              <p><strong>In the last half of the 19th century people of the working class in
                  
                  Europe were beginning to show interest in the ideas of socialism and
                  
                  syndicalism.  Some
                  
                  members of the intelligentsia, particularly the Catholic intelligentsia,
                  
                  decided to formulate an alternative to socialism which would emphasize
                  
                  social justice without the radical solution of the abolition of private
                  
                  property.  The result was called <em>Corporatism</em>.  The name had nothing
                  
                  to do with the notion of a business <em>corporation</em> except that both words are
                  
                  derived from the Latin word for body, <em>corpus</em>. </strong></p>
              <p><strong>The basic idea of corporatism is that the society and economy of a country should
                  
                  be organized into major interest groups (sometimes called <em>corporations</em>)
                  
                  and representatives of those
                  
                  interest groups settle any problems through negotiation and joint agreement.
                  
                  In contrast to a market economy which operates through competition a
                  
                  corporate economic works through collective bargaining.  The American
                  
                  president Lyndon Johnson had a favorite phrase that reflected the spirit
                  
                  of corporatism.  He would gather the parties to some dispute and say, "Let us
                  
                  reason together." </strong></p>
              <p><strong>Under corporatism the labor force and management in an industry belong to
                  
                  an industrial organization.  The representatives of labor and management
                  
                  settle wage issues through collective negotiation.  While this was the theory
                  
                  in practice the corporatist states were largely ruled according to the
                  
                  dictates of the supreme leader. </strong></p>
              <p><strong>One early and important theorist of corporatism was Adam Müller, an
                  
                  advisor to Prince Metternich in what is now eastern Germany and Austria.
                  
                  Müller propounded his views as an antidote to the twin dangers of
                  
                  the egalitarianism of the French Revolution and the <em>laissez faire</em> economics of Adam Smith.  In Germany and elsewhere there was a distinct
                  
                  aversion among rulers to allow markets to function without direction or
                  
                  control by the state.  The general culture heritage of Europe from the
                  
                  medieval era was opposed to individual self-interest and the free operation
                  
                  of markets.  Markets and private property were acceptable only as long as
                  
                  social regulation took precedence over such sinfull motivations as greed. </strong></p>
              <p><strong>Coupled with the anti-market sentiments of the medieval culture there was
                  
                  the notion that the rulers of the state had a vital role in promoting
                  
                  <em>social justice</em>.  Thus corporatism was formulated as a system that
                  
                  emphasized the postive role of the state in guaranteeing social justice and
                  
                  suppressing the moral and social chaos of the population pursuing their
                  
                  own individual self-interests.  And above all else, as a political economic
                  
                  philosophy corporatism was flexible.  It could tolerate private enterprise
                  
                  within limits and justify major projects of the state. Corporatism has
                  
                  sometimes been labeled as a <em>Third Way</em> or a <em>mixed economy</em>, a synthesis of capitalism and
                  
                  socialism, but it is in fact a separate, distinctive political economic
                  
                  system. </strong></p>
              <p><strong>Although rulers have probably operated according to the principles of
                  
                  corporatism from time immemorial it was only in the early twentieth
                  
                  century that regimes began to identify themselves as corporatist.  The table
                  
                  below gives some of those explicitly corporatist regimes. </strong></p>

              <p><strong>In the above table several of the regimes were brutal, totalitarian
                  
                  dictatorships, usually labeled <em>fascist</em>, but not all the regimes
                  
                  that had a corporatist foundation were fascist.  In particular, the
                  
                  Roosevelt New Deal despite its many faults could not be described as
                  
                  fascist.  But definitely the New Deal was corporatist.  The architect for
                  
                  the initial New Deal program was General Hugh Johnson.  Johnson had been
                  
                  the administrator of the military mobilization program for the U.S. under
                  
                  Woodrow Wilson during World War I.  It was felt that he did a good job of
                  
                  managing the economy during that period and that is why he was given major
                  
                  responsibility for formulating an economic program to deal with the
                  
                  severe problems of the Depression.  But between the end of World War I
                  
                  and 1933 Hugh Johnson had become an admirer of Mussolini's National
                  
                  Corporatist system in Italy and he drew upon the Italian experience in
                  
                  formulating the New Deal.  It should be noted that many elements of the
                  
                  early New Deal were later declared unconstitutional and abandoned, but
                  
                  some elements such as the National Labor Relations Act which promoted
                  
                  unionization of the American labor force are still in effect.  One part of
                  
                  the New Deal was the development of the Tennessee River Valley under the
                  
                  public corporation called the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA).  Some of
                  
                  the New Dealer saw TVA as more than a public power enterprise.  They hoped
                  
                  to make TVA a model for the creation of regional political units which would
                  
                  replace state governments.  Their goal was not realized.  The model for
                  
                  TVA was the river development schemes carried out in Spain in the 1920's
                  
                  under the government of Miguel Primo de Rivera.  Jose Antonio Primo
                  
                  de Rivera, the son of Miguel Primo de Rivera, was the founder of
                  
                  Franco's National Syndicalism. </strong></p>
              <p><strong>Corporatist regime typically promote large governmental projects such as
                  
                  TVA on the basis that they are too large to be funded by private enterprise.
                  
                  In Brazil the Vargas regime created many public enterprises such as in
                  
                  iron and steel production which it felt were needed but private enterprise
                  
                  declined to create.  It also created an organized labor movement that
                  
                  came to control those public enterprises and turned them into overstaffed,
                  
                  inefficient drains on the public budget. </strong></p>
              <p><strong>Although the above locates the origin of corporatism in 19th century
                  
                  France it roots can be traced much further back in time.  Sylvia Ann
                  
                  Hewlett in her book, <em>The Cruel Dilemmas of Development: Twentieth
                  
                  Century Brazil</em>, says, </strong></p>
              <blockquote> <strong>Corporatism is based on a body of ideas that can be traced through Aristotle,
                  
                  Roman law, medieval social and legal structures, and into contemporary
                  
                  Catholic social philosophy.  These ideas are based on the premise that
                  
                  man's nature can only be fulfilled within a political community.
                  
                  <br>..........<br> The central core of the corporatist vision is thus not the individual but
                  
                  the political community whose perfection allows the individual members
                  
                  to fulfill themselves and find happiness.
                  
                  <br> ...............<br> The state in the corporatist tradition is thus clearly interventionist and powerful. </strong></blockquote>
              <p><strong>Corporatism is collectivist; it is a different version of collectivism than socialism but
                  it is definitely collectivist.  It places some importance on the fact that private 
                  property is not nationalized, but the control through regulation is just as real.  It is
                  <em>de facto</em> nationalization without being <em>de jure</em> nationalization. </strong></p>
              <p><strong>Although <em>Corporatism</em> is not a familiar concept to the general public, most of the
                  economies of the world are corporatist in nature.  The categories of socialist
                  and pure market economy are virtually empty.  There are only corporatist
                  economies of various flavors. </strong></p>
              <p><strong>These flavors of corporatism include the social democratic regimes of Europe and the
                  Americas, but also  the East Asian and Islamic fundamentalist regimes such as Taiwan, Singapore
                  and Iran. The Islamic socialist states such as Syria, Libya and  Algeria are more corporatist

                  such as Russia and China are now clearly corporatist in economic philosphy although not 
                  in name. </strong></p>

              <p>Thank you zetreyier. But I would like to know how corporatism is practiced in actuality in Singapore. How is the corporatist model applied in the political 'layout' of Singapore?

              <p>Singapore politics is easy. One party PAP controls everything. The party is controlled by Lee family.</p>
              <p>The people have no influence whatsoever on anything.</p>

              <p>Singapore parliament is basically for show.</p>
              <p>All the MPs are chosen and controlled by the inner clique CEC of PAP.</p>

              <p>I don't think there is corporatism in Singapore according to below definition:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>The basic idea of corporatism is that the society and
                                              economy of a country should be<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> organized into <span style="color: #0000ff;">major interest groups</span></strong></span> (sometimes called <em>corporations</em>) and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>representatives of
                                              those interest groups <span style="color: #0000ff;">settle any problems through negotiation and
                                              joint agreement.</span></strong></span></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>According to some scholars, there had never been any form of state organised under the concept of corporatism in 20th century, because in theory, workers and owners, managers of capital are supposed to "work" things out in a fair way, negotiate terms among themselves. Everybody happy.</p>
              <p>In practice, it's always the state gang up with business to crush the workers.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Your concept of "corporatism" seems to be a state dominated by interests of business corporations. That's a different story already. That's a typical oligarchy you find in latin america.</p>
