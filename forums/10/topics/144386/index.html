That's is time when Malaysia petrol price is cost around RM1.20 per liters.<br><br>If you check the above table, you will notice that taxes represent a huge sum of the US petrol price, say we minus US 0.20 from the selling price, the cost at petrol station will be US$1.59(RM6.04) per gallon or RM1.60 per liters. Minus the 31% tax, the cost of the petrol should be around RM1.10 per literes.<br><br>So come here come the story of "Petrol subsidiaries". Although the media keep feeding us with data from ASEAN country, no single media in Malaysia are able to give us the data as what DoE of US provide.<br><br>Looking at the US DoE data, it is obvious that the petrol price of Thailand, Philipine and Indonesia is nothing but result of tax levy on the petrol.<br><br>To date, no ASEAN country government releasing single piece of data about the REAL PETROL COST. For the case of indonesia, the hikes is pretty obvious : the petrol hikes is a cumulative result of international crude oil hikes and HUGE GOVERNMENT levy.<br><br>In short, ASEAN country(except Brunei that did not impose petrol tax, while Singapore imposing less car policy) is currently riding on the international oil price to exploit the people. It is clear that crude oil price increase did TOO little to the current petrol price increase. Is this the same to Malaysia "petrol subdisidiaries". I don't know, since no ASEAN government is releasing the information.<br><br>Please leave you comment if you think my theory is flaw.<br><br><a href="http://www.caffeinbar.com/b2evol/" rel="nofollow">http://www.caffeinbar.com/b2evol/</a><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I do agree with Atobe on this point. I for one have been wondering for the longest time why our petrol prices are so high, so we basically "manufacture" them here in Singapore. We are consuming petrol refined right over at our offshore island!!<br><br>I believe taxes are the main cost of petrol here. It is in line with the garmen's policy of allowing one to own a car, but discourage one from driving it.<br><br>Petrol prices in Singapore have always been sticky downwards, meaning, increases are often and done easily while decreases are rarely seen!! It is sad to see that the petrol discounts percentage offered actually works like the variable component of salary!! It allows petrol companies to adjust the price without getting into too much "problems" with the consumers.<br><br>I am beginning to feel the heat now, very soon I will be going for the 50% discount offered across the causeway!!</div>

I for one have been wondering for the longest time why our petrol prices are so high, so we basically "manufacture" them here in Singapore. We are consuming petrol refined right over at our offshore island!!<br><br>I believe taxes are the main cost of petrol here. It is in line with the garmen's policy of <span style="color: red;">allowing one to own a car, but discourage one from driving it</span>.<br><br>Petrol prices in Singapore have always been sticky downwards, meaning, increases are often and done easily while decreases are rarely seen!! It is sad to see that the petrol discounts percentage offered actually works like the variable component of salary!! It allows petrol companies to adjust the price without getting into too much "problems" with the consumers.<br><br>I am beginning to feel the heat now, very soon I will be going for the 50% discount offered across the causeway!! </div></blockquote>Actually the Singapore Government would prefer that you continuously drive your car around more often, as they can collect more revenue from the petrol that is burnt, also from the ERP, the carparks with the Cashcard payment - that moves your funds electronically with immediate effects (from your account directly into an interim account) and also as well as from the GST when you pay your Service Bills.<br><br>The Singapore Government is ever so helpful to make the roads unclogged for us by limiting the number of cars allowed to be sold per month with the C.O.E system.<br><br>It will then build open highways, and secondary roads, that entice you to rev up, but the Government imposed ridiculours speed limits that end up straining your car engine, forcing it to consume even more petrol.<br><br>If you cannot resist to go beyond the speed limits, they have invested in small hand-held laser cameras that can be used by one person - hiding under or on the overhead Pedestrian Bridge - to snap you as you zip (not zoom) along the open roads. These small laser cameras will need to be paid for.<br><br>So you see, there is money to be made by the Government if you drive more often in Singapore, why should they restrict you with a hefty high petrol tax ?<br><br></div>

There is never a 'no strings attached' discount/rebate from the gahmen.<br><br>Since the LTA's insistence on ERP being the only idea to solving the massive congestion on the CTE, it is left to us to interpret their actions as one of implementing a monetary cost onto consumers as a solution.<br><br>I recently paid a hefty 1.6++ for SPC, up from 1.54 per litre = almost a full 1 buck more than usual. And that was for octane 95. We certainly should be asking the questions as to who what where when and why.</div>
