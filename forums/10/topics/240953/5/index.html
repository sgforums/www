            <div class='col-md body'>I REFER to Ms Laura Thornton-Olivry's letter about maids being deprived of food (ST, March 30).<br><br>My son recently completed a study on slavery for his schoolwork. He felt that slavery exists in Singapore today for some of the maids.<br><br>Certainly there are employers who treat their maids as their 'property'. Some maids are entirely under the domination of their employers. Just read all the stories about maids being abused, denied food or risking their lives hanging clothes to dry.<br><br>Why can't we learn to treat each other with respect, regardless of social status? Why can't we protect those who are unable to defend themselves?<br><br>Remember that a maid is someone's daughter. She is separated from her loved ones. Many of them have never lived away from home or their country before.<br><br>I started to wonder how I would feel if my daughter was in the same situation. Being so far away from her I would feel powerless to help her. My little girl would be at the mercy of complete strangers. All I could do then would be to pray that:<br><br># She does a good job every day to please her employer.<br><br># She gets enough rest every night.<br><br># She does not have to worry about food and drink.<br><br># She gets some time off every week.<br><br># She will be treated by a doctor when she is ill.<br><br># She is not abused physically or mentally.<br><br># Her safety is not at risk.<br><br># She will return a better person.<br><br># Her employer's family will care for her with kindness and compassion.<br><br>I would pray that I will get a letter like this from her:<br><br>'Mum and Dad, the family that I work for treats me very well. The job is demanding but I don't mind. I want to do my best for them. You don't have to worry about me because I feel safe and I'm happy.'<br><br>Let us make sure that every parent of our maids gets a letter like this.<br><br>Too Teh Hsin<br><br>Straits Times, 3 Apr</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Even one case of maid abuse is one case too many</strong><br><br>I FEEL sick every time I read about a case of maid abuse here and I applaud The Straits Times for highlighting these cases and the plight of maids.<br><br>I further applaud the courts for the tough stance they take regarding maid abuse cases.<br><br>These people have sacrificed so much to come here to earn a small amount of money to help take care of their families back home, yet many of them are treated so badly.<br><br>Maids are human beings like the rest of us, yet some employers treat their pets better than they treat their maids.<br><br>Sure, the abusers are a small minority of employers but, on the other hand, the cases that go before the courts are likely just the tip of the iceberg - many more abuse cases must be occurring, with maids suffering in silence, not knowing what to do.<br><br>In our modern society how can anyone treat someone else inhumanely? Abuse is abuse, whether it is physical, verbal, psychological or not allowing the maid to eat nutritiously.<br><br>There can be no excuse for such abuse, yet many of the accused claim that they are 'depressed', as if this gives them the right to be abusive. Not only are some employers abusive, but we have also probably all witnessed children physically or verbally abusing their maid too.<br><br>Clearly, some people are not fit to employ a maid and should not be allowed to do so.<br><br>While employers have the ability to research into the background of their prospective maid it would appear sensible that some form of checking also be carried out in regard to the employer; to confirm whether the employer and his/her family are fit to employ and take care of a maid in a humane and caring manner.<br><br>As well as jail terms and financial penalties, employers convicted of maid abuse should receive psychological counselling and also be banned from ever hiring a maid again.<br><br>This may sound tough but employers must realise that hiring a maid entails a great deal of responsibility and if they are not capable of being responsible and humane towards their maid then they should not be allowed the privilege of hiring a maid.<br><br>I reiterate that I know that maid abuse here occurs in only a small minority of cases but in today's civilised society even one case is one case too many.<br><br>Bruce William Swales<br><br>Apr 3 Straits Times</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Put new employers of maids on a one-month probation</strong><br>YET another case of hell-treatment of a maid. For every maid that has come forward to tell her sob story, how many are living in inhumane conditions in their respective 'cells'?<br><br>It is sickening to note that many people in this civilised First World country of ours are treating another human being like dirt.<br><br>Little wonder as anybody with $500 to spare each month (the maid gets half of it) can become an employer - a master to be exact. Suddenly, many people can become an emperor or empress, not unlike what they see in those drama serials on TV.<br><br>They feel great that somebody is calling them Sir or Madam; and at a snap of the finger, this person will come running to them.<br><br>They can say what they want about this lowly being in front of them, as she has no right of reply. The 'emperor' and 'empress' only want to hear 'Yes Sir' or 'Yes Madam'.<br><br>Little brats, if any, in the 'palace' will no doubt feel like princes and princesses. Their 'high class' parents confirm their status and condone their actions towards this lesser mortal residing in their house.<br><br>The Ministry of Manpower's reply to complaints is as usual, the rules and regulations governing the hiring of maids. How many maids would dare to call and complain against their employer? Those who do must be in extreme distress, perhaps on the verge of death.<br><br>I propose MOM consider the following:<br><br>1. Interview all potential employers before allowing them to hire a maid.<br><br>Among others, they are to declare the jobs for the maid, daily meals and the place of sleep. A visit to the house may be necessary.<br><br>2.A probation period of one month, after which both employer and maid are interviewed. Appropriate actions should be taken before things get worse.<br><br>3.A review of the current security deposit and insurance schemes.<br><br>4. A review of the modus operandi of maid agencies. Making a person work six to nine months without any pay is inhuman. No civilised nation should allow it.<br><br>5.A review of the current penalty against employers who inflict physical harm to their maids.<br><br>6. Give incentives to employers who treat their maids well - such as reducing the levy.<br><br>The above will have no tangible benefits for MOM. In fact a budget has to be set aside. But we need to show the world that besides churning profits, we do have a heart for those who need help.<br><br>While we deliberate and pontificate, we cannot deny the fact that there are many helpless souls still suffering in silence.<br><br>Chan Wai Piew Daniel<br><br>Straits Times Apr 3</div>

Why increase their rights and benefits when what really matters<br><br>Our pragmatic approach has brought SingaporeÂ’s domestic worker industry from the third world to the first over the past 40 years. <span style="color: red;">It is the myopic, obsessive idealism of living fossils that threaten our continued success against the wishes and interests of the majority of Singaporeans who hire domestic workers who see no need for a raise in the standards.</span><br><br>Yawn...after 40 years of free democratic elections, the working conditions for maids have not made much progress, much less improved. After 40 years of elections, we still have increasing numbers of cases of going for the bottom line when it comes to treating our domestic workers....that's what Singaporeans really think.</div></blockquote>Please, you are morally bankrupt to be getting hot under the collar here.<br><br>Why should one be surprised if the citizens have learned several lessons on how to treat those more vulnerable then you from the powers that are?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Given his track record in this forum, it is doubtful OM actually feels any real compassion for the plight of local Domestic Workers, just that it happened to be convenient for him to capitalize on their cause to further his own needs, whatever they may be (which I suspect has something to do with being a self appointedlap/sheepdog of sorts on some misguided mission to rein in the Â“strayÂ” sheep of Singapore).<br><br>He is certainly not fit to may any appeal to the morality of the situation, given the positions he had quite clearly expressed in other posts.<br><br>The moment they do not serve his needs, there is little doubt he will callously cast them aside, or perhaps even turn on them.<br><br>So the bottom line is really this: Given your obvious dishonesty, regardless of how many posts you make and statistics you may attempt to postÂ… nobody is going to give what you post any serious consideration.<br></div>
