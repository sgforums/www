            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Actually having a maid can be quite handful.  I am relating from my personal experience.  I gave my first maid plenty of freedom because she had proven herself to be very responsible and most important, my daughter like her a lot.  She had worked with us for a good 4 yrs.<br><br>When me and my wife go to work, we would bring her to my mom-in-law's place, and stay with her maid, so that they can accompany each other.  One day, my mom-in-law called home to give some instructions for dinner and nobody picked up the phone, even after 10 mins of calling.  We rushed home from work and saw her maid chatting up with an Indian man at the void deck and my maid missing.  Worst thing is, my 2yrs old daughter is at home alone sleeping.  We calculated, its a good 45 mins that they leave my daughter alone at home.<br><br>After she came back, she said she went jogging at the park.  Furious at this irresponsible behaviour and ridiculous excuse, we send her back to the agency.  And that is when all the truth start to surface.  Both of them start hurling accusation at each other, about each other's affairs with their boyfriend and meeting them at my mom-in-law's house.  Since then, we dismissed both of them and send my daughter to full day child care.<br><br>When we have this maid, we want to give her monthly day off even when she is not entitled to (cos she's from Indonesia) but she refused and requested for more money instead.<br><br>And 1 year later, we employed another maid to help my wife out with housework, because i have to attend a long course in US.

My wife received a letter from Maybank, asking for payment.  She appealed to MOM but was rejected, despite the fact that i am in US and she's alone and need to work.

Migrant domestic workers earn half the wages of Singaporean workers in similar occupations, such as cleaners or gardeners. Unpaid wages is a growing complaint.<br><br>Â“Many domestic workers labor without pay for months to settle debts to employment agencies, work long hours seven days a week, or are confined to their workplace,Â” said Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch. Â“SingaporeÂ’s refusal to extend ordinary labor protections to domestic workers is leaving them open to abuse.Â”<br><br>The 124-page report, Â“Maid to Order: Ending Abuses against Migrant Domestic Workers in Singapore,Â” is based on more than one hundred in-depth interviews with domestic workers, government officials, and employment agents. It details a range of abuses endured by domestic workers in Singapore and the response of the Singaporean government.<br><br>Families in Singapore employ approximately 150,000 women, primarily from Indonesia, the Philippines, and Sri Lanka, as domestic workers. Human Rights Watch said the Singaporean government has instituted some encouraging reforms in the past two years. These include creating mandatory orientation programs for employers and domestic workers, prosecuting cases of unpaid wages and physical abuse, and introducing an accreditation program for employment agencies.<br><br>But key labor conditions, such as wages, hours of work, and salary deductions are left to employers and agencies, while domestic workers have little or no bargaining power. Human Rights Watch said that authorities have excluded domestic workers from the country's main labor laws.

            <div class='col-md body'>Is it enforced labour or modern form of slavery? Not protect by labour law domestic workers suffer from long hours, no pay for months, no day offs, locked indoor, no phone calls, no sexual activities, and now the brutal beatings! Why?<br><br>......The wages seem exploitative in a country with one of the most affluent societies in Asia and having a per capita monthly income exceeding 2,000 dollars. And for round-the-clock work.<br><br>''Even machines need rest,'' says Filipino domestic worker Ellen Elancanal, who has been here for eight years. ''We work so many hours. We must have a day a week, whichever way we want to spend it''. She gets to spend her Sundays with a church choir, or helping fellow workers in trouble.<br><br>''Not giving people time off can make people disgruntled and stressed,'' said Helen Tan, spokeswoman for the Association of Employment Agencies, Singapore.<br><br>But many employers are wary of 'social problems' and choose to keep their maids at home.<br><br>Employers in Singapore risk forfeiting a 3,000 dollar-security bond if the maid goes missing--or if they fail to repatriate her at the end of the contract or in the event of pregnancy.<br><br>''They (domestic helpers) know that if they do that (get pregnant), they stand to lose everything. It's not in their interest to jeopardise the money they send home to their families,'' said Braema Mathi, president of Transient Workers Count Too, an agency defending the human rights of workers here.<br><br>''If employers are worried about pregnancy, then workers should have sex education. We can't control human behaviour to that extent and say that we are protecting her by not giving her a day off''.<br><br>On the ground though, many employers are sceptical about days off. ''They have boyfriends and all that!'' says Mary Lee, 58, a Singaporean homemaker who has employed several domestic workers over the last two decades.<br><br>''Some even go to Geylang (Singapore's red-light district) and earn extra cash, you know? We can't control the maids, so it's best that when we employ the maid, we tell the agent we don't want to give days off,'' Lee said.<br><br>Fear of 'social problems' causes employers to deny maids a day off and the stress of working without a break results in pent-up frustrations that create rather than solve a delicate problems which can be tackled on with responsibility and understanding.<br><br>''The bold maids are often those who have worked here for some time. Their employers trust them and some abuse their privileges,'' said Alice Cheah, owner of the Singapore agency, 'Caregivers Centre', stressing that 'havoc maids' are in the minority.<br><br>''Maids should be given days off. It'd be unhealthy psychologically if the maids are cooped up in the house every day. If the maids treasure their jobs, they will behave well,'' Cheah said.<br><br>http://www.thinkcentre.org/article.cfm?ArticleID=2661</div>

It's not in their interest to jeopardise the money they send home to their families,'' said Braema Mathi, president of Transient Workers Count Too, an agency defending the human rights of workers here.<br><br>''If employers are worried about pregnancy, then workers should have sex education. We can't control human behaviour to that extent and say that we are protecting her by not giving her a day off''.<br><br>On the ground though, many employers are sceptical about days off. ''They have boyfriends and all that!'' says Mary Lee, 58, a Singaporean homemaker who has employed several domestic workers over the last two decades.<br><br>''Some even go to Geylang (Singapore's red-light district) and earn extra cash, you know? We can't control the maids, so it's best that when we employ the maid, we tell the agent we don't want to give days off,'' Lee said.<br><br>Fear of 'social problems' causes employers to deny maids a day off and the stress of working without a break results in pent-up frustrations that create rather than solve a delicate problems which can be tackled on with responsibility and understanding.<br><br>''The bold maids are often those who have worked here for some time. Their employers trust them and some abuse their privileges,'' said Alice Cheah, owner of the Singapore agency, 'Caregivers Centre', stressing that 'havoc maids' are in the minority.<br><br>''Maids should be given days off. It'd be unhealthy psychologically if the maids are cooped up in the house every day.

If the foreign worker somehow escapes, the bond is confiscated too!  If the foreign worker hurts himself or the employer hurts him/her in the process of this "escort", the local laws of "causing hurt" or "unlawful restraint" may be applicable to the employer as seen in the eyes of the police.

Migrant domestic workers earn half the wages of Singaporean workers in similar occupations, such as cleaners or gardeners. Unpaid wages is a growing complaint.<br><br>Â“Many domestic workers labor without pay for months to settle debts to employment agencies, work long hours seven days a week, or are confined to their workplace,Â” said Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch. Â“SingaporeÂ’s refusal to extend ordinary labor protections to domestic workers is leaving them open to abuse.Â”<br><br>The 124-page report, Â“Maid to Order: Ending Abuses against Migrant Domestic Workers in Singapore,Â” is based on more than one hundred in-depth interviews with domestic workers, government officials, and employment agents. It details a range of abuses endured by domestic workers in Singapore and the response of the Singaporean government. ...<br><br>Read more of the Human Rights Watch report:<br>http://hrw.org/english/docs/2005/12/07/singap12125.htm<br></div>
