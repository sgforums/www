            <div class='col-md body'>Once again in the Straits Times we read about a maid who fell to her death trying to climb back to her flat after a rendez-vous with her lover and finding that her employer had locked the flat. Another article wrote about a man who spent 5 hours on the window ledge when his lover's employer came home earlier than expected.<br><br>These reports highlight a prevalent abuse of human rights in Singapore. We treat our maids as juveniles, preventing adults from the rights of association and movement. The common excuse is the maid levy that can be confiscated if the maid becomes pregnant.<br><br>I think that policy must change. Notwithstanding the possible social problems created by pregnant maids, we should not dictate who our employees should meet and indeed, whether and with whom they have sex with. Instead, there should be greater access to contraception and abortion for unwanted pregnancies. Employers should be charged for any additional costs this incur. Legislation can prevent children born to maids in Singapore from having an automatic claim to citizenship. There are better ways to deal with this problem than to imprison your maids in your homes.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think the country were maids come from also affect their working conditions. I think the Phillipines govt insist that their maids get paid a higher salary (than, lets say, Indonesian maids) and a day off every month. The Indonesia govt stipulates that their maid get a lower salary and the monthly day off is not compulsory. So, sadly, most of our maids are Indonesian, and they get low wages and no days off.<br><br>I feel that for any S'porean to employ someone else to work for them and NOT give them a day off EVER, it amounts to serious abuse of workers' rights. Something must change, if we see ourselves as compassionate S'poreans.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Singaporean employers will insist on live-in maids but there should be regulations on the accommodation conditions. Maids should be entitled to a room that has a window for ventilation (international environmental health standards require the window to be at least 10% of the floor area), a bed, a cupboard for her belongings and a small table/chair. They should be entitled to a day off each week.<br><br>Legislation should be changed as well. Employers who stop their maids from going out of the house should be prosecuted for illegal imprisonment. If they are not happy with the performance of their maids, they can dismiss her. Maids should be given at least an hour off each day between 7am and 10pm, so they can go out, make phone calls from a public phone or meet their boyfriends if they so wish. If domestic maids get pregnant, they should be deported as the law provides for. However, the employer cannot be held responsible for that and it is wrong to confiscate the deposit for this reason.</div>

I wonder who trusts their maid the first day they arrive. Trust is something that has to be built up and until that level of trust is attained, then I am afraid that it has to stay the way it is. Many people do like to keep their security deposit safe, thank you very much.<br><br>Also, unfortunately, Singaporeans do not want to compete being a domestic helper. I think we all know that.

I think I am in the minority on this issue. Most Singaporeans will reject more regulations to protect the welfare of domestic maids. And that is also why the government has been reluctant to be more proactive in this respect. There isn't ground support...Singaporeans want their cheap maids that they can bully.<br><br>However, we have to understand the difficulties faced by employers as well. We cannot blame employers and confiscate their deposit just because their maid gets pregnant. That is a ridiculous policy. I bet the Minister himself cannot guarantee that his teenage daughter won't get pregnant before marriage. So how can employers be responsible if their adult employee gets pregnant? That policy is part of the reason why kiasu Singaporeans treat their maids like juvenile delinquents.<br><br>I say have the deposit of $5000 but pregnancy cannot be a reason to confiscate that deposit. Rather, if the employer fails to keep his part of the contract, mistreats the maid or limits her freedom of movement or association; then that deposit can be confiscated and paid out as damages to the maid.<br></div>

I don't think she is particularly lucky if she has to leave her family behind to find work so far from home. But I think we try to treat her decently. She has her own room with a big window, an electric fan, a bed, a wardrobe, shelves for books, a table and chair. She gets a day off a week but sometimes she does not want to go out; in which case, we pay her an extra day's salary.<br><br>The only other thing we did for her which may be more than what's expected of an employer is that we gave her $30 pocket money per month for the first few months. Many Singaporeans may not realize that for the first 3-6 months, your maid's salary does not go to her. It goes to the agent who paid for her airfare and other administrative costs. We feel that it would be good for her to have some pocket money over the first few months as she gets settled down in a foreign land.<br><br>Singaporeans will work as domestic help if the pay is good. With full-time foreign maids being so cheap, who would hire Singaporeans? If it were up to me, I would ban all live-in foreign maids. Instead of that, agencies bring in foreign maids, provide domitories to house them and hire them out to provide domestic service on an hourly charge basis. But Singaporeans will rise up in protest: so the government will never adopt that policy.</div>
