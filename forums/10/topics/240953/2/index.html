I don't think she is particularly lucky if she has to leave her family behind to find work so far from home. But I think we try to treat her decently. She has her own room with a big window, an electric fan, a bed, a wardrobe, shelves for books, a table and chair. She gets a day off a week but sometimes she does not want to go out; in which case, we pay her an extra day's salary.<br><br>The only other thing we did for her which may be more than what's expected of an employer is that we gave her $30 pocket money per month for the first few months. Many Singaporeans may not realize that for the first 3-6 months, your maid's salary does not go to her. It goes to the agent who paid for her airfare and other administrative costs. We feel that it would be good for her to have some pocket money over the first few months as she gets settled down in a foreign land.<br><br>Singaporeans will work as domestic help if the pay is good. With full-time foreign maids being so cheap, who would hire Singaporeans? If it were up to me, I would ban all live-in foreign maids. Instead of that, agencies bring in foreign maids, provide domitories to house them and hire them out to provide domestic service on an hourly charge basis. But Singaporeans will rise up in protest: so the government will never adopt that policy.</div></blockquote>I'm afraid not many Singaporeans treat their maid like what you do.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> This is the very least that they deserve.</div>

Cruel expatriate influenced by the Singlish speaking Singaporeans.<br><br>It will be brilliant reading and interpretation on your part to conclude that I am also protecting the employer who abused the maid by returning from church earlier than their usual Sunday practice, in the cruel process had interupted the maid's affair with her lover, causing them to panic, and resulting in the maid's lover being forced to hide - by climbing out of the high rise apartment, and to perch on the window ledge for over five hours before being discovered by the neighbor.<br><br>Yes, you are right that the Singaporean church goer was cruel to the maid for coming home earlier than usual, and at the end of it all he was cruel enough to let the maid's lover off with a mere police warning.<br><br>Yes, perhaps you could be right for concluding that Singaporeans are cruel to the maids that caused them to even lie that their parents have died, so as to be able to gain sympathetic leave home.<br><br>Yes, you could be right that Singaporeans are abusive to these maid for not trusting them enough to let them return home after 3 months employment.<br><br>Could it be that your PhD title makes you a <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Prima Donna</strong></span>, and allow you to dictate terms to your UK Employer to release you from your contract, and allow you to return to Singapore for a short holiday after 3 months of being abused by your UK Employers ?<br><br>Singaporeans could take a leaf out of your brilliance in handling your UK Employers, and do the same to our Singaporean employers - half of whom are probably working for the Singapore Inc.<br><br>We could certainly learn something from your bargaining skill in leveraging the Human Rights consideration to our own Singapore Inc employers.</span><br><blockquote><strong><br>Maids who take advantage of their employers? What do you call working 18 hours a day, seven days a week without annual leave or weekend off? What do you call restriction of movement and the freedom to associate with whom she wishes? </strong></blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">What would you call the conditions for Singaporeans who have to work 2 jobs in 24 hours, just to put some food on the table, pay the utilities, give their children an education, employ a maid to look after the children and the old folks, while the Singaporean slave through the 2 jobs ?<br><br>How many Singaporean - on a new job are put on probation - will be allowed to roam about freely, use the phone lines to chat with their friends, indulge in idle talk with new colleagues, and have the run of the place to make themselves comfortably at home ?<br><br>How many factory workers are allowed to roam freely on the production line and associate themselves freely in conversation with anyone they like ?<br><br>How many work places will not insist on proper decorum and proprietary restrictions in accessing or use of restricted materials and places, and maintain confidentiality even outsife of the work place ?<br><br>Are Singaporeans the only employers imposing such rules of employment on these foreign maids ?<br><br>Or are these not the accepted rules expected from those employed as servants, butlers and maids across the entire globe - in which all of them are expected to maintain the expected minimum standard of service and keep the family affairs private ?<br><br>Surely, the personal contacts whom the butlers or maids associate with, outside of the working hours, will also be a concern to the employers, simply for the sake of security to the employer and the family ? </span><br><blockquote><strong><br>Unfortunately, as I have said, the majority of Singaporeans are abusive employers like Atobe has shown himself.

            <div class='col-md body'>There are always two sides of the story<br><br>On one side , you have maids misbehaving and on the other , employers who are just plain nasty and use the maid levy as an excuse .<br><br>My aunt had a nasty maid who had to be escorted by the police and the maid agency to the airport . She had threatened to kill my cousins if she was sent back. Reason for sending her back was because she stole things from the house and pawned it - the receipts were found by my cousin who was asking mommy what they were because they were in jie jie's room.<br><br>My aunt was never nasty to the maid because she believed in treating people well. Her previous maids used to cry when their contract was completed because they liked working for her - she is a reasonable boss. Everything the children say to the maid has to start with a please and a thank you. She get brought out on outings and even to expensive restaurants for Chinese New Year Reunion where she ate a good share of what the family eats.<br><br>So I would hesistate to pass judgements on all employers and all maids .
