Â“SingaporeÂ’s refusal to extend ordinary labor protections to domestic workers is leaving them open to abuse.Â”<br><br>The 124-page report, Â“Maid to Order: Ending Abuses against Migrant Domestic Workers in Singapore,Â” is based on more than one hundred in-depth interviews with domestic workers, government officials, and employment agents. It details a range of abuses endured by domestic workers in Singapore and the response of the Singaporean government. ...<br><br>Read more of the Human Rights Watch report:<br>http://hrw.org/english/docs/2005/12/07/singap12125.htm<br></div></blockquote><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by oxford mushroom:</div><div class="quote_body">Singapore accused of maid neglect<br><br>Female migrant workers in Singapore face what amounts to forced labour due to a lack of legal protection, US-based rights campaigners say.<br>Human Rights Watch (HRW) said domestic workers were overworked and frequently denied food, pay and social contact, as well as suffering physical abuse.<br><br>http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/4502046.stm</div></blockquote><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by oxford mushroom:</div><div class="quote_body">Here's another report from the International Herald Tribune:<br><br>"...Stories of exploitation and abuse of migrant workers, especially women, in the richer countries of East Asia are so common as to barely elicit comment.

At the very least, their wages should increase at the same rate as Singapore's annual inflation rate.

Surely, we don't want the reputation of being a First World nation that is accused of paying our domestic helpers poorly.<br><br>I'm not sure if Singapore has a minimum wage, but even if it did not, surely common sense dictates that 73 cents a day is markedly insufficient.<br><br>Singaporeans complain about the cost of living in Singapore - has anyone considered what it must be like for these domestic helpers who probably haven't seen a pay rise in years? At the very least, their wages should increase at the same rate as Singapore's annual inflation rate. As we look forward to January each year to learn of our pay rises, why can't we do the same for our domestic helpers?<br><br>We need to stem the mentality that domestic helpers belong to a separate breed or class of people.<br><br>At the end of the day, we're all part of the same human race and should treat everyone with respect.<br><br>I live on my own in London and I maintain my own home on top of working a full-time job and I know how difficult it is to clean, cook, wash and iron.<br><br>Domestic helpers are there to provide a more comfortable life for us.

            <div class='col-md body'>The media is taking notice of such maid abuse:<br><br>A SLICE of bread and a bowl of porridge, 250 calories.<br><br>This is what some maids get a day.<br><br>Two hundred calories is hardly enough, they actually need 10 times that amount (2,100 calories).<br><br>Nutritionist Cyndy Au was shocked to hear of such a diet and said: 'Any lay man can tell that someone having these meals would be grossly undernourished.'<br><br>Checks with Embassies, and maid welfare agencies showed that insufficient food has surfaced as a common complaint among maids here. And nutritionists say that with the high levels of activity and low intake, maids who are starved will eventually waste away.<br><br>The issue of insufficient food arose in a letter to The Straits Times' forum page on Friday, when Ms Laura Thornton-Olivry, a research director in her 30s said her neighbour's maid has been begging for food through the back window.<br><br>Also, in a case before the courts, an Indonesian maid whose employer has been accused of abusing her told of being starved. In testimony last Thursday, she told the court that 'ma'am never gave me food and I was hungry'.<br><br>These are not new occurrences.<br><br>In 2002, a maid, given just two packets of instant noodles over lunch and dinner, had to steal apple juice and porridge from the children. She was eventually beaten to death.<br><br>Looking at examples of the spartan meals that some maids have, Ms Au told The Sunday Times it's obvious that their 'energy intake is much lower than the energy required, especially considering the nature of her work'.<br><br>According to the Health Promotion Board's website, a woman aged between 18 and 30, who weighs about 54kg, would need 2,100 calories a day if she engages in medium levels of activity.<br><br>However, a daily intake of water, a slice of bread, and watery porridge would not go beyond 250 calories.<br><br>Also, Ms Au pointed out that there is no variety.<br><br>'Not all food groups are present hence the nutrients are not obtained to meet the daily requirement,' she said.<br><br>She added that these maids would eventually waste away because their fat a protein storage would be used up.<br><br>Also, they would feel tired, have low immunity and might suffer from giddiness and a lack of concentration.<br><br>But often, employers aren't abusive from the onset.<br><br>Psychiatrist Brian Yeo said that when things are not done to satisfaction, employer may then exercise forms of control like reducing pay or food. These are more passive forms of abuse that may escalate over time.<br><br>Agreed psychologist Danny Ng: 'It is really an issue of control and power. They can control someone else's diet and it is done to establish boundaries of who is the boss and who can control the other.'<br><br>Both agreed that abuse often occurs when employers who are stressed at work or even at home, take their frustrations out on the maid.<br><br>Dr Yeo added that the spouse, usually the husband, does not intervene as it may appear that he is siding with the maid instead of the wife.<br><br>But it isn't always a problem of nasty employers.<br><br>'Sometimes it might be an issue of cultural differences,' said Mr Angland Seah owner of maid agency AJS Manpower consultants.<br><br>In the case of Filipina maids, he said they are used to a bowl of rice for breakfast and find that bread is not enough.<br><br>The company often advises employers to cook extra rice for dinner, so that the maid can have some the next morning.<br><br>Another maid agent Yeo Boon Loong said it is often a two-way problem.<br><br>'Maids and employers have different expectations and when they are not met, problems arise, but if employer, can understand what the maid needs and give a proper meal, things might be easily resolved,' he said.<br><br>Troubled maids and concerned members of the public can call the Ministry of Manpower's toll-free hot-line at 1800-339-5505<br><br>Straits Times 31 Mar</div>

That was when the woman ordered her pet dog to bite her, she claimed.<br><br>She decided to pack up that morning and left for the Indonesian embassy.<br><br>Tay, 51, has claimed trial to nine charges - four allegedly committed on Sept 23, 2005 and five on March 21 last year at her Changi home.<br><br>She is accused, among other things, of ordering her dog to bite the maid, and of molesting her and gripping her neck.<br><br>The maid told the court it was about 1am one day in September 2005 when Tay suddenly opened her room's door.<br><br>Tay pulled her hair from behind, turned her around, pushed her and slapped her on both cheeks, she alleged.<br><br>Tay gave her a few more hard slaps and a few strands of her hair fell from the woman's grip on her head.<br><br>She cried out when she felt a pain in her buttocks. She turned around and saw that Tay had hit her with a stool which she then threw at her.<br><br>The pet bowl and knife followed but were deflected by the stool which she had picked up.<br><br>Tay then called in her shih tzu Yuki, a toy breed. Carrying the diminutive dog, Tay said: 'Yuki, bite'' .<br><br>It bit her on her right thigh several times, and her thigh bled.<br><br>She cried and yelled out in pain and tried to push the dog away.<br><br>Meanwhile, Tay had walked out to switch on the television to high volume before returning to cover the maid's mouth, saying 'diam diam'' (Malay for quiet).<br><br>This time, the dog bit the maid on her left arm.<br><br>She ran out of the room to Tay's son's room. He and his father, Mr Kim Hua Siang, helped put a plaster on her wound.<br><br>The maid then said she wanted to go to the agent. But Mr Kim told her to wait till her wound had healed. He gave her a Panadol to relieve her pain.<br><br>The maid said she did not sleep the rest of the morning.<br><br>Later that morning, she packed her bags and left for the Indonesian embassy.<br><br>A police report was made and she was examined by a doctor in hospital.<br><br>The hearing continues on Monday."<br><br>31 Mar Straits Times</div>

They feel good that somebody is calling them Sir or Madam; and at a snap of the finger, this person will come running to them. They can say what they want about this lowly being in front of them as she has no right of reply. The "emperor" and "empress" only want to hear "Yes Sir" or "Yes Madam". Little brats, if any, in the "Palace" will no doubt feel like princes and princesses. After all, from books and movies, they know full well who and what a maid is. And their "high class" parents confirm their belief and encourage their actions towards this lesser mortal residing in their house.<br><br>Granted there are still human beings in our society, who treat their maids<br>like human beings.

When they quit, the employers refused to 'release them' for others to employ, compelling their repatriation. The current maid suffers ditto, working 19-plus hours daily and fearing abuse for talking to outsiders.<br><br>In the follow-up report, 'So hungry, some maids beg neighbours for food' (ST, March 31), the Ministry of Manpower gave the assurance that errant employers will be prosecuted and that maids 'need not fear reprisal'. But vindictive employers can still add insult to injury by repatriating the maids.<br><br>Even if all maids were exit-interviewed to investigate cruelty, compensate victims and deny offenders future employment, employer prerogative to repatriate remains a threat. Hence the impunity of 'maid slavery'.<br><br>A support group for Indonesian maids found that 25 of 45 complaints last month were about food deprivation. One employer charged her maid $2 for a packet of instant noodles. A researcher reveals that some employers forget to provide enough food while others deny nutrition 'to show that they are lower in status'.

            <div class='col-md body'>A flurry of letters in the Straits Times in support of better working conditions for domestic maids. Fortunately, not all Singaporeans are blind and racists.

It appears as though we are no better than the slave owners of the old American South.<br><br>In fact, I would bet that if slavery were made legal here, a large number of Singaporeans would revel in the fact that they wouldn't have to even pay their maids and delight in the fact that they could deny them every right that must be afforded to people of a civilised society.<br><br>After all, 'They are not like us' seems to be the attitude of employers here. Indeed, 'they' don't behave like us.<br><br>On a recent trip to Manila, I was delighted at the excellent customer service provided by every single person I encountered - from the staff at the hotel I stayed at to the shop assistants at the malls I visited. Far better, I should add, than the service that I usually receive in Singapore.<br><br>It seems that the penalties for maid abuse - fines and short jail sentences - are insufficient to deter employers from continuing to abuse the employees under their care.
