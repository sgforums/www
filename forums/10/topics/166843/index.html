            <div class='col-md body'>I read the following article in The New Paper wither interest, regarding new drivers who finally have a driver's licence. Their plight, is that they could not find trust in their newly gotten skill - DRIVING.<br><br>Now, looking at the large pool of local fresh graduates who can't find jobs in Singapore, it seems they're suffering the same syndrome - Juts Pass but Given No Chance.<br><br>As such, I wonder, what is the point, in older workers upgrading themselves when 'people' (employers in general) in Singapore, are generally DISCRIMNATORY in practice? They DON'T give young freshies a chance, and as well DON'T think that older workers can do the job or stay on because they're over-qualified due to age and experience.<br><br>Where on earth, do we go from here?? This sort of employment mindset can only change with Governmental Intervention.<br><br>======================================================<br>New driver? Sorry, can't rent a car<br>By Crystal Chan<br><br>December 03, 2005<br><br>WHAT do you do when you pass your driving test, are eager to drive but cannot afford to buy a car?<br><br>Rent one, of course.<br><br>But this is not so easy as most car renters will say no to new drivers.<br><br>--Choo Chwee Hua<br>If you hope to borrow one, some new drivers say forget it.<br><br>One said even family members turned him down.<br><br>Which leaves these newbies wondering how to hone their skills.<br><br>Accountant Tan Tiong Heng, 34, who passed his test on 5 Feb, approached Singapore's biggest car-sharing business, NTUC Income's car co-operative, but was turned down.<br><br>Mr Tan said: 'All other car rental companies I approached also wanted drivers with at least three years' driving experience.<br><br>'I think this policy is ridiculous. If we can't afford a car and nobody wants to rent us one, how can we get driving experience?'<br><br>Of the four car-sharing businesses and 30 car rental companies that The New Paper contacted, all but two declined to rent to probationary drivers.<br><br>One company, Honda Diracc, does rent cars to probationary drivers aged 23 and above.<br><br>A spokesman said: 'These drivers can gain experience and not lose their driving skills as a result of the lack of practice.'<br><br>He added that Honda ICVS which runs Honda Diracc, does not assess probationary drivers' skills as the company trusts their abilities since they have passed their driving tests.<br><br>New drivers, among the 28,000 who pass every year, must undergo a year of probation from the date they get their licences.<br><br>All the car-sharing businesses and rental companies which do not accept probationary drivers cited lack of driving experience as the reason.<br><br>Car-sharing is an hourly car rental service. It allows members to use a car when they need it without incurring the high costs of car ownership.<br><br>NTUC Income's car co-operative, which is Singapore's biggest car-sharer with a fleet of 200 cars, requires all its 5,500 members to have at least 30 months of driving experience.<br><br>Its general manager, Mr Lewis Chen, said: 'We want to reduce the likelihood of accidents. If a car is involved in accidents, it'll be down for a few days, depriving other members of usage.'<br><br>ComfortDelgro's three-year-old Cityspeed, Singapore's No 2 car-sharer, with a fleet of more than 100 cars and 3,000 members, wants members with at least a year's driving experience.<br><br>Probationary drivers who want to rent will be subject to approval.<br><br>ComfortDelgro's group corporate communications officer Tammy Tan said probationary drivers are assessed based on their age and employment, among other factors.<br><br>She said: 'The company wants to be sure these new drivers are confident to handle its cars.'<br><br>WHERE DO NEW DRIVERS TURN TO?<br><br>What about the need for new drivers to gain driving experience?<br><br>Mr Chen said new drivers could borrow cars from friends and relatives.<br><br>'We do not think it is suitable for the car cooperative to mix the needs of new drivers with the general needs of our members,' he explained.<br><br>Mr Tan said that even relatives or friends have said no.<br><br>Ms Gina Yao, marketing manager of Popular Rent-A-Car, said: 'Our insurance coverage requires our clients to have at least a year of driving experience, because the risk factor is higher for new drivers.<br><br>'We understand that new drivers need experience but we're restricted by our insurance policy.'<br><br>Mr Gerard Ee, president of the Automobile Association, however, feels that it is unfair for car-sharing operators to exclude probationary drivers.<br><br>He said: 'The operators can consider schemes where new drivers have to pay higher fees to offset the insurance premiums.<br><br>'After all, the operators are running a business so they have to be cautious.<br><br>'But probationary drivers are also likely to be more careful on the roads.'<br><br></div>

Instead, it is subsituted by attending seminars and talks related to your diploma, participate in competitions related to your diploma. The school also asks every student to do a portfolio of a professional and and hopefully by being with the professional all the time, you will learn something from him.<br><br>I quite like the seminars, talks and competitions, really learn a lot, but do a portfolio of these professionals, very hard. Contacting them is already hard enough, interviewing them and doing research on them takes up a lot of time.</div>
