              <p>Both LKY and GCT were Prime Ministers before but LKY seems to be very much smarter than GCT.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>LKY managed to let his son become PM than he and his son corrupte public money by giving themself large pay increment whereas GCK seems to be a stupid nerd who did not try to make any advantage out of his PM post.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>On the surface it seems that GCT is a nerd, but he could very well be a cunny old fox who is much smarter than LKY.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>GCT knows very well that LKY is too powerful and there is no way he could challenge that old man so he pretents to be a obedient dog and he knows that it is a matter of time before that old man dies.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Once the old man dies, GCT can than take the opportunity to depose off his useless son and let his own son become the next puppet PM while GCT remains the 1 with the real power.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You see nowadays there are so many people who hates the Lee dynasty but you never hear much people complaining about GCT.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So 1 day when that old man is dead, GCT could very well seize the opportunity to seize power and depose off that old man's useless son.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You see that senile LKY everyday talking about how he will have a military coup etc when the opposition party wins. He is totally off guard against GCT.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Yes LKY maybe right that PAP could continue to rule Singapore for the next 10 years but it could be ruled by the Goh dynasty instead of the Lee dynasty.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Afterall, GCT have been the PM of Singapore before so he have the experience of ruling a country and he stands a much better chance of seizing power from within the party given his reputation and status as Senior Minister than the opposition party winning the elections.</p>
