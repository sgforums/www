              </span></p><p><span style="color: red; font-size: large;"><strong>THE secret of Singapore's strong
              job growth, according to Manpower Minister Ng Eng Hen, is not to rely
              solely on locals to fill the vacancies.</strong></span> Instead, it was
              the ministry allowing businesses here to readily tap foreign workers to
              meet their needs that has proven to be the Republic's key competitive
              advantage, said Dr Ng in Parliament yesterday.</p>
              <span style="font-size: 12px; font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">
              <p>'If we had relied on our limited manpower supply, growth would be
              slower and fewer jobs would be created. This is the experience in other
              countries that tend to close their labour markets,' he told the House.</p>
              <p>Some MPs were concerned that the government's recent moves to relax
              the rules on hiring foreign workers had dented opportunities for
              locals. But Dr Ng reassured them this was hardly the case.</p>
              <p>'The unemployment rate among local polytechnic diploma-holders has
              fallen from 5.6 per cent in June 2004 - before the introduction of the
              'S' pass (for foreign skilled workers) - to 3.4 per cent in June 2007.
              Last year, we saw a 47 per cent increase in the number of job vacancies
              requiring at least a diploma qualification,' said Dr Ng.</p>
              <p>To further boost productivity, MPs such as Josephine Teo (Bishan-Toa
              Payoh GRC) suggested that foreign worker access could be linked to
              industry upgrading and re-development efforts. Another suggestion was
              to have employers show that they had put in enough effort to hire
              locals before being allowed to hire foreigners.</p>
              <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4" width="300" align="right">
              <tbody>
              <tr>
              <td align="center" valign="top"><img src="http://www.businesstimes.com.sg/mnt/static/image/ax/greenline.gif" border="0" alt="" width="300" height="1"></td>
              </tr>
              </tbody>
              </table>
              <p>Dr Ng disagreed with both ideas. 'It would be both ineffective and
              counter-productive to tie foreign worker quotas to specific outcomes.
              Doing so would restrict the growth of companies, especially in this
              tight labour market, and in turn reduce job opportunities for locals.'</p>
              <p>The solution, then, is a three-pronged effort. First, re-create more
              jobs to boost workers' value and productivity. Second, get companies to
              upgrade. Lastly, develop a 'first-class Continuing Education and
              Training (CET) system to help our workforce stay ahead', said Dr Ng. As
              such, the Lifelong Learning Endowment Fund will be topped up to $3
              billion. More CET centres, too, will be developed to benefit adult
              learners, while an Institute for Adult Learning will also be set up to
              conduct research and develop new training methods.</p>

              <p>I have no answers for the above. Maybe you can check with the MOM ? But I cannot guarantee there you will get your answer.</p>
              <p>I just like to contribute to this forum to reveal what i notice working in several companies in singapore.</p>
              <p>a. IT departments of big companies are virtually dominated by foreigners. I say this based on my involvement in 4 of the world's largest companies i have worked for. Their department 'design' is similar. They seem to hire about 80% - 95% or more foreigners, based on my personal assessment. </p>
              <p>b. The skillsets are not difficult to learn. just 3 months, a person with sound fundamental IT skills can be productive and start to take over the job.</p>
              <p>c. What is a talent? Can there be so many Talent shortage? Are IT engineers such talents that so many is needed that locals cannot be trained to do the same?  I believe and am convinced that a Talent is more than an IT consultant or engineer. A talent is someone rare. there are so many IT people around the world and many countries supply so many of them that they are everywhere. Assuming this is so-called talent, then, the word 'talent' has become 'cheaper'.</p>
              <p>d. foreigners come and go. continued dependence on foreigners has the problem of creating a black hole of dependence. Overtime the dependence has not sloweddown simply because of ease in which these can come in. I must say its benefitial to business. But in what way ? Salary wise?</p>
              <p>e. how do you measure the loyalty of foreigners who convert to citizen? I ask because i am not aware what system can ensure a new citizen is more loyal than a born citizen. Mas is a indon convert. This may be a biased example, but then that is a point that should not be ignored as well.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Is business the ultimate deciding factor for national development?</p>
              <p>If so, I am quite disappointed.</p>
              <p>The citizens , however, in my view, is the ultimate decider. Balance is key. This is the only way to avoid Complacency.</p>
              <p>Selamat, I hope you will be caught in less than 6 months. somehow, i have a lot of confidence in our leaders who will certain do a good job, as proven by their track record.</p>

              <p>I believe you can calculate/estimate to a very close percentage of out from the stats board info like the calculations I did for you, and proven by the news article you post, if you really put your heart into it. Either that or you could still go to any Meet the MP session as I have already told you and ask the MP to help you get the data. Or you could call MOM for your data.</p>
              <p>It is your research afterall, you should do the effort, and not post in the forum to ask others to do for you. You are being very similar to another forumer whom when I challenged him to do research, told me that he's researching by questioning in this forum.</p>
              <p>FYI, for question 3 (Is it disclosed for 2007?), your CNA news article and another recent news article posted by fishbuff (on number of locals employed) have the answer.</p>

              <p>instead of everyone being put on a permanent job, now the job role will play a determinant role.</p>
              <p>by taking out a mix of roles that can either be sub out or put on a contract basis, the company saves a lot a SG&amp;A and enhance positive operating profit by going on this model.</p>
              <p>this is reality now, like it or not. tt's why job security is a thing of the past.</p>
              <p>to suggest there is some conspiracy theory behind this is just ludicrous.</p>
