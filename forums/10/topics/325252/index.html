              <p>During my schooling days, comunity involvement project forced students to do acts of charity like visit homes for the aged, most of us just tried to get done with it as a requirement because the school forced us. only a minority would have the heart to really take it as a meaningful experience and i guess that your proposal is something like this but on a larger scale which might create alot of frustration for the "heartless" majority and that is bad, we will have more angsty and stuckup teenagers who despise the authoritarian system of the school.</p>
              <p>I feel that it is an idea of good intention but it simply isnt going to be pragmatic to implement it as a compulsory scheme.</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>Hello, i would like to propose something for the community to bond the older generation and young and my ideas are as follow:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span>We aim to bring the older generation (comprising of those aged 65 and above) and youngsters (secondary school students) together through a partnership between studio apartments and secondary schools. In this project entitled “Golden Experiences in Schools”, schools would be liasing with studio apartments. Secondary school students would carry out meaningful activities with them.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span>Such activities include:</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span>Outside school activities-</span></p>
              <ol style="margin-top: 0cm;">
              <li style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span>Morning Walks with senior citizens on Saturday mornings</span></li>
              <li style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span>Cleaning up of homes every fortnight (Fridays tentatively)</span></li>
              <li style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span>Learning Massage from external organisations and how to care for elderly (eg. Food and nutrition, problems senior citizens may face) via hospitals eg. KK women and Children Hospital, Tan Tock Seng Hospital or Singapore General Hospital</span></li>
              <li style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span>Paint apartment corridor, brighten up place</span></li>
              <li style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span>Elderly can teach dialects to Secondary School students</span></li>
              </ol>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span>Within School activities</span></p>
              <ol style="margin-top: 0cm;">
              <li style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span>Elderly can sit in with students during their art, IT and music lessons to learn what they learn</span></li>
              <li style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span>Share experiences with them regarding World War 2, Racial Riots, kampong life…etc. during National Education and Social Studies Classes</span></li>
              <li style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span>Include Elderly in Civics and Moral Education whereby elderly can teach students values</span></li>
              <li style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span>Elderly can join students in Physical Education lesson whereby they teach Tai Ji Quan or Gateball to students</span></li>
              </ol>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt 18pt;"><span> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span>At the end of about 6 months of service(January to June), the students can share their experiences and inspire people to be interested in building good relations with the youth and senior citizens in the community<span> </span> by doing up</span></p>
              <ol style="margin-top: 0cm;">
              <li>  <ol style="margin-top: 0cm;">
              <li style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span>an exhibition in school whereby members of public can come in to view</span></li>
              <li style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span>newsletter which can be mailed to every resident in the district</span></li>
              </ol></li>
              </ol>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span>For the next 6 months or so, students would also be encouraged to undergo Research and Development and come up with a proposal of an item for the ‘silver industry’ to better the lives of the aged, if feasible, the idea would be acknowledged and awarded as well as taken up by companies to manufacture the product and sold in the market.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span><span> </span></span></p>
              <p>I hope that you guys would not mind giving me your opinon about this idea, new ideas as well as constructive criticism. Thank you very much!</p>

              <p><br>I think it is a good concept. On a societal point of view, it is a good initiative to bridge the gap between the young and the old, through mutual understanding and sharing of experiences.</p>
              <p>It might work for some, and not work for others on a pragmatic level, but the effort to do so is there.</p>
              <p>From an economic point of view, the exposure of our young to the old may even stir an entrepreneur sense of making life better for the old, through the introduction of equipment, health science, and even recreational products that the young may survey with the old.</p>
              <p>As for the old, they may have a better understanding on the aspirations, hopes and dreams of the young, to see life through their point of view in our changing world, and may be persuaded to be more receptive and liberal towards the young's educated perceptions, even if flawed and untampered by life's experience.</p>
              <p>Good luck.</p>

              <p>- Targeting reputable schools with students of higher aggregate potential.</p>
