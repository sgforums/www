              <p>ok fyi, whoever controls space, control earth, because N.K has always been that loner and communist country. The United nations countries leaders felt insecured, since N.K ain't its ally. There are alot of major top secret projects and highly confidential thingy in space itself, somemore if N.K get a satelite, this mean N.K is able to spy other countries as well like what US or allies are doing to every other country.</p>
              <p>Somemore, there's alot of activities going on in space at this moment or at the higher atmosphere. The Allies felt threaten for sure, its not about launching missle hitting who etc. Like what N.K stated, its for satelite purposes, but other countries linked it to possible missle and nuclear threat.</p>
              <p>Somemore, we are reading news and info from media and sources of the UN's country, are we actually reading the right content and sources. We should read the 1st hand source or see the video correspondence from N.K to analyze the situation, instead  of buying the info which is posted from allie's site.</p>

              <p>When everyone is running out of resources, you need 1000 dollar USD to purchase a bread compared to a 1 dollar bread during good time, and its up to the seller and producer if he wants to control the fluctuation of his resources to the buyers.</p>
              <p>In a world where its not control by **** system, nor frequency controlled world. The Community advance way faster as the elites are not binded nor being controlled.</p>

              <p>Have been to Pyongyang, it is truly a showcase capital. People living there all have ties to the ruling elite. Don't you think it is weird when people dressed formally outside everytime you see them?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Heaven and hell difference between Pyongyang and the countryside... Guided tours only show the "bright" side of life there... Can only imagine the horrors people face...</p>

              <p>It is not I suspect. It truly is. A showcase capital which houses only the politically privileged.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Men and women going out in formal wear(suits and western dresses), taking the Metro but no one is seen exiting the stations, buses are so 1960's esque, but tour buses are brand new Chinese/Japanese make(I wonder where they get the Japanese buses)...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And we were brought to a commoner's house. But the house was just well too furnished. Kitchen was like from a designer's showpiece and immaculate. It didn't seem as though people actually lived in the house. For all I know the guides could have had the flat preserved as a showcase model and people to just "live" in it...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A lot of weird stuff... Their failed endeavour to build the world's tallest hotel too... All tell tale signs of a truly showcase capital for the politically privileged.</p>
