            <div class='col-md body'>Exactly, Hyperfocal! Thanks for the response.  You know, during the last elections, just weeks before the announcement of the polling date, the RC members came knocking on our door and checked with us if there was any problems or difficulties we were facing.<br>I told them that this is a surprise visit...I had stayed here for over 14 years and this is the first time the RC members come knocking on the door...I asked why come now and not like a year or three years ago...they could not quite answer.  I asked this types of visiting is good for RC members but don't waste so much time of your volunteer hours when your own MP is doing nothing but shows up only during ribbon cuttings and some lantern or new year celebrations....In the end of the conversation, they tried to recruit me...what a laugh!</div>
