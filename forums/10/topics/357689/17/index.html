                      (where the citizens are entitled to subsidized or free medical care, cheap
                      subsidized housing, free education, cheap transport, etc), there is often a
                      price to be paid (usually in the form of higher taxes).</span></p>

                      elaborate further, I want to stress that I am neither pro-PAP nor pro-opposition.
                      And I certainly do NOT support the current policy of paying millions to our

                      Singaporean (like many of you here) who supports political changes – but only
                      if the change is for the better.</span></p>
              
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">I used to
                      work for a German boss. One of the reasons why he chose not to work in Germany
                      is because he had to pay income tax of 50%. He is opposed to the fact that his
                      hard-earned money is used by his government to provide unemployment benefits, medical
                      care and free housings for drug addicts and drunkards who are too sick to work.<span>  </span>There is also a significant percentage of
                      people in Germany who are unemployed (by choice) as there are sufficient welfare/financial
                      hand-outs for them to survive without having to work.</span></p>
              
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">On the other
                      hand, my Norwegian colleague is happy to pay 48% income tax in his country.
                      That’s because he has many children and all of them are entitled to free
                      medical care and free education.</span></p>
              
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Bottomline
                      is that a welfare state is not for everybody. <span> </span>As the range of welfare and social security
                      services increase, it is inevitable that tax will also have to be increased to
                      fund these services (unless we are oil rich like Qatar or Kuwait).</span></p>

                      may argue that raising tax will not be necessary if we can cut the millions

                      realise that even if you can save $100mil by cutting the salary of our
                      politicians, it will amount to only $25 for every Singaporean (assuming a
                      population of 4mil). This is barely enough even for a visit to the neighbourhood
                      clinic. So who is going to pay for subsidised hospitalization, subsidised
                      housings and free education? Does it mean that doctors, nurses, hospital
                      administrators, construction workers, architects, engineers, teachers and civil
                      servants will also have to take a pay cut? That’s not progression, that’s

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Even if we
                      are to use our reserves to pay for these welfare services (as suggested by some

                      in a generation or two, leaving our children and grandchildren to bear the

              <p>Please do not jump to conclusion. If you trace back my previous posts, you will realise that my post about welfare state is a response to a particular forumite who asked for:</p>
              <p>"HDB pigeon holes become bigger and cheaper for locals"</p>
              <p>"Trains and buses to have more seats instead of taking the
                                          seats to make way for more passengers to stand. If the govt is so
                                          "kiang" they can consider building a double storey underground
                                          train!"</p>
              <p>"50% off all medication rebates"</p>
              <p>My point is that if all these demands are implemented, it will likely translate to higher taxes for ordinary Singaporean like you and me. I am not opposed to welfare services for certain segment of the population (such as the disabled or the mentally challenged). But my honest opinion is that the able-bodied Singaporeans should quit whining and learn to stand on their own 2 feet. This is after all a capitalist system, not a socialist or communist system.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Now the question is, what will our slave drivers react if they realised that all their slaves are willing to die in time of war?</p>

              <p>Dear Minigun,</p>
              <p>For heaven sake, please educate yourself about capitalism (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism) and quit making a fool of yourself time and again. A capitalist system is an economic model, not a politcal system. It certainly has nothing to do with management of our reservists. You will get the same definition be it from the dictionary or your so-called "political science books".</p>
              <p>We can have another round of discussion once you are adequately informed about the subject. Cheers!</p>
