              <p>a good question. when all the local boys go thru NS to protect our country, the PR FT, when in times of war what will they do? help protect singapore or run away? or just stay here and hope to be protected if they cant run? and if the aggressor is their homeland, will they remain neutral, or will they join the aggressor?</p>
              <p>i wonder, if other country army guys think the same, like in korea, and taiwan. if their country is hugely populated by foreigners, will they still feel the pride in defending the country in times of war, who are they really protecting? their families or the foreigners?</p>

              <p>You can ask yourself the same questions and the answers are all there.Like imagine you are a FT or PR in Costa Rica and suddenly there is war...and by the way Costa Rica dont have an Army.On the question of who is the aggressor,if you damn sway your country was the one who attacked then you could either be deported or end up confined around barb wires until the conflict is over.</p>

              <p><br> I did not say all PR must serve lah! it depends on their

              if the govt send them a letter ordering them to serve NS then
              they must serve NS lah! Dont be one of those bunch of aunties or

              <p>well, so my question goes to those PR who did not serve NS, Mr so smart know it all.</p>
              <p>and so what if they do serve NS? u mean serving NS will make them loyal to the country? singaporeans will have to defend singapore, as this is home, we got nowhere else to run to. for PR, they have their motherland, whats makes u think they would not run home?</p>
              <p>in a simple context, you are working and your company about to go bust and keep giving you pay freeze. will u stay on until it finally go bust, or will u find another job. so what if the company sent you for training when it was doing well, gave u bonus in good times.</p>
              <p>Serving NS does not make one loyal to Singapore espescially in times of war and chaos.</p>

              <p>CHOICE?! Not if you have already CHOSEN to take up Permanent Residentship. All PRs have to do NS or risk having your PR revoked. Or should I say, you WILL definitely lose the Permanent Residentship. </p>

              <p>You can ask yourself the same questions and the answers are all there.Like imagine you are a FT or PR in Costa Rica and suddenly there is war...and by the way Costa Rica dont have an Army.On the question of who is the aggressor,if you damn sway your country was the one who attacked then you could either be deported or end up confined around barb wires until the conflict is over.</p>
