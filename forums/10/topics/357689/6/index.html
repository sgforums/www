              What to fight? Sg is a small and flat island. A few guided missiles, the whole island will be gone.  Our HDB flats and other tall buildings will collapse like playing cards.  Please dont ever dream of war in Singapore.  No one, not even our leaders or former leaders have seen real war situation. 
              During Japanese invasion of SG in the 1940s, the British, Australian and New Zealanders were the real soldiers defending Sg.   Small groups of Sg people fighting were under the British forces.

              <p>So? Not many wars involving singapore has happened during these past... 60 years? Not surprising that people never see real war. Of course, you can leave out the current president who was on the island and experience the war first hand, but not as a combatant.</p>
              <p>Jap invasion of singapore is fought by foreigners. Than? Any reason to mention this?</p>
              <p>If you know war is imminent you won't try to leave ah? You will loh, you aim rich people for what? Or you think that an air ticket is too out of reach for common singaporeans nowadays? I will also arrange to leave if i can, but Mindef not dumb, confirm will stop me at the border.</p>

              <p>in today warfare, don't need a few guided missles. just one nuclear bomb enought to devestate the entire region. and nuclear warfare between nation will end the world.</p>

              <p>Damn...the Malay Regiment's last stand at Bukit Chandu was in vain.</p>
              <p>The people who have a stake in the nation to protect (as opposed to stake) or have no way out will be the ones who will stay behind. If you feel that you have no stake, why is that so? What is your participation in civil society, your contribution? Are you going to do anything about it other than blame the ruling party's ideologies and policies? Some of the people here want the ruling party out, okay, but what's next? What ideal society or nation do you want to create?</p>
              <p>Some of the OB markers are mobile, but it hasn't stopped GLBTs, political clubs, intellectuals and nature lovers from lobbying and articulating their opinions. They create their own space against perceived oppression. Are you in such fear for your material comfort that you'd rather leave it to someone else to stand up for your beliefs and make changes to society for you? Even if you have no ideals to stand up for, whom will you leave the defending of your friends and kin to?</p>
              <p>Of course, no one can say for sure whether they will stay or leave until it actually happens, but think about it.</p>

              <p>What real foreign soldiers and fight are you talking about? Capitulation within days? When they had the upper hand against a bunch of 'squat bastards' low on ammo?</p>
              <p>Foriegn soldiers, their families, the colonial dogs, their mistresses and the rich fleeing onboard evacuation ships, leaving behind their indentured slaves that our forefathers were in the mercy of the brutual jap wolves, 50,00 of our people died without even any resistance, against only 10,000 short assed japs?</p>
              <p>Faithless small boys, if one or a few missiles can do the job, wars would be easily won and need not be dragged for years as it did in Vietnam, Iraq, Iran, Britain 1942, Somalia 1980. etc.</p>
              <p>Even 2 atomic bombs could not stop the military lunatics in Tokyo. It took the massed russians on its colonnial borders to realised the furtility of war.</p>
              <p>A few missiles cannot level a city. Worse still, it only creates more  covers in the wreckage to wage havoc on the enemies, as it did in the battle of Stalingrad 1942. The mighty ruthless efficient germans of 200,000 well armed soldiers and much feared tanks thought it was a walkover the russians, but in the end, the shakened and trembling germans surrendered with only 91,000 men left to the courageous inhabitants of Stalingrad who knew they would be massacred by the decieving and brutual germans if they do not fight.</p>
              <p>Atomic bombs will only render an entire territory useless, and Singapore is a necessary port for world trade. It will destroy the surrounding nations as well. Rest assured no one wants Singapore radio-active. Even mad Hitler knew of the strategic position of our country in 1940 and had requested the Japs to seize it frequently.</p>
              <p>One don't need to experience war to know how to handle it. When you get punched, do you say you have no experience, so dunno how to handle it, and let yourself continued to be punched?</p>
              <p>Hell, defence is as natural as eating. Either you fight or you die. At least today, you  still have a chance to learn about organisation and fighting organised warfare.</p>
              <p>Our forefathers never had the chance and had their heads chopped off. So did the chinese indonesian men in 1997. They could only stand aside and watch the horror done to their properties, their children and their loved ones.</p>
              <p>Go on and flee and find excuses for your cowardice, the more reasons the better the justifications for your selfishness. May you have peace in your lifetime.</p>

              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">A few cruise missiles can't really destroy Singapore FYI</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">Nukes? Our surrounding neighbours don't have nukes. And even if they do, radiation can travel quite a fair bit, they won't want that. </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">Singapore get bombed to bits in an air campaign? Seriously, there is a reason why the air force gets the bigger slice of the defence budget. We have the smallest airspace in SEA, but actually our pilots clock more flight hours than any of our immediate neighbours. And for a bloody good reason, we didn't sign the treaty banning mines and cluster munitions. </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">Chances are in an all out conflict, first thing to hit Singapore has to come from the air. E.g artillery shells, rockets, other conventional munitions delivered via aircraft. </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">You'll be surprise how often units get activated to respond to a threat. It just doesn't get reported in the news. This is from my first hand experience</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">I'm very sure Singapore won't survive long in a prolonged war. But we do have our own means to survive. And think again why would we equip our NSFs with green uniforms when our environment is mostly urban grey. </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">I'm no government loyalist, nor a fan of the NS system. But I think some logic should be in place before mouthing off fantasy scenerios. If we really sucked that much, you won't be sitting comfortably in your chair reading this post now. </p>

              <p><br>If people are happy with being enslave, so be it. As long as they are happy, life goes on. Thanks for your insight, just pick your bones and be what you are, let others take their jones and live their life.</p>
