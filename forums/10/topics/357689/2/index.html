              <p>- The next and subsequent winner for the GE is not LKY and
              friends!</p>
              <p>- Country won't pay high for a president to sign paper and sell
              roti pratas only</p>
              <p>- MPs must show that they are really worth that 5 digit
              figures.</p>
              <p>- Prata man will give a wide smile at the NDP when the parade
              commander asking permission for march-pass.</p>
              <p>- ERP cost and timings to be reduced</p>
              <p>- Singaporeans can queue up at the GST rebate center that was
              meant for tourists</p>
              <p>- We can be involved in "controlled" debate or  peaceful
              protest anywhere and not only one place. If peaceful protest go out
              of hands, authorities can take actions since we paid for their
              salaries.</p>
              <p>- HDB pigeon holes become bigger and cheaper for locals.</p>
              <p>- Ministers eat with us at the hawker centers / fast food joints
              so that they know what ingredient should be inside what kind of
              local dish.</p>
              <p>- Deceased president should have a proper state funeral.</p>
              <p>- Trains and buses to have more seats instead of taking the
              seats to make way for more passengers to stand. If the govt is so
              "kiang" they can consider building a double storey underground
              train!</p>
              <p>- Govt dun anything also law here law there. Even my cat fight
              with your dog must law here law there.</p>
              <p>- 50% off all medication rebates?</p>
              <p>- Abolish the rule on cutting off the life support system for
              those brain dead. They might wake up one day.</p>

              <p>Germany was not supposed to rebuilt its army after its agression in Europe in 1914-1918. It disregarded its treaty. Britain and France and European states did nothing concrete to stop Germany.</p>
              <p>Germany preached peace but invaded Ruhr, an industrial belt belonging to France. France stood silent.</p>
              <p>Germany preached peace, but invaded Czechslovakia. By a collective european agreement, Britan and France was suppose to send troops to defend Czech. They didnt.</p>
              <p>Czech was won. Germany again preach peace, but invaded Austria. Britan and France guaranteed its independence, but again, did nothing.</p>
              <p>Germany preach peace again, but invaded Poland. Britain and France promised to protect Poland. But again it did nothing.</p>
              <p>Poland was won. Germany preached peace, but invaded Norway, Holland and Belgium. Britain and France got worried, but it was too late. Germany already rearmoured herself well. France was occupied by Germany as well, and surrendered to German rule.</p>
              <p>England was left alone on her island. No one to help her as her cities were ravaged nightly by German bombers.</p>
              <p>So who will go next after Britain is conquered? I am sure the US troops aint gonna sit and wait to find out in 1942</p>
