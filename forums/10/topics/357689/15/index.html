              <p>I am answering based on my feel now.</p>
              <p>To say whether you will risk your life during safe times is dependent on how much importance you place on the person.</p>
              <p>To me, the only 3 persons worth risking my life for are my gal, my mum and my dad.</p>
              <p>Whether I would chicken out when the time comes, is another question, coz like you said, maybe I am a chicken by heart.</p>
              <p>But I can be very sure I won't risk my life for Singapore</p>

              <p>I remembered a time when I was slightly swayed by the PAP, when Goh Chok Tong was the PM. He was advocating a more caring and gentler society, and for a time, we slowed down slightly to savour the relations we have around us.</p>
              <p>Now, it's back to $$$ $$$ $$$, leaders are bought by $$$, and not serving mainly because of passion for the people. It's sad, a very sad state of society.</p>
              <p>LKY has forgotten what he once said, that leaders need to have the passion for the people. Now he says that what he said in the past is bullsh*t, he believes only in $$$ now.</p>
              <p>And the best part is, there are actually people who agree that their pay is justifiable, even though that we are one of the smallest countries in the world and our leaders are paid THE MOST in the world.</p>

              <p>If politicians are in politicians to earn big bucks they are in the wrong job they should go be businessmen.    In public service is to serve the public, serving public should be the top priority not money making.    I don't really feel a sense of belonging to  the country, really.</p>
