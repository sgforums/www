            <div class='col-md body'>When the scholarship programme was instituted by LKY at an early stage in the late 1960s to groom emerging talents to fills the eventual gaps in the cabinet, many visionaries believed it to be the right move, the bold leap. As an immediate consequence, a large portion of the old guard had to step aside to accommodate these future leaders.<br><br>30 years on, the ruling party can laud the success of this canny move. But while many of these scholars stay on in government office, some choose an alternative to political service Â– the SAF. Having served my 2 Â½ years of national service, spent time in a GLC and ending up in the private sector, I canÂ’t help but draw comparisons to the way the stepladder is drawn.<br><br>A generic scholar is provided with his/her roadmap. So long as he clears all the arranged hurdles in his path, he will make minimum full colonel by the end of his careerÂ….wait I meant end of his military career. It appears the nanny-like style of our govt has spilled over into providing these retired Â‘war veteransÂ’ with a cushy job that arguably pays well in most aspects and ensures continuity within the govt sector and corporations.<br><br>When I say continuity, I refer to the 'tune' that these people sing when they sit on the board of listed govt corporations. Is that perhaps the first concern? To ensure that GLCs remain well-oiled and balanced in terms of ex-SAF personnel vs genuine contenders? The immediate result of such a move ensures no external influence can threaten the said corporation. By external, I mean anyone with wild intentions to change or overtly influence the direction of the corporation away from the 'govt song'.<br><br>By Â‘retiringÂ’ directly into the potential seat of a vice president or senior manager of say GIC or ST Eng, does that not deprive others of a place? When I say others, I refer to those average joes who work their way up but lack the protection of the scholar society. These unfortunate diehards do not have the luxury of pre-planned roadmaps towards their comfortable retirement. Lest you start thinking, the other non-SAF scholars inculcated within the fresh ranks of the company, need not feel insecure when faced with these ex-40-somethings; the board will ensure there are sufficient vacancies to consolidate their career paths.  If not, a convenient creation of a new position is not unthinkable.<br><br>Hence the time old question remains: why reward these &gt;45 retirees with a posh position that arguably can go to an emerging talent? IsnÂ’t this considered a double-incentive to serve the SAF, knowing you can go out with a bang and a fat pay cheque and still retain a high-end position in an industry without prior experience nor background knowledge? Since the govt so aptly loves to measure yardsticks by dollars and cents performance, is there some gauge measuring these old hands whether they are well-equip to do the job?<br><br>And as for those old guards who stood aside for these upstarts decades ago, some must be left scratching their heads and pondering about our MM: When is it your turn?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Good question.<br><br>A few things to note here. A well trained soldier can indeed be a good decision maker and manager.<br>However the minus point in this situation is, w/o relevant experience, how well can they perform outside the military?<br>Another question to note is the automatic promotion and smooth career path provided for these schorlars. Will it prevent truly capable non schorlar officers from promotion to senior ranks? I'm sure the answer is yes. Can SAF adjust the system so that the capable are rewarded based on performance?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The leaders have been largely rhetorical for despite many years of trying to promote all kinds of values like creativity, "thinking out of the box" and entrepreneurship, here is what Dr. Avolio has found as quoted in the Financial Times:-<br><br>QUOTE:<br><br>As Dr Avolio points out: "A fundamental question now is: If Singapore wants to become a 'thinking and learning nation', able to compete by using the full potential of an engaged workforce, what are its leaders willing to do to make this happen?<br><br>"To create value based on driving innovation will require a fundamental refocusing on how leaders are selected and developed in Singapore."<br><br>There needs to be a clear shift in mindset and priorities. A closed and regimented leadership style may have worked in the past. But as economic progress brings nations closer, the need for an open and consultative leadership direction has become more critical to adapt to a fast changing global environment.<br><br>Creativity and entrepreneurship have been buzzwords in Singapore's business circle for years. But little has been done to achieve them.<br><br>Unless Singapore's corporate leaders dare to think "out of the box", and take bold actions, the desire to achieve a creative and entrepreneurial culture will be unfulfilled UNQUOTE<br></div>

For years since 1970s, citizens saw no sign of any economic master plan or strategy.<br><br>If there is one, citizens would have seen Singapore economy upgraded from the labor-intensive model of Goh Keng Swee to the later talked about value-adding model.<br><br>If there was one, we would not be losing out to the Asian Tigers in building our own brands and new technology start-ups in international products like Samsung or Tai Tong etc etc and lagging behind in entrepreneurship due to neglect of practical broad-based education for too many years.<br><br>The reason why we do not have one is because all the cabinet ministers are generalists who know little about the latest race in the technology front.<br><br>The closest strategy is the latest announcement of the IR which was the final confirmation of our lack of economic strategy in that Singapore ministers have finally admitting its inability and failure to compete in the economic strategic fronts.<br><br>I have posted to the feedback unit on the necessity of adopting an economic master plan to benefit from spin-off effect of proposed IR. So far all we hear are excuses about uncertainties signalling that we do not have ministers who understand strategy to leverage on our resources and other advantages in Sun Szu Art of war as applied in good management.<br><br>All these lapses clearly showed that our ministers have run out of steam and ideas. They are now managing the economy ad hoc as seen in PSA and SIA and know only reactionary measures and not enough about economic preemptive and strategic management. They only try to talk like they know and make promises without implemeting a total strategic plan.<br><br>If they have the right mix of strategies through the GIC we should have seen results better than 3% pa. GIC has under-performed and it is doubtful if they have ever come up with an overall economic master plan to leverage on the IR as suggested or other plans that will outperform competitors by more than MISC has been capable of doing.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To be fair, the bulk of a defence budget has to come from taxpayers. Since many of the military equipment and build-up is relatively 'secret', one cannot simply market a potentially new weapon or procure joint ventures that make money.<br><br>The 'business model' in the army is completely different, if any. Defence corporations usually award contracts, not the other way round.<br><br></div>
