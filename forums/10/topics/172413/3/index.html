Do they make things better or outperform the non scholars whose advancement they recently deprived?<br><br>If they can justify their pay and position with examplary performance, then the coporation benefits from their "scholar" capability. But if they are poor performers and merely warm seats and produce oxygen till their second retirement, then we have to ask ourselves why do companies want to waste money on them.<br><br>Remember, companies are profit driven. Money is the bottomline.</div></blockquote>Good point. Also a good pointed noted by LazerLord about this being GLC and not MNCs.<br><br>The other consideration is that the government is giving these scholars an opportunity. Not a guaranteed position. As I've mentioned, there have been many Presidential scholars/ Service chiefs who has been given the boot due to poor performance in the private sector.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Some people seem to take issue with the fact that the ex-scholars have no relevant experience in running GLCs. This may be the case but I believe that there are some general skills that can carry over from the public to private sector eg. general intelligence, people management, motivating staff. You don't always need relevant experience to lead a GLC although you have to pick up the key issues quickly and have capable staff.<br><br>For example, if LKY were to run SIA, he would no doubt be able to lead it very capably, even if he has few experience in the aviation sector.<br><br>For me, the real issue is whether ex-scholars who underperform continue to lead GLCs. Can anybody raise an example? When a GLC is managed poorly, they get knocked by private companies in the market. If the ex-Chief of Air Force can't perform, why would SIA want to keep him. Afterall, Chairman SIA has to answer to the Government as well. Sure, the ex-scholar has more openings for him in GLC vis-a-vis a peer from the private sector. However, it is performance in the long term that determines success, whether in a GLC or not.</div>

That doesn't exist. People work for money. I do. And I'm not ashame to admit it. Do you?<br><br>Why are scholarships coverted by students? Because it is a guaranteed path to success. If that path is set to end at 45, even the average students would not take up the scholarship. These scholars would be smart enough to know that.<br><br>This has nothing to with being cronies. It about giving well deserving scholars an opportunity after their manadatory 45 years retirement. Otherwise, the other options would be to increase or do away with the 45 years retirement age but that would introduce a whole new set of problems wouldn't they?<br><br>Again, this has nothing to do with free economy. You are saying that it is unfair for the average Singaporean. True. But what has the average Singaporean done for that our government needs to ensure their continued employement after 45??<br><br>Also, no one expects to be given high paying jobs after their retirement. Only the selected few will be given the opportunity. There are incidents that some SAF Overseas Merit scholars are condemned and they didn't even reach LTC rank because they fail their tasks.</div></blockquote>Granted nothing is fair in the world. Fortunately, there are always people who try to make it a fairer place.<br><br>There is a distinction between <strong><span style="color: red;">honour</span></strong> and <strong><span style="color: indigo;">decency</span></strong>. We have to be clear in each context. The honour of receiving the scholarship coupled with a roadmap to the top (or success) comes with the scholar's own effort and ability, and not everyone makes it all the way as you have pointed out.<br><br>But you should also realise that there are limited positions at the pinnacle, positions where the other predecessors are nesting. The whole idea of the govt scholarship system is that each scholar shall serve their 'tour of duty', in essence, each position is tenable for a pre-determined time; after which, that position must be relinquished to a qualified young blood.<br><br>The service expectancy of each chief vocation officer is a prime example.<br><br>So the early retirement age of 45 is already pre-planned by the govt. It is up to the govt to determine whether to shift the date. Their main consideration was the need to <strong><span style="color: darkblue;">'fast track' </span></strong>budding talents within the SAF to<strong><span style="color: brown;"> avoid dissent</span></strong>, which in turn requires a short service span within each appointment.<br><br>With pay adjustments with every promotion and appointment (you get increments for both), these 'hotshots' are already very well taken care of. If they have planned their post SAF careers right (they ARE scholars aren't they?), they should be financially sound.<br><br>Can the same be said for the average singaporan who may struggle to secure a decent-paying job come retirement? Should we take PM Lee HL's audacious claim that "it is not the job of the govt to provide employment to the people" at face value? Is that how he expects to secure votes for the upcoming elections?<br><br>It has become a <strong><span style="color: darkred;">question of decency </span></strong>when unqualified 'hotshots' cross trade into a different industry, devoid of experience or relevant skills and thereby denying other more qualified talents that office. Are you aware of the internal animosity created due to such a high-handed act?<br><br>Doesn't the average singaporean contribute to the gross GDP of Singapore's economy? Doesn't the average singaporean pay taxes? Or are you suggesting that only scholars and employees of govt stat boards have <strong><span style="color: red;">'done for that our government' </span></strong><br><br>These 'scholars' <strong><span style="color: blue;">CHOSE</span></strong> to sign on, <strong><span style="color: indigo;">CHOSE</span></strong> to receive SAF scholarships. For better or worst, they SELECTED their military careers of their own free will. They should have <strong><span style="color: brown;">no illusions </span></strong>about life after that.<br><br></div>

They cannot allow any heads of major organizations to build their own power bases. To them such accumulation of powers will be dangerous to their own power bases especially at the SAF. So they long ago have set up a system where the heads will be rotated after a few years and broken up from their bases. At the end only one person will be powerful in such a system.</div></blockquote>In ancient China was balls less amn, in 19th century was Heshen, in modern US is Cheney.</div>

This may be the case but I believe that there are some general skills that can carry over from the public to private sector eg. general intelligence, people management, motivating staff.

Can anybody raise an example? When a GLC is managed poorly, they get knocked by private companies in the market. If the ex-Chief of Air Force can't perform, why would SIA want to keep him. Afterall, Chairman SIA has to answer to the Government as well. Sure, the ex-scholar has more openings for him in GLC vis-a-vis a peer from the private sector.
