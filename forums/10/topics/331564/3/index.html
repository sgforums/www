              <p>do u think LKY will use his own money to invest in GIC and temasek??? do you think that he is so stupid to take loans from financial insitutions who charges high interest rate and more importantly, the need to declare your financial status and account.</p>

              <p>if there is a venue whereby you dun hv to seek approval, no interest, no committment, no individual lost and still can get plently of it, u go for it..and that is the CPF. Tell me, how do they paid you the interest of 2.5 or 4% if they dun invest in it??</p>

              <p>I just noticed one thing too!! The ST forums hardly feature letters that are political. I have been reading these two weeks and there's nothing political in nature at all. Mostly are someone's gripe about someone or something.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>ST is trying to breed political apathy. That also brings less limelight to the opposition while PAP continue their daily self promotion and glorification.</p>

              <h3 class="post-title entry-title">In Pravda there is no "truth" and in Izvestia there is no "news"</h3>
              <p>Ladies and Gentlemen,<br><br>There was a joke in the former Soviet Union which goes like this. In Pravda, there is no "truth" and in <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_0" class="blsp-spelling-error">Isvestia</span> there is no "news", which by the way were the 2 main newspapers in
              Soviet Russia.</p>
              <p>In Russian, Pravda meant "truth" and Izvestia meant
              "news". Both, of course, were state owned and controlled newspapers in
              the former Soviet Union. But what you got was neither truth nor news,
              just plain propaganda.</p>
              <p>That the Soviet Union is doing well. Grain
              production has gone up ten fold. The country cannot be in a better
              shape. Everything is just perfect. Except that the Soviet Union in
              truth was crumbling.<br><br>Which reminds me of the state owned and
              controlled Singapore newspapers such as the Straits Times. And by the
              way, the entire Singapore press and media is both owned and controlled
              by Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_1" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew and his government.</p>
              <p>No one is allowed to print and publish any newspaper in Singapore without a permit from Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_2" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew's government under the Newspapers and Printing Presses Act.</p>
              <p>And you
              guessed it. If you were going to write anything critical of him, you
              not only would be denied that permit, but you will be sued for
              defamation, crippling damages will be awarded and you will be promptly
              bankrupted.<br><br>I have not been able to get any real news in the
              state controlled Straits Times. For instance today's Straits Times
              carried an article about a teenage boy who had sex with another
              teenager; a prostitute was found precariously hanging from a high rise <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_3" class="blsp-spelling-error">HDB</span> flat and Walter <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_4" class="blsp-spelling-error">Woon</span>,
              Singapore's Attorney General counters an argument of a lawyer who says
              there is one law for the rich and another for the poor. But what news
              is there about the Ministry of Home Affairs, the Ministry of Trade, the
              Ministry of Manpower, the Foreign Ministry? Nothing.<br><br>And no one
              can contradict anything put out by this state controlled press one way
              or the other, for the simple reason that no one knows what is really
              happening.<br><br>Which leaves me to guess as best I can, reading what
              is out there in the foreign media. They tell us that Singapore has
              turned into a tax haven for the rich from other countries, as a money
              laundering center, like Vanuatu, a Pacific atoll.</p>
              <p>A place where the
              poor are no longer able to live due to unbearable costs. A place where
              one person takes his life everyday mainly by jumping off high rise <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_5" class="blsp-spelling-error">HDB</span> flats and where the government uses the law courts to punish dissenters
              by throwing them in jail, one of the victims being myself.<br><br>On
              the whole, one thing is clear. The reputation of Singapore has been
              irreparably tarnished. There is no doubt about it. The Washington Post
              is the foremost and most highly respected newspaper in the United
              States together with the New York Times.</p>
              <p>And if the Washington Post
              reports that Singapore is a country which uses its laws to suppress
              legitimate criticism, then this must be the end for Singapore. And this
              is exactly what they did in their report titled "Public enemy in
              Singapore" dated Dec 9, 2008 when they described the shameful use of
              the law courts to silence Dr. <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_6" class="blsp-spelling-error">Chee</span> Soon Juan.<br><br>Singapore
              is not a self sufficient agricultural country that can ignore
              international opinion. It is not Burma. Every aspect of Singapore's
              existence depends on the goodwill of the world. Trade, education,
              investment, banking and commerce.</p>
              <p>Once it's reputation is sullied, it
              can no longer pretend to be a place that one chooses to invest in, a
              place where one gets educated in, a place where one does honest banking.<br><br>And
              in the end, the truth always has a habit of surfacing. Tyrants and
              dictators around the world will try to put up a good face in public,
              but their lies and deceit must eventually begin to take a toll. As is
              the case with Singapore's Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_7" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew.<br><br>Another
              report of significance is the Asian Wall Street Journal's article
              titled "Democracy in Singapore" of June 26 2008 and the article titled
              "Singapore maneuvers in response to <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_8" class="blsp-spelling-error">Chee</span>"
              in the Far Easter Economic Review of Dec 9, 2008.</p>
              <p>These are not papers
              that one can easily dismiss. They are read by people of importance all
              over the world. And what they say is the same thing. That Singapore's
              attempt to show themselves as a democracy with the rule of law is
              nothing but a front. That it is in fact plain and simply a dictatorship
              with Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_9" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew the dictator since 1959, as long a Fidel Castro of Cuba.<br><br>Dr. <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_10" class="blsp-spelling-error">Chee</span> Soon Juan is undoubtedly winning in this battle between democracy and
              tyranny, between truth and falsity and between the rule of law and rule
              by dictate. And with the Godsend, the Internet, Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_11" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew cannot win in his desperate attempt to continue to keep criticism under wraps.<br><br>The
              effect of this bad publicity will undoubtedly take a toll on the
              Singapore dictator's ability to continue with business as usual. The
              rot has already begun to spread. The edifice has to fall in due course.</p>
              <p>This is the time for everyone who cares for Singapore to weigh in with
              the truth and help to turn this place into a real democracy. Agitate,
              write, protest, go to jail, do whatever you can. It cleanses the soul.
              And you can look at yourself tomorrow and tell yourself, there was a
              man. Not a dictator's lackey.<br><br>Gopalan Nair</p>
