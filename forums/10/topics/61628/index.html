            <div class='col-md body'>What u guys think about it. I firmly believe in it. History tells us it works too, one famous example is the Nazi regime(im not pro nazi).<br>Though you may have a dictatorship running the country, however capitalism was practised in the industries and companies.They were not state owned but of coz they only build for themselves since they were preparing for war. So its like best of both worlds. Strong leadership at the top, flexibility down below. Anw im talking very elaborately ....</div>
