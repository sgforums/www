              <p><br>I beg to differ.    All these years of interacting and observing Singaporeans, in general they are still the same, still kiasi kiasu, inward looking, fearful of PAP, dare not speak up and when others speak up or take action they are the first ones to oppose and be obnoxious, unkind to utter words of destruction.    I don't think singaporeans will ever change.  Due to these the current ruling party becomes more and more daring and evil to serve themselves at the expense of the people and continue to ignore the people.   </p>

              <p>Every political system has it's down sides you know...it's how we ensure that the down side do not go out of hand that makes a political system works.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Please remember the fact that the grass ALWAYS seems greener on the other side. Blindly adopting the political system of another country will not work...if it can work...then there is no point in having a country called singapore.</p>
