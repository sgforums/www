              <p>I know LKY n his son LHL are trying to influence Mainland China by "teaching" him what to do to stay in power with absolute one-party ruling.I believe China didnt copy all of their methods,but they did copy some of their ideas n implement them in Hong Kong n their country.</p>
              <p>LKY n LHL thought that by doing that,they can hold on to power with China ever increasing influence in the region.And they can use China to reduce threats from the U.S from interfering Singapore politics.</p>
              <p>But what they didnt know is that it is very dangerous for them to do that.Coz unlike North Korea n Iran,China got nuclear power.If,China going to follow North Korea,Singapore or Iran style,pass the power n status from a certain politician to his son.And that son happen to be a fuking retard like LHL n North Korea current leader, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kim Jong Il</span> it would be a major threats to the world stability.</p>
              <p>In United States,a politician can pass their President seat to his son through fair election,and their parliament can keep in check of their president power.But,in China n Singapore,there is no such system to control dominating party leaders authorities.Sinapore still nevermind,coz she is small n our PAP leaders n ministers constantly being raped by other countries leaders.BUT,China will be a different story.If the leader happen to be as retard as LHL n North Korea leader, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kim Jong Il</span>,or a terrorist like Iran president,it would be a disaster for the entire human being.</p>
              <p>If such a retard leader in China decide to press a nuclear button to attack other countries out of anger,especially if the target is U.S n Russia,Oh my god.......u guys can imagine what will happen......</p>

              <p>Although you HAVE to give credit to lee kuan yew as one of the
                  top autorcratic leaders around in history. I mean compare LKY to
                  other autocratic leaders like Mao or chiang ...personally I find
                  that he is a much better leader.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">So you acknowledge LKY to be an authoritarian? Fair enough.</span></p>
              <p>I mean...having a more liberal democracy does not mean the
                  leader will be better than lee kuan yew.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">And continuing the current autocratic process <strong>most definitely precludes the leader from being better than LKY.</strong></span></p>
              <p>If that' the case...then George W. Bush can be known as one of
                  the top leader because he was elected from a more liberal
                  democratic process.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">I've never thought it possible to construct a strawman out of red herrings. Your capability in fabrication astounds.</span></p>
              <p>You guys HAVE to understand that the  voters DON'T make the
                  correct choice all the time.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">But leaders do, right? Hence your blind support for autocracy.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Oh wait, when leaders screw up, it's always an <strong><em>honest mistake</em>.</strong></span></p>
              <p>The more time I spend here...the more I see the LKY bashers
                  becoming more and more like LKY...thinking that ANY opposition is
                  better than the PAP.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Better than thinking that ONE person is the be-all and end-all of government.</span></p>
              <p>It's like the opposition supporters are a little extreme...if
                  this is what most of the opposition in singapore is like...I will
                  feel so sad for singapore.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">If your puerile ramblings represent the thoughts of most of the PAP, Singapore is dead.<br> </span></p>
              <p>Alot of opposition supporters is becoming like the PAP...they
                  <strong>DON'T</strong> admit that they CAN be wrong.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">So you're saying that the PAP don't admit their mistakes? We may yet have some common ground.</span></p>
              <p>Guys...liberal democracy is not some wonder tool that will make
                  life perfect. As long as there is imperfection in this world...NO
                  political system can be perfect.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Democracy is nearer to the 'perfect' asymptote than whatever forms of autocracy you can devise.</span></p>
              <p>Only when humans becomes perfect...maybe then...we can come up
                  with a perfect political system.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Why don't you lead the way? I just bought some lobotomizing equipment and was wondering what to do with it.</span></p>
              <p>Every political system has it's down sides you know...it's how
                  we ensure that the down side do not go out of hand that makes a
                  political system works.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Centrist waffle, but I've got no argument with that.</span></p>
              <p>Please remember the fact that the grass ALWAYS seems greener on
                  the other side. Blindly adopting the political system of another
                  country will not work...if it can work...then there is no point in
                  having a country called singapore.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">So you're saying that Singapore is only worth its political system? Very <strong>interesting </strong>view you have there.</span></p>

Do some research and u will appreaciates our life here... our garmen might be stiff in certain area but at least we have a choice and we try hard enough, thing would materialized.

              <p>I know LKY n his son LHL are trying to influence Mainland China
              by "teaching" him what to do to stay in power with absolute
              one-party ruling.I believe China didnt copy all of their
              methods,but they did copy some of their ideas n implement them in
              Hong Kong n their country.</p>
              <p>LKY n LHL thought that by doing that,they can hold on to power
              with China ever increasing influence in the region.And they can use
              China to reduce threats from the U.S from interfering Singapore
              politics.</p>
              <p>But what they didnt know is that it is very dangerous for them
              to do that.Coz unlike North Korea n Iran,China got nuclear
              power.If,China going to follow North Korea,Singapore or Iran
              style,pass the power n status from a certain politician
              to his son.And that son happen to be a fuking retard like LHL n
              North Korea current leader(sry,i forgot that b!tch name^^),it would
              be a major threats to the world stability.</p>
              <p>In United States,a politician can pass their President seat to
              his son through fair election,and their parliament can keep in
              check of their president power.But,in China n Singapore,there is no
              such system to control dominating party leaders
              authorities.Sinapore still nevermind,coz she is small n our PAP
              leaders n ministers constantly being raped by other countries
              leaders.BUT,China will be a different story.If the leader happen to
              be as retard as LHL n North Korea leader,or a terrorist like Iran
              president,it would be a disaster for the entire human
              being.</p>
              <p>If such a retard leader in China decide to press a nuclear
              button to attack other countries out of anger,especially if the
              target is U.S n Russia,Oh my god.......u guys can imagine what will
              happen......</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Just from that opening post itself, it is already full of bias and taking a prejudiced stance on many issues.</p>
              <p>Who told you that NKorea leader is a retard? And who told you that Iran president is a terrorist?</p>
              <p>I know who, Reuters, AFP, AP.</p>
              <p>What is truly worrying for me is that many Singaporeans have swallowed and gulped down this propaganda by the three evil forces, Reuters, AFP, AP, copied and pasted by the Singapore media and other regional media here.</p>
              <p>So what makes you believe that NKorea leader is a retard and Iranian leader is a terrorist?</p>
              <p>Retard by what standard? Terrorist by what standard?</p>
              <p>I am really worried when people in Singapore so readily accept certain viewpoints without critical judgement or objective evaluation. Ordinary people's global viewpoint is totally brainwashed already without them realizing it. Even believing some leaders are more enlightened and responsible than other leaders, by what standard are you measuring and comparing them?</p>
              <p>If everyday we read articles written by certain news sources, of course our minds will be slowly forming a picture to believe who are the 'good guys' or the 'bad guys' , but do you think this is correct?</p>
              <p>With regards to China learning from Singapore, sure why not? Why should that be neccessarily be a bad thing?</p>
              <p>You alluded to them copying dynastic politics, I am not sure they will do that, one-party state maybe. But I think what they are really interested to see and learn is the whole Singapore experience, the whole package.</p>
              <p>Actually Singapore started off somewhat socialistic, just look at the name, People's Action Party. There has been some discussion on how they managed to provide almost universal housing for the masses, a great socialist achievement.</p>
              <p>But what is interesting is that Singapore managed to use capitalistic methods to achieve socialist aims, such as providing universal housing through revenues collected from mutinational corporations.</p>
              <p>I just stop it here, and there is no need to go further, but I just want to say I am convinced a benign authoritarianism is a much superior form of governance than democracy, and combining capitalism and socialism is possible. Since China is opening up and trying to embrace capitalism, of course Singapore can serve as a useful reference point.</p>
              <p>What I want to say is, dont take Singapore too lowly. Give it more credit. And dont take democracy too highly. It is overrated.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Just from that opening post itself, it is already full of bias and taking a prejudiced stance on many issues.</p>
              <p>Who told you that NKorea leader is a retard? And who told you that Iran president is a terrorist?</p>
              <p>I know who, Reuters, AFP, AP.</p>
              <p>What is truly worrying for me is that many Singaporeans have swallowed and gulped down this propaganda by the three evil forces, Reuters, AFP, AP, copied and pasted by the Singapore media and other regional media here.</p>
              <p>So what makes you believe that NKorea leader is a retard and Iranian leader is a terrorist?</p>
              <p>Retard by what standard? Terrorist by what standard?</p>
              <p>I am really worried when people in Singapore so readily accept certain viewpoints without critical judgement or objective evaluation. Ordinary people's global viewpoint is totally brainwashed already without them realizing it. Even believing some leaders are more enlightened and responsible than other leaders, by what standard are you measuring and comparing them?</p>
              <p>If everyday we read articles written by certain news sources, of course our minds will be slowly forming a picture to believe who are the 'good guys' or the 'bad guys' , but do you think this is correct?</p>
              <p>With regards to China learning from Singapore, sure why not? Why should that be neccessarily be a bad thing?</p>
              <p>You alluded to them copying dynastic politics, I am not sure they will do that, one-party state maybe. But I think what they are really interested to see and learn is the whole Singapore experience, the whole package.</p>
              <p>Actually Singapore started off somewhat socialistic, just look at the name, People's Action Party. There has been some discussion on how they managed to provide almost universal housing for the masses, a great socialist achievement.</p>
              <p>But what is interesting is that Singapore managed to use capitalistic methods to achieve socialist aims, such as providing universal housing through revenues collected from mutinational corporations.</p>
              <p>I just stop it here, and there is no need to go further, but I just want to say I am convinced a benign authoritarianism is a much superior form of governance than democracy, and combining capitalism and socialism is possible. Since China is opening up and trying to embrace capitalism, of course Singapore can serve as a useful reference point.</p>
              <p>What I want to say is, dont take Singapore too lowly. Give it more credit. And dont take democracy too highly. It is overrated.</p>
              <p>For more discussion please search a bit on YouTube, type these names:</p>
              <p>Kishore Mahbubani</p>
              <p>Fareed Zakaria</p>
              <p>Lee Kuan Yew Democracy</p>

              <p>You cannot blame Singaporeans. The media here is brain dead and depoliticised.</p>
              <p>They watch this type of dead state media, they also become influenced by its propaganda.</p>
              <p>This is due to your  "benign authoritarianism".</p>

              <p>The level of awarness and maturity of political affairs can be raised by the mainstream media if they choose to do so.</p>
              <p>They can provide diversity of views, discussion, debate, political talkshow etc.</p>
              <p>But under the PAP regime, their goal is to brainwash the public into voting for them and keep them at a low level of political knowledge.</p>
              <p>This is your so-called "benign authoritarianism".</p>
              <p>How not to be brainwashed and narrow, under this type of worthless state propaganda media?</p>
              <p>If public becomes politicised, which fucker would go and vote for PAP regime, you tell me?</p>
              <p>So, authoritarianism = state propaganda media to serve its own interests = brainwashed public.</p>
