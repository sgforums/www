            <div class='col-md body'>I might be overreacting or wrong here, because I do not know what percentage of Temasek funds belong to the MAS, which ultimately belongs to CPF members.<br><br>If all our CPF funds in MAS is placed in Temasek, I would be concern about my money. Whether they can payout our retirement money when it's time for us to retire?<br><br>In 2006 CPF has "Long Term Investments" of "$108,096 millions" in it's Balance Sheet.<br><br>In 2006 MAS owes CPF Board $108,096 millions (under 10. Long Term Investments) in it's Balance Sheet.<br><br>Temasek obtains it's funding from MAS and Temasek's Shareholder's Equity in the Group Balance Sheet 2006 is $90,630 million.<br><br><strong>There is a shortfall of $17,466 millions ($108,096 - $90,630), I wonder with the current investment strategy Temasek is making, will the CPF Board be able to meet all future liabilities to it's members when they fall due (without leading to inflation, as MAS could always increase the money supply to meet it's liabilities to CPF Board).</strong><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Of course this is all hypothetical, as I do not know the extent of funding MAS extends to Temasek. But if all the Long Term Investments in CPF Board goes to Temasek, there might be a cause for concern.<br><br>Everything stated here is hypothetical, so readers should exercise caution interpreting the figures shown, and not presume that they are all facts. I made alot of assumptions, so I could be wrong in my analysis.</span><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br><img src="http://i208.photobucket.com/albums/bb312/maurizio13/AR2006PDF_Page_39.png"><br><br>Source: <a href="http://mycpf.cpf.gov.sg/NR/rdonlyres/C8791EEA-ED1C-417A-99A9-1B831390D57C/0/CPFAR_FinAnnexes2.pdf" rel="nofollow">CPF Board</a><br><br><img src="http://i208.photobucket.com/albums/bb312/maurizio13/AR2006PDF_Page_63.png"><br><br>Source: <a href="http://mycpf.cpf.gov.sg/NR/rdonlyres/C8791EEA-ED1C-417A-99A9-1B831390D57C/0/CPFAR_FinAnnexes2.pdf" rel="nofollow">CPF Board</a><br><br><img src="http://i208.photobucket.com/albums/bb312/maurizio13/temasek.png"><br><br>Source: <a href="http://www.temasekholdings.com.sg/investor_relations/gpfinstatements.htm" rel="nofollow">Temasek</a></div>
