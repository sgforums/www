Malaysia will be getting subs, and the situation will change drastically in the next decade. "No immediate threat" does not mean much to me. The keyword there is "Threat". it simply means they ARE a threat. If Indonesia is not a threat, then I don't know what is. Malaysia is not our only potential aggressor mind you. I support the need for a newer torpedo.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>personally, I support the need for a better torpedo, the A244S range is only about 7km, and its speed is about 35 knots, which is not really enough. . .i think Singapore should start shopping for better toprs BEFORE those M'sia Scorpenes come along. . ., and I was just wondering, what does RSN's subs carry?  if it is just those toprs, can the Harpoon be launched from it using a capsule?  else they will be pretty redundant 'cos M'sia has better and more capable subs and regional countries have mostly surface warships while the A244S is solely for Anti-sub if i'm not wrong. . .</div>

And it was my point exactly.  To have a blue water navy, means your fleet/squadron is able to make long range deployments.  However, being able to make long range deployment withou air cover can only spell trouble.  Usually being couple hundred tonnes of sinking metal.  The Royal Navy had so to speak a blue water navy back in 1940s.  The Prince of Wales and Repulse was part of it, and unfortunately for the "escorting" carrier, the carrier was left behind due to problems.  The blue water navy died the moment the carrier was left behind, resulting in Japanese torpedo wakes trailing to the site of the 2 sunken battleships.<br><br>In RSN's case, the frigates may give a little more deployment range, but what use is this without air cover?  Or Naval aircover in this case, if the deployment is too far away from any of our bases?  Hence you are right that currently only 3 countries have blue water navy.  UK, US and France.  China is on its way to acquiring one as soon as their carrier is completed and pilots trained.<br><br>And with the above said, my definition of a Blue water navy, is NOT, technically, wrong.</div>

The main 4 tubes are 533mm and would need heavy torps like the Mk48. Of course MK 48 is not suitable because they are too heavy and are  more suitable for deeper sea and colder water. RSN is best to purchase the heavy weight from Whitehead heavy weight (A184 or "Blackshark" because Italia's surrounding waters (the Mediterranean) are more like the South China sea.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Shvkal II is guided.  How the hell, beats me.  My best guess is with another external guided active sonar source, like a UUV.<br><br>In anycase, with 200knots and close proximity of regional water, you don't really have to be guided to sink another sub.  Given a sufficiently large warhead, u can probably sink 2 submarines by exploding between them.<br><br>The russians were experimenting with nuclear tipped shvkal, that could be launched from 60 miles away to sink carrier battle groups.  Still no news about that as yet.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>the kursk illustrates the fact that the navy of the former soviet union is falling apart.<br><br>i believe the weapon platform itself is stable but the entire navy suffers from insufficient funding, substandard maintenance and demoralised crew who doesn't even receive proper paychecks!<br><br>u try running a navy with all those factors working against u  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>the shkval alone didn't "cause" the incident... much of the russian fleet is an accident waiting to happen because there's not enough money to allow it to operate safely.<br><br>but its not as if Sg is buying it and a sjoormen is gonna blow up next because of it... i just think its an interesting technology, sufficiently advance for RSN to maintain an edge over the rest.<br><br>why take baby steps when a technological leap is readily available? a sub armed with a combination of wire guided torpedos for normal engagements and rocket propelled ones for retaliation, forcing the other sub to take evasive actions and snap the wire of its torpedo would make a very strong combination.</div>
