            <div class='col-md body'>Just wondering how the SAF, with its technology, and recent proposed auisitions, how does it match up with other regional armed forces (Thailand, indonesia, Australia, Cambodia, Vietnam,etc)<br><br>also, Jane's Defence weekly commented sometime ago that SAF might become an expeditionary force within 10 years, watcha think of that? (i'll be 24 then, out of NS, so if SG becomes expeditionary, then phew, dun wanna drop into Indon or Lanka to help fight rebels)<br><br>Personally I think Singapore can beat countries such as Nam and Cambodia and Indon flat (these countries got numbers but no support or firepower), but Thailand, Malaysia and Australia I'm not so sure, NOT THAT I'M ANTICIPATING WAR WITH ANYONE<br><br>PLS DO NOT TURN THIS INTO A FLAMING WAR BETWEEN SINGAPOREANS AND MALAYSIANS<br><br>However, as sidenote, have any of you visited <a href="http://www.harimau.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.harimau.org</a> before?  I've NEVER in all my time on the net been so vulgar, but looking at that site, i wanna wring the neck of the damn sitemaster and piss on his/her shit face and the stupid organization...

            <div class='col-md body'>if go to war and Tim Huxley is right in his book, Brunei should also help out abit on SG side, though they are a very small force, they can create somedisturbance on Borneo, Malaysia will cry fighting on two fronts.<br><br><strong>As it is, they use so many types of equipment their logistics probably already weeping, gotta fight a war they are gonna start crying, deliver to two battle fields, they're gonna wail!</strong> (note i bold it, should go see HARIMAU's post on M'sia ORBAT, and he's so proud of it, but he has since disappeared)<br><br>Though indon got people, they only have about 300,000 full time soldiers which is not alot considering indon's size, and looking at the Indon govt, how good is their armed forces.<br><br>Don't come arguing back they got reserves.  Their reserves are there on the lists in name only.  Some are probably long dead but still listed as a reservist.<br><br>However, if Malaysia and Indon can somehow coordinate their equipment effectively, its gonna be a hard fight, with Singapore almost for sure losing.  But I doubt they can coordinate with each other.  Rivalry, jealousy, all the rubbish you get at diplomatic level gonna break down their coordination too.<br><br>Irony is, if Indon fights SG, its gonna be using Singapore's old equipment (see the forum on Singapore Giving Indon Freebies) 'cos its among the newest equipment they probably got, considering the state they're armed forces is in.<br></div>

My cousin was a commander of one of our artillary units which Lee oversaw back when he was still in the SAF.

            <div class='col-md body'>i will say to compare our military manpower strenght ....we are currently at a disadvantage.Looking at our standing force of 300,000 strong soldier, we cant determine much as a large number of that are NS cum reservist men, looking at the stayer or quiter's arguement...sigh....i dare not be confident...however to compare our armed force technical capability ,i will say we were far at the advantage point,at least i will say we are one generation ahead in terms of weapons compare with our nearest counterpart, malaysia and indonesia , which are being pull back by the economic crisis..but i will say malaysia made the smartest available move ,to upgrade their strenght ,by aqquiring russians instruments.<br>The only way to win the war is to fight it fast, deadly and fearlessly. our weapons are specialized in 'enter and take land' warfare..only if we destroy our enemies economic point and heart ,that we will win the war quicky. For example ...if we were to be at war with australia...chemical warfare or biological warfare to destroy their crop might be used by our Generals to ensure a quick victory. Failing to win the war quickly may spark a discourage in our team and abling the enemy recrew more man. The enemy might use religion as an instrument to fight us, which cannot be easily control by our commander.<br>There are a number of factors which proves our disadvantage in SEA. A multicultural small red dot in the middle of a muslim, and procommunist world is one example. However luckily, due to our advancement in weaponary, it acts as a heavy deterence .To have a head on conflict with malaysia or indonesia , the risk are lesser (comparing to other SEA countries) as long as national survival is at stake ...but with thailand , cambodia or vietam i will say , rather not wise, due to their geograhical intensity , weaponary and their people's loyalty , i will say not so easy to win.The best way to match up agaisnt our neighbours is to make friends with them and beat them up economically and socially, by winning them in this two fronts, military victory in times of need will be much easier.<br><br>I NEED TO HAVE FOOD , A HOME, A JOB......SO THAT I CAN FIGHT FOR......COUNTRY.</div>

He did a programmed the computers in the artillary guns that increased the accuracy of the guns from something like 400m squared to about 4 metres squared.(Not too sure about the specifications though must check this out). Later during a live firing exercise with the americans, The amarican commander was so impressed that the US requested to buy the software. With brains like him the mutts will be dead in time of war.</div>
