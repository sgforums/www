            <div class='col-md body'>i think projecting its force overseas will be a problem, SG does not have a large enough armed forces so as to project overseas<br><br>Mobilising ofr long term only feasible if Singapore under threat directly.  If you deploy them overseas or call them up because you deploy your standing force overseas, thats going to be uproar and economic standstill.   People will lose jobs and companies will lose revenue.<br><br>Probably can act as balance for region and take lead in issues here.  Its already taking the lead for many things in ASEAN.  For example, SG is the one always lobbying for FTA and other agreements.<br><br>With a powerful force of Singapore in ASEAN itself, any aggressor, wether within or outside ASEAN, will think twice about whacking any country in ASEAN since there is a strong force nearby which can help take back lost territory.  Of course, other countries can play this balancing role but Singapore is the closest to achieving it with the ability to maintain that position as well.<br><br>So SAF might be able to apply its deterrence role regionally as well.<br></div>

It carries the rough equivalent of the RMN frigates despite being less than 1/3 the size of the RMN frigates.  The crew used is therefore also much smaller...,  however, the main difference is the heli on board the frigate.  It can be very potent if used effectively..., spotting enemy ships for firing solutions, etc.<br><br>this compares what is probably the best class of fighting ships of both navies...<br><br>also, I'm not too sure on the range of the Exocet, seems a bit short to me...<br><br>Malaysia also has 2 1,900 tonne Kasturi-class frigate which carry 4 Exocets each, that is about the load of Singapore's 6 MGBs.. although the MGBs use harpoons... even Singapore's 6 PVs can carry 4 Gabriel SSMs.... so it shows that RSN employs more weapons with smaller, faster and therefore more economical platforms...<br><br>pls comment...<br><br></div>
