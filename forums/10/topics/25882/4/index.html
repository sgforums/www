Sjoormen class effectiveness<br><br>Even though the challenger class subs are old, they still serve a rather useful purpose and no one knew about the details and extent of the refit program the subs have undergone.<br></blockquote>I read from somewhere (sorry forgot the source - could have been from the Kockum website) that an update to the combat system. Nothing was said about how extensive the update was, just a brief mention. The main stress was with the tropicalisation program.<br><br><blockquote><br>2. Visby<br><br>It could be that the singapore - swedish program was actually to design a MCV replacement. It is plausible as the current known ORBAT has 12 missile craft. It is only logical that when the frigate program is completed, the time would ha ve come to consider the MCV replacements as the MCV would have been 20 years old already<br></blockquote>I don't think this is the case. The Sea Wolf crafts would have been much older than the 20 years. RSN has the "habit" of "passing down" the roles of the ships. The MCVs replaced the MGBs as the primary strike crafts. With the "La Fayatte" frigates, they will be used as the primary strike vessels (both surface and Air warfare). The MCVs will simply complement the "La Fayattes", albeit this also mean that RSN has essentially acquire green water to blue water capabilities. RSN is no longer a simple brown water navy.<br><br>My guess as to why the Visby options was dropped for the time being is because Sweden has yet commission even their first ship, and it is a well known policy that Mindef would not purchase any unproven technologies. Perhaps when the Swedish navy has operated the Visby for a couple of years then the RSN will purchase some.<br><br><blockquote><br>3. NGFS and Frigate fit<br><br>I question the authenticity of the ADJ article. It is a malaysian publication and there is a distinct slant in their coverage towards the RMAF. Regarding the exocet mk2 fit, I am curious if true about the choice. It will make better sense from a logistical point of view to adopt a harpoon variant. The capabilities of the harpoon variants are not neccessarily inferior to the exocet. I am hoping for a minimum 100mm calibre on the frigate. Logistically it might make sense to adopt a common gun mount but then for the sake of improve capability, the logistic difficulties should be tolerated.<br></blockquote>For the new "La Fayatte" frigates, it was a well published information both from Janes and Flight International magazine that they would be armed with Aster 15 and MM40 Exocets. The French essentially are not going to provide any free integration of Barak or Harpoon and to give the carrot to RSN, they would have thrown in the whole thing dirt cheap in comparison to the similar weapons. I also won't be surprised that the frigates ended up with French integrated Combat Systems, Air-Surface search radars, Sonars,  and fire-control radars.<br><br>Even the choppers selection would most probably be an european design with French companies involvment. The two most likely candidates are NH-90 and EH-101 Merlin.<br><br>As for the gun mount, I really don't see the 100mm a good choice seriously. If RSN is serious of getting a large calibre gun, go for the United Defense, LP Mk45 Mod 4 gun. The mod 4 has a stealth mount and can fire the rounds further than the French 100mm. The extended range projectile can fly over 100km which makes it a good anti-surface weapon and a long range arty gun. If the fire control/ combat system is smart enuff, they could even down some planes before they can drop their PGMs.<br></div>

The onboard sensors and weapon fire-control systems would have gone through live exercises and operations. Visby is still pretty much on the development and system testing phases and hasn't even achieved a initial operating capability, whereas the La Fayettes have served France for many years and have been sold to Taiwan and Saudi Arabia.<br><br>As for weapon fit, it is pretty much on par with a typical frigate of its size, 8 SSM, 16 to 32 SAM, Chaff, Standard medium size gun, and possibly CIWS.<br><br>It also carry a 10 ton helo like most frigate of the same class. The only thing different is that La Fayatte is somewhat a little slower than other frigates in the same class. It can't make &gt;30knots in speed. What a shame. However RSN version will be slightly faster due to the reduce in size and weight, but I doubt it can still travel above 30 knots though.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>guys!! my personal view more towards the platform of RSN future Delta frigates.As said  earlier on(not by me),  conspicious RSN tends put its surface ship in service for at least a decade or so,having/acquiring ship which has larger platform allows future upgrade and integration of latest technology.As for visby case<br>,it is looks for like a seal box floating/sail in the sea imagine if one day someone decided to open and place some stuff in  he/she must unseal this box then reseal it back.Worse still there might not be enough space,if the new object is too large. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Singapore will not become a blue water navy by just acquiring LaFayettes.  To be a blue water navy, I have always believed in Naval Aviation.  Which means, the Surface task force must be able to have the means to project naval air-power.  It must also be able to sail around with means of resupply without going back to port.  Which means, we would have to acquire carriers.  That itself is not out of the question, since we really are short on space.  So acquiring carriers might be a solution to free up runway space.  Maybe not a BIG one, but a small one that can hold up to 30 aircraft.  Automated systems to minimise manpower required on the carriers, etc etc.</div>

To be a blue water navy, I have always believed in Naval Aviation.  Which means, the Surface task force must be able to have the means to project naval air-power.  It must also be able to sail around with means of resupply without going back to port.  Which means, we would have to acquire carriers.  That itself is not out of the question, since we really are short on space.  So acquiring carriers might be a solution to free up runway space.  Maybe not a BIG one, but a small one that can hold up to 30 aircraft.  Automated systems to minimise manpower required on the carriers, etc etc.</div></blockquote><strong>By your definition - ONLY countries have modern aircraft carriers (at least 30 aircraft per carrier) in the their fleet is consider to be a blue water navy -<br><br>Well, Only TWO countries in world can fitted your definition - US &amp; France - maybe UK.<br><br>So that why your definition of a blue - water navy is wrong.<br><br>Personally the a blue -water navy mean having capability of your navy deploying its ships out on a full time &amp; long distance deployment in the oceans<br><br>The 6 frigates by itself to not make RSN a blue -water navy but it do give the Sg to have a long distance / longer time deployment capability.<br><br>But If Sg is to have a couple of supply / refilling ships that is a different story. </strong></div>
