Thus it makes sense to use a common platform, common ammunition. Furthermore, the French 100mm gun does not provide much more benefit than the 76mm gun. If RSN want a bigger and longer range gun, they use choose the US United Defence 5", 62 calibre, Mk 45 Mod 4 naval gun. The new Mk 45 Mod 4 provides  Naval Surface Fire Support (NSFS) range of more than 21 nautical miles (37 km) using the Navy's new 5-inch Cargo projectile, the Improved Conventional Munition and an improved propelling charge for all- weather, day/night mission support. It will also provide a over- the-horizon NSFS range of more than 60 nautical miles (120 km) with the near- term integration of the 5-inch Extended Range Guided Munition (ERGM) and propelling charge.<br><br>The gun mount is also redesigned with stealth features.</div>

However, all of a sudden, Mindef decided to go the French way, ordering a scaled-down version of La Fayette instead. The actual reason for this change is never made public.<br><br>I can only guess that there might be a disagreement of how much stealth technology the Swedish is willingly to provide Sg, system and weapon fit issues, cost or probably the associated risks.<br><br>However, I have also recently seen a pic of a computer model of ST Marine proposal of a stealth corvette of 85m in length with the standard FAC diseal engines hull type and the La Fayatte like superstructure.</div>

If any of you went to Asian Aerospace 2002, you would have seen 3 new models of the new RSN warships. One of them is and 80m OPV that looks like the Lafayette frigate which is probably a shortened version. The other is the Visby stealth corvette and the third is Italy's new generation stealth FAC. Being curious, i spoke to one of the ST engineers at the show. He mentioned that 80m craft is not the la fayette frigate. As for the swedish stealth platform it would probably be a version of the Visby. Hence, I see a new generation of ships being purchased. The 80 m opv to replace the MCV. And perhaps the Visby to replace the Fearless patrol vessels.</div>

The only sensible one is Azhar. As for the Aster 15, I think that the purchase is almost a certainty. As for Aster 30, it would depend on the radar fitted on the frigates. If a 3D long range phased array radar is fixed like ARPAR is fixed then it would be a possibility. As for exocet, I suspect that it is just a cover name for something more interesting. Sea launched storm shadow? For a simple reason that RSN will not want to introduce an inferior missile to the harpoon on a new ship.</div>

Its waterjet propulsion system provides excellent shallow water capacity and high maneuverability.<br><br>Depending on the selection of different propulsion specifications, the 27m Stealth High Speed Interceptor is capable of speeds in excess of 35 knots. It's basic configuration is two units of high speed diesel engines and two waterjets.<br><br></div>

Designed for excellent performance including speed, fuel economy and sea-keeping capabilities, the 81m Stealth OPV is capable of sustained operation up to sea state 5. Its design includes a platform for landing and take-off operations for a range of helicopters up to 10 tonnes. The vessel is capable of speeds ranging from 23 to 30 knots depending on the propulsion configuration.<br><br>Besides low observable features incorporated in the stealth OPV, the vessel is also fitted with self-defence capabilities for enhanced survivability. Vital areas of the ship such as the major shipboard, navigation, communication and combat systems may also be hardened to withstand a certain degree of shock due to underwater explosions. Mechanical and electrical systems are arranged such that there is sufficient redundancy.<br><br>The stealth OPV is designed with a high degree of automation for low manning, including a ship control, monitoring and management system (SCMMS). The design also allows for unmanned engine room operations.<br><br>The vessel can be fitted with different combat systems for a range of capabilities from coastguard functions to protection against various threats including Anti-surface warfare (AsuW), anti-submarine warfare (ASW) as well as anti air-warfare (AAW).<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i guess reason y RSN actually drop the idea of visby corvette is because of the fact that military officials wants singapore armed force to be a expeditionary force to fulfil this "expeditionary" stuff a larger ocean going ship is needed.<br><br>During the contender bidding<br>big name such as ingall a northrop grumman company is involve but the reason y DCNI won of course 1st is the price tag and secondly during that time la fayette frigate is the only combatant ship to have earn its reputation for being the 1st true stealth warship(dont start on sea shadow it is only an experimental ship)<br>.<br>Speaking about aster 15 missile it is confirmed and the probablility of integrating aster 30 virtually zero,since all of u guys here know that aster 30 is a ballistic missile defense shield for the european<br>countries(i m referring to the present). <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>I thru storm shadow is still in development....can anyone update me on storn shadow sea launch version.thanks <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

Sjoormen class effectiveness<br><br>Even though the challenger class subs are old, they still serve a rather useful purpose and no one knew about the details and extent of the refit program the subs have undergone. It may not be a mismatch as far as you think <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Recently a RSN sub had an exercise with a CVBG in the south china sea. The exercise aims include to allow the USN experience in hunting SSK. For 3 days, the whole ASW array of the CVBG was employed within the defined exercise area and yet the SSK could not be found. The SSK however penetrated the defence and was judged to have sunk the carrier.<br><br>2. Visby<br><br>It could be that the singapore - swedish program was actually to design a MCV replacement. It is plausible as the current known ORBAT has 12 missile craft. It is only logical that when the frigate program is completed, the time would ha ve come to consider the MCV replacements as the MCV would have been 20 years old already<br><br>3. NGFS and Frigate fit<br><br>I question the authenticity of the ADJ article. It is a malaysian publication and there is a distinct slant in their coverage towards the RMAF. Regarding the exocet mk2 fit, I am curious if true about the choice. It will make better sense from a logistical point of view to adopt a harpoon variant. The capabilities of the harpoon variants are not neccessarily inferior to the exocet. I am hoping for a minimum 100mm calibre on the frigate. Logistically it might make sense to adopt a common gun mount but then for the sake of improve capability, the logistic difficulties should be tolerated.<br><br></div>

Such series of exercises are known as PASSEX or passage exercises and are not announced publicly. I believe many of you would have known people in service and you can validate the existence of such exercises with them. If you are aquainted with any submariner, do ask them.<br>I do not think there is a security breach by me saying the result. Please advice me if you think this result breach milsec.</div>
