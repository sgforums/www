              <p>wah, I am very surprised that this year's election, BN has lost so lost so much seat to the united opposition.<br>Good to hear that Kelantan remains in PAS. Even Perak, Kedah and Selangor together with capital city all won by Opposition for the first time. Look at the map pls..</p>
              <p>But Penang which the Gerakan has ruled it pretty well in the past is won by DAP.<br>I am not mentally against this but feel quite pity for Dr Koh Tsu Kun. He is a doer, not talker and has done so much for the people. Can't they give some face to him in his final battle. haiz... I really hope the DAP and BN should give him some kind of formal recognition when he step down. This is also for DAP to show their generosity in front of people.</p>
              <p>I think if I have a choice, I'd rather Johore won by the opposition. Look at the public order, so many robbers snatching around in the city area during day time. For the pirated CD there, I can close one eye coz students need it. Look at the queueing crowd at malaysia custom, I have to spent so much time to sweat and breath the exhausts. But to make it happen is very difficult, don't know why it is always the souther it is, the stronger the ruling party. Look at the PAP, wow. never lose before. Look at the north 5 states, totaly different. Maybe singapore fengshui is good. hehe.</p>
              <p>Singapore on one hand need to be more careful coz Umno may again create tension between the 2 countries in order to win back the support from malaysian like what mahathir has done. Frankly speaking, I still believe Abdullah to be a good person, but he is just too soft. Not only that, his extremist son in law khairul and this hishamudin really has some responsibilities to bear that caused this politics tsunami. If I were him, I will force them to quit politics and quietly earn money. It is a complicated mixed feeling that I have especially when seeing a singapore-friendly PM suffer such loss. Najib if still has that kind of Keris mentality in 1987, will really make things bad if he become next PM. Singapore may not like to see the new economy policy to be dropped, but if racial issues happen, it will definitely affect singapore sooner or later.</p>

              <p>That time when Dr Koh's class mate and good friend Anwar Ibrahim sacked by Mahathir, he should have made a decision already.<br>Anyway, from the first day that he joined politics, he should expect for the worst because it is "Malaysia politics", enough saying. If I were him, I won't feel that sad if I lose a seat for any reason like health, technical error or politics inside party, national/central government issue. But if the people that I have care about so much vote against me, really ...</p>
              <p>I think Singapore better be quick in finalizing major decisions and talks with Malaysia before the next Mahathir step up.</p>

              <p><span>KUALA LUMPUR - Malaysia's ruling coalition on Saturday suffered its biggest electoral upset ever, losing control of four state governments and failing to win the crucial two-thirds majority in parliament. <br><br>It is Barisan Nasional (BN)'s worst performance in a general election since independence in 1957. <br><br><span style="color: #ff0000;">Prime Minister Abdullah Badawi's multi-racial coalition won 139 out of 220 seats counted for the 222-seat Parliament, state television reported. Even if the BN wins the remaining two seats, it would fall short of the 148 seats needed for a two-thirds majority. <br></span><br>The opposition alliance of the Democratic Action Party (DAP), the Parti Keadilan Rakyat (PKR) and the Islamic Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS), won 81 seats. In the outgoing parliament, the opposition had 19 seats. <br><br>The only other time the 14-party BN coalition failed to win a two-thirds majority was in 1969 when it secured 66% of the seats. This time, it would have only 63.5% if it wins the remaining two seats. <br><br>A two-thirds majority is needed to amend the Constitution. The last time the BN lost that majority was in the 1969 election. <br><br>In the 2004 elections, BN had a landslide victory when they clinched 199 of the 219 seats. <br><br>Adding to the BN's woes this time, the coalition lost control of four states - Kedah, Penang, Perak and Selangor, while PAS secured two-thirds majority to keep its hold on Kelantan. <br><br>Indicative of the scale of the debacle, three of BN's component parties - the MCA, Gerakan and MIC - were almost routed. MIC president S. Samy Vellu, Gerakan acting president Koh Tsu Koon and PPP president M. Kayveas were trounced. <br><br>PM Abdullah, who is also the BN chairman, retained his Kepala Batas parliamentary seat in Penang while his deputy Najib Tun Razak won with a huge margin in Pekan in Pahang. <br><br>Asked whether the election results showed the people had lost confidence in his leadership, Mr Abdullah said: " No...this is the people's stand to show their stand not to give us a two-thirds majority." <br><br>On the defeat of several of his Cabinet ministers, the prime minister said defeats are normal. <br><br>Besides Samy Vellu, who is also Works Minister, Shahrizat Abdul Jalil, Zainuddin Maidin and Abdul Aziz Shamsuddin were also defeated in the elections. <br><br>Mr Abdullah also denied talk that he would step down as prime minister. <br><br>"I don't know who is being pressured (to step down) I'm not resigning," he told a press conference at the BN operations centre at the Putra World Trade Centre. <br><br>Mr Abdullah, who has been prime minister since November 2003, said he would have an audience with the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, Tuanku Mizan Zainal Abidin, on Monday on the formation of the new government. <br><br>Saturday's poll, called before it was due in May 2009, was widely seen as a referendum on PM Abdullah's rule, and Malaysians took the opportunity to administer a stinging rebuke over price rises, religious disputes and concerns over corruption. <br><br>Chinese and Indians account for a third of the population of 26 million and many complain the government discriminates in favour of Malays when it comes to education, jobs, financial assistance and religious policy. <br><br>About 70 percent of Malaysia's 10.9 million eligible voters had cast ballots, the country's top poll official said. - CNA/ir</span></p>

              <p>The PAP government is more than happy to sit back and watch while investor climate( in Malaysia)is worsened by such rabid talk in Malaysia and it stirs nationalistic passion in Singapore which favours the incumbent government. So more votes for the PAP. They are happily smiling away whenever Dr M makes another whine. How much more stupid can it get? Malaysia is losing money to Thailand, Indonesia, Vietnam, etc fast and unless she does something major to revamp the economy, these latter countries will steamroll past Malaysia. These latter countries are less confused with respect to economic directives relatively speaking.</p>

              <p>hmmm..it is inherent in the entire political system so much so that it has become a way of life in the civil service, economy and politics. I really wonder if money politics will just simply disappear with the newly elected opposition candidates. You`d think they would not want a share of the goods? It enriches them and that in turns give them more clout to canvass for more votes via freebies and other incentives.</p>

              <p>It also took a long time for the chaos to settle down. A century or more of war and violence. Malaysia cannot afford to waste that amount of time getting its act together while the world moves past by her. Vietnam, for example, is growing at around 7%-8% in the past few years and swallowing new investments like no other. And you are not even talking about China or India.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately for Malaysia, they are stuck in the same economic playing field now occupied by these countries. Unless she moves up the value chain, economy-wise, she will suffer big time as these economies with cheaper labour and dare i say, more hadworking people, gobble up investments and money.</p>
              <p>But moving up the value chain will cause a lot of economic and social unrest. People will have to be educated and moved out of thier current jobs. People will lose jobs. And people will be unhappy. Are any of the political parties willing to suffer the lost of voter support? The opposition wants to cling on to its wins and get more in the future. Bn wants to recover its losses. The economy will no longer be that important. Getting the people`s support will be important. That would mean populist polices which make people happy.That would also probably mean that political parties would eschew grim, unpopular but critical policies which are important for Malaysia`s competitiveness in the future.</p>

                  At least they not happy can still protest n take on the FRU, equivalent to Spore SOC. I think the election result in Malaysia should serve as a warning to other ASEAN nation that no party can hold on to office all the time.

              <p>i disagree pearlie 27,</p>
              <p>i think malaysia election process is definitely more `open'. it has its flaws but from the overall electoral process to the people exercising their vote without fear, they definitely score 1 better than singapore, imo.</p>
              <p>i can recall politics of fear being used explicitly in singapore by the ruling party when PAP was canvassing for votes, like how your estates will be left behind if PAP is not voted in your area because upgrading will be last to come, your property value will drop, etc., etc. </p>
              <p>`more democratic' is open to vast interpretation. however, in malaysia, politics has cross to another level, imo. ruling parties cannot take things for granted anymore. oppositions which captured states now has a platform to demonstrate its alternative ideas to gevernance and if it works, they will grow from there. the malaysian people also realize that they now are more aware that they do have the power in them to push a point across. there is no fear of political repraisal from anyone, or at least they show no fear of it. they just have to live with the decision till the next election. if the opposition did not capitalize on this with a show of political competency and effectiveness, then they will know they just blew this fantastic opportunity given to them.</p>
              <p>in singapore, the overall political make-up is so different. the jaggernaut that is PAP and the political sterilization of its people meant that singapore will still `languish' (sorry, i didn't have a good word for this).   </p>

              <p>i agree in part with what you wrote. dangling carrots is common anywhere.</p>
              <p>on the minority threat, in malaysia, the chinese knows that that have a credible opposition in DAP. so, the chinese do have an alternative card to play, if they choose to.</p>
              <p>as for the indians, the revolt that happened overnight and the government's bad handling proved to be their undoing.</p>
