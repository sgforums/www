              <p>Time : 00.35hr - Malaysian Opposition take control of Penang, Kedah, and retain Kelentan.</p>
              <p>Unoffical report from Malaysiakini  also state that Selangor has also fallen to Opposition Party.</p>
              <p>Four long standing Malaysian Ministers, and one BN Chief Minister {Penang} lost in their constituencies- the Malaysian electorates have shown courage to dare to exercise their electoral rights, and give themselves the opportunity to seek political change.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans will need to learn from the courage of others in facing common political future with confidence and trust in citizens who are willing to offer themselves to serve the Nation.</p>
              <p>Complacency has indeed set in - as mentioned by MM LKY in the embarrassing jail break by the supposed JI Chief.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, MM LKY will not criticize his own Political Team about the political complacency towards Singaporeans- which resulted in the economic state of affairs suffered by Singaporeans since LHL took over the PM position.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans need to have more confidence in ourselves, as the success of Singapore today was achieved by past generations of Singapore Citizens - not the Politicians from the Ruling Party.</p>

              Malaysia got 2 kinds of seats, the State and the Parliament. Parliament is for central govt while state forms the local govt.
              <br><br>
              Singapore I believe follows the same model, which explains the large amount of ministers in this state

              <p>The good thing about all this is that the BN(still in power) would have to take the opposition seriously now and show proof thier desire to tend to the very concerns of Malaysians which have caused this near rout.</p>
              <p>The bad and worst thing is that the Malaysian political scene is in a complete mess. Bn has lost key states which are critical to its economy and not to mention important sources of income for the coalition. BN`s efforts to push Malaysia forward economically has taken a hit. The opposition, meanwhile, is not a BN. They are only united in thier desire to kick out BN. DAP does`nt trust PAS. PAS doesn`t trust the DAP.  Keadilan is the weak bridge between the two. If you leave DAP and PAS by themselves, it will end in a shooting war between non-malay intellectuals and technocrats and ultra conservative Islamists. Expect policies to get delayed and torn apart at the parliamentary and state level as pork-barrel politics come into play. Each side will simply blame the other side.</p>
              <p>As far as leaders go, Malaysia will be in a worst state than ever before. Badawi would most likely resign. Ironically, he is the best BN has got now. His successor Najib is aristocratic and overtly haughty. He nearly lost his seat two elections ago in his capacity as DPM. It will force the party to look internally for new leaders. But the current crop of new leaders are new, divisive, untested and do not seem to be very capable. BN has made the fatal error of allowing too many ministers warm thier seats for far too long without making a decent effort to cultivate new talent. UMNO might just as well fall back to extreme race-based themes and policies to retake the lost malay ground. In effect, BN could end up with extreme rightist leaders who champion malay rights and little knowledge as per running the country well.</p>
              <p>Malaysia is worst off in the short run. However, it is hard to say how it will look in the longer term. Internationally, Malaysia will probably become more insular in the next couple of years as rival political parties fight for every inch of ground. Policies will most likely be more populist in nature and will not really be helpful for Malaysia.</p>
              <p>In about 4 years time, the people will get tired with the political infighting from all sides and little work done in reality. They will vote in the BN once again because there was at least some decent progress made when they were ruling the states concerned.</p>
              <p>My two cents.</p>

              <p>I do not want to disagree with you , however i have to admit in certain truth to your assumptions that fractures will appear. PKR has to reign in DAP and PAS as a united front , irregardless of race and religion. However , that asside ,  we will continually work with BN and push for progress and better lives for the people. We will stop BN from ammendants of further NEP related policies in the laws. We will wish to  repeal the law. But it is a process that will not be an easy task.</p>
              <p>I would love to rebutt some of your assumptions however i cant reveal the nature of the contents. Let time work its way. And for a strong opposition coalition to survive and continue to push through , it will be co-operation no own selfishness. As we have seen in history , the people has the last say.</p>

              <p>oppositions will build on this, if they can demonstrate that they are level headed, competent and can behave differently than BN. if anwar is accepted as the opposition leader, he can galvanize the opposition and provide some insights into the running of the states. he has deep experience in running the country afterall.</p>
              <p>however, if the opposition lose sight of this opportunity and `enrich' themselves because of this upperhand, they will suffer the in the next election.</p>
              <p>malaysia is in a precarious position now. but if it shows political maturity as a nation, i don't see how this can detrimant the country in the long run. politics of fear needn't rule the country becos the opposition has a bigger stake in the say now. oppositions are malaysian too. they want to see malaysia progress. a progressive malaysia in the next 4-5 years will only strengthen their resolve and prove that not only BN knows how to run a country.</p>
              <p>my take is, malaysia has grown up.</p>
