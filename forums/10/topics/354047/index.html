              <p>Melbourne has retained its position as the best city in the world to call home. <br><br>Often derided as Bleak City by Sydneysiders, Melbourne topped a survey of 130 cities, narrowly beating out the other four Australian capitals surveyed - because its weather rated the best. <br><br>Sydney lost ground because its crime rate was rated on a par with New York and London. <br>1= Melbourne<br>1= Vancouver<br>1= Vienna<br>4 Perth<br>5 Geneva<br>6= Adelaide<br>6= Brisbane<br>6= Copenhagen<br>6= Montreal<br>6= Oslo<br>6= Sydney<br>6= Zurich<br>13= Helsinki<br>13= Stockholm<br>13= Toronto<br><br>Others:<br>19= Auckland<br>19= Honolulu<br>28= Paris<br>45= London<br>51= Dublin<br>51= New York<br>57= Washington<br>64= Athens<br>75= Beijing<br>130 Port Moresby<br><br><br><br>The Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) survey ranked Melbourne, Vancouver and Vienna as the best cities for expatriates to live, with Perth fourth and Adelaide, Brisbane and Sydney equal sixth. <br><br>Geneva was ranked fifth, while Papua New Guinea's capital Port Moresby kept the title it took in the last survey in October 2002 as the worst. <br><br>"Melbourne pretty much top scored in everything," said survey co-editor Jon Copestake. <br><br>"But the difference between all the Australian cities is minimal. One thing Sydney had different to the other cities was a higher crime rate, and its climate. Its level of humidity was worse than Melbourne's." <br><br>Victorian Tourism Minister John Pandazopoulos said the award was based on a survey of a city's infrastructure, access, education levels, crime rate, focus on the environment, culture and events, its diversity and how connected it was with the rest of the world. <br><br>Mr Pandazopoulos said even Melbourne's weather rated better than Sydney's. <br><br>"It's a brilliant pat on the back for Melbourne, particularly for two years in a row," he said. <br><br>"We already promote ourselves as the world's most liveable city, we can continue doing that." <br><br>Mr Pandazopoulos said the award backed Victoria's record as the only Australian state in which international visitor rates grew for the past two years. <br><br>He said Melbourne was also a very affordable city, where people got value for money for great products, including top fashion and restaurants. <br><br>He said the government would continue to work hard to meet the balance of stimulating a vibrant economy and social standards to ensure Melbourne remained one of the world's best cities. <br><br>The London-based EIU assessed the level of hardship for expatriates in the 130 cities, using 12 factors including housing, education, recreational activities, health, climate and terrorism. <br><br>Cities were rated one to five in the 12 categories, with one meaning there was no hardship and five indicating extreme hardship. <br><br>Melbourne received the perfect one in each category, including its unpredictable weather, to give it an overall score of one. <br><br>The other Australian cities were all given a two for climate, while Adelaide also received two for housing, Brisbane and Perth scored two for transport and Sydney for its crime. Port Moresby received five for crime and an overall score of 80. <br><br><br>While Perth was given an overall mark of 1.1, Adelaide, Brisbane and Sydney scored 1.2. <br><br>The heightened terrorist threat only had a minimal impact on western cities, even those in the United States, largely because of newly developed security measures. <br><br>The highest ranked US city was Honolulu in 19th on eight points, while New York was 51st with 16 and Washington was the lowest of 16 American cities in the survey at 57th, mainly due to a higher risk of terrorism giving it an overall score of 19. <br><br>London was equal 45th, along with Los Angeles, Madrid and San Francisco. <br><br>Kuwait fell the most places, dropping from 87 to 97 because of the war in neighbouring Iraq, while Harare suffered the greatest actual drop in living standards as a result of ongoing unrest and slid eight places to 118. <br><br>The Iraqi capital Baghdad was not included in the survey. <br><br>- AAP</p>

              <p>Liveability ranking<br>Urban idylls<br><br>Apr 28th 2008<br>From Economist.com<br>Vancouver remains the most liveable city; Harare is still intolerable<br><br><br>With a rating of almost 100, Vancouver is the world's most liveable city according to the Economist Intelligence Unit’s latest liveability ranking (see full report). The city, which will host the Winter Olympics in 2010, achieves the best possible score for all indicators, with the exception of prevalence of petty crime. Canada and Australia perform strongly because they benefit from good infrastructure, plenty of recreational activities and relatively low population density. The threat of violence and instability puts half of the ten lowest scores in Africa, and continuing strife in Zimbabwe keeps Harare in last position.</p>

              <p>The Economist Intelligence Unit’s liveability rating quantifies the challenges that might be presented to an individual's lifestyle in 140 cities worldwide. Each city is assigned a score for over 30 qualitative and quantitative factors across five broad categories: stability, health care, culture and environment, education, and infrastructure. The categories are compiled and weighted to provide an overall rating of 1–100, where 1 is considered intolerable and 100 is considered ideal.</p>

              Vancouver and Vienna as the best cities for expatriates to live,
              with Perth fourth and Adelaide, Brisbane and Sydney equal
              sixth. <br> <br> Geneva was ranked fifth, while Papua New Guinea's capital Port
              Moresby kept the title it took in the last survey in October 2002
              as the worst. <br> <br> "Melbourne pretty much top scored in everything," said survey
              co-editor Jon Copestake. <br> <br> "But the difference between all the Australian cities is minimal.
              One thing Sydney had different to the other cities was a higher
              crime rate, and its climate. Its level of humidity was worse than
              Melbourne's." <br> <br> Victorian Tourism Minister John Pandazopoulos said the award was
              based on a survey of a city's infrastructure, access, education
              levels, crime rate, focus on the environment, culture and events,
              its diversity and how connected it was with the rest of the
              world. <br> <br> Mr Pandazopoulos said even Melbourne's weather rated better than
              Sydney's. <br> <br> "It's a brilliant pat on the back for Melbourne, particularly for
              two years in a row," he said. <br> <br> "We already promote ourselves as the world's most liveable city, we
              can continue doing that." <br> <br> Mr Pandazopoulos said the award backed Victoria's record as the
              only Australian state in which international visitor rates grew for
              the past two years. <br> <br> He said Melbourne was also a very affordable city, where people got
              value for money for great products, including top fashion and
              restaurants. <br> <br> He said the government would continue to work hard to meet the
              balance of stimulating a vibrant economy and social standards to
              ensure Melbourne remained one of the world's best
              cities. <br> <br> The London-based EIU assessed the level of hardship for expatriates
              in the 130 cities, using 12 factors including housing, education,
              recreational activities, health, climate and terrorism. <br> <br> Cities were rated one to five in the 12 categories, with one
              meaning there was no hardship and five indicating extreme
              hardship. <br> <br> Melbourne received the perfect one in each category, including its
              unpredictable weather, to give it an overall score of
              one. <br> <br> The other Australian cities were all given a two for climate, while
              Adelaide also received two for housing, Brisbane and Perth scored
              two for transport and Sydney for its crime. Port Moresby received
              five for crime and an overall score of 80. <br> <br> <br> While Perth was given an overall mark of 1.1, Adelaide, Brisbane
              and Sydney scored 1.2. <br> <br> The heightened terrorist threat only had a minimal impact on
              western cities, even those in the United States, largely because of
              newly developed security measures. <br> <br> The highest ranked US city was Honolulu in 19th on eight points,
              while New York was 51st with 16 and Washington was the lowest of 16
              American cities in the survey at 57th, mainly due to a higher risk
              of terrorism giving it an overall score of 19. <br> <br> London was equal 45th, along with Los Angeles, Madrid and San
              Francisco. <br> <br> Kuwait fell the most places, dropping from 87 to 97 because of the
              war in neighbouring Iraq, while Harare suffered the greatest actual
              drop in living standards as a result of ongoing unrest and slid
              eight places to 118. <br> <br> The Iraqi capital Baghdad was not included in the
              survey. <br> <br> - AAP</p>

              <p><em><strong>With
              <span style="color: #ff0000;">low crime</span>, little threat from instability or terrorism and a highly
              developed transport and communications infrastructure, Canada and
              Australia are home to the most liveable destinations in the world. Four
              of the ten most liveable cities surveyed by the Economist Intelligence
              Unit are in Australia, and two of the top five are Canadian (see full
              report). Vancouver is the most attractive destination, with a
              liveability index of just 1.3% (see table).''</strong></em></p>

              <p>i can figure out how a city 10 times of crime rate as Singapore</p>
              <p>can be the most livable.</p>
              <p>May be i cant appreciate other factors,like freedom to shot,</p>
              <p>freedom to possessa gun legally,or illegally etc etc</p>
              <p>u can see many SG people interested in Oz crime rates.</p>

              <p>Melbourne has retained its position as the best city in the
                  world to call home. <br> <br> Often derided as Bleak City by Sydneysiders, Melbourne topped a
                  survey of 130 cities, narrowly beating out the other four
                  Australian capitals surveyed - because its weather rated the
                  best. <br> <br> Sydney lost ground because its crime rate was rated on a par with
                  New York and London. <br> 1= Melbourne<br> 1= Vancouver<br> 1= Vienna<br> 4 Perth<br> 5 Geneva<br> 6= Adelaide<br> 6= Brisbane<br> 6= Copenhagen<br> 6= Montreal<br> 6= Oslo<br> 6= Sydney<br> 6= Zurich<br> 13= Helsinki<br> 13= Stockholm<br> 13= Toronto<br> <br> ...................................<br> <br> Mr Pandazopoulos said the award backed Victoria's record as the
                  only Australian state in which international visitor rates grew for
                  the past two years. <br> <br> He said Melbourne was also a very affordable city, where people got
                  value for money for great products, including top fashion and
                  restaurants. <br> <br> He said the government would continue to work hard to meet the
                  balance of stimulating a vibrant economy and social standards to
                  ensure Melbourne remained one of the world's best
                  cities. <br> <br> <span style="color: #ff0000;">The London-based EIU assessed the level of hardship for expatriates
                  in the 130 cities, using 12 factors including housing, education,
                  recreational activities, health, climate and terrorism. </span><br> <br> Cities were rated one to five in the 12 categories, with one
                  meaning there was no hardship and five indicating extreme
                  hardship. <br> <br> Melbourne received the perfect one in each category, including its
                  unpredictable weather, to give it an overall score of
                  one. <br> <br> ............................<br> <br> - AAP</p>

              <p>i can figure out how a city 10 times of crime rate as

              <p>can be the most livable.</p>
              <p>May be i cant appreciate other factors,like freedom to shot,</p>
              <p>freedom to possessa gun legally,or illegally etc etc</p>
              <p>u can see many SG people interested in Oz crime rates.</p>
