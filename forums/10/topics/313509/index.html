              <p>"The Clintons last made their returns public in 2000 when they reported an adjusted gross income of $416,039 for 1999. Since then, the former president has embarked on a number of business ventures and has made millions from speaking engagements and books.</p>
              <p>In the tax returns, the former president describes his occupation as "Speaking &amp; Writing."</p>
              <p>Beside speeches and books, his biggest single business income is from his partnership with Yucaipa Global Opportunities Fund, a Los Angeles-based investment firm founded by longtime Clinton fundraiser Ron Burkle. Between 2003 and 2006, the returns show total Yucaipa partnership income of $12.5 million. The 2007 summary provided by the campaign lists $2.75 million in partnership income.</p>
              <p>....</p>
              <p>According to a summary of the seven years provided by the campaign, the former president's speech income since he left the White House totals $51.85 million and his income from his two books — "My Life " and "Giving" — totals $29.6 million, including a $15 million advance for "My Life."</p>
              <p>.....</p>
              <p>The campaign has said Clinton typically donates millions of dollars worth of free speeches to charities...."</p>

              <p>They just donated US$10 m.Why so many people paid so high price tickets</p>
              <p>attending Clinton speech?</p>
              <p>''In the past eight years, Bill and <a href="http://projects.washingtonpost.com/congress/members/c001041/">Hillary Clinton</a> earned a combined $109 million, with the former president collecting
              nearly half of that money as a speaker hired at times by companies that
              have been among his wife's most generous political supporters''</p>
              <blockquote>The considerable crossover between the couple's decades of political
              fundraising and their personal profit also extended at times to the
              former president's charity work and his presidential library, though
              many records related to those remain secret. What is clear is that
              numerous financial patrons -- individuals as well as large corporations
              -- repeatedly emerge in the Clintons' circle.</blockquote>

              <p>my cynical self tells me that whenever fortune or forbes magazine publishes its annual richest man list, LKY will just sit in his OSIM massage chair relaxing, sipping the singapore sling and smile, thinking aloud, "you guys don't know what you are talking about."</p>

              <p>yeah.. he's more into power than money la. power brings in money anyway.</p>
              <p>he'll die knowing that 30 years from now. there will always be that fear and dread that he will return from the dead when his name is whispered aloud..</p>
              <p>haha kinda reminds me of the isrealites of the bible, when LKY said that he would return from the dead if SG ever gets into trouble or smth.</p>
