            <div class='col-md body'>PM Lee chides the Opposition<br>Low and Chia reproached by Mr Lee for trying to 'score political points'<br><br>Tor Ching Li<br>chingli@newstoday.com.sg<br><br>PRIME Minister and Finance Minister Lee Hsien Loong turned up the heat on the Opposition yesterday. Not only did he criticise the Workers' Party (WP) "time bombs" and manifesto in his round-up speech, Mr Lee also rebuked both WP chief Low Thia Khiang and Non-Constituency MP Steve Chia.<br>.<br>The former was chided for his "selective memory" and sole interest in "scoring political points", and the latter was portrayed as a bank raider for his suggestions for tax cuts and fee waivers.<br>.<br>Responding to Mr Low's question as to why the Government could incur a spending deficit of $2.9 billion while the WP's suggestion for increased education and healthcare expenditure was labelled "fiscally irresponsible", Mr Lee said the problem lay in the call for "an unconditional needs-based welfare safety net" in the WP's manifesto.<br>.<br>"In contrast, this Government lives within its means, without neglecting its obligations to lower income Singaporeans," he said.<br>.<br>While explaining that the Government's capital receipts from the statutory boards were sufficient to fund the $2.6 billion Progress Package without drawing on past reserves or burdening taxpayers, he went on to say: "(Mr Chia) wants to raid the bank Â— he proposed cutting all sorts of taxes and fees and (wants to) just declare that Christmas has arrived."<br>.<br>Mr Lee also pointed out that Mr Low chose to forget the $7.8 billion worth of assistance measures doled out by the Government since 2001. Instead, he said, Mr Low had accused the Government of raising the GST after the last elections.<br>.<br>"But before we raised the GST, we had also provided $2.7 billion worth of Economic Restructuring Shares to help Singaporeans cope," Mr Lee said. Visibly irked, he then launched into a scathing dose of Latin: "Mr Low has, to say in Latin, suppressio veri suggestio falsi Â— suppressed the truth while suggesting what is false!"<br>.<br>Pointing out that Mr Low had nothing constructive to say about the Progress Package Â— unlike Potong Pasir MP Chiam See Tong Â— Mr Lee said this "shows he is not really interested in whether Singaporeans are getting the help they need, only in scoring political points".<br>.<br>"Why make a speech to score political points?" he asked Mr Low. "There will be an opportunity to do so before the next General Elections."<br>.<br>But both Mr Low and Mr Chia persisted with their concerns during clarification time. Mr Chia asked which chapter or clause in the Constitution states that land sales go into the reserves and not the budget position. Mr Low questioned the Government's "ad hoc" help only in times of Budget surpluses Â— before being put down by Deputy Prime Minister and Leader of the House Wong Kan Seng for a "clarification" that seemed more like a speech.<br>.<br>In response to Mr Chia, Mr Lee pointed to a White Paper that states land sales are to be locked up as past reserves and cannot be touched. Still, Mr Chia told Today there was a lack of transparency where national reserves were concerned.<br>.<br>"I did not say money should be given out freely. I'm trying to say that if there is a lot of money then the spending on the people should reflect it," he said.<br>.<br>More than just 2 days<br>.<br>Deputy Prime Minister Wong Kan Seng yesterday revealed to the House that the Electoral Boundaries Review Committee had completed its report.<br>.<br>It is now with the Prime Minister, and a copy would be sent to the MPs within the week.<br>.<br>The report would map out the wards and the number of MPs for each constituency and reveal if any constituencies are absorbed into others or if any new ones are formed. It is usually released just before the polls are called.<br>.<br>Non-Constituency MP Steve Chia, who is the Secretary-General of the National Solidarity Party, wanted to know how long the campaigning period for the coming General Election will be, and if there would be "at least three months" between the release of the boundaries report and the dissolution of Parliament Â— which precedes the issuance of the writ of election.<br>.<br>In response, Mr Wong said: "I am very certain what was experienced in 2001, where there were only two days between the publication of the electoral boundary report and the dissolution of Parliament, will not happen this time.<br>.<br>"But if the Prime Minister decides and when he decides to have the election and dissolve Parliament, I think all of us will know of it."<br>Low and Chia reproached by Mr Lee for trying to 'score political points'<br><br>Tor Ching Li<br>chingli@newstoday.com.sg<br><br></div>
