              <p>you know,i went for an interview as an eligible job applicant for the SAF contractor servicing singapore army tanks in australia.</p>
              <p>in less than 1 or 2 minutes after flipping my file of 10 certs he told me he wont even consider me as a trainee to service the singapore army tanks in australia even though im allowed to work for them.his reason was he doesnt want to train me up even though he advertised the job decription as a trainee position for servicing SAF tanks and vehicles in australia.</p>
              <p>so the white guy who interviewed me and rejected me as soon as i stepped into the interview room was placed in position and paid a salary by who?the spore gov naturally!he even told me off  to go back to spore because he thinks spore will pay me same salary as him  of minimum of $120,000/year salary for sitting around and looking at wasted spore army tanks in australia.</p>
              <p>this makes me think spore gov might say one thing but cant cash out on its promises on looking after sporeans in spore and outa spore!im beginnin to lose faith in spore.pretty soon i wont be sporean from looks of it all.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Let's see - males get to serve national service, you get to contribute to CPF whose value will have eroded to the point of being worthless by the time you retire, you get priority in being overlooked in place of cheaper foreigners in the workforce who do not exactly have the financial commitments Singaporeans need to contend with, just to name a few.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Above all else, you are even strongly encouraged to put up with the unreasonable ways of foreigners just so you can better integrate to their way of life for the sake of a more harmonious social environment that doesn't spark off social unrest and cause problems for the fascists who are incidentally paid lottery-winning salaries at the expense of Singaporeans.</span>   </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Above and beyond that, you have the honour of living in a "democracy" where your leaders threaten to send tanks in to put things right in the event of freak election results just so they can perpetuate a fascist dynasty.</span> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Is there any distinct advantage being a Singaporean over a PR or FT ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What or where is the value of our Singaporean Citizenship?</p>

              <p>WOW so simple you also do not know.</p>
              <p>1) singaporean - first to serve NS to protect FT !!!</p>
              <p>2) singaporean - first to fire when economy bad !!!</p>
              <p>3) singaporean - first to die when no money !!!</p>
              <p>4) singaporean  - first to blame for not voting for PAP !!!</p>

              <p>Sorry loh, but how many of us can spare that 5 - 10 years to wait for them to repair the damage they caused? Besides, in 5 - 10 years time, the damage will be far greater than what it is now.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Many of us were already pinning hopes on the recent elections for change and it has left us with a bitter taste in our mouths.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Life is too short for any rational person in the right mind to continue to slog on here and pray for an absolution which would never come.</p>
