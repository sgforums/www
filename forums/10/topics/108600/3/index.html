It's the fact that I actually agree with it somewhat.<br><br>Statistics have shown that Malays are generally the most under-performing race in Singapore when it comes to studies. Only about 60% of Malays who take the GCE O Levels actually get five subjects passed, for instance.<br><br>In the recent headlines, I read that the Malays were making achievements with regards to their studies. Achievements? What achievements?<br><br>Yeah, sure, more Malays are passing their PSLE. But if that's considered an achievement, then I feel really sad for us Malays. Sure, it's an improvement, but it's nothing to shout about. The other races are gunning for distinctions.... while the Malays are gunning for passes.<br><br>I have also noticed the phenomenon of dwindling number of Malays as I progressed higher up the educational ladder...... There were twelve Malays in my Pri 6 class... four in my Sec 1 class. By the time I got to Sec 3, I was the only Mat in my class.<br><br>Ironically, I'm one of several Mats in my NUS tutorial group.... that's why I don't fully agree with your statement.<br><br>By the way, in case any of you didn't read the previous posts and are thinking of flaming me for being racist to the Malays, think again. I'm Malay. You can ask those who were at the sgforums BBQ if you think I'm pulling your legs.<br><br>Sure, I'm being extremely harsh on my own race..... but the way I see it, we Malays deserve it.<br><br></div></blockquote>that;s true. though i'm not malay, i'm happy for our fellow malay counterparts who made it good.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>cheers to you fudgester!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm Chinese and have been in Perth for 2 1/2 years. I don't have much Singaporean friends there as I went there by myself. I met some Asians and they complained that the local Anglo-australians have racist attitudes towards them.<br><br>Personally, I have no experienced anything like that yet. When my tutors give me a crap mark it's because I truly deserve it and not because i'm yellow. I make it a point to not put everything down to racial discrimination. I think what our parents teach us when we're kids is also extremely important. I had many chinese primary school friends who shunned kids of other races coz' they said their parents did the same thing.<br><br>I am not dating a chinese guy, neither is he anglo australian. So when I tell my friends he's of Indian ethnicity, most of them are pretty cool about it. My close friends are either chinese, malay, indian, or bi-racial. When I was working at an arcade as a teenager, the uncle at the prata stall was very nice to me because I was nice to him. He didn't care that I was Malay or not.<br><br>I really hope we are able to teach our children in future the right attitudes. All prejudices mainly arise from what we learn as kids. The next coloured person is also human, and in situations like the Tsunami, it's when we see that many people get together in the face of adversity. Let's not let that be the only thing that can unite us.</div>
