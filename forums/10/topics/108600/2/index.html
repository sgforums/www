They've been hibernating in the well for too long. I've seen some Malays who hang out more often with the Chinese and picking up the language too.

I just happened to like the girl, that's all. I once had a crush on a Malay girl, in fact.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by theTelepath:<br><strong><br>How many malays do you think can make it to University?</strong><br></blockquote>Do you know what I hate about this statement? It's the fact that I actually agree with it somewhat.<br><br>Statistics have shown that Malays are generally the most under-performing race in Singapore when it comes to studies. Only about 60% of Malays who take the GCE O Levels actually get five subjects passed, for instance.<br><br>In the recent headlines, I read that the Malays were making achievements with regards to their studies. Achievements? What achievements?<br><br>Yeah, sure, more Malays are passing their PSLE. But if that's considered an achievement, then I feel really sad for us Malays. Sure, it's an improvement, but it's nothing to shout about. The other races are gunning for distinctions.... while the Malays are gunning for passes.<br><br>I have also noticed the phenomenon of dwindling number of Malays as I progressed higher up the educational ladder...... There were twelve Malays in my Pri 6 class... four in my Sec 1 class. By the time I got to Sec 3, I was the only Mat in my class.<br><br>Ironically, I'm one of several Mats in my NUS tutorial group.... that's why I don't fully agree with your statement.<br><br>By the way, in case any of you didn't read the previous posts and are thinking of flaming me for being racist to the Malays, think again. I'm Malay. You can ask those who were at the sgforums BBQ if you think I'm pulling your legs.<br><br>Sure, I'm being extremely harsh on my own race..... but the way I see it, we Malays deserve it.<br><br></div>
