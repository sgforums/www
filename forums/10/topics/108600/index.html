            <div class='col-md body'>Yeah I do experience some racial discrimination for being with a non-chinese guy.<br><br>I get weird stares in public (I stare back at them)<br>My relatives think there is something wrong with me not being able to get a chinese guy  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> They even chided my mum for not forcing me to join the SDU  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> Anyway I told my mum to tell them to mind their own biz in a polite way and if they have anything just tell me directly and not behind my back.<br><br>Haha now my brother is under scrutiny by them (same suggestion that he should join the SDU too) because his ex-gf was non-chinese</div>
