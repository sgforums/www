            <div class='col-md body'>i tink i find Malays more friendly and helpful than others. though i am not sayin all lah.  Remember d days when i knocked doors in property agent days and happened to come across a Malay family, the elderly man invited us in to view his flat (he is not selling) and even gave us a glass of water each.  Better than those aunties who shouted across from their kitchen or bathrooms that they r not free or wat........  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think racist will be everywhere around the world.Becoz we cannot forget,this world is still divided by different countries,different races n different religions.So it is very unrealistic to hope that all ppl could "do away" racial discrimination.Even if we all Singaporeans can do it,can we ganrantee that other ppl will do the same?It would be deadly for us to "act" like an angel n the rest of the countries are still "devils",becoz in reality,good ppl always die first!!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i agree with the fact that it's unrealistic to put away all these discrimination. Even SG ppl look down and discriminate ppl who don't dress well, speak well and don't hold credit cards. NOt just races, it's just difference between ppl and how they think.<br><br>I have walked into a shop at Takashimaya in shorts and slippers, but from the way i dressed, no one came to attend to me when i needed assistance to ask for my size. so i approached the sales assistant, she told me all display there, have means have, don't have means don't have. Then another customer in O.L outfit with a LV bag took the same piece and ask her for a bigger size. the sales girl told her she will check it out the store room... KAOZ!!! i walked out and sumpa never return.<br><br>On a seperate occasion, i was working (part-time) at a restaurant and happened to sprained my ankel, so i was limping all the way from the cashier to the kitchen. This guy, early 30s with his wife (wearing causual shorts and slippers) asked if i'm ok, so i said i'd just sprained my ankel but had to work. So they said take care. I felt so sweet to have customers saying such things to me. So i continued to stand at the cashier doing my things when they came to bill, the guy flashed out his Platinum card. I was like  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> .....<br><br>The moral of this incident, discrimination is everywhere.... so long we don't start behaving like the KKK, to the extreme of killing ppl of different religion, race, nationality, we are doing fine. It's some moral education tat we all ought to learn more and accept.</div>
