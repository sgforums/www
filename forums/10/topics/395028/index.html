              <p>LKY in that year said that to DXP (The then chairman / leader of China until 1992 since 1978, or in the 1980s??) :</p>
              <p>When DXP praised LKY for Singapore's major changes and building accomplishment, LKY replied: "Thank you, this is a extremely small country, very easy to manage." DXP had the same feel and sighed: "If I were need to manage, only if the size area is only as big as entire Shanghai will be so good ah!" Thus, LKY was not surprised by his comments, but instead scarsitically said: "The majority of the Singaporeans comes from China Guangdong or Fujian etc Southern province, which their ancestors are illiterate; and farmers without their own plot of land; while those high ranking officers, literate scholars, were all stayed in the central plains to wait for prosper blooming, therefore there is nothing that Singaporeans can do is something impossible for Chinese from China to do it, or having better ideas to do it."</p>
              <p>Upon hearing to LKY's such comments, DXP did not reply, did not rebut and thus the conversation was left sliently in the history. However, DXP did not forget the "challenge" that LKY made previously, which LKY knew what his slience meant.</p>
              <p>In 1992, when DXP travel to the South and visited Singapore, he said that he wanted to learn from Singapore, and to outperform Singapore.</p>

              <p>When DXP praised LKY for Singapore's major changes and building accomplishment, LKY replied: "Thank you, this is a extremely small country, very easy to manage." DXP had the same feel and sighed: "If I were need to manage, only if the size area is only as big as entire Shanghai will be so good ah!" Thus, LKY was not surprised by his comments, but instead scarsitically said: "The majority of the Singaporeans comes from China Guangdong or Fujian etc Southern province, which their ancestors are illiterate; and farmers without their own plot of land; while those high ranking officers, literate scholars, were all stayed in the central plains to wait for prosper blooming, therefore there is nothing that Singaporeans can do is something impossible for Chinese from China to do it, or having better ideas to do it."</p>
              <p>Upon hearing to LKY's such comments, DXP did not reply, did not rebut and thus the conversation was left sliently in the history. However, DXP did not forget the "challenge" that LKY made previously, which LKY knew what his slience meant.</p>
              <p>In 1992, when DXP travel to the South and visited Singapore, he said that he wanted to learn from Singapore, and to outperform Singapore.</p>

              <p>Very subjective. Afterall, most people in Singapore does not buy the idea of communism and this is an expected answer.</p>

              <p>Think again, Speakers Corner full of people kpkb-ing of our government let so much FTs coming in, flooding the whole country. Overpopulation is an issue here. (If not the MRT and buses will not be that squeezy compared to 1980s to 1990s)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Maybe in China, for such a big country with the most population country, it is impossible for them to claim that their country has limited talent on many areas, and therefore need a mass intake of foreginers, but could you think that if there is no limit on how many babies are borned, how about the unemployment thing? In Singapore, FTs is an issue for the depressed wages because FT are and able to willing to accept a lower wages (Apart of NS issue)? What about China? They sure bound to have depressed wages due to strong competition within Chinese. (PS: Even now, not all Uni grads who are willing to find a job = got a job within 6 months)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Sure, I am not bootlicking them. With the 1 child policy, it effectively created an unbalanced society such that many men will have to be single forever due to the lack of women in society as their parents generally preferred on males rather than females. The situation is improving, but such an errenous policy had costed an generation. Maybe, this is why an increasing of homosexuals being accepted worldwide.</p>

              and policemen, hanging their corpses on lamppost and burning them.
              There weren't any room for negotiations anymore, the students kept

              <p>The fact is the protests contained many people 
              with varying agendas, and hence it was unclear with whom the government 
              could negotiate, and what the exact demands of the protesters were.</p>

              <p>But I still think that at that time the country with its infancy of opening their doors outwards, doing such things would have scared off the investors etc, making the country worse. So Deng is right to oppress such demands, which is as of no priority yet.</p>
