Ms Ng, a member of the Government Parliamentary Committee for Defence and Foreign Affairs, attended and spoke in her personal capacity.<br><br>Asean should support Professor Gambari's efforts, she said. But it must not be slow 'to take Myanmar to task, including suspending it, if its rulers continue to refuse international and domestic demands for reform'.<br><br>She said later she would hand the petition to Foreign Minister George Yeo tomorrow and 'leave it to his good judgment to decide how he will go forward'.<br><br>The activists, the 'Overseas Burmese Patriots', hope that Singapore will give the petition to the Security Council.<br><br>Their spokesman, business student Myo Myint Maung, 22, said it was a plea to help Myanmar's quest for democracy.<br><br>The group, which had a police permit for the forum, has no plan to demonstrate against Myanmar Prime Minister Thein Sein here.<br><br>'But within Singapore's legal boundaries, we will do our utmost to voice our feelings, objectives and requests,' he said.<br><br><span style="color: red;">Last night, police warned against staging outdoor protests after learning of a bid by foreign students to do so on Monday at the Shangri-La Hotel, the Asean Summit's venue.<br><br>Police told organisers that their action would be illegal, and advised them to apply for a permit to hold an indoor event.</span><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Students defy Myanmar protest ban at ASEAN summit<br><br>Small anti-junta demos near Asean meeting<br><br>SINGAPORE - A HANDFUL of foreign students protested against Myanmar's junta on the fringes of a Southeast Asian summit on Monday, prompting intense police action as they marched up Singapore's main shopping strip.<br><br>Nine activists marched in groups of three up the city-state's glittering Orchard Road to avoid arrest under strict rules that say any outdoor gathering of five or more people requires a police permit.<br><br>Most carried candles and wore red t-shirts with the slogan 'We pursue peace, justice and democracy for Burma' on the back.<br><br>Ministers from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) formally opened their summit nearby at the heavily guarded Shangri-La Hotel with the adoption of the bloc's first-ever charter.<br><br>But the situation in Myanmar is expected to dominate this week's proceedings, in the wake of the junta's suppression of mass pro-democracy protests in September, which claimed at least 15 lives.<br><br>'We wanted to do something in some small way to show that the world hasn't forgotten,' Pia Muzaffar, a 22-year-old British student at the National University of Singapore, said.<br><br>'We want to send a clear message,' she said. 'As you can see, we're completely peaceful.'<br><br>Protests are rare in Singapore - and those by foreigners even more unusual - but on the eve of the summit, police designated the meeting venues as 'security zones,' meaning a single demonstrator can be expelled if deemed to be creating an unacceptable stir.<br><br>The three groups were outnumbered more than five to one by police, some of whom recorded the proceedings on video. The demonstrators were advised that they could not go up the road leading to the Shangri-La.<br><br>'It isn't our intention to break the law. We have no issue with the Singapore government or the policy,' said 20-year-old Daniel Babiak from Canada.<br><br>The three groups later dispersed without incident.<br><br>'We believe it's a good opportunity to raise awareness and keep the focus on human rights in Burma,' 22-year-old Dylan Bird from New Zealand said.<br><br>The other protesters hailed from the Netherlands, Sweden and the United States.<br><br>'We want to send a message to them as citizens of the world, as human beings, that we don't tolerate their actions in Burma,' Mr Bird said, calling on Asean to take tougher action against its most troublesome member. -- AFP<br><br></div>
