            <div class='col-md body'>"..The CPF scheme has come to occupy a pre-dominant position in SingaporeÂ’s<br>pension arrangements. The recent parametric reforms of the CPF scheme and the introduction of the SRS do not, however, address the main limitations of the arrangements. These include inadequate balances at retirement due to extensive preretirement withdrawals, particularly for housing and property, and due to low returns credited to members; lack of inflation and longevity protection; lack of survivorsÂ’ benefits; <strong>lack of transparency and accountability, particularly in investment management; inadequate weight given to fiduciary responsibility as compared to socio-economic engineering objectives; inadequate social risk pooling in health care financing </strong>(only about a quarter of the total national health budget comes from the Government - the rest is from individuals and businesses, while the opposite can be seen in high income countries of the OECD); and the virtual absence of a tax-financed redistributive tier. The limited nature of health insurance and the issue of long-term care of the aged also pose challenges to policymakers."<br><br>The above is another paper by Prof Asher,<br><br>see http://icpr.itam.mx/Working/AsherSingapore.PDF</div>

No wonder garment keep saying we are not ready to take reposiblities for ourselves.Yet there are some idiots who just throw them away within a day. So just becoz of few bad apple, the whole basket has to suffer. That's why the CPF views are going toward this direction, garment doesn't want to end up spending their budget on retired 60+ freeloader who just sit &amp; wait for money from the sky.<br><br>Here again, we sporean are again relying on garment to provide for us. Yes very true CPF will not be sufficient with inflation &amp; blah blah blah but at least you will have peanut for lunch. Even if u strike 1mill toto, I don't think it is enough for retirement &amp; yet there are some idiot out there who say if they strike they will immediately quit their jobs &amp; retirement.... I am talking about 20+ 30+ ppl. so it all boils down to individuals.<br><br>So how much is enough? 2.5% returns not enough in comparison to what? Blue chips or Bank's rates. I think we have to compare apple to apple to be logical ppl. I am not promoting for CPF but I too am a worrying sporean. No body saves anymore &amp; that is why everyone expect someone to take care of them when the well dried up.<br><br>Migrating is not only solution. Grass wil alway seems greener on other side, you will still find some things to complain about. This is human.  I had a French friend who is cursing on their " Prefect" welfare system. French has the best welfare system in the entire Europe (World). In the end, no one in the country wants to work hard. The harder you work, the pay gets higher, the tax gets more in terms of percentage. In the end the pay you will get after tax deduction will be almost the same pay as the next person who worked less. So what the "F%&amp;#" work. Then you will be "F%&amp;#ing" mad with those free-loaders who refuse to get a job &amp; garment had to spend billions of dollars of tax pay's money to feed these useless.<br><br>So imagine this to be happening in Singapore, all we need is to have 1% of these kind of retirees each year who finish their money within a day. Imagine what will happen? Some idiot will complain no garment no welfare. Then some idiot will be the first to complain to garment why they are spending your tax to feed these ppl. The same idiot will complain ppl begging on the streets... same idiot will complain too little money....it will never end.<br><br>So nothing is prefect in this world. Maybe the next world after death...<br><br>I rest my case.<br></div>
