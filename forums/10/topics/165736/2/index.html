Blue chips or Bank's rates. I think we have to compare apple to apple to be logical ppl. I am not promoting for CPF but I too am a worrying sporean. No body saves anymore &amp; that is why everyone expect someone to take care of them when the well dried up.<br><br>Migrating is not only solution. Grass wil alway seems greener on other side, you will still find some things to complain about. This is human.  I had a French friend who is cursing on their " Prefect" welfare system. French has the best welfare system in the entire Europe (World). In the end, no one in the country wants to work hard. The harder you work, the pay gets higher, the tax gets more in terms of percentage. In the end the pay you will get after tax deduction will be almost the same pay as the next person who worked less. So what the "F%&amp;#" work. Then you will be "F%&amp;#ing" mad with those free-loaders who refuse to get a job &amp; garment had to spend billions of dollars of tax pay's money to feed these useless.<br><br>So imagine this to be happening in Singapore, all we need is to have 1% of these kind of retirees each year who finish their money within a day. Imagine what will happen? Some idiot will complain no garment no welfare. Then some idiot will be the first to complain to garment why they are spending your tax to feed these ppl. The same idiot will complain ppl begging on the streets... same idiot will complain too little money....it will never end.<br><br>So nothing is prefect in this world. Maybe the next world after death...<br><br>I rest my case.<br></div></blockquote>2.5% is not enough compare to inflation rate. I'm not debating that CPF is no good. It has its merits as a force savings for retirement but do you understand why in the first place? That is because the government don't give a damn about you when you're old. It expects you to fend for yourself. That's why they force you to save. But in doing so, they deplete the funds that you could have otherwise use to make more money for retirements.<br><br>No everyone knows how to invest wisely and most are fools who loose their money. However, the government should take into consideration giving the people an option of how they should spend their money since in the end, they don't care whether you have enough money or not - you're on your own. Haven't you heard of Singaporeans who had to declare bankrupt even though they have hundreds of thousands of dollars in CPF? This is ridiculous. They person is dying and we are insisting that they save for retirement??<br><br>And on France, you're friend is complaining because he/she pays a heavy tax. I pay a heavy tax too but compared to the French (although I had snobs), I must say they have a very good system for the aged. Do you know that they only have to pay tax for the first 14 years of their working life? After that, their welfare is fully taken care by the government and I mean FULLY (not Subsidize). Let our government top this if they can.<br><br>Now take a moment to imagine this. You retire and gives up your citizenship, you get maybe half a million SG dollars and you go to Thailand and retire in a beach side house. You're half a million is multiplied 23 times and you're house is now a 15000 sqft landed that cost about $150k SG. That leaves you with about 8 million thailand bhat. Another choose to remain in Singapore, he gets $450 a month until he dies, lives in a 3 room HDB and struggles to make ends meet.<br><br>Do you still rest your case??<br></div>

I attribute this to the quality of ministers we had in the old guards and MM Lee taking the helm. But for the last decade or so, we haven't progress much. Instead, I believe we have regress. Our quality of our ministers are shitty, our policy are no longer proactive but reactive. PM Lee is doing a good job changing things but as it is now, I see that the people has progress much more further that our government.</div>

Yes tonnage of $$$ goes to projects, unecessary upgrade that are not even useful which I too do not agree too.<br><br>So if u have a policy make up there, who doesnt even know the value of money just becoz he was born w/o worries from well to do family, studies oversea &amp; bag a job on scholarship.<br><br>Give a blank cheque to a rich boy &amp; see if he would buy a Merc350 or Toyota.

            <div class='col-md body'>I think people have missed the issue. Prof Asher is not saying for a moment that we should opt for state welfare instead of the CPF system. The issue is how the CPF system is run.<br><br>By allowing and in fact encouraging Singaporeans to use their CPF for housing, we have seen the dramatic rise in property prices over the years, so much so that Singapore becomes non-competitive.  Residential property prices do have a bearing on commercial property prices as well in land-scarce Singapore. Whether it is the doctor's fees or the cost of ice cream, a significant part of it goes to pay for the rental of the clinic or factory.<br><br>To reverse that trend, the government is trying to bring down infrastructure costs but that will have a detrimental effect on our retirement savings, since much of it is tied up in that HDB flat. In the past, conventional wisdom is that when you retire, you downgrade from that executive flat to a 4-room flat and live off the profits. Looking at the prices today, how much profit do you get? But many do not have anything else in their CPF savings apart from that HDB flat. If you don't get a windfall from the sale of your flat, or worse, if you suffer a loss, then what are you going to live on in your retirement?<br><br>The other very valid point by Prof Asher is that there is no transparency in the way Temasek Holdings invests our CPF funds. Going by international industry standards, the returns we get for our CPF savings is below par. Why is that so? Apart from the few leaks such as that disastrous investment Ho Ching made in the US, we will never know...<br><br></div>
