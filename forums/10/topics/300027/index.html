Check out with MediaCorp for answer. Originally the assets including licence fees (Radio &amp; TV) collected from the citizens were used to run the Media Stations.<br><br>What happened to the TV/Radio Licence Fees at the point of privatization? There is no doubt that you will find that these licence fees were kept by the Media Development Authority for its own purpose and not transferred over to Mediacorp to run the stations.<br><br>Also check with SBS and Singapore Post etc what happened to all the assets and equipment owned by them before the privatization using taxpayers' monies.<br><br>For example, SBS owned a large fleets of buses, the depots, lands and car parks (as government services) purchased or acquired using citizens' monies before the privatization.<br><br>Singapore Post and Singapore Power etc also owned many assets acquired with taxpayers' monies before privatization.<br><br>The answer is very simple - government simply pocketed all the privatization sale proceeds and these privatized GLCs have had to charge higher fees and charges all over again to recover such assets costs by amortizing them as depreciations which are then priced into the fees charged one more time .<br><br>Privatization resulted in double taxation so to speak as happened in TCS's privatisation to MediaCorp, SBS, Singapore Power, Singapore Post and more.<br><br>No wonder our citizens are unable to survive having to pay all the double taxations for everything from Excise Duty to COE to ERP, from double TV licence fees and double-land costs to SBS etc.<br><br>All the fees charged by all the GLCs have to be set higher in order to recoup their new acquisitions which actually were already paid by citizens but pocketed by the government quietly as surpluses or extraordinary gains in their consolidated accounts,<br><br>Citizens at the lower income groups will have to keep struggling to pay such double taxations caused by privatization. Those who are earning S$1,000.00 pm will have to pay between 40% and 60% of their family incomes towards these GLCs for essential government services which were previously financed from taxations.<br><br>This is the root cause of our all rising costs of living which up to today is still not being represented by our MPs or oppositions to parliament on our behalf.<br><br>Sigh...........</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Privatisation of public services is only for show!  Me from private public service can tell that it is for show only.   Everything still follows the PAP.   Charity is forced not voluntary from that place I worked.    What a laugh!  HR said though they are privatised, they still follow the gahmen's ways for they want to be good citizens of the gahmen.</div>
