              <p><strong>Forbes.com, 22 Sep 2009</strong><br> <br> HONGKONG/NEW YORK Sept 22 (Reuters) - The Far Eastern Economic
              Review, one of Asia's leading print publications, will be shut down by
              News Corp as it struggles with losses and a dwindling readership
              migrating to the Internet.<br> <br> The 63-year-old magazine, which was run by News Corp's Dow Jones and
              enjoyed a weighty reputation for its fearless and in-depth Asian
              business and political coverage since World War Two, <span style="color: red;"><strong>will close in December</strong></span>, Dow Jones said. <br> <br> The announcement marks the denouement of what observers and former
              staffers said had been a gradual decline in the fortunes of one of the
              great titles in Asian journalism, once considered essential reading for
              the region's intelligentsia.<br> <br> 'The decision to cease publication of the Review is a difficult one
              made after a careful study of the magazine's prospects in a challenging
              business climate,' said Todd Larsen, chief operating officer at Dow
              Jones Consumer Media Group.<br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>In 2004, Dow Jones fired most of FEER's reporters
              and transformed it into a monthly publication. Articles were largely
              commissioned and only a skeleton editorial staff was retained.</strong></span><br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>David Plott, FEER's editor at the time, described
              the upheaval in 2004 as a loss of one of the 'greatest concentrations
              of knowledge and expertise about the region assembled anywhere'. </strong></span><br> <br> The magazine's demise comes as publishers gravitate towards
              electronic media and advertising revenues dwindle. In 2001, Asiaweek,
              another respected Asian weekly magazine, folded after 26 years.<br> <br> 'It's paradoxical that as the region becomes more and more important,
              there are fewer and fewer publications producing quality coverage,'
              said Hugo Restall, FEER's current editor. Restall will remain on the
              editorial board of the Wall Street Journal, also run by Dow Jones.<br> <br> A string of notable figures and correspondents have worked for FEER,
              including John King Fairbank, the Harvard sinologist, and the writer
              Ian Buruma.<br> <br> <strong>SINGAPORE LAWSUIT</strong><br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>Throughout its history, FEER's investigative and
              critical journalism has sparked tussles with Asian governments. The
              magazine is currently embroiled in a legal battle with the Singapore
              government, with the island state's High Court ruling it defamed elder
              statesman Lee Kuan Yew and his son, incumbent Prime Minister Lee Hsien
              Loong.<br> </strong></span> <br> FEER subsequently appealed the verdict.<br> <br> 'If we lose that then there's a question of whether they want to try to
              enforce the judgment in Hong Kong. Conceivably it could continue,' said
              Restall.<br> <br> Another FEER editor, Philip Bowring, also grappled with a lawsuit by
              the Singaporean government before he left the Review in 1992.<br> <br> 'It's important that these sort of battles are fought even if you don't
              win. At least you must put up a good fight,' said Bowring.<br> <br> 'The one thing I do wonder about is the timing of this closure --
              whether or not Singapore is going to drop that suit now that (Rupert)
              Murdoch has said that he's going to close the magazine.' <br> <br> -------------------<br> <br> <span style="font-size: small;"><strong>Latest updates @ Singaporenewsalternative.blogspot.com<br> <br> 1.

              <p><br>It all depends on what "good" means.</p>
              <p>It is good for Harry and sonny - as there will no longer be any aggressive and fearless "reporters-without-borders" who will dare to make detailed investigative reporting, and bring out embarrassing details that messed up the carefully polished image of LKY, his PAP and their Singapore Inc.</p>
              <p>It is bad for Singapore and the ASEAN region, as there will be one publication less that inform the World of the domestic political events that unfold in Singapore and the respective countries that form ASEAN.</p>
              <p>Dictatorships will continue to rule with impunity, knowing that the abuses within the sovereign borders will not be known to the larger world.</p>
              <p>LKY said it in such stoic and upright manner that he did not appoint LHL, and that it was GCT that decided "by himself" to appoint LHL as GCT's DPM, and GCT had stayed in the PM's seat for 14 years.</p>
              <p>Those who are unfamiliar with the long term calculating mind of LKY will accept the statement based on facts.</p>
              <p>Those who are familiar with the workings of LKY's mind, will know better then to take his words without any pinch of salt.</p>
              <p>FEER's closure will be detrimental for oppressed Citizens in ASEAN.</p>

              <p>It is not surprising!</p>
              <p>for many years, FEER was considered the voice on the FE from the western point of view.</p>
              <p>Since 1997, HK has returned to China, China has developed beyong recognition, Korean's culture flooded the whole region, Japan's influence drop significantly....but it appears that FEER hasn't changed.</p>
              <p>The local readers now find other magazines such as yazhou zhoukan more relevant, its reports more reflective of what is happening , its analysis has greater depth, and this magazine is selling even in the US and Canada. It is not the case of electronic vs printed materials.</p>
              <p>in summary, if this region is still  considerd the East that is very Far away, the magazine should pack up and go home.</p>
