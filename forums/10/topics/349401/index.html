              <h1>Open letter to Prime Minister Press Secretary Chen Hwai Liang</h1>
              <p><strong>Mr Chen Hwai Liang<br> Press Secretary to the Prime Minister<br> Singapore</strong></p>
              <p>Dear Sir,</p>
              <p>We are writing to you to correct some factual inaccuracies inherent in your letter to Financial Times titled “<strong>Singaporeans understand the perils of an open economy</strong>” published on 25 February 2009 in which you quoted a blog</p>
              <p>You wrote “<strong>Unfortunately, the online poll he cited was from a website devoted to anti-government invective</strong>.” to describe our blog from which the poll was taken. Nothing can be further from the truth.</p>
              <p>(<em>On 12 January 2009</em>, we conducted an <em>online poll asking
                  who deserves more sympathy - MP Seng Han Thong or his assailant Ong Kah
                  Chua, 76% of 277 polled voted for the latter. The poll was quoted by
                  Rear-Admiral Lui Tuck Yew in Parliament and subsequently reported in
                  the Financial Times on 12 February 2009 by John Burton though no
                  reference were made to us. You can still vote  in the alleged poll </em><a href="http://wayangparty.wordpress.com/2009/01/12/mm-lee-visits-seng-han-thong-in-hospital-attacker-may-be-sentenced-to-life-imprisonment/"><em>here</em></a>)</p>
              <p>We invite you to visit us at <a href="http://www.wayangparty.com/">http://www.wayangparty.com</a> to read our articles. The Wayang Party Club is a socio-political blog
                  dedicated to open and honest discussion of current affairs of the day.</p>
              <p>While we admit we have been critical of the certain government
                  policies, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>it is misleading to claim that our website is devoted solely
                  to anti-government invective and nothing else.</strong></span></p>
              <p>We welcome views from both ends of the political spectrum, including
                  pro-government ones. As you can see for yourself, we do publish
                  occasional articles written by our guest writers which are adopt a
                  neutral stance and sometimes even in favor of the government.</p>
              <p>Mr Chen is most welcome to post his rebuttal to our contents here.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> Unlike some other blog which practises censorship religiously, we will
                  respect your right of reply. </strong></span>Comments posted on this site in defence of
                  the government are allowed with no moderation or censorship.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Perhaps the government should ask itself the real reason behind the
                  pervasive anti-government sentiment in Singapore’s blogosphere which is
                  reflected in threads even on forums owned by the state media such as
                  Hardwarezone and Channelnewsasia.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Has the government done enough to communicate with its citizens ? Is
                  the government aware of the undercurrent of discontent and
                  disgruntlement against the way it governs the nation ? Does it really
                  understand our concerns and grouses ?</p>
              <p>Though the poll was conducted by a purportedly “anti-government”
                  website, the question asked is fair and relevant. Each participant is
                  allowed to vote only once which ensures that the result obtained is
                  fairly accurate.</p>
              <p>The poll result is not surprising judging from the outpouring of
                  sympathies and support for the MP Seng’s assailant Ong Kah Chua in the
                  internet chatrooms. While we do not condone the attack, we implore the
                  government to ponder upon this question: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>are netizens against the MP or
                  the party to which he belong ?</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>With all the major newspapers and broadcasting stations under its
                  control, the state media has ceased to represent the voices of the
                  common folks on the ground. Instead, it has become a propaganda
                  mouthpiece of the government to manipulate and contort public opinion
                  to its own partisan interest.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The lack of official channels to register their genuine displeasure,
                  frustration and anger have led to citizens turning to the internet to
                  let off steam. </strong></span>The chasm between the government and the citizenry will
                  only grow wider if the state media continue to be nonchalant about
                  online rumblings which have the potential to trigger a political
                  tsunami in time to come.</p>
              <p>There is still time for the government to acknowledge its own
                  shortcomings and mend the bridges with the online community before it
                  is too late.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Yours sincerely,</strong></p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>

              <h1>Prime Minister Press Secretary replies to Financial Times</h1>
              <p><em>rom Mr Chen Hwai Liang.</em></p>
              <p>Sir, John Burton (<a class="bodystrong" href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/8f3e5d78-f87a-11dd-aae8-000077b07658.html"><strong><span style="color: #003399;">“Crisis spoils Singapore celebrations”</span></strong></a>,
              February 12) claimed an undercurrent of public discontent with the
              People’s Action party (PAP) government, as Singapore goes into a sharp
              recession. Unfortunately, the online poll he cited was from a website
              devoted to anti-government invective.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans may be apprehensive about the financial storm raging
              around us, but we understand the inescapable vulnerabilities of a
              small, open economy, and what we must do together to pull through. At
              the next general elections, voters will decide whether this PAP
              government has served them well.</p>
              <p>Mr Burton also highlighted losses from specific investments by
              Singapore government-owned entities in western financial groups. GIC
              and Temasek have diversified portfolios aimed at long-term returns.
              Their performance is not measured on each individual investment but on
              the entire portfolio.</p>
              <p>They have suffered overall losses in this crisis like most investors
              in public listed assets, but by less than the decline in market indices.</p>
              <p>Over the 20-year period up to March 31 2008, GIC earned annualised
              US dollar returns of 7.8 per cent, while Temasek earned 19 per cent.</p>
              <p>This is not a disreputable record.</p>
