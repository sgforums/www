            <div class='col-md body'>The only really valuable resource I can think of in Singapore is her human resource. We are apparently better educated, have more opportunities and have the technology to pursue our talent compared to our neighbours. But we have no oil, rubber, farms (very few), sheep, cattle, and even water!<br><br>Even if we as people are more superior, we all see our neighbours opening up and trying to "catch-up" with Singapore (and the rest of the world). Such countries include China, Malaysia and Vietnam.<br><br>When they catch up in terms of human resource, what else are we left with? Many MNCs will be moving their asia head quarters elsewhere because of cheaper labour costs and space.<br><br>One good example is the PTP (Port of Tanjung Palapas - I think that's what it's called) stealing a major client from PSA (this is a while back already).<br><br>In time to come, if Singapore doesn't find another competitive edge, it will start to sink.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"></div>

SG was part of malaysis??? Being part of the Johore sultanate does not equate being part of Malaysia... different context altogether... and they have no more claim to it after their two rival tengkus fell out with each other and one sold his land to the Brits... (typically malay in those days... sell their land for a quick buck cos they're too stupid to see how valuable it could become and too butt lazy to administer and develop it...)<br><br>If u wanna go that far back, why don't u say that Thailand has a claim to Malaysia? Or Indonesia has a claim to the entire archipelago since Majapahit supposedly included Malaysia as well... Or that China has a claim all the way up to Africa since their rulers paid homage to the Ming emperor!<br><br>In the same breath, why not tell the Americans that the Brits have a righful claim to the original 14 colonies on the east coast... and the French have a claim to Louisiana =P<br><br>Or why not tell native Americans that they have a claim to all the land they lost during the westward expansion? DuH...<br><br>We may not be as prosperous or be in as enviable a position as we once were. The question is, do you wanna be the rat abandoning the sinking ship or do you wanna help the ship stay afloat? Selling the ship to pirates is not an option.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>and before i forget, as to what joho mentioned, it is a sad but true fact. once malaysia and indonesia and our other neighbours with more natural and human resources than us get their shit together, we may not stand much of a chance.<br><br>i think we're at present, just living on borrowed time - the headstart we have had over our neighbours due to great leaders like LKY (hate him as much as we want, he did bring singapore to what it is today), isn't going to last forever.<br><br>unless we think of something really good or our neighbours continue to be plagued by civil unrest, political problems and what-have-you, its only a matter of time before they overtake us. most of us may not live to see it in our lifetimes, but it is quite inevitable as far as i'm concerned.</div>
