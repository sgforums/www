How many times I nearly kena langah by these cyclists.  They cycle on the pedestrian walkway and got the cheek to ring their bell and expect all the pedestrians to jump into the longkang so they can cycle by?!  Until they learn how to behave themselves and cycle courteously, I don't think we should encourage their behaviour by giving them cycling lanes.<br><br>Sorry, that's my opinion.  9 out of 10 times they one who almost langah me and ring the bell and expect me to jump like money for them is a PRC cyclist.  I know, because I stop to ask them why they are so rude and so reckless with the safety of the pedestrian!</div>
