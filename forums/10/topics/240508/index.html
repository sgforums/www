            <div class='col-md body'>It's time for change in Singapore. The old generation is dying off,along with them the founding fathers,who must make way for the future.<br><br>JB Jeyaratnam was a powerful opposition voice for Singapore,silenced by Old Man Lee, aka Lee Kuan Yew,one of the founding fathers of Singapore. Sinnathamby Rajaratnam was another who probably wanted Singapore to be better than it is now.<br><br>Rajaratnam was a strong believer in multi-racialism in Singapore, and when drafting the Singapore National Pledge in 1966 just two years after the 1964 Race Riots, he wrote the words "One united people, regardless of race, language or religion." In the 1980s and 1990s, when the government began implementing several policies to promote the use of "mother tongue" languages and ethnic-based self-help groups such as Chinese Development Assistance Council (CDAC) and Mendaki, Rajaratnam expressed his opposition to these policies which, in his view, ran counter to the vision of establishing a common Singaporean identity where "when race, religion, language does not matter". He advocated for greater racial integration which he felt was still lacking in the country.<br><br>Singapore has so much potential,and as it reaches its own mid-life crisis, a social and political awakening among the people of the country  <strong>must</strong> occur.<br><br>People have no excuse not to know about their country.There is the information available to anyone on the Internet,on the political blogs.It is our social responsibility, to be executed by each within their individual capacities,to make Singapore a better place than it is now.<br><br>Enough with the lies, enough with the stupid,pathetic tactics of the government to maintain power through having the election districts redrawn.Have courage and stand together. As long as a large group stands together,you have the power of one.Stand as one,move as one.<br><br>Satyagraha.<br><br>Time to knock on the doors of power and tell them,the line has to be drawn somewhere.Its up to my generation,all generations of people who have some attachment to this land and its people,to make a difference.<br><br>The PAP is NOT Singapore.Let them fear the people for once in their lives,let them come down from the Ivory Towers and live among the people.<br><br>My name is Shiwen.My number is available upon request.The resources and information I refer is available to anyone,if you just think about it,and you will see the truth.<br><br>http://www.littlespeck.com<br>http://singabloodypore.blogspot.com/<br>http://www.singaporeangle.com/2006/07/flowing-river-of-history-social-class.html<br><br>Challenge them.Make them bleed.Its time for change.</div>

I find that most of the older generation have this "brand loyalty" mentality, they tend to hinge on the past successes of the PAP government, not looking at the present or future. They also have this fear mentality for the old man, because of the harsh ways in which the old man deals with his adversaries.<br><br>The younger Singaporean has more discerning views regarding the government. They don't practice "brand loyalty", they only give credit when credit is due. I think the new PAP generation notice this behaviour, that's why they are trying to get "in touch" with the newer generation voters by practicing hip hop dance, amongst other things.<br><br>I am hoping for a close 50:50 composition in parliament. In such circumstances, the citizens view would be represented, instead of the current regime's self serving policies. Not forgetting that in such a scenario, our poor PM will have to find ways to fix them.<br><br>Having total domination for either the PAP or opposition party is bad, it's better to create a balance of power, so that each party can debate their policies and put it to a fair vote.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The time of political awakening has come upon us. But what must the citizens do to take advantage of such awakening?<br><br>Here are three steps they could take:<br><br>(1) Time - Time is now because of internet age. Circumstances and rules of the game are changing. Government now realizes that the young not turning to the news in the internet for news and facts instead of the newspapers which are generally perceived by people as not telling the truths, telling half-truths and disabled to report on real problems.<br><br>Government now wants to counter cyberspace criticisms because of this new circumstance.<br><br>The government now cannot instruct or direct the people what to do and believe. People will not take what they say as truths. For example, newspapers are reporting everyday that property market is doing well, but people could find out whether it is. Watch for what the cyberspace says.<br><br>Why Minister Mah Bow Tan continues to air his own arrogant opinion about how affordable is public housing, people read about great discontent being expressed in the cyberspace and about the profiteering going on in HDB to make double profits on the lands people already owned and paid for by their taxes.<br><br>Minister Khaw will be seen as not fully addressing the issues of concern if he continues to impose the presumptuous organ robbery opt-out scheme forcibly taking away organ from person in a coma situation against human right to save the dying person.<br><br>(2) Political Awakening - More people have come to understand their right to air their  views on how the country should be run especially involving wrong doings like the NKF or the lack of accountability in making investments of people's hard-earned monies in Shin Corp.<br><br>People are now asking for change to past government policies like the taxing and cost-recovery system, which drives up costs of living and wasteful spending of their hard-earned monies on golden taps.<br><br>They are also disagreeing with use of taxpayers' monies for estate upgrading with priority given to the loyal pap supporting precincts.<br><br>They are also telling the government not to engage in money politics with giving of monies to buy votes prior to election.<br><br>They are also questioning whether the accounts presented to parliament based on current revenues versus current expenditure with silence on capital gains and revenues from windfalls in land sales are truthful.<br><br>They are also asking to change the constitution to prevent using of GRC for maintaining racial equilibrium in voting when there are more practical method like proportional representation or reserved seats which will not result in incumbent party undue advantages in contesting election.<br><br>Citizens must post their views and opinions objectively without being anti-anyone. Be consistent and focused like in the NKF views.<br><br>(3) Implementation - For a start, People must at least go to the internet an take an active part in political renewal in whatever form. They must put up proposals and get fellow citizens to support the political parties and candidates to vote for including oppositions of good quality or even certain incumbent. They are not against the government but are taking an active part in deciding the political renewal they want.</div>
