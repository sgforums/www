            <div class='col-md body'>I completely agree it is time for an awakening. Im so pleased to see that there are seeds of discontent amongst my fellow singaporeans. This goes to show one thing. That our peaople are starting to wake the hell up and recognise the injustice. If u think TT Durai is a cheat, wait till u look into our ministers pay packages. SM Goh's wife lept to his defence when the issue on his pay surfaced, comparing it to peanuts. Now one can only wonder what the ministers are paid.<br><br>As if thats not bad enough, the PAP seems to have a distinct disconnect with our people. They recognise social problems only after they problem has festered in our contry's loins for ages. Is this good leadership. No. I call this a lack of forsight. They are so caughtup helping the rich get richer, that they know nothing of the ground conditions. They are doing nothing more than gorund control.<br><br>At the end of the day my fellow singaporeans, we must ask ourselves, does the PAP represent US and our concerns today? If u think  they do then vote for them. If u are unhappy and feel u have no voice in your own country then, If you have the chance to vote for an opposition, then do so. To encourag' more to speak up. Then u will find ur voice in a true leader. Not some tyrant's spoilt son.<br><br>WE NEED A VOICE.</div>
