            <div class='col-md body'>The parliament is yet having another debates on rising costs etc. What can we people expect from another sessions of wayang kulit?<br><br>Ask any young ministers like Dr. Vivian Balakrishnan who was in charge of remaking Singapore committee at one time to do something about the perpetual rising costs as I have done at one Annual Remaking Singapore Conference held at Suntec, his answer is "There are many types of costs, the fixed cost and variable cost.<br><br>In this way he conveniently side-step the main issues by simply saying that the government has not control over costs etc to avoid the problem.<br><br>Instead he asked the people subsequently: "Do you have any solutions to rising cost problem?" (As if people are paid to do his job) He would add: "We will study them"<br><br>Actually solution is quite straighforward such as the following:-<br><br>(1) Do not always go up, when costs come down, to pass back saving<br><br>(2) Outsource all services to private sector firms in non-critical areas.<br><br>(3) Do not double-tax e.g. HDB's charging on land twice.(Land acquisition paid by citizens and charging on land via sale of HDB), Vehicle Excise duty, Petrol Tax, COE, ERP.<br><br>(4) What go up when come down must come down e.g. Petrol tax should be removed with taxing by COE and ERP.<br><br>(5) What go up behind must reveal to all - no profiteering on lands and assets through corporatizing to GLCs as citizens already paid infrastructures. GLCs should not charge on lands and assets again.<br><br>(6) Annual budget especially in proposal to increase taxes or GST must include full accounts showing profits made by all departments and capital gains from all departments including GLCs, HDB, URA. The hidden surpluses by HDB, URA for period 1900-2000 came to S$20,000,000,000.00. Is this necessary to hoard monies of citizens just to claim superficial success or worse for spending on Suzhou, Shin Corp or be wasted on NKF malpractices.<br><br>The younger ministers do not seem to understand the root causes affecting citizens' perpetual rising costs. Many families with income of S$1,000.00 are paying more than half of their income on bus fares, utilities, education and medical care.<br><br>More families are breaking up due to such squeeze by rising costs with the government championing for all the monopoly GLCs to increase their costs all the time year after year.<br><br>If we have indeed the true talents among our ministers we should have solved such a straightforward problem long ago.<br><br>What keep the ministers and MPs from raising root causes and root issues affecting rising costs?<br><br>I could not think of any other reason than the hedonism or worship of the golden calf as posted in another thread.<br><br>They were there sitting pretty in parliament just for wayang kulit to protect their own career in the autocracy which needs compliant men to embolden autocracy self-serving agenda to cling to power.<br><br>Let us find true talents like Sim Kee Boon who could take control of overall complex problems and issues and deal with them quietly without justifications or excuses and produce results acceptable to all.<br><br>I will be waiting for the next parliament debates to see if we have such Sim Kee Boons.<br><br></div>
