            <div class='col-md body'>By Valarie Tan, Channel NewsAsia<br><br>SINGAPORE : Once the second biggest casino gambler in the world, he is serving 42 years in jail for cheating banks of $117.1 million to feed his habit.<br><br>Chia Teck Leng, now aged 45, is against having a casino in Singapore but says if there is to be one, Singapore needs to at least tame it.<br><br>He wrote a paper "Taming the Casino Dragon" while in prison to 'share his experience' and 'lessons learnt'.<br><br>The Home Affairs Ministry is releasing it now - as part of the public education on the casino debate.<br><br>What is the fuss about a criminal's account?<br><br>It was the largest case of cheating involving a Singaporean - the former finance manager of Asia Pacific Breweries (Singapore) Pte Ltd - ended up in jail because he was 'hooked' on gambling.<br><br>He was given time off from prison work to write this 13-page paper - and took about five months till December.<br><br>It is almost academic in tone - informative - introducing words like 'whale' to mean the big players and 'house advantage' for the odds in favour of the casino in the long-term.<br><br>Self-deprecating at times - saying "like an inexperienced teenager succumbing to the lure of a newly discovered vice, I was soon hooked".<br><br>And at others, prescriptive. In fact, without irony, he recommends over 10 'safeguards' to protect Singaporeans from the ill-effects of casino gambling.<br><br>Chia spoke about being accosted by "alluringly colourful lights, attractive croupiers and the magical promise of easy money."<br><br>The turning point came when he lost three-quarters of a million dollars which he had painstakingly saved. To recoup losses, Chia sought bigger bets.<br><br>He travelled to exclusive casinos in Australia and London where he placed million-dollar bets.<br><br>Besides that, Chia gives an insight into just how lucrative the casino trade is, giving the example of just how much operators make in one game - Baccarat.<br><br>His plain message was the casino always wins. - CNA /de<br><br></div>
