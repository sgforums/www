              <p><strong>Singapore's Q4 jobless rate falls to 1.6%<br>Posted: 31 January 2008 1151 hrs</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>SINGAPORE : Singapore's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate fell to 1.6 percent in the fourth quarter from 1.7 percent in the third as firms added new jobs across all sectors, the Ministry of Manpower said Thursday.</p>
              <p>Supported by robust job creation, the unemployment rate dropped to a decade low, comparable to pre-Asian crisis levels.</p>
              <p>The economy created 64,200 new jobs in the three months through December, more than the 58,600 added in the third quarter, according to the ministry's preliminary estimate.</p>
              <p>Fourth quarter employment growth was led by a strong increase in the services industry, while the manufacturing and construction sectors also made healthy additions.</p>
              <p>For all of 2007, the economy added a record 236,600 jobs, up from 176,000 in the previous year.</p>
              <p>The unemployment rate averaged 2.1 percent over the course of the year, lower than 2.7 percent in 2006.</p>
              <p>All major sectors registered employment growth in 2007.</p>
              <p>The services sector saw the largest employment gains of 144,100, boosted by rapid increase in hirings across a wide range of industries led by financial and professional services.</p>
              <p>The booming construction sector added 40,900 workers, double the increase in 2006.</p>
              <p>Manufacturing employment rose by 49,400, supported by strong manpower demand in marine and offshore engineering.</p>
              <p>Both locals and foreigners benefited from the strong job creation.</p>
              <p>Local employment grew by 92,100 in 2007, slightly more than the gains of 90,900 in 2006.</p>
              <p>This is the third successive year that local employment creation has set new record highs.</p>
              <p>Given the limits to the growth of Singapore's indigenous workforce and the larger base of jobs created, the local share of total employment created dropped from 52 percent in 2006 to 39 percent in 2007, even though the absolute gains in employment taken up by locals increased over the period.</p>
              <p>Foreign employment rose by a new high of 144,500 in 2007, enabling the economy to grow beyond the limits of Singapore's indigenous workforce.</p>
              <p>As at December 2007, there were 900,800 foreigners forming one in three (33 percent) of the 2.73 million persons employed in Singapore.</p>
              <p>The majority or two thirds (67 percent or 1.83 million) of the workforce were locals. - CNA/ch</p>

              <p>Some of you might recall a mudder of all question I posed where i recieved no satisfactory reply. I had asked a question about the UNEMPLOYMENT RATE in this forum before. I asked what is the EMPLOYMENT RATE of SINGAPOREANS. This seemed like a simple question with only a few words and many would have thought the news had informed. Until today, I see this cna article, I only saw news about employment rate of RESIDENTS which in simplest english means PR + singaporeans.  By that, there was no figure about the unemployment rate of Singaporeans , this may have surprised many who thought news had reported.</p>

              <p>lets say there are currently 1000 people in a country.</p>
              <p>of this 1000 people, if minus away lets say 500 of them are students, senior citizens etc. then another 500 people are in the work force. so this is 100% employment rate. right?</p>
              <p>then lets say, if these 500 people who are suppose to be in the work force, 50 of them are unemployed. so is 90% employment rate and 10% unemployment.</p>
              <p>then this year, there are 100 students graduated and they join the work force. so the people in the work force should be 600. And if 600 of them are working, then the employment rate should be 100%.</p>
              <p>then lets say, those 100 students that just graduated manage to find a job. then of the 600 people that suppose to be employed, only 550 people are currently employed. the 50 people still could not find a job.</p>
              <p>so the employment rate should increase to 91.6% while the unemployment rate is reduce from 10% to 8.4%.</p>
              <p>But wait, the umemployment rate is still high. So to counter this problem to make the percentage look lower, why not increase the number of people to the work force by hiring lets say 500 more FTs and giving the 500 of them jobs? The percentage of unemployment is definitely lower now. BUT the 50 people still unemployed.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To TS: the jobless rate might fall to 1.6%, the number of jobless is unknown.</p>

              <p><strong>Singapore's Q4 jobless rate falls to 1.6%<br>Posted: 31 January 2008 1151 hrs</strong></p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>SINGAPORE : Singapore's <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">seasonally adjusted</span></strong> unemployment rate fell to 1.6 percent in the fourth quarter from 1.7 percent in the third as firms added new jobs across all sectors, the Ministry of Manpower said Thursday.</p>
              <p>Supported by robust job creation, the unemployment rate dropped to a decade low, comparable to pre-Asian crisis levels.</p>
              <p>The economy created 64,200 new jobs in the three months through December, more than the 58,600 added in the third quarter, according to the ministry's preliminary estimate.</p>
              <p>Fourth quarter employment growth was led by a strong increase in the services industry, while the manufacturing and construction sectors also made healthy additions.</p>
              <p>For all of 2007, the economy added a record 236,600 jobs, up from 176,000 in the previous year.</p>
              <p>The unemployment rate averaged 2.1 percent over the course of the year, lower than 2.7 percent in 2006.</p>
              <p>All major sectors registered employment growth in 2007.</p>
              <p>The services sector saw the largest employment gains of 144,100, boosted by rapid increase in hirings across a wide range of industries led by financial and professional services.</p>
              <p>The booming construction sector added 40,900 workers, double the increase in 2006.</p>
              <p>Manufacturing employment rose by 49,400, supported by strong manpower demand in marine and offshore engineering.</p>
              <p>Both locals and foreigners benefited from the strong job creation.</p>
              <p>Local employment grew by 92,100 in 2007, slightly more than the gains of 90,900 in 2006.</p>
              <p>This is the third successive year that local employment creation has set new record highs.</p>
              <p>Given the limits to the growth of Singapore's indigenous workforce and the larger base of jobs created, the local share of total employment created dropped from 52 percent in 2006 to 39 percent in 2007, even though the absolute gains in employment taken up by locals increased over the period.</p>
              <p>Foreign employment rose by a new high of 144,500 in 2007, enabling the economy to grow beyond the limits of Singapore's indigenous workforce.</p>
              <p>As at December 2007, there were 900,800 foreigners forming one in three (33 percent) of the 2.73 million persons employed in Singapore.</p>
              <p>The majority or two thirds (67 percent or 1.83 million) of the workforce were locals. - CNA/ch</p>

              <p>are anyone not literate here?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>you can clearly tell the difference in reporting between the report of last time and the current report.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>it makes a world of difference.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>its clear now the employment situation of singaporeans.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I urge all young people to join me to challenge reports if there is room for improvement.  as no one owes no one a living, we as information receivers, should depend on ourselves to demand for clear information.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>last time, if I tell you, the employment rate for RESIDENTS is 5% unemployed, even if you have 1 million phd, I bet you oso cannot tell me based on that how many singaporeans actually are employed even in percentage.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>that is my main point.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>we must demand the right to have clear and transparent information. No one owes no body nothing. that is, if you do nothing about things, nothing in terms of improvement will happen. Its just like if you go to some department and ask for some related information and they know but they conveniently say they don't and ask you to refer to another department or they act blur say no no when in fact they know. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>if you don't demand, people will take it that you dont want that info.</p>

              <p>1) I've showed you how you can contact the MP at the meet the people session to demand whatever information you need. You have yet to give a satisfactory reply as to why you do not want to do so, yet continuously demand information. Why is it so?</p>
              <p>2) The information is out there, and my calculations and analysis have been proven by CNA. It is only people like you with minimal analytical powers that cannot comprehend readily available information, and yet want to complain without thinking.</p>
              <p>3) Have you or have you no idea on how many fresh graduates there are in Q3 looking for a job from both uni and poly? Do you know that it can easily reach 0.2% or more of the labour force, or do you still need us to do calculations for you?</p>

              <p>OM , with utmost due respect, being a learned person and especially a medical doctor, you must surely know that foreigners who are doing jobs that Singaporeans shun are not FTs , they are FOREIGN WORKERS.</p>
              <p>FTs and FWs are different unless you are accusing the government of being so dumb that they cannot differentiate between both.</p>

              <p>Stay focused on the FT issue . It is not an FW issue - we all know that FW take up jobs that Singaporeans don't want. However FTs take up jobs that Singaporeans want and there are issues of undercutting locals whilst on the other spectrum , you have overpaid FTs in jobs Singaporeans would love to have.</p>
              <p>I am disappointed with your apparent inability to stay on the issue . Being a doctor , I would expect  your statements to be intelligible.</p>
              <p><strong>As for your superfluous cat analogy: You don't seem to display any faith for your own people. That is why one former FT is right : Singaporeans work against each other instead of working together. The ones who want a better Singapore for all are forced to work against the Singaporeans, like you, who just want to profit from the minute with your cheap labour. </strong></p>
              <p>And one more thing , there are cases of  FT who are paid so well and leave Singapore with a golden handshake without any real contribution when a Singaporean could probably do the job and contribute more. It is the case of buying a ragdoll cat to catch the mice instead of getting an ordinary moggie to catch mice- thanks to our policy makers.</p>

              <p>jobless by choice for more than a few months (cannot remember exactly how many) is not considered as part of the labour force, and hence not even considered under employed or unemployed.</p>
              <p>An economy is considered to be at full employement at such low percentages is because of people switching jobs, people looking for jobs at the moment after graduation, etc. These people need time, and thus may in this quarter be considered as unemployed. At any point of time, there will always be such people.</p>
              <p>Of course, the unemployed also include those who find it perpetually hard to get a stable income.</p>
