              <p>not for those in my categories and profession. one of my friend in his 50s that did mainframe programming was retrenched from his job, sold biscuits and cakes to provision shops, and now happily employed in a school as an IT administrator.</p>
              <p>another chap in his 50s, lost his job, and converted to freelance auditing job.</p>
              <p>these are battle hardened folks that have endured 3 recessions in SG... but as they age, they cant help to feel the uneasiness of unemployment looming not very far when they hit 60 of 70s.</p>

              <p>You are few months late to believe or disbelieve. A lot has changed.</p>
              <p>I'm predicting that the next economic bull run will be near the end of 2009. Need to start saving up and earning extra income sources to prepare for investment opportunities.</p>
              <p>Btw, there are a few ways to earn passive income using IT, you just have to know how... Already spent some exam study time and sleep time considering the possibilities... Going to embark on 2 to 3 of such projects of different content right after exams to try it... b_e_c, if successful I share with you hor, since you are also from IT... I won't be selfish one.</p>
              <p>Then again, perhaps you should also spend some of your abundant energy on doing research into such areas yourself.</p>

              <p>not too late. the key is to stay positive. keep your feet firmly on the ground in terms of expenses and life's maintainence. cast your net wide; call up friends, check back with ex-colleagues once in a while for job openings, approach recruitment companies. often job openings are secured through word of mouth. advertisements are already too late when you see one. and catch up on your hobbies or personal work neglected in the past. negativity will do you in. so, stay up.</p>
              <p>you will get there. i have seen some of my older friends digging themselves out through preserverance. and they are in their 40s.</p>

              <p>i have no problem securing a job.</p>
              <p>sometimes maybe due to market conditions, no job openings. i dry for few months. but i prove my market value worthiness everytime by securing another job due to my skillset which is rare in the pore.</p>
              <p>then again, the pore does not have enough job for my kind of skills.</p>
              <p>seng shao , zou geng shao.</p>
              <p>this words were told to me by my friend.</p>
              <p>IT is diverse. the pore is tiny super little market.</p>
              <p>with influx, this is magnified many many many times.</p>
              <p>influx is about new, young, cheaper, endless supply for a limited demand. this is logically the problem.</p>
              <p>with proper management of the situation, this is no problem.</p>
              <p>over supply lowers the market value.</p>
              <p>as one ages, you find your salary as IT person has hit the ceiling.</p>
              <p>I always preach to youngsters about what to expect if they go into IT. Why so few locals into IT ? they are smarter than me, they have moved on to other fields like sales and management.</p>
