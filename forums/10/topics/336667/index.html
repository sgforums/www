              <p>Students complain at the Melbourne campus of the Central Queensland University.<br>Photo: Michael Clayton-Jones<br>Related coverage<br>ï¿½ YOUR SAY Overseas students<br>By David Rood<br>March 14, 2006<br>AT 10 o'clock yesterday morning, a group of international students at the Melbourne campus of Central Queensland University told the media that they were planning to start a hunger strike.<br>They accused the university of treating them as "cash cows", interested only in their money.<br>Within hours it was called off ï¿½ the students were under the mistaken impression that protesting would threaten their visas ï¿½ but their concerns remained.<br>The students' claims came after 62 per cent of them failed a tax and accounting postgraduate subject at the Lonsdale Street campus. The students complained that they were tested on material not covered in lectures, were not given the opportunity to challenge their marks and suffer from substandard facilities ï¿½ all claims that the university strongly disputes.<br>A representative of the 60 masters students said CQU treated the Melbourne campus like a bank rather than an education institution that was concerned about its students.<br>"When you compare us to RMIT or Monash, we don't have adequate facilities and libraries. They are just taking our money," the student said. CQU has the highest proportion of international students of any Australian university. Almost half of its 24,000 students are from overseas. The Melbourne campus has 3753 international and 100 domestic students.<br>They pay $24,000 for the two-year masters degree.<br>Melbourne campus executive dean Gus Geursen said while he was alarmed by the hunger strike threat, the university aimed to prepare students for life.<br>"The fact that 38 per cent of students passed the subject is evidence that the students were well prepared for the exam," he said. "Our standards are not low, our standards are high. This is not a backyard university."<br>Professor Geursen said students could apply to have their work marked a second time. He said he was confident CQU Melbourne students have the same access to resources and facilities, such as libraries, as students at other Victorian universities.<br>The academic programs at the Melbourne campus ï¿½ faculty of business and informatics ï¿½ are run by the university, but the campus is managed by a private company.<br>Former Victorian premier John Cain, who has researched city universities, said the campus did not have appropriate facilities for a tertiary institution.<br>"The university is detached physically by some thousands of kilometres from its base, giving its name and blessing to the courses but the campus is being run by a private company," he said.<br>http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/cash-cow-students-take-a-brief-stand-against-uni/2006/03/13/1142098405192.html<br><br><br>Hi,<br><br>This is the same way they failed me. How can so many international students just fail without a reason? The professor never gave me a reason for failing either. This news bit is solid proof of harassment of international students. Do not trust Australia for Education. India treats students much better.<br><br>There is one more proof that these people only want cash from students by failing them in one semester and then taking cash for another semester:<br><br>http://blogs.theage.com.au/yoursay/archives/2006/03/overseas_studen.html<br><br>learning.uow.edu.au/LAS2001/unrefereed/east.pdf<br><br>See for yourself how Australians treat Indians!!!</p>

              <p>that is very naive. there is this springboard culture among the young immigrants.</p>
              <p>once they got established enough, they will try to seek immigration to a even better paying country.</p>
              <p>its the same when singaporean go overseas for work and studies. if they can leave everything behind in singapore, they can do it again anywhere, and be literally global citizens, where citizenship is just a meaningless piece of paper.</p>
              <p>you think gong li really want to become a singaporean because singapore is an attractive country to her? in fact, how often did you see her around in singapore. most of the time, she's living in china or at LA, hollywood.</p>
              <p>she pick up singapore citizenship cos its cheap and convenient. as long as you don't stay in singapore, you don't have to pay tax, and a singapore passport is more convenient when travelling compared to a chinese or american passport.</p>
              <p>likewise, how many scholars want to really stay and contribute to singapore, by becoming a loyal singaporean? too few.</p>
              <p>the ministers speak of them creating employment. but i only see they taking employment from locals, instead of creating jobs for locals. if you want to create employment, it would be better to invite entrepreneurs and investors over to singapore, than to offer jobs and scholarships to foreigners. The gahmen's immigration logic is warped.</p>
              <p>we don't need to offer scholarships to attract foreign talents.</p>
              <p>if they are truly talented, they would have seek out singapore as a place of business opportunities, and come to singapore on their own. look at china and india now, people are fighting to enter these markets, and the government plays only a minimal role in attracting investment. by not trying intentionally to bring in foreign talent, only the truly capable and commited will come knocking on the doors of singapores.</p>
              <p>we do not need to lower ourselves to the role of beggars, prostrating and begging these so-called "talents" to come to singapore, enticing them with our hard earned cash. </p>
              <p>even if we r to offer scholarship to foreigners, it would be better for the universities and educational institutions themselves to award the scholarships, not the government.</p>
              <p>have you seen any singaporean on a british or american government scholarship? no. even the smartest singaporean scholar can only hope of getting a university scholarship (excluding corporate scholarships), i don't see why our government should be so "special" to award scholarships to foreigners.</p>

              <p>By offering the scholarships, the well performing foreign
              students come here to study and if they really are good they
              can get a job here. By getting them to study here, they might grow
              to be familar with the lifestyle and chose to stay. After all, as
              human beings we tend to prefer to stick with the familar once we've
              grown used to it.</p>
              <p>What they offer, is their minds that would entice the

              <p>If such scholarships are not offered, these foreign students

              <p>It's not a popular university, from what I heard is that CQU allows international students to pass easier and therefore graduate earlier compared to other international students that go to Griffith University, Queensland University of Technology and University of Queensland. </p>
              <p>For all I know to gain entry into CQU is not difficult, you just need a pass in english. If you have an overall performance (OP) of 17 to 21 you can gain entry. OP 1 is the highest and OP 25 is the lowest, this applies to all students who have finished highschool. </p>
