              <p>all the bullshit about PAP wanting S'poreans to have more children is just a smokescreen for their real aim to increase foreign immigration into S'pore.</p>
              <p>PAP leaders know full well that most S'poreans can't afford to have 3 children.............in fact with just 1 child, many are already struggling...........</p>
              <p>to top it off, the Govt don't give monthly financial help to those needy families with children unlike in European countries............</p>

              <p>What you saying is not realistic. How many children can an average Singaporean have? A HBD flat have limited no of rooms, each room for one child. So growth all depends on the property sector.</p>
              <p>We should not stop immigration but put more checks on immigration. We only want to let in quality skilled migrants not PRC desperate low cost workers. S'pore got no resources so the only resources is in its Human Capital. S'pore must continue to encourage scientist, doctors, professors, bankers to boost the human capital. It is the only way. USA is a successful country because they have brought in many foreign scientist. S'pore is bringing in way too many immigrants, should put a quota.</p>
              <p>If you look at M'sia, the country is dying because they have their protectionist policy. Malaysia is running dry of its own skilled labour because many are running to singapore and other countries. Malaysia is not replacing its lost labour thru immigration so many factories are left with a lot of vacant skilled position for engineers. This is why immigration is so important for S'pore. If want to limit immigration then why not stop all the foreign prostitutes from coming here and working in geylang?</p>
              <p>S'pore should implement point based system and place yearly quota on immigration and should never stop immigration.</p>

              <p>So the government is telling us they are bringing in more foreigners because at present our birth rate is low.</p>
              <p>Now, let say all singaporeans respond to the call to have more babies, and as a result the birth rate is back to normal or higher. These babies will only enter the workforce 18 years later.</p>
              <p>But what the government is doing now is they are bringing in foreigners who enter the workforce immediately and not 18 years later. And for the new citizens they bring in does not mean they will be producing more babies to hit the target.</p>
              <p>So if you think government bring in more foreigners because birth rate is low, that's an excuse and not the truth.</p>

              <p><br>We should instead lobby for less PAP domination in the govt but still remain in power. I don't think opposition is prepared to rule S'pore. PAP must solve the high property price, reduce the pay for ministers, social welfare homes for the old folks and still encourage immigration but put yearly quota restrictions.</p>

              <p>Of course they want rich lah, more tax means more revenue. Very hard you know, if you own a local business, you surely want to employ cheaper labour. All the business organisations and MNCs want to lobby to the govt for cheaper labour. PAP is under pressure. If the businesses don't get their wish, they will pack up and ship out to China. Problem is that many people are getting married later and later.</p>
              <p>Land so scarce. How? Of course HBD have to be small to save cost. Govt is doing all they can. Be foreward, Singapore is going to turn into expensive Tokyo, it is inevitable. All the best the govt can do is to slow down the process.</p>

              <p>Well ponzi or not at least more better than China. They dun even have CPF. They have to save the salary themself. Actually singapore should reduce CPF dominance/monopoly by allowing private mutual fund companies to take over like the superannuation policy in Australia.</p>
              <p>Actually you have a point but i don't think the money from CPF is use to pay minister benefits and pay but the money could be channeled into the benefit of PAP sponsored construction and investment projects and probably PAP supporter businesses can obtain cheaper ball outs if the stock market collapse.</p>
