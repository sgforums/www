              <p>I wonder when the harsh economic times comes, will the government be able to follow the steps of New Zealand or not. When NZ locals cannot find job and their overseas compatriot came back after being kicked away in the country they worked in. NZ government did not further approve the permits for a lot of the immigrants, so that their own can have a job. </p>
              <p>A bit more different is that, NZ have the same population as us, but their land is soooo much more bigger, so the squeeze is another story. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>They are so smart to think of importing more people to make up for the shortage of babies.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Then again, they never thought that in 20 - 30 years time, all these people they bring in will become old.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I guess they will start kicking old people out once they are of no economic use to the country.</p>

              <p>Children of these lower ranks and creed, have gone on to make it big, and having moved to the upper economic belt, also find it hard to have kids.</p>
              <p>So it is not the creed, but money management. Of living within your means.</p>
              <p>When a home must be a condo, a car (or two) is a must, plus a lifestyle to maintain, there isn't much money left after that. All those money could have been used for the kids.</p>

We do not expect all FT or FW to stay here, that is for sure, but we are hoping and in fact it is happening that more than 1/3 of them decided to make this place their home, so kindly welcome them with open arms, thank you.</p>

              <p>Nobody really dont want to have baby, better to be singles, as having baby will takes up a whole chunck of your life and time.</p>
              <p>And of course, MONEY!!! I am not talking about $1k or $2k, it is $10k to $50k kind of money to spend to nurture your kids, educations, medical, insurances, fees, etc.... </p>

              <p> Well i remember my mum used to tell me that i cause them to get fined for having me the 3rd one in the family in 1975 . The govt posed a fine on the 3rd child in 1972 . And my mum always scold me no matter what i do no matter right or wrong . I was just the venue to vent her anger cause i caused them to be fined even when my parents were already damm poor . And they even attempted to " con " me away to indonesia .</p>
              <p>  Now they say they want more babies and ask pple to have more babies while they go and up the prices of everything then bring down our salaries ? I always tell my friend politics are just irresponsible talk by irresponsible pple " up there " .  When they give baby bonus , my bro just missed the bonus by a few month only and there goes the money . Now its NS bonus that me and my bro missed . So can we say that the younger generations are singaporean while the older ones are not ? Thats why they don't get the money ?</p>

              <p>It is unlikely that tthey will abandon ship if what you meant is they really leave SG for good.  Cos they simply open up themselve for the angry mob to do whatever they want without much protection.</p>
              <p>Staying put would be a better choice more over they could be seen as responsible staying put to deal with situation and also with their mass fortunate, they are already any crisis free.  Just my opinion</p>

              <p>from 1975 to 2010, you and your family become rich, able to buy computer( IT Savy), able to use internet (education), i think you should be bless that you are what you are today because our govt make it happen for you. As for your parent treatment against you, you learn to keep it to yourself, do not tarnish your family name in the public.</p>

              <p>We should therefore take a holistic view into it, if not, everyday blame this and that, it will never end, and nothing will move and that end up same same, but different ways of grumbling and complaining</p>
