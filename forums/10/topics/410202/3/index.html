              <p>One could point out that the current situation was made a lot worse then it ought to be by the heavy-handed population control policies of the PAP. Some people did point out in the era of the baby boomers that the birth rate would naturally come down as the country becomes developed, and that heavy-handed population control policies would not be such a good idea.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately this observation ended up being almost prophetic. The fact that we had our (quietly forgotten) eugenics era and stuff like the graduate mother's scheme probably didn't help things.</p>
              <p>Additionally the current measures to boost the population always run into conflicts of interests... the government wants people to have more babies but are unwilling to encourage or create the societal and economic conditions to encourage such a thing. </p>
              <p>The current massive influx of FTs is just a stopgap measure, ultimately if the root conditions are not met, even the FTs themselves will not be having more children (assuming that they even stay), ultimately this leads to a country with an open door policy where the population is constantly topped up by foreigners hoping to make a quick buck off the favorable policies while the locals shoulder the burden of that. It's going to be a vicious cycle.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately I do not see any viable solutions to the situation, namely because our government will be unwilling, or unable to really do what it takes to resolve the issue... probably because it involves taking steps that might affect their own interests.</p>

              <p><br>Singaporean are obedient citizens, they listen to the govt, they will not revoke to PR migrating there, but only make some noises, not a whimp of care for the govt.</p>
              <p>What i see in the future is a total different scenarios, PR or new citizens and their decendents are from a different culture and background, if PAP are not careful, the next 10 years, you will see real violences and street protest in Singapore just like any other countries revolution or my taiwan parliament and street violences. Because this new breed of citizens are not going to be as obedient as singapore uncles and aunties and their childrens, they fight for unfairness and their rights.</p>
              <p>Dun believe me, if you look at today situation, just the SM Goh make a remark against PRs, the who PRs and expatriate forums are already fighting for their rights, and our govt have to quickly step in to address and calm them down. But when Govt make an unpopular decision on local Citizens, all keep quiet as tho nothing happen, that is the differences you see. PAP can be digging their own grave</p>

              <p>Our government building are built like "Seven Wonders of the World".Our MRT n buses are always "Brand New",but the services n efficiency(the buses are traveling as slow as tortise) are low.He also like to purchase high tech n advance warplanes n military weapons in million or even billions of dollars.Anyhow appoint his wife as CEO n then anyhow invest in foreign countries n incur losses.</p>
              <p>I dont know,if i was his father,i will strangle him to death.If i were a Prime Minister,i will disallow this son to even step into the politics n ruin my reputation.</p>
