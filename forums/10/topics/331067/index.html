              <p>When I wrote that I'm a victim of the corrupt government of Singapore. Some people accused me of trying to make the opposition look bad. I've been defamed crazy by the ruler of Singapore through the NUH in 2002. I've refused medication and go on to complete my 7 semester degree locally in Indonesia. I know <strong>now for sure that Singapore is run by a tyrant</strong>. A deceitful liar and a man of no moral values. A cheater and a murderer, a corrupt man, a womanizer, a sadist and a torturer. A man whose life is an insult to God.</p>
              <p>I suspect that those people who accused me of trying to give the opposition a bad name are the ones who are actually posing as anti-PAP voices when in fact they are trying to give the opposition a bad name.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>One forumer even went to confront me in eternal hope. Mocking me whether I had felt better by posting in that forum. So what's the connection between posting a religious testimony and having myself feeling better? That forumer tried to get to my nerve by calling me living in delusion.</p>
              <p>Here's the quote</p>
              <p><em>Hope all you want and feel better. But I tell you that it is
                                              better to face reality and live in reality. Only then can you find
                                              true happiness. Chrtistians must live up to the standards set for
                                              them. "Love your neighbour"... hahaha... it benefits people like
                                              me. If you cannot do it, don't live in a delusion.</em></p>
              <p>Next time you see someone as an anti PAP regime think twice! He may be a faker.</p>

              <p>6. Do not think for yourself against LKY and LHL will</p>

              <p>Let me rephrase it to suit the situation as Singaopre is not a free democratic country.</p>
              <p>Do not ask what LKY and LHL can do for you, ask what you can do for LKY and LHL.</p>
              <p>Or rather <strong>Ask what LKY and LHL want of you</strong>.</p>
              <p>Ha ha is it clearer?</p>
              <p>And the ten commandments of any would be believer in Singapore.</p>
              <p>1. Do not go against LKY and LHL will</p>
              <p>2. Do not do against LKY and LHL will</p>
              <p>3. Do not think against LKY and LHL will</p>
              <p>4. Do not speak against LKY and LHL will</p>
              <p>5. Do not go against LKY and LHL will, ever</p>
              <p>6. Do not think for yourself against LKY and LHL will</p>
              <p>8. LKY and LHL will is the law in Singapore</p>
              <p>9. No 1-8 encompasses all law in Singapore</p>
              <p>10. No 1-9 is the law for which there is no greater law in Singapore be it man made or   God's.</p>

              <p>What hybrid? It's a totalitarian regime. The general election is a make up, cosmetics to please and fool the crowds and has no real value of whatsoever to bringing democracy to Singapore. <strong>Your general election has become nothing but a tool to legitimate status quo</strong>. Just like in the days of the old new order regime in Indonesia.</p>
              <p>Actually countries in South east Asia are known not to be democratic in a real sense. These countries are comparatively young with largely uneducated population to begin with. A dictator was a pragmatic and practical solution to bringing political stabilization and rapid economic development. These countries include Malaysia, Indonesia and Singapore.</p>
              <p>Howwever as these countries develop themselves with rapid economic growth and the level of education of its population, its people inevitably will demand to be given more room of freedom.  Dictatorial rule will gradually lose its appeal especially to its younger generation who are better educated and which emphasizes change and eager for a change towards more liberty especially in political sector.</p>
              <p>Indonesia has started the path towards democracy. A flawed one though as it is now but we are heading towards democracy nonetheless with the toppling of the late former president Soeharto. Malaysia is gearing towards democracy as well. Signs of changing leadership is already at the gate. That leave Singapore stuck in the old style of dictatorial rule alone. Where are the young idealistic people in Singapore? Don't you believe in something? Your stomatch may be full but your soul is empty  without liberty.</p>
              <p>I remember in the old new regime of Soeharto. My parents would hush me up whenever I speak something that they thought was provoking. It was horrible I couldn't even speak up my thoughts in my own home. I know it may not be that extreme in Singapore but the longer the same people stay in power the more corrupt they will become. It's almost inevitable. LKY might be a good person to lead the country decades ago but people change. Situation change. If Singapore stays as it is now there will be no bright intellectual people willing to juggle and fight their living in Singapore. How come they can love something that is not a part of them. They have no say to their government they can't initiate change when they want to and they can't enter politics out of the blue.  So much of trying to be a genetic pool of bright people. Singapore will attract short term economic refugee instead.</p>

              <p>When I wrote that I'm a victim of the corrupt government of Singapore. Some people accused me of trying to make the opposition look bad. I've been defamed crazy by the ruler of Singapore through the NUH in 2002. I've refused medication and go on to complete my 7 semester degree locally in Indonesia. I know <strong>now for sure that Singapore is run by a tyrant</strong>. A deceitful liar and a man of no moral values. A cheater and a murderer, a corrupt man, a womanizer, a sadist and a torturer. A man whose life is an insult to God.</p>
              <p>I suspect that those people who accused me of trying to give the opposition a bad name are the ones who are actually posing as anti-PAP voices when in fact they are trying to give the opposition a bad name.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>One forumer even went to confront me in eternal hope. Mocking me whether I had felt better by posting in that forum. So what's the connection between posting a religious testimony and having myself feeling better? That forumer tried to get to my nerve by calling me living in delusion.</p>
              <p>Here's the quote</p>
              <p><em>Hope all you want and feel better. But I tell you that it is better to face reality and live in reality. Only then can you find true happiness. Chrtistians must live up to the standards set for them. "Love your neighbour"... hahaha... it benefits people like me. If you cannot do it, don't live in a delusion.</em></p>
              <p>Next time you see someone as an anti PAP regime think twice! He may be a faker.</p>

              <p>But despite the many grudges of Singaporeans regarding new policies whenever they are implemented, the government has done a pretty good job governing Singapore, hasn't they?</p>
              <p>And indeed we are much more prosperous than many of our neighbouring countries despite our relatively small size. One of the key to our success is the political stability present here in Singapore. Look at our neighbouring countries. Why is there a need to change the government if they are doing their job well? Yes, there may be some policies that we do not like but the government serves to do its job and not to make everyone happy.</p>
              <p>To add on to that, i believe the regime in Singapore is more authoritarian than totalitarian.</p>
