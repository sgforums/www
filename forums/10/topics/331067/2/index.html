              <p>What hybrid? It's a totalitarian regime. The general election is a make up, cosmetics to please and fool the crowds and has no real value of whatsoever to bringing democracy to Singapore. <strong>Your general election has become nothing but a tool to legitimate status quo</strong>. Just like in the days of the old new order regime in Indonesia.</p>
              <p>Actually countries in South east Asia are known not to be democratic in a real sense. These countries are comparatively young with largely uneducated population to begin with. A dictator was a pragmatic and practical solution to bringing political stabilization and rapid economic development. These countries include Malaysia, Indonesia and Singapore.</p>
              <p>Howwever as these countries develop themselves with rapid economic growth and the level of education of its population, its people inevitably will demand to be given more room of freedom.  Dictatorial rule will gradually lose its appeal especially to its younger generation who are better educated and which emphasizes change and eager for a change towards more liberty especially in political sector.</p>
              <p>Indonesia has started the path towards democracy. A flawed one though as it is now but we are heading towards democracy nonetheless with the toppling of the late former president Soeharto. Malaysia is gearing towards democracy as well. Signs of changing leadership is already at the gate. That leave Singapore stuck in the old style of dictatorial rule alone. Where are the young idealistic people in Singapore? Don't you believe in something? Your stomatch may be full but your soul is empty  without liberty.</p>
              <p>I remember in the old new regime of Soeharto. My parents would hush me up whenever I speak something that they thought was provoking. It was horrible I couldn't even speak up my thoughts in my own home. I know it may not be that extreme in Singapore but the longer the same people stay in power the more corrupt they will become. It's almost inevitable. LKY might be a good person to lead the country decades ago but people change. Situation change. If Singapore stays as it is now there will be no bright intellectual people willing to juggle and fight their living in Singapore. How come they can love something that is not a part of them. They have no say to their government they can't initiate change when they want to and they can't enter politics out of the blue.  So much of trying to be a genetic pool of bright people. Singapore will attract short term economic refugee instead.</p>

              <p>When I wrote that I'm a victim of the corrupt government of Singapore. Some people accused me of trying to make the opposition look bad. I've been defamed crazy by the ruler of Singapore through the NUH in 2002. I've refused medication and go on to complete my 7 semester degree locally in Indonesia. I know <strong>now for sure that Singapore is run by a tyrant</strong>. A deceitful liar and a man of no moral values. A cheater and a murderer, a corrupt man, a womanizer, a sadist and a torturer.

              <p>Here's the quote</p>
              <p><em>Hope all you want and feel better. But I tell you that it is better to face reality and live in reality. Only then can you find true happiness.

              <p>Who gave the mandate for Badawi to rule Malaysia? The people of Malaysia? No. It was Dr Mahathir. More like Mahathir handed over his rule to Badawi.The people didn't elect for Badawi.</p>
              <p>Mahathir has the wisdom of stepping down although he was very

              <p>Who gave the mandate for Badawi to rule Malaysia? The people of Malaysia? No. It was Dr Mahathir. More like Mahathir handed over his rule to Badawi.The people didn't elect for Badawi.</p>
              <p>Mahathir has the wisdom of stepping down although he was very successful at building Malaysia, though he doesn't have the wisdom of letting go.</p>
              <p>It's the same in Singapore. Who gave the mandate to Goh Chok Tong to rule in Singapore? The people of Singapore? No it was LKY. Likewise who gave the mandate to LHL to promote himself from DPM to PM? </p>
              <p>Like I said the general election in Singapore is nothing but a tool to legitimate status quo.</p>

              <p><br>You got problem against DPM getting promoted to PM is it? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p>This has always been the tradition for future PM, they all get promoted from DPM unless there is a change of ruling parties.</p>
              <p>You speaks of Democracy but you don't want to accept the democracy that is embraced by the people. I don't see any riots or malcontentment in Malaysia and Singapore when Badawi and Goh Chok Tong get promoted from DPM to PM.</p>
              <p>At least show some respect to the democracy chosen by the people before you come and lecture others about democracy.</p>
              <p>But I feel the people are happier when Badawi and Goh Chok Tong were PM in Malaysia and Singapore.</p>
              <p>Ohh....and why is it necessary for DPM to become the next PM? Because they were trained and they understood the duties of being a PM while working as the Deputy PM.</p>
              <p>You don't need a brain to figure that out right? Maybe it is necessary for a person to at least have a BRAIN first before they are allowed to speak of Democracy? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p>If your Democracy means having the people to vote for an inexperienced minister to be the next PM, then clearly you do not understand Democracy, Government, and how the country is run.</p>
              <p>How about next time when you are going to have SEX with your wife, you go set up voting booth and ask all your neighbours to vote and see if they want to allow you to have SEX or not....ok?</p>
              <p>This is Democracy at its best isn't it? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>they invest so much money to bring in talent, why the fuck they spend so much effort to expel talent?</p>
              <p>you didn't even keep the letter? than get another opinion from another doctor to rebuke the NUS doctor.</p>

              <p><br>Since you truly think that it is a cover up, get a second opinion then. Rebuke whatever the NUS doctor has determined with iron cast evidence. It's pointless to blame this on the government.</p>
