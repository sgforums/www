              <p>A BANK here has been ordered by the Court of Appeal to disclose details
              of a customer's account to the Attorney-General (AG).</p>
              <p>The AG had asked for the information on behalf of a foreign
                  government, which is conducting a criminal probe into the account
                  holder.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In an earlier ruling, the High Court had rejected the
                  request. It said then that it could not be sure that the details sought
                  by the AG were the same as those wanted by the foreign government. This
                  was because the request had not been produced in court.</p>
              <p>However, in a written judgment released yesterday, Chief
                  Justice Chan Sek Keong said the issue was not whether the request
                  should be shown to the court, but whether the laws relevant to its
                  approval had been followed.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The court noted that such requests are screened first by the
                  AG and then the Home Affairs Minister under prescribed procedures. It
                  said that a 'red flag' should not go up just because the request was
                  not produced to the court.</p>
              <p>'This screening process is a useful means to balance the
                  competing public interests of financial confidentiality and privacy on
                  the one hand, and on the other hand, ensuring that Singapore is not a
                  haven for money laundering,' said CJ Chan.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Lawyers said the case was significant as it was rare for the courts to order banks to disclose account details.</p>
              <p>Doing so, they said, sends a signal that Singapore is willing
                  to set aside a bank's need to preserve confidentiality in order to
                  fight transnational crime and prevent money laundering.</p>
              <p>Details of the foreign government, the bank and the account holder were not disclosed in the judgment.</p>
              <p>The foreign government, which was probing a case of criminal
                  conspiracy and fraud, had requested the full bank records of the
                  customer since the account was opened in 2000.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The request was made under the Mutual Assistance in Criminal
                  Matters Act, which is meant to facilitate assistance in criminal
                  investigations between countries.</p>
              <p>Noting that the High Court judge had also questioned whether
                  the AG had asked for more items than the foreign government had
                  requested, the Court of Appeal ruled that this was confusing the scope
                  of the request with the scope of the application.</p>
              <p>'If the request seeks the production of five items of
                  information from a bank, and the AG's application seeks the production
                  of eight items of information, there is nothing wrong with the request,
                  but there is something wrong with the application,' said the Chief
                  Justice.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The court noted that the judge had not doubted there was a
                  request. It said the police officer handling the case had submitted an
                  affidavit and 'there was no reason for the judge to take upon himself
                  the task of having to verify whether the AG had sought more or less
                  information than that requested by the requesting state'.</p>
