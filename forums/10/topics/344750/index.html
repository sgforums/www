              <p><span></span></p><blockquote>
              <p><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 12pt;">Recently,
              there have been calls for Malaysians to boycott US made products, in
              support of the latest brutal invasion on the Palestinians in Gaza,
              which already cost the lives of over 750 innocent civilians, especially
              non combatants like women, children and old folks. We should also look
              closely the other major supporters and 'strategic partners' of Israel,
              in the terms of defense, especially people so close to us.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 12pt;">SAR
              21 assault rifles and ammunition have been used to brutalise and
              massacre the defenseless and downtrodden non combatants Palestinians in
              Gaza, including women and children. Little that the world realise, SAR
              21 automatic assault rifles are indigenous weapon developed and
              manufactured by Singapore Technologies. The CEO of Temasek Holdings is
              Ho Ching, the wife of Singapore Prime Minister Brig. Gen. (NS) Lee
              Hsien Loong. Temasek Holdings is the parent company to Singapore
              Technologies, a GLC.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 12pt;">Singapore,
              have had very close and strategic partnership with the Israelis,
              especially in defense since their expulsion from the Federation of
              Malaysia 9 Aug 1965. Within two months, Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew
              received the Israeli Defense Attache based in their embassy in Bangkok
              for immediate military assistance, in favour against India and Egypt.
              Soon, six military advisers were dispatched to form the Singapore's
              pioneer military unit; the First Infantry Regiment, commonly known now
              as 1 SIR. The rest is as they say, is history.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 12pt;">Till
              present as being very good friends, Singaporeans still receive military
              assitance, especially advance training from the Israelis. Formalised
              military collaborations have been strengthened since then, especially
              when formal organisations are formed for the co-operation and
              development projects. The effort put by both nations on R &amp; D work
              on defense and strategic weaponry is immense. The progress and
              direction all of these co-operation and joint developmental work should
              be worried and frightened about. Singapore is Israeli third most
              important strategic partner in defense development.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 12pt;">Time
              an again, Singapore is being coined as "The Israel of the East". Hence,
              Malaysians should unanimously support the call to boycott Singaporean
              products, in support of our brothers living vicariously in their homes,
              now under siege and brutal bombardment.<br></span></p>

              <p>To date, Singapore has not exported the SAR-21 beyond small quantities to various police and special forces units around the world, including Indonesia, Peru, Morocco and Sri Lanka and Blangadesh.</p>

              <p>The point is not Singapore's policy towards the Middle East, but rather the eagerness of the Malaysian blogosphere and general public to begin Singapore bashing at the smallest suggestion of our past links with Israel.</p>
              <p><br>Many of the posters on this board idolise Malaysian bloggers,  see them as paragons of liberty, freedom of expression and an example to be emulated by us. Still more Singaporeans believe in the delusion that the virulent hatred of Singapore is confined to a small section of Malaysian political discourse when in fact such sentiments are extremely commonplace and permeate throughout the entirety of Malaysian society. Ask any man on the street in Malaysia and more likely than not you will get replies similar to what I have quoted.</p>

              <p>The point is not Singapore's policy towards the Middle East, but rather the eagerness of the Malaysian blogosphere and general public to begin Singapore bashing at the smallest suggestion of our past links with Israel.</p>
              <p><br>Many of the posters on this board idolise Malaysian bloggers,  see them as paragons of liberty, freedom of expression and an example to be emulated by us. Still more Singaporeans believe in the delusion that the virulent hatred of Singapore is confined to a small section of Malaysian political discourse when in fact such sentiments are extremely commonplace and permeate throughout the entirety of Malaysian society. Ask any man on the street in Malaysia and more likely than not you will get replies similar to what I have quoted.</p>

              <p>Singapore always has a policy that acts in favour of its own interests. In such a case, we would therefore remain neutral. Not to condemn, and not to support.</p>
              <p>Malaysians calling for a boycott of Singaporean products are just making use of the Israeli invasion as an excuse to hit out at Singapore. All along its been pretty obvious that our neighbours are jealous of us. Envy makes them hit out at us. Since the past, they always liked to stir up racial tensions but they always do not succeed. They should just fuck off and mind their own politics.</p>
              <p>Malaysia. Truly Racial.</p>

              <p>Foolish thoughts and ideas. First of all Singapore has made it clear that it doesnt support such a war against Gaza and second it'll just cause more problems for them.</p>
              <p>The recent opening of the new JB CIQ shows how dependent they are on Singapore. With the CIQ's complex move to a further location, Johor Town has seen a drastic decrease in business and is becoming  a ghost town simply because there are much lesser cars from singapore coming into that area. Imagine that effect multiplied, if a statewide or nationwide boycott occurs.</p>

              <p>frankly, Singapore will do the same thing as Israel if push came to shove..</p>
              <p>don't be an ass...</p>
              <p>if your goddamned neighbours attempt to annihilate you, and you soundly defeat them, would you give them a chance to do the same thing?</p>
              <p>and before THAT 6 days, did Palestine even exist?</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.eretzyisroel.org/~samuel/pic1.jpg" alt="" width="633" height="1125"></p>
              <p>where the hell is "Palestine" ?</p>
              <p>and.. if their arab brethern were so concerned about the "Palestinians", why the hell did they blockade them and then blame Israel?</p>
              <p>also, go look up "Black September" in Jordan when they massacred thousands of Palestinians.. it was when the Palestinians tried to take over Jordan.. no one batted an eyelid?</p>
              <p>back to now.. the fricken Hamas keep firing rockets instead of improving the lives of "their people" it's like a inferiority complex riddled hamster picking a fight with a boa constrictor.. then crying foul to the world they got "bullied"</p>
              <p>it's a fricken "victim mentality"... they would sacrifice the blood and lives and future of their children to pander to this psychosis they have to be "i am a martyr.. give me my 72 virgins"</p>
              <p>it sucks...</p>
              <p>and Israel should be slapped for falling for such a ruse too.. and their ham-fisted ways.. but then, what else could they do?</p>
              <p>the old saying is true... if the Palestinians put down their arms, there will be peace.. if the Israelis put down their arms, Israel would cease to exist...</p>
              <p>just look at the way the Iranians and the rest of the Arabs pour scorn on Israel whenever they try to negotiate peace... and tell me what the hell is going on..</p>

              <p>As it is, it doesn't matter how the Israelis do their way.</p>
