              Rich or poor, no worthy scholarship applicant will be turned away by the Public Service Commission. But should family income matter when deciding who is more deserving? New PSC chairman Eddie Teo gives his take on the issue

              <p>it looks better for his resume, and besides its unbecoming for such a talented young man to actually pay for his own studies when his equally talented family(LKY's words) have benefited from the state by the basis of their talents. don't sue me, that was LKY's explaination for having so many of his relatives in the govt or related bodies.</p>
              <p>they did mention whatever the original aim, currently the scholarship wasn't meant to benefit the poor who couldn't pay for their studies, just to tie talented people to the govt. there are other scholarships for the poor, this is meant for elites or would be elites.</p>

              <p>Your above two propositions conclude to a moot point unless you're addled enough to claim that grades are barred by race, language, religion or family background haha. Since grades are achievable here solely on the ability and motivation of the individual without racial, language, religion or family background obstruction, and to you is one of the drivers to a scholarship, your 1st sentence is the same as the second.</p>
              <p>BTW, you are so clueless if you think that all you need are "grades" for a scholarship in Singapore. I'm certain you do not know any real ones (Scholars. REAL ones. SAFOS, President's, OMS league. Not some lame duck, buay kan NUS bursary for the poor/study award from SAF/Lelong healthcare/teaching award holders who call themselves scholars).</p>
              <p>The perfect scorers don't even get to the first rate scholarships, they end up with the breadcrumbs like some stat board or teaching award that no top leaguers covet. The all rounders with near perfect scores AND mandatory ten thousand other things that are NON-academic do get to compete in the final leg of the 1st/top tier. Bloodbath begins and only a handful of the best men win.</p>
              <p>The only fools who think that "best grades" = "best scholarship" or "only grades required" = scholarship are the people outside looking in who have never ever had a brush with the subject matter they brazenly pontificate about, thinking that they're such know-it-alls but of cos making big fools of themselves.</p>
              <p>They're the people who went to below average JCs like VJ, NJ, TJC and below, stayed in SG all their sad lives and attended some village university like NUS arts and social science, had some fat gay bf who didn't make it to OCS, never had spoke to a SAFOS or OMS before in their lives. No interaction at all even mildly with the "circle". And they think they know-it-all,,very sad.</p>

              <p>The attainment process of scholarship is meritocratic and quoting input from skythewood "is independent of race, language, religion and family background".  So you are correct. For once in your life you say something that isn't as stupid as you are because its actually correct which is a miracle! Wow congrats~!<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>
