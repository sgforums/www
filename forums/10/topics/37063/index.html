Korea Tensions<br>Tue Mar 4, 7:15 AM ET<br><br>By CHRISTOPHER TORCHIA, Associated Press Writer<br><br>SEOUL, South Korea - The interception of a U.S. reconnaissance plane by North Korean fighter jets heightens tension on the Korean Peninsula amid fears that the North could make nuclear bombs within months.<br><br>Lt. Cmdr. Jeff Davis, a Pentagon (news - web sites) spokesman, said four North Korean fighter jets approached the U.S. plane over the Sea of Japan on Sunday, coming as close as 50 feet. One used its radar to identify the plane as a target, but there was no hostile fire, he said.<br><br>Davis said it was the first such incident since April 1969 when a North Korean plane shot down a U.S. Navy (news - web sites) EC-121 surveillance plane, killing all 31 Americans aboard.<br><br>In an interview with 14 U.S. newspapers, President Bush (news - web sites) repeated the U.S. stance that the situation can be resolved with diplomacy. According to The Baltimore Sun, Bush said that while the military option has not been taken off the table, it would be a last resort in dealing with the country's moves toward nuclear weapons production.<br><br>Asked how successful diplomatic efforts have been, Bush said: "It's in process. If they don't work diplomatically, they'll have to work militarily. And military option is our last choice. Options are on the table, but I believe we can deal with this diplomatically. I truly do."<br><br>The interception fit a pattern of recent North Korean actions that could be an effort to pressure the United States into negotiations on chief Northern aims: a nonaggression treaty and aid for its dilapidated economy.<br><br>"Ever since the nuclear issue surfaced, North Korea (news - web sites) has been taking steps to increase tension and to show its hostility," said Lee Suk-soo, a military studies professor at the National Defense College in Seoul.<br><br>"The reckless move is a signal to the United States at a time when Washington pays little attention to North Korea's repeated demand for direct dialogue," he said.<br><br>North Korea did not comment on the plane incident. Its state-run media instead criticized annual U.S.-South Korean military exercises that began Tuesday, saying they were preparation for an attack. The "Foal Eagle" exercise, which has been held since 1961, ends April 2.<br><br>"This Foal Eagle exercise is escalating the danger of armed clashes on the Korean Peninsula," said Minju Joson, a North Korean newspaper.<br><br>"If the eagle swoops down on us, a nuclear war will break out and it is clear that the whole Korean nation will not escape nuclear holocaust," said the report, which was monitored by South Korea (news - web sites)'s Yonhap news agency.<br><br>North Korea officials have repeatedly condemned the exercises with strong rhetoric.<br><br>North Korea on Tuesday reiterated its demand for a nonaggression pact, saying through Radio Pyongyang that it was "to remove unreasonable U.S. threat, not to gain something." The radio was monitored by Yonhap.<br><br>U.S. military officials say the annual maneuver is "defense-oriented" and is not related to the nuclear dispute.<br><br>Washington, which is preparing for a possible war against Iraq (news - web sites), says it will not be blackmailed into concessions and that North Korea's efforts to develop nuclear weapons are a multilateral issue. The U.N. Security Council is expected to debate the matter.<br><br>North Korea test-fired a missile into the sea off its east coast on the eve of South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun's inauguration last week.<br><br>On Feb. 20, a North Korean MiG-19 warplane crossed over the South's western sea border, but quickly retreated after South Korean jets flew to the area.<br><br>Last week, U.S. officials said North Korea had restarted a nuclear reactor that is at the center of a suspected weapons program. The 5-megawatt reactor could yield enough plutonium for an atomic bomb in about a year, experts say.<br><br>North Korea, which has warned that a U.S. attack on its nuclear facilities at Yongbyon would trigger war, could also decide to reactivate a reprocessing facility near the reactor. Such a move could allow it to make several nuclear bombs within months, according to defense analysts.<br><br>The United States believes the North already has one or two nuclear bombs.<br><br>In the Sunday incident, Davis said, the four North Korean planes "shadowed" the unarmed American plane over international waters for about 20 minutes before breaking off.<br><br>Two North Korean MiG-29 fighters and two other aircraft that Davis said appeared to be MiG-23 fighters intercepted the U.S. Air Force RC-135S reconnaissance plane, which Davis said was about 150 miles off North Korea's coast.<br><br>The closest the fighters came was about 50 feet, Davis said. He did not know how many crew members were aboard the RC-135, although the standard number is 17, including two pilots.<br><br>The U.S. plane broke off its mission and returned to its home station at Kadena Air Base in Japan, Davis said.<br><br>North Korean complaints about reconnaissance flights by U.S. planes had grown more frequent before the incident. On Saturday, the North said a U.S. RC-135 reconnaissance plane had intruded into its airspace off the east coast daily for a week. RC-135 planes are modified Boeing 707s.<br><br>The type of plane that was intercepted is loaded with electronic receivers and features large circular windows in the fuselage for the photography of foreign ballistic-missile tests at long range.<br><br>The current nuclear dispute began in October when U.S. officials said the North acknowledged it had a secret nuclear program in violation of a 1994 agreement.<br><br>Washington and its allies suspended oil shipments and North Korea responded by moving to reactivate frozen nuclear facilities and withdrawing from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.<br><br></div>

The US has deployed 24 long-range bombers to the Pacific base of Guam capable of launching such a strike.<br><br>Mr Kim, who has written a text studied by North Korean military leaders, predicted North Korea would restart its reprocessing plant to make weapons-grade plutonium this month.<br><br>A nuclear weapon would be produced by the end of next month, with another five by the end of the year, he said. This was on top of a suspected nuclear arsenal of 100 weapons.<br><br>The ultimate aim of North Korea's leader, Kim Jong-il, was the "neutralisation of the American factor" in the region, Mr Kim said.<br><br>This would be achieved by striking a non-aggression pact with the US or becoming an "official" nuclear power, thereby making the US nuclear umbrella in the region irrelevant. "Both ways, Kim Jong-il is a winner," Mr Kim said.<br><br>"By the end of the year, I predict Bush will be in Pyongyang suing for peace," Mr Kim said. While his comments are extreme, they match the heated and belligerent rhetoric of North Korea, which has previously warned of nuclear war and turning the cities of its enemies into a "sea of ashes".<br><br>The Bush Administration yesterday made renewed calls on China and other countries in the region to help broker a solution to the crisis. In his live televised press conference, Mr Bush said North Korea's nuclear program was a regional issue.<br><br>"I say 'regional' because there's a lot of countries that have got a direct stake into whether or not North Korea has nuclear weapons," Mr Bush said. "We've got a stake as to whether North Korea has nuclear weapons. China clearly has a stake as to whether or not North Korea has a nuclear weapon."<br><br>The Bush Administration is pushing for multilateral talks with North Korea but the communist state wants direct talks with Washington.<br><br>In the meantime, diplomatic activity is continuing behind the scenes. "We have a number of diplomatic initiatives under way - some of them very, very quietly under way - to see if we cannot get a multilateral dialogue started," the US Secretary of State, Colin Powell, told a US Senate Committee.<br><br>Yesterday the US also flagged the possible withdrawal of its 37,000 troops from South Korea, part of the rethink of a deployment in place since the end of the Korean War in 1953.<br><br>The US Defence Secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, said the US was consulting with South Korea and he suspected "we'll end up making some adjustments there".<br><br>"Whether the forces come home or whether they will move further south of the [Korean] peninsula or whether to some neighbouring area are the kinds of things that are being sorted out," he said at a "town hall" meeting in Germany.<br><br></div>

Korea: U.S. Plotting a Nuclear Attack<br><br>By JAE-SUK YOO<br>Associated Press Writer<br><br>March 9, 2003, 6:29 AM EST<br><br>SEOUL, South Korea -- North Korea on Sunday accused the United States of plotting a nuclear attack on the communist country and condemned Washington's decision to send additional long-range bombers to Guam.<br><br>North Korea claims the Bush administration is planning pre-emptive strikes on its military bases and nuclear facilities, which U.S. officials believe are being used to make atomic bombs.<br><br>North Korea's state KCNA news agency said the U.S. Department of Defense mapped out a plan including "not only cruise missile strikes and massive air raids, etc., but the use of tactical nuclear weapons."<br><br>The North's "army and people will take every possible self-defensive measure to cope with the U.S. bellicose forces' new war moves," it said.<br><br>Tension between Pyongyang and the United States increased last week after North Korean fighter jets intercepted a U.S. reconnaissance plane over the sea between the Korean Peninsula and Japan.<br><br>U.S. officials believe Pyongyang may be preparing to test fire another missile soon, following the launch of an anti-ship missile off its east coast late last month.<br><br>The Pentagon is deploying 12 B-1 and 12 B-52 bombers to Guam, about 2,000 miles from North Korea in case of conflict in the region.<br><br>"These moves indicate that the U.S. Air Force is taking the lead in implementing the U.S. imperialists' strategy to mount a pre-emptive attack on (North Korea)," said Pyongyang's official Rodong Sinmun newspaper.<br><br>Washington says it wants to settle the dispute diplomatically, but has not ruled out a military option.<br><br>Meanwhile, U.S. officials demanded that Pyongyang dismantle its nuclear facilities in Yongbyon during unofficial talks in Germany last month, a major Japanese daily said Sunday.<br><br>U.S. diplomats also called for Pyongyang to allow U.N. monitors to return to verify that it wasn't enriching uranium for its purported nuclear weapons program during the meetings at the North Korean Embassy in Berlin on Feb. 20-21, the Asahi newspaper reported.<br><br>North Korea rejected the demands and the meetings ended in disagreement, the paper said, citing an unidentified former U.S. official who attended the meeting. Pyongyang had proposed a visit by U.S. nuclear inspectors, it said.<br><br>U.S. officials were not immediately available for comment Sunday.<br><br>In Seoul, an opposition lawmaker urged South Korea to stop cash aid to North Korea, claiming the funds were being used to develop nuclear weapons.<br><br>Lee Hahn-koo said former President Kim Dae-jung's government provided $3.3 billion over the past five years, including $900 million in cash.<br><br>"The North's military would not have been able to achieve its current capacity without the Kim Dae-jung government's financial aid," Lee said in a news release.<br><br>The nuclear dispute flared in October when Washington said North Korea admitted pursuing a nuclear program.<br><br>Washington and its allies cut off oil shipments to the impoverished communist state. The North retaliated by expelling U.N. monitors, moving to reactivate its frozen nuclear facilities and withdrawing from the global Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.<br>Copyright Â© 2003, The Associated Press<br><br></div>
