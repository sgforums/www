            <div class='col-md body'>Only marry foreign women.<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>"Now you understand why US men prefer foreign born women: THEY TREAT US BETTER, RESPECT US, APPRECIATE THAT AFFECTION WE SHOW THEM, AND ACKNOWLEDGE OUR EFFORTS TO PROVIDE A BETTER LIFE."<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>A huge percentage of American women are selfish, flighty, insecure, needy and psychotic, and quite capable of concealing those traits during the dating phase<br><br>White 'career' American chicks are the bottom of the barrel marriage-wise.<br><br>Foreign women from South America, Eastern Europe, and Asia are at the top. Only guys who travel (in other words, guys who are successful and ambitious enough to travel a lot) find these. But they never, ever go back.<br><br>Foreign-born women living in the US are the next best. They get married early...they are highly sought-after by American guys for their wifely skills (hell, any women who has ANY ability to be a wife is better than your average American chick, who knows NOTHING about being a wife)<br><br>Bottom of the barrel---white American chicks. Yecch.<br><br>Here's a story: I knew a guy who was Hungarian (parents emigrated) who tried for 15 years to find a half-decent women to marry. He's a doctor, by the way. Finally after 8 psycho-weirdo US chicks, he went back to the 'old country' to find a wife. The people there were lining the women up for him to meet...he's a rich American guy...they are considered the best husbands in the world.<br><br>He found this lovely wife. She is a total gem, and he's happy as hell. 2 kids. Happily ever after.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>I will go one step further and differentiate between Western women vs. non-Western women. This is not just an American phenomenon, most women in Western countries have that cold, bitchy, superficial, stuck up attitude. A lot of Western women hold themselves as the pure center of the relationship. If the men don't fit a rigid and unrealistic criteria or she doesn't feel the man can take care of her enough (even if she has a higher paying job) then she will drop him like a hot potato, regardless of his character or commitment to the relationship.<br><br>Popular Myth: Western men looking for foreign wives are only seeking subservient slaves.<br><br>Truth: Most Western men today are evolved and modern and truly believe in the 50/50 system. Most Western men are dismayed by the lack of sincerity of Western women. I can do my own laundry and cooking thank you!<br><br>Yes, Latin American and Eastern European women do make better mates because both come from more conservative and family oriented cultures where relationships and commitment are actually revered.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>I was absolutely blown away by the quality of women on my trip to eastern Europe. Classy, cultured, traditional values, how could you ask for more?<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Latin American women seem to make decent wives. My friend married a hot girl from Venezuela. Sweet, beautiful, cooks, cleans, and is the perfect wife. Like how American women were in the 1950s America.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>As I said, it's a competitive marketplace. We're not looking to marry other men. The real world is not about what is fair, but what you can get.<br><br>American men have options. American women do not. So the American women huff and puff, and scowl at the incoming foreign brides who don't demand the feminazi equality bullshit. You WISH American men didn't have choices. You're like a labor union that's pissed off because the company is hiring non-union employees.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Honestly I wish I could have found an American wife with all the qualities of my foreign wife. I could not, because they do not exist. Here is a partial list of her loveliness<br><br>1: Sensible and good with money.<br>2: Genuine commitment.<br>3: Very family oriented.<br>4: She enjoys housework.<br>5: Hard working.<br>6: She does not have to diet to look great<br><br>Foreign women are comfortable in their femininity. As a male I am attracted to this. And I love her with all my heart.<br><br>I believe that American women have priced themselves out of the marketplace. Too needy, too many headgames, too easy to divorce.<br><br>Not many foreign men want American wives either.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>American women..<br>- highest maintenance (I've never heard of a foreign bride demanding her husband buy expensive house &amp; cars)<br>- fattest in the world<br>- most likely to cheat<br>- highest rate of divorce (60% - US-US marriages; 20% - US-foreign marriages)<br>- largest payout in divorce court (you'll be ass-raped for everything you earned, plus most of what you will earn for years to come)<br>- bitchiest<br>- most likely to nag constantly<br>- most likely to believe in feminism and "equality"<br>- most likely to hate men<br>- spend least amount of time with her children<br>- worst at cooking and cleaning<br>- fucked &amp; chucked by tons of guys before tricking you into marriage<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>3 reasons to marry an American woman<br><br>You actually believe BBW = big BEAUTIFUL wife.<br>You believe nagging is essential for personal growth.<br>You really look forward to the day your BBW wife divorces you and you gladly fork over 50% over your hard earned assets, plus child support and alimony (a lard ass bitch for sure is not going to have a good job). Then after that you have to figure out how to live on 20% of your income.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Every foreign girl I've met was superior in every conceivable way to any other girl I've known, from attractiveness to personality.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>I have a foreign Latino girl and she blows away American women. This web site are 100% true; I can speak from experience of living with my girl for a month. I could never go back to American trash women. I also use to think web sites like that were stupid until I had the experience for myself. It has changed my life for the better, made me look at American women in a different light.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>I wouldn't even consider dating an American women, the majority are bitchy prudes that only put out when they think they can cash in. I for one will never spend a huge amount of money of some stupid bitch just to get laid. Mexican and Asian women are a much better choice and they look better than American chics too.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>After many many years of dealing with American women, I've hit an interesting point. I've lost ALL sexual interest in them, in fact I just about puke walking down the sidewalk on any day, seeing all those shitty, rude, mean, snotty American women.<br><br>Strange thing, cause for so long I've been quite a horndog, chasing women at all levels. I'm still totally attracted to foreign women...Indians, Orientals, Europeans.<br><br>But show me an American chick and I basically couldn't care less. Tell me how "beautiful" she is...doesn't matter. I suppose from an intellectual viewpoint I can see the beauty, but it's not any more attractive to me than...let's say...admiring a beautiful horse or a well-groomed cat. OK, admirable, but not sexy folks.<br><br>They say that sex is 90% mental...well, my mind has rejected American women completely.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Since I've been traveling overseas I have met many nice Japanese, Russian, and Spanish women. I can tell you this....the women are so much better. I want a lady that, when I get home from work, would rather kiss me than scream at me for some trivial reason like I didn't mow the lawn. I can do without the nagging thanks. To all my fellow American men... American women are easily replaceable...go Asian, or Russian, even European (except British, Italian, and French women) and you can't go wrong. Experience is the best teacher.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>I can not date white American women anymore. I was in the navy and I have seen the light. Women from other countries just look better and treat you better too! I didn't pay for shit when I was overseas and I pay up the wazoo here. Any rational person can figure it out from here.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>American women are high-maintenance primadonnas with attitudes. I'd take a foreign born Russian or Latina woman any day. They are much nicer and normally MUCH SMARTER than most American women - plus they don't watch Rosie and Ricci Lake - they go to the library or perform outside activities.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Dating or being married to an American woman is like driving a beat-up Ford Escort. If you are only used to driving a beat-up Ford Escort, then you have no idea what it feels like when you drive a Bentley or Ferrari. You need to at least test-drive a Ferrari, so you'll have a reference point on what a real car feels like.<br><br></div>
