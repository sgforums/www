              <h1>Record private home sales: a boom or bomb in the making?</h1>
              <p>July 17, 2009 by admin  </p>
              <p><strong>By Jeremy Koh and Eugene Yeo</strong></p>
              <p>A relative of mine bought a 3 room unit of a 99 year old condominium in Tampines last month at a whooping $900,000K.</p>
              <p>If I remembered correctly, the median price of the project was only $700,000 in 2007.</p>
              <p>A colleague bought a penthouse at The Calrose for over $1.5 million
              dollars. The launch price 3 years ago was slightly less than $1 million
              dollars.</p>
              <p>Are we entering another bull run in the property market?</p>
              <p>The Straits Times seems to think so, at least from its suggestive headline “Record private home sales’: -</p>
              <p>“It was another electrifying month for the private home market, with
              sales last month surpassing even levels seen at the height of the boom
              two years ago.</p>
              <p>The recession-defying numbers for yet another month point to surging
              confidence among buyers and sellers, and signal that the worst is
              likely over.”</p>
              <p>[Source: <a href="http://singaporeenquirer.sg/?p=4187">Straits Times, 16 July 2009</a>]</p>
              <p>Are the good old days coming back soon? Will prices go up indefinitely?</p>
              <p>One does not need to be a property expect to realize that current
              prices are unsustainable in the long run for the following reasons:</p>
              <p>1. Though the government has moderated its GDP forecast in view of
              better than expected performance of the economy in the second quarter
              of 2009, the global economy, especially that of the United States,
              remain in the doldrums and is not expected to recover till the end of
              2010.</p>
              <p>2. Over 70% of the private residential projects are bought by
              foreigners which contributed to the latest property boom from 2006 to
              2008. With MNCs scaling down their operations and moving to cheaper
              destinations, the number of foreign buyers in Singapore’s property
              market is expected to decrease.</p>
              <p>3. Rentals continue to fall in 2009 as the market cools down, with the most appreciable decline noted in the prime areas.</p>
              <p>The average monthly rent for luxurious non-landed homes in Singapore fell 18.8% on a quarterly basis to $5.20 psf pm in Q1 2009.</p>
              <p>For example, St Regis rents start at $7,500 for the smallest 1,507
              sq ft three-bedroom unit and $20,000 for the 3,757 sq ft, four-bedroom
              unit, or around $5 to $5.30 psf per month. The average rent record for
              Grange Residences, a prime but slightly older condo, is at $6.20 psf
              per month at the end of last year.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, the average rents of non-landed homes in the prime
              districts fell 16.2% on a quarterly basis to $3.65 psf pm in Q1 2009.
              However, newer projects are still able to command rents of $4.60 psf to
              $5.00 psf per month. For example, the transacted rents for one-bedroom
              units of 690sq ft at the Sail @ Marina Bay now stand at $3,200 a month.</p>
              <p>[Source: <a href="http://www.iproperty.com.sg/news/573/Market-Update-Secondary-sales,-condo-rents-&amp;-investement-sales">iproperty.com</a>]</p>
              <p>4. There will be a deluge of new projects which will obtain T.O.P.
              in 2009 and 2010 thereby exerting further downward pressure on the
              prices.</p>
              <p>Based on these multitude of factors, it is highly unlikely that
              prices will continue to rise any longer. In fact, the market should be
              heading for a crash if it is not popped up artificially by the HDB
              resale market.</p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Singapore is
              the only democratic country in the world that has a huge public housing
              programme. Even china does not have a public housing programme that
              takes up 86% of all residential land. </span></span></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Due to the
              sheer size of Singapore’s public flat segment, and the tendency for the
              government to intervene directly in the property market, home prices in
              general (excluding the high-end segment) tend to swing back and forth
              within a manageable range. </span></span></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB"><span lang="EN-GB"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">The
              recent HDB resale transactions in March 2009 have shown that buyers are
              paying prices high enough to prop up the S$600 per sq ft threshold for
              most mass market condo projects.</span></span></span></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB"><span lang="EN-GB"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Flat
              buyers are paying between S$250 per sq ft to S$330 per sq ft just to
              own quarter-century old HDB resale 3-room flats in suburban areas such
              as Yishun, Woodlands and Hougang.</span></span></span></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB"><span lang="EN-GB"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">In
              Kim Tian Road, which is a short drive from the Central Business
              District (CBD), buyers would have to pay much higher per sq ft prices
              such as between S$450 per sq ft to S$550 per sq ft for six-year old
              resale 5-room flats. </span></span></span></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB"><span lang="EN-GB">[Source: <a href="http://www.iproperty.com.sg/news/638/Market-update-The-HDB-influence-in-the-market">iproperty.com</a>]</span></span></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB"><span lang="EN-GB">The resale prices of Housing
              Board flats have risen by 10 to 15 per cent in the past one to two
              years, despite the recession that began in September last year.</span></span>] </p>
              <p>The HDB may have contributed to the spike when it decided to raise
              the valuation prices of its flats last year, saying it would help
              buyers as a lower cash-above-valuation payment would result.</p>
              <p>While the cash request is slightly lower, the valuation price has
              leapt. The price of a four-room flat in Tampines is about $370,000 now,
              some $40,000 more than the price early last year - and this is largely
              due to the higher valuation price.</p>
              <p>Instead of helping to stabilise prices, the HDB’s spike in valuation has been instrumental in increasing resale prices.</p>
              <p>[Source: <a href="http://singaporeenquirer.sg/?p=4190">Straits Times, 14 July 2009</a></p>
              <p>How much longer can HDB continue to pop up the resale market? Will
              it come to a day when a four room 99-year resale HDB flat in the
              suburbs fetch more than $500,000K on average?</p>
              <p>Left alone to market forces, the prices of HDB resale flats are likely to plummet, at least back to the 2007 levels.</p>
              <p>The astronomical prices of HDB resale flats help to support the
              prices of mass market condos which in turn ameliorate the expected
              plunge in the prices of luxurious condos.</p>
              <p>Capitalizing on the profits made from the sale of their flats, HDB
              upgraders are able to afford paying over-valuation prices for private
              apartments and landed homes which in turn fuel the inflation of prices.</p>
              <p>It is a vicious cycle which will eventually implode upon itself in
              the event of a crash in either the high-end or HDB resale market.</p>
              <p>With the continued efflux of foreigners from Singapore, the high end
              market may crash sooner than later which will bring down prices
              drastically in the mass market condos and HDB flats in a domino-like
              effect.</p>
              <p>The median prices of HDB flats will never exceed that of mass market
              condos. They are after all, public housing built by the government and
              they are supposed to be easily affordable.</p>
              <p>Already, some HDB flats in prime areas like Bishan, Tanjong Pagar
              and Bukit Merah are fetching prices close to or exceeding that of
              condomniums in remote areas like Woodlands and Jurong.</p>
              <p>Unless the prices for the mass market condominiums continue to increase, the present HDB valuation hike is untenable.</p>
              <p>The ongoing “boom” in the property market may soon become a “bomb”
              for some when supply far outstrips demand precipitating a general drop
              in the prices.</p>
              <p>Given the economic uncertainty plaguing the world and Singapore in
              the days ahead, it is advisable not to purchase a property now unless
              it is absolutely necessary.</p>
              <p>It may be more prudent to sit on the fence and wait rather than to jump onto the bandwagon and get ‘burnt’ in the end.</p>

              <p>Since
              independence, our hosuing pricing has always go upwards because it
              contributes into GDP numbers, which in turn translates to higher bounus
              to ministers besides the millions of taxes it can generates.</p>

              <p><br>A little different isn't it?</p>
              <p>The crisis was started when loans were too easily available to people who couldn't even pay their loans. They just took the loan and sit on it for a few months/years and resell it. I don't think HDB is so exposed to this sort of speculation.</p>
              <p>I'm more curious of the effect if the HDB prices were brought down either through market actions or the changing of the government.  Seems to me there isn't much of a choice but to let the price go up.</p>
              <p>You piss off the people who are still paying the loans for the people who wants to buy new ones?</p>

              <p>The Singapore's private property market is somewhat unregulated as compared with the public property. Unregulated with regards to speculation. Rightly so, considering that it is a market for the wealthy, bold and daring.  <br><br>There is a book in Popular Bookshop or MPH by this guy called Eric Cheng who made his fortune on the real estate. In one portion, he described how agents and speculators time themselves during the start of a boom market to ''flip" the market, driving price up and profit into their pockets.   <br><br>Isn't it telling that in the the last quarter, there were record high number of property agents entering the market?   </p>

              <p>You said it right, bro. This was what happening in the US's real estate. <br><br>The whole issue of sub-prime lending crisis (lending to people wtih no credit worthiness) has dragged the ordinary US working folks, along with the rogues speculators, to their knees with foreclosure, backruptcy and despair.   <br><br>Somehow, many sheltered Singapore, good or bad times, can only see growth, growth, money, money and not the wisdom of your statement.</p>
