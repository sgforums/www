              <p><br>of cos, why not?</p>
              <p>you don't need everyone to be concerned, but enuf to let the gahmen know that we are aware of what's happening and that they do have an accountability to the ppl of singapore.</p>
              <p>the problem is this gahmen has been practising an inconsistent administration on being transparent. we are all fed incomplete or selected news.</p>
              <p>singaporeans have been taken for a ride for far too long, and thank goodness for technology, information flow are now a lot more open.</p>
              <p>i am not denying that singapore has rise to be a pheonix in the region with impressive infrastructure growth and the ppl's well being are better off, but for the riches singaporeans helped contributed to the country and how these riches are now hoarded by a certain family in the name of `protecting our assets', the common ppl still have a very raw deal.</p>
              <p>even in the latter, their folly after folly in the handling of the SWF demonstrates that they are the last persons we want to trust our money with.</p>

              <p>These products include Lehman Minibonds and Merrill Lynch Jubilee Series 3.</p>
              <p>Senior Minister of State (National Development and Education) Grace Fu gave this update in Parliament on Monday, in response to a question from Nominated MP Eunice Olsen.</p>
              <p>Since Dec 1 last year, the amount that town councils can invest in non-government stocks, funds or securities has been capped at 35 per cent of the sinking fund.</p>
              <p>Holland-Bukit Panjang invested about 6.7 per cent of its total funds available for investment in the structured products, and Pasir Ris-Punggol, about 2.6 per cent.</p>
              <p>The sinking funds are used to pay for long-term or cyclical expenditure, such as replacing lifts, pumps and pipes, re-roofing, and repairing and redecorating blocks.</p>
              <p>The funds are also used to pay for lift upgrading, so that residents pay a smaller percentage of the total lift upgrading cost.</p>
              <p>The sinking fund is distinct from the operating fund, which is used for short term expenditures.</p>
              <p>Ms Fu said town councils need to invest their funds prudently so that the accumulated funds are not eroded by inflation.</p>
              <p>The investment guidelines - which her ministry has no plans to change - seek to achieve an optimal balance between reasonable returns and financial prudence, she added.</p>
              <p>She noted that investments in stocks, funds or securities must be on the advice of a qualified person, such as an investment adviser holding a licence under the Securities and Futures Act, and an approved bank or a merchant bank approved as a financial institution under the Monetary Authority of Singapore Act.</p>
              <p>The 16 town councils manage more than $1 billion in sinking funds.</p>

              <p>town council is suppose to be a public service organisation, not a profit making organisation. it should not have any rights to overcharge the people so that it will have a big investment fund, which would not help the residents in any case.</p>
