              <p>speak for yourself, I don't need you to give me words about it.   If you want to do it the rally way, go ahead, but I believe you talk only.  If you truly wants protests, start your own, no need to depend on others.</p>
              <p>You can go on wondering if they bother or not.   I have reap what I sow.  Foreigners are appreciative of the fact that there are people who bother to tell them the truth.   Not all foreigners are aware of the ways of the ruling party, especially those uneducated or not well educated.    Me and my friend managed to discourage one china lady from converting to citizen.  She was so ignorant of the ways of the ruling party.    I am doing within my capacity, something small and helpful.    People have the right to know the truth and reality of the ways of the ruling party.  If you want to help them know, tell them about it.   </p>

              <p>approve of course..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>economically - generally cheaper to employ, cost less to maintain (in goverment point of view in terms of subsidys tax payment and rebates...) in case you doesn't know how much money your goverment spend a year to let you sit here comfortably and whine...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>foreigners generally got less needs and demand too and if theres any its usually basic needs... they had the mindset of leaving home to another place to earn a living thus will offset that when they had the feeling of being mistreated.... whereas a singapore will make a big fuss abt it and complaint to the whole world..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>higher educated foreigners usually pay higher taxes and also their spending power is greater thus not very used to our culture they always spend at some destinated spot where it cost more.. spending is a economy multiplier in case you duno..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>they also bring in their knowledge and thus we benefit from them..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>internationally.. it increase our standing.. more ppl know us.. more ppl are linked to us as a result we got more negotiating power ended up in more deals and trade...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>not to mention some jobs like cleaner, construction worker they are doing our dirty jobs...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>all these enable your goverment to top up your medi save, giv you money every year, rebate your flat upgrading, giv you free class C ward, giv every singaporean basic insurance coverage, pay for our safetly and security so that we can jalan around the street during midnight.. every country is suffering from inflation some even stagflation but they dun hav the benefits we enjoy..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>if you say they bring up crime rate- i bet spoilt kid are more likely and take up more % of the crime rate</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>if you said they took away your job- there are still rules and regulation in businesses in terms of ratio between singaporean and foreigners go MOM webby see ba.. and generally singaporean got an edge over foreigners in terms of communication and when it come to promotion and stuff you still win over them.. skillwise i dun see why we are inferior til we are scare of their presence.. unless if you are someone who whine all day and not striving for self improvement.. then u go where also the same..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>if you say they marry your girls or guys- HAHHAA as a guy i find myself more spoilt with choices and as for girls i guess they are thankful someone can tahan the typical sg ger temper~~~ hot and spicy~</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>please treat everyone with equality... you didt pledge everyday in sch last time for fun... we are already advantaged those who doesn't make use of the edges prolly deserve it.. so look at the bigger picture ok? the world didt jus evolve around ur backyard</p>

              <p>if theres no risk of becoming the minority and replaced eventually why not? please your goverment know that issue long before you started whining here.. they got nothing to gain if that happen anyway.... but they cant openly do it like wat malaysia been doing.. it affect our image... look at things properly u will know...</p>
              <p>i really feel for those foreigner.. ppl look down at them, they work hard, and end of the day not appreciated.... change your focus and start to make your life a better one.. then you will see things from more angle everyone should be treated equally lor... issnt it like what i said? too spoilt.... not liberal enough... why take the whole cake when u cant finish it? every singapore got a headstart already(means a destinated size of the cake).. if you wan more get it with ur own ability... everything also dependant = = typical again..</p>

              <p>the taiwanese ppl has higher political awareness compare to Sgoreans. that is without a doubt.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>One of major reason is the role of the media. In taiwan, almost every TV station( maybe less MTV channel) has a timeslot for political discussion. This in turn will raise the awareness of citizens and thus exert pressure on the govt to action against potential area of corruption.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>TV station has to be unbiased, actively enageg the sgoreans on sensitive issues, give a platform for opposition opinion. Only then can we have glimpse of hope for full democratic society.</p>

              <p>do the taiwanese ppl really have higher political awareness? they supported Ah Bi and æ°‘è¿›å…š for 8 years and now æ°‘è¿›å…š wants a clear cut with ah bi, are the taiwanese ppl really awared of what's going on?</p>
              <p>The taiwanese ppl were under the one party å›½æ°‘å…š they kbkp so they had a new government 8 years ago, and painfully, they became aware of  what politics is all about so they unanimously re-elected å›½æ°‘å…š. We really don't have to feel the pain before we know what hurts.</p>
              <p>Exactly what "full democratic society" can do for us I don't know, but so far this half democratic, or sugu democratic society seems alright compared to the taiwanese society. Singaporeans are conservative, one bird in hand is better than two in the bush.</p>
