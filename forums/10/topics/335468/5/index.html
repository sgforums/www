              <p>The very basis of democracy is going to lead to bickering, that's the point of it all isn't it? You really think you can get mature individuals to talk nicely in a room through a system where it's the person who shout the loudest that get the votes? </p>
              <p>Singapore is nothing more than a harbor port, every major companies we have here caters to the world market and thus if the world goes into a recession, we automatically go into a recession. It's pretty simple logic isn't it?</p>
              <p> It's the price of globalisation.</p>
              <p>You know, the reason why you can get a cheap Made-In-China PC at home to talk to us on this forum? The reason why you can get a job to even pay for this Made-In-China PC?</p>
              <p>This "rich" reserve you talk about is the primary reason why Singapore is not loaded down with debt like Japan and Korea.</p>
              <p>Taiwanese entrepreneurs? I wonder if you've actually talk to Taiwanese before. So far only their IT industry is still going strong. That, at least is the impression i got from the Taiwanese on the ground, not through the global media.</p>
              <p>Hong Kong and Taiwan has this huge thing next to them called C-H-I-N-A. Somehow you always fail to factor that into your statements.</p>

              <p>Did LKY learn how to run Singapore's economy from Chiang Ching-kuo ?</p>
              <p>Where did you get your information from, or did you depend on your own interpretation of history in the same manner that LKY re-wrote Singapore's history ?</p>
              <p>LKY was in the political hot seat since 1957, when Chiang only assumed political office in 1972 till 1978 -  a time when Singapore was already into industrialisation with Jurong being reclaimed as early as the late 1960s.</p>
              <p>Can any economy thrive without the existence of SME's today ?</p>
              <p>Even as the Singapore Government has belatedly recognised the role of the SME - which it had discouraged in the 1970s in favor of supposedly larger enterprises that they claimed offer economies of scale, the Taiwanese government had formed a <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.moeasmea.gov.tw/ct.asp?xItem=340&amp;ctNode=258&amp;mp=2">Taiwan Ministry of Economic Affairs committed to legal advocacy for SMEs. </a></p>
              <p>Taking an extract from an Asian Development Bank report, it indicated that in 2006 the Taiwanese had <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.adb.org/documents/books/ADO/2007/TAP.asp">‘Services accounting for 73% of GDP dominated by small and medium enterprises’.  </a></p>
              <p>The success of Taiwanese enterprise was not a result of politics, in the same manner as the heavy handed Political Interference of the PAP in every aspect of Singapore's Life had allowed the PAP Government to monopolise the political and economic spectrums for their own selfish benefit.</p>
              <p>After 51 years, we now know the ultimate goal - Ministerial appointment and GLC appointment that pays millions. </p>

              <p>Taiwan's political system at least allowed for open debate and access by the press to investigate and publish the details of <a rel="nofollow" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6112668.stm">‘Taiwan’s Chen in corruption case’  </a>- compared to Singapore's muzzled press, and the Singapore Government habit to sue for self-assessed injury from self-assumed defamatory statements even when the details are well known concerning the FIRST Family appointment to Government Linked Companies.</p>
              <p>Are you now claiming that the Taiwanese political system do not give the Taiwanese Citizens wider political latitude compared to Singaporeans ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Did LKY learn how to run Singapore's economy from Chiang Ching-kuo ?</p>
              <p>Where did you get your information from, or did you depend on your own interpretation of history in the same manner that LKY re-wrote Singapore's history ?</p>
              <p>LKY was in the political hot seat since 1957, when Chiang only assumed political office in 1972 till 1978 -  a time when Singapore was already into industrialisation with Jurong being reclaimed as early as the late 1960s.</p>
              <p>Can any economy thrive without the existence of SME's today ?</p>
              <p>Even as the Singapore Government has belatedly recognised the role of the SME - which it had discouraged in the 1970s in favor of supposedly larger enterprises that they claimed offer economies of scale, the Taiwanese government had formed a <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.moeasmea.gov.tw/ct.asp?xItem=340&amp;amp;ctNode=258&amp;amp;mp=2">Taiwan Ministry of Economic Affairs committed to legal advocacy for SMEs. </a></p>
              <p>Taking an extract from an Asian Development Bank report, it indicated that in 2006 the Taiwanese had <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.adb.org/documents/books/ADO/2007/TAP.asp">‘Services accounting for 73% of GDP dominated by small and medium enterprises’.  </a></p>
              <p>The success of Taiwanese enterprise was not a result of politics, in the same manner as the heavy handed Political Interference of the PAP in every aspect of Singapore's Life had allowed the PAP Government to monopolise the political and economic spectrums for their own selfish benefit.</p>
              <p>After 51 years, we now know the ultimate goal - Ministerial appointment and GLC appointment that pays millions. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When using such a term to criticise others, I try to spit it in the right direction and to be certain that it is not against the wind.</p>

              <p>To be honest, I haven't read LKY's menoir. I heard about Singapore and Taiwan relationship, LKY and Jiang JK in the following Taiwanese program, presented by Taiwanese political analysts. Apparently Singapore built the jurong industrial estate, like the xinzhu industrial estate in Taiwan. In a certain year, in a regional economic downturn, Singapore had no growth but Taiwan maintained a 6% growth, that was when Jiang told LKY the secret, investment in research and development in Technology and in Human Resources. I guess this is extended to these days, when we are putting so much emphasis on the elites, the FT, and for the same reason, countries like Malaysia can dedicate a big piece of land called Multi Media Corridor, or logistic hub,...but cannot succeed. The original idea came from Jiang JK.</p>

              <p>I stand corrected for the statement on the taiwanese SME. I do recognise the fact that in Singapore, young people come out from colleges and universities to look for employment, while Taiwanese come out hoping to start new businesses. Singaporeans, because we speak english, there are many opportunities in the MNCs, but there are few Taiwanese who graduate speaking english (only those who went overseas), so they either work in the local companies or start their own.</p>
              <p>In the early days of development, the Taiwanese could start small factories in the remote areas outside Taichung, to manufacture products for export, or nearby Xinzhu or Yunlin to support the big manufacturers in those industrial estates. No expensive rentals, no rules, not even the environmental protection rules to follow, could employ farmers nearby, if not just buy some local made machineries (copied). Besides, they have sizable local markets.</p>
              <p>There are reasons why Taiwan develops the way they do. Their government played a part but not all. The big taiwanese conglomerates started during the rule of KMT, but we don't hear any new taiwanese companies developed during the rule of ah bian, democratically elected, ruled with full democracy, but did nothing for the economy. </p>
              <p>Singapore government is playing a much bigger role in trade and economic development in Singapore, for Singapore. From the start, the then english speaking elites didn't need to start own business, those from RI went to government service, those from ACS went to become lawyers and accountants, the Chinese speaking businessmen ended up dealt with Indonesians and Malaysians... besides, the market in Singapore was not big enough for SME to do local business. So is it right or wrong for the government to play a bigger role? I am not an enterpreneur myself, I hope my sons can be...but if they wait for the government, they will never be...</p>
              <p>Finally, the direction of the wind here in this forum is against everything and anything, closely or remotely linked, or no linked to PAP. Luckily I don't spit, so I don't care whichever is the wind directiion.</p>

              <p>In any political forms, Government will always have a part to play in developing and providing the space for enterprise and enterpreneurship - as it must provide the infrastructure and some sense of security for investment to take place.</p>
              <p>While the Taiwanese Government provide the frame work for private enterprise to succeed, it also participate in the competitive environment of free enterprise, which is unlike that of the Singapore circumstance where Government Linked Companies will trample the small and medium businesses.</p>
              <p>'Ah Bian' had his own political obligations to fulfill after stepping into the Presidency, as his political agenda was not his own but that of previous President Lee Teng-hui - whose main goal was to strive for the independence of Taiwan.</p>
              <p>This explains for Ah Bian's wasted two terms of economic inactivity which resulted in Taiwan's economy floundering on its own strength from Private Enterprise that allowed Taiwan to stay afloat even as Singapore was the FIRST Asian country to declare going into recession.</p>
              <p>After experiencing the second and third economic downturns, each time Singapore had organised Economic Review Committee - in 1997 and repeated again in 2002; with both reports encouraging the lower absorption of private money into the CPF and allowing private capital to release the entrepreneurial spirit of Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>Both reports had reasoned that small and medium enterprise should be encouraged to grow as it can provide employment opportunities that are more resilliant towards changes in economic circumstances.</p>

              <p>Singapore government is playing a much bigger role in trade and economic development in Singapore, for Singapore. From the start, the then english speaking elites didn't need to start own business, those from RI went to government service, those from ACS went to become lawyers and accountants, the Chinese speaking businessmen ended up dealt with Indonesians and Malaysians... besides, the market in Singapore was not big enough for SME to do local business. So is it right or wrong for the government to play a bigger role? I am not an enterpreneur myself, I hope my sons can be...but if they wait for the government, they will never be...</p>

              <p>I believe that the correct statement made was that RI students go into government and hold political power, while ACS students go into commerce to hold economic power.</p>
              <p>Some students from both schools became very good lawyers and accountants, as well as engineers and other professions as Singapore's economic growth opened up alot more employment opportunities, at the expense of small and medium business. whose growth were stifled by the unfair competition from GLCs.</p>
              <p>GLCs have been discovered to plagiarised local designers' patents through reverse engineering and modifying the product designs to by-pass patents. If not for some other Government agencies acting as "angel investors" in new enterprises, the fight with the mamoth GLC would have been lost from the start.</p>
              <p>Government involvement should be limited to infrastructure and strategic industries that are seen to be vital to the interest of the country, and should not use Public Funds to set up enterprises that swamp Private Enterprise.</p>
