              <p>When i was growing up, there was no Young or Kid PAP that i had to join. I don't have to go through any indoctrination classes or said Hail Lee Kuan Yew to his picture every morning.</p>

              <p>Then i started understanding why that the PAP is a great deal better than the other choices out there. Because it's able to plan in strategic terms, not react in a knee jerk manner in most democracies.  We're not weighted down with external debts like our neighbours.  (Malaysia has done a good job of this too, despite my prejudices)  </p>
              <p>I don't worship the PAP, it's still inefficient and have its problems. But i find the idea that multiple parties will automatically promise a better government laughable because keeping the population satisified and happy is a pipe dream, human greed can never be satisifed. We will always want more and better stuff.</p>
              <p>Do i think that the PAP always make good decisions? No.</p>
              <p>But what defines a good decision? The one that makes people happy? Or the one that demands sacrifices to create a more sustainable future?</p>
              <p>Do i open the storehouses so that people can have full meals for the forseeable future? Or do i ration it out just in case of a major natural disaster?</p>
              <p>We pick and poke on the mistakes that the PAP made and always ignored the things they've done well. Looks at our commodities, there's inflation yes but did it go out of control during the high oil and grain prices? Did our food prices skyrocket?</p>

              <p>Stevenson, i absolutely agree with u. Look at SKorea, brilliant democracy, look at the economy. Same goes with many western countries with coalition govs. No consenses... Very inefficient. Many sporeans take pap leadership for granted. Always wondered why because they REALLy care for the people, unlike countries which have leaders who are absolutely selfish and take posts for their own gain. SO PLEASE be grateful we have a good government which cares for the People(Though not like Western socialism, i think that is the first way to economic bankruptcy btw).</p>
              <p>I am not a pap posterchild by the way,  i m 0.5 korean, so this is just my honest viewpoint on spore politics</p>

              <p>maybe the gov here did not give much room for the opposition to flourish but judging from what i read and see during the last election their plans is simply not sustainable enough.. short sighted..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>so i can said we are not pro goverment..... its simply becos theres no one else better around... </p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>You'd be surprised at how insidious this aspect of the human brain can be. Humans, especially male brains have never evolved to understand content. Though admittedly, human society only reached this stage because we never understood content.</p>
              <p>That's why after each high, the drive for us(males) to experience the next high (Gambling winnings, sex with a beautiful woman, lottery, winning a computer game,  equipment in an online game) becomes almost overwhelming for us. And our brain will try its best to force us to seek out the next high.</p>
              <p>Is my theory far fetching? Perhaps, but pay attention the next time you are convincing yourself to buy that nice electronic gadget, that sexy car or the epeen apartment. Then imagine IF you get it, how long are you going to stay satisfied?</p>
              <p>This is a reason why depression often inflicts lottery winners, because they just can't satisfied a high like winning a lottery.</p>
              <p>The same reason why men are especially vulnerable to alcoholism, drug addiction, adultery..etc. The instinct will drive us to think we logically need to satisfy that urge.</p>
              <p>I'm not a woman, so i can't really comment too much on woman psyche. But considering we descend from the same womb, i don't think women are free from such instincts too.  </p>
