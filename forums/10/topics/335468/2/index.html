              <p> </p>
              <p>One of major reason is the role of the media. In taiwan, almost every TV station( maybe less MTV channel) has a timeslot for political discussion. This in turn will raise the awareness of citizens and thus exert pressure on the govt to action against potential area of corruption.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>TV station has to be unbiased, actively enageg the sgoreans on sensitive issues, give a platform for opposition opinion. Only then can we have glimpse of hope for full democratic society.</p>

              <p>I absolutely agree with you.   Taiwanese are more mature and aware politically.   At least they bother to put in effort to know what is happening in the political scene and think analytically.</p>

              <p>Depends on the propaganda.</p>
              <p>For example if someone spread below propaganda, we must disapprove, not approve:</p>
              <p><a href="http://educate-yourself.org/nwo/">http://educate-yourself.org</a></p>
              <p><a href="http://www.threeworldwars.com/nwo-timeline1.htm">http://www.threeworld</a></p>
              <p>Above is complete horseshit, complete rubbish.</p>
              <p>Nonsense plucked out of thin air.</p>
              <p>So if someone spreads above propaganda, we must oppose, not support.</p>

              <p>speak for yourself, I don't need you to give me words about it.   If you want to do it the rally way, go ahead, but I believe you talk only.  If you truly wants protests, start your own, no need to depend on others.</p>
              <p>You can go on wondering if they bother or not.   I have reap what I sow.  Foreigners are appreciative of the fact that there are people who bother to tell them the truth.   Not all foreigners are aware of the ways of the ruling party, especially those uneducated or not well educated.    Me and my friend managed to discourage one china lady from converting to citizen.  She was so ignorant of the ways of the ruling party.    I am doing within my capacity, something small and helpful.    People have the right to know the truth and reality of the ways of the ruling party.  If you want to help them know, tell them about it.   </p>
