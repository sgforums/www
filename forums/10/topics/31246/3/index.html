It was like being borned and breed in the Cdo family. We eat, sleep, trained, suffered and relaxed together made us more of a co-hesive, fighting unit!</div>

Ever heard of recce or sniper units? Each is a class in its own. Be it CDO, SOF, normal infantry, they are all impt units in the army. Lets not overlook them. I am from the recce unit. Like you CDO, my mates and I went through some tough training too. So maybe it is not right to assume that only in CDO do you get the same bonding of brotherhood, espirt de corps.<br><br>There was this article which I read sometime back, one black op operative quoted " the true professional are the quiet ones. They don't go around announcing their presence. Cause it will invite a bullet to their head. Let their action prove their worth." A point to ponder perhaps?</div>
