              <p>I came across this electronic paper on the web....it is a good references for those who continue to look at current influx of chinese immigrant or others minority within the regions...and draw your own conclusion of how the past was differ from the current situation....</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.ari.nus.edu.sg/docs/wps/wps03_010.pdf">http://www.ari.nus.edu.sg/docs/wps/wps03_010.pdf</a></p>
              <p>Author: Mark Ravinder Frost.</p>
              <p>Asia Institute Research,</p>
              <p>National University of Singapore</p>
              <p><a href="mailto:arimrf@nus.sg">arimrf@nus.sg</a></p>
              <p>Dated: August 2003</p>
              <p><strong><em>primary discussion on this paper is as quote " how communities of local born born and locally settled Chinese in Singapore interacted with new waves of chinese mirgants in the nineteen century and than later how they responded to the cultural and political ideas emanating from the mainland Chinese mainland, " (pg 4, Frost)</em></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But just to highlight one point of the stark different in the past chinese immigrant they came and they started their little 5 sqftt business. And do their trading. Those that made it settled down and married local residents or thru Family match make from China to establish family network here in Singapore.   There were plenty of rubber field and trading to expand....the unique geographical location provide expansion on admitting regional migrant. </p>
              <p>another aspect of differences back in the 1918 it takes 3 months on the Junk and depend upon wind direction on their sailing if you missed the Junk. Migrant have to wait for another years. These days it takes 4 hours flight if you missed the flight chances is that you can get another flight in 12 hours....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For those who are interested in what happen in the Past in Singapore please read on I welcome different perspective....</p>
              <p><strong>How old perception may not work in todays global enviornment....</strong> </p>
              <p>I had a filppino friend who work in a global company...he visited china to qualifiy vendors and when he was staying in Hotel in HKG...he was followed by the Hotel Security Guard...thinking that he was a migrant worker...</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">What happened in 1819 were definitely different from the present day. In the past, migrants and their descendent in Singapore "were forced to choose between one of two education options." They experienced how the british sanctioned their “exploration of their plural identities and their interest in opening china commercially”, but “the china orientation of the straits Chinese was being used to bar them from political representation in the administration”. I can imagine how the Chinese in Singaporean then must have felt when in 1930 Britian and China agreed that Chinese British subjects could no longer claim British national status whilst visiting China, and at the same time they are "being withheld from appointment to higher positions in the colonial government." The Chinese then were made to choose between a colonial master and their motherland, they were</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Today, we choose what kind of Singaporean we want to be.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">There is no dual nationality for Singaporean, and we are protected by the constitution of Singapore, not the queen in Buckingham palace or the emperor in the Forbidden City.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Today, immigrants decide where they want to go, in the past, their destination was decided by the wind.</span></span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The predominantly English speaking Straits Chinese represents a small part of the modern cosmopolitan Singapore. Even among the Chinese Singaporean, there is still a large portion who came to Singapore after 1949, from china (before China became PRC), Malaysia, HK, Taiwan, Indonesia…and these are authentic Singaporean. </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">What remains unchanged is that Singaporean will have to continue to interact with new wave of immigrants, and respond to new cultural and political ideas, from PRC, India, the region, and even US, UK, and australia via the net. Besides trading, there are plenty of joba for the economy to expand. Of course, last time, the fruits of economy expansion went to Buckingham palace, now it goes to Istana or MAS at Shenton Way. </span></span></p>

              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">What happened in 1819 were definitely different from the present day. In the past, migrants and their descendent in Singapore "were forced to choose between one of two education options." They experienced how the british sanctioned their “exploration of their plural identities and their interest in opening china commercially”, but “the china orientation of the straits Chinese was being used to bar them from political representation in the administration”. I can imagine how the Chinese in Singaporean then must have felt when in 1930 Britian and China agreed that Chinese British subjects could no longer claim British national status whilst visiting China, and at the same time they are "being withheld from appointment to higher positions in the colonial government." The Chinese then were made to choose between a colonial master and their motherland, they were</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Today, we choose what kind of Singaporean we want to be.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">There is no dual nationality for Singaporean, and we are protected by the constitution of Singapore, not the queen in Buckingham palace or the emperor in the Forbidden City.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Today, immigrants decide where they want to go, in the past, their destination was decided by the wind.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The predominantly English speaking Straits Chinese represents a small part of the modern cosmopolitan Singapore. Even among the Chinese Singaporean, there is still a large portion who came to Singapore after 1949, from china (before China became PRC), Malaysia, HK, Taiwan, Indonesia…and these are authentic Singaporean.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">What remains unchanged is that Singaporean will have to continue to interact with new wave of immigrants, and respond to new cultural and political ideas, from PRC, India, the region, and even US, UK, and australia via the net. Besides trading, there are plenty of joba for the economy to expand. Of course, last time, the fruits of economy expansion went to Buckingham palace, now it goes to Istana or MAS at Shenton Way.</span></span></p>
