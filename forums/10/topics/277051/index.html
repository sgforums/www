            <div class='col-md body'>Those newspapers or magazines etc......they are just a group of people, they are publishers, writers, editors, cartoonists, etc.....those people working in there.<br><br>If a publication do something provocative, its their own responsibility, a group of people. It's not the responsibility of a whole country, of other people who totally have nothing to do with it, or might even disapprove it.<br><br>So for these cases, when certain publications offend some people, but the protest is enlarged to a whole nation, it brings an awkward situation. Nobody knows what to do.<br><br>This is just a mismatch or a misunderstanding due to a different cultural environment.<br><br>In many Asian countries and Muslim countries, press is censored, and also there is a greater emphasis on collective good over individual freedom or group freedom.<br><br>In Western countries, press is not censored, and also there is a much greater emphasis on individual freedom and group freedom.<br><br>So I see these cases more as a cultural clash.<br><br>Mind you, some groups in Western countries have channelled and targetted their 'freedom of expression' for a long time on the main religion there itself, Christianity. They also have ridiculed Christianity in many ways.<br><br>So again.......I see this more as a cultural clash, at the heart of it. It's a difference of social philosophy.<br><br>But I think to myself.....maybe this cultural clash isn't neccessary, because some newspapers or some magazines, they don't represent any nation at all. A magazine is not a president. They dont represent or symbolize a country. They dont speak on behalf of a country. It's just a group of people, and they do what they want, and other people of the entire nation should not be asked to be responsible for what these people do.<br><br>Meat Pao.</div>

Isn't it similarly freedom of expression if the Muslims in Iran and Pakistan wish to protest against this affront to their religion?
