My apologise.<br><br>However, after I've read the link you directed me to, I'm still not satisfied with their methodology. Primarily because of their division method. At this point, you will have to excuse me for using Malaysia and N.Korea again as an example, for even though you are a resident in neither states, but gathering from what we can from all sources of news, not just ST which you may despise, there should be sufficient confidence that Malaysia is comparatively more democratic than N.Korea. Even the report's own data showed that Malaysia scored better in all three comparable statistics. But because of the division method used, it's democratic ranking is below N.Korea. At this point in time, my previous eg of the A levels scores with the PSLE scores is still relevant. Even though Malaysia scores better in both political and civil liberties, it's under the same divison as N.Korea. It's like somebody scored 44 for a test and another score 2, yet both get the same grade of F9. This also means that a state which scores better in political and civil liberties by a bit which pushes them up the next grade would be better off than whoever is below irrelevance of both it's freedom of press and corruption scores. Clearly, this is an inaccurate manner of ranking.<br><br>and with regards to<br></div></blockquote>I don't know if it makes a difference, if you get an F9, it's a failure, does not matter if you have 1 point or 49 points. Maybe it has some consolation effect on one's ego.<br><br>I hope you understand this, being economically vibrant does not equate to political freedom or civil liberty. China is economically vibrant now, but does it mean there's political freedom and civil rights there?<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by wisefool83:</div><div class="quote_body">And please stop utilising languages with taunting tone, for it provokes men even of the mildest temper into an exchange of words rather than ideas</div></blockquote>Taunting?

If they do so, they are not serving their own purpose.  See nothing that good for them if Singapore ranks no 1.  By not encouraging democracy they gain a lot, can continue to manipulate, control freedom of speech, control media,  .   .   .   .   .   .       and give themselves super high salary.</div>

How often have we heard of North Korean seeking asylums from China and other countries. If they can't travel, then obviously they can't get into China. The reason for their predicament is that they do not engage in global trade, which allows the transfer of technology, they chose to remain reclusive. They adopt a planned economic system, which creates disincentives to good work.<br><br>But changing a economic system does not make a marxist regime democratic, as in the case of China. It's the same here as it is in China, Chinese mainlanders are travelling more these days because of their economic successes, but is China democratic?</div>
