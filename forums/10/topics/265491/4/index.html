It does not mean stating my views than accepting yours because you think your views are more right than mine. You debate it out and let others decide who is right. I see the path you are leading us to, but there are other paths out there, does not mean that I have to accept your path. Accepting takes convincing, have you shown with facts that your path leads to a better higher ground? Many a times we have shown with facts and logic to OM, gazelle and lionnoisy, most of the time, they either go MIA (missing in action) or side track the issue entirely to another topic.<br><br>Nobody's is asking you to accept alternative views, but you have to appreciate that there are alternatives to the narrow path provided by the regime. By telling ex-Singaporeans not to provide alternative views to their way of living in another country is self imposing blinkers to your wide peripheral vision.</div>
