Say primary school kids attend school exams with 4 subjects. A boy falls sick on the day of one of the paper that he is likely to fail. As a result his average score became much higher and consequently his class ranking rose. I mean seriously, you think N.Korea is more demoractic than Malaysia?<br><br>2) Freedom of Press's score has a much higher determination value than the other scores. Political rights and civil liberties both had only 1-7 while press freedom and corruption has 1- 150 and 145 respectively. So a lot of countries are going to share the same score on the first 2 scores, and the real differentiating points are in the latter 2 scores. It's like say you take 4 subjects, 2 of them are like your A levels scoring where you get A B and C while the other two are calculated like PSLE where every score counts. So a person who scored 69, 69 85 and 85 would get B, B + 170 and another person who score 70, 70, 84 84 would get A, A +168. The mean score for the two kids are the same, but because of the scoring calculation technique, the latter's score would look better and thus a higher rank.</div>

My apologise.<br><br>However, after I've read the link you directed me to, I'm still not satisfied with their methodology. Primarily because of their division method. At this point, you will have to excuse me for using Malaysia and N.Korea again as an example, for even though you are a resident in neither states, but gathering from what we can from all sources of news, not just ST which you may despise, there should be sufficient confidence that Malaysia is comparatively more democratic than N.Korea. Even the report's own data showed that Malaysia scored better in all three comparable statistics. But because of the division method used, it's democratic ranking is below N.Korea. At this point in time, my previous eg of the A levels scores with the PSLE scores is still relevant. Even though Malaysia scores better in both political and civil liberties, it's under the same divison as N.Korea. It's like somebody scored 44 for a test and another score 2, yet both get the same grade of F9. This also means that a state which scores better in political and civil liberties by a bit which pushes them up the next grade would be better off than whoever is below irrelevance of both it's freedom of press and corruption scores. Clearly, this is an inaccurate manner of ranking.<br><br>and with regards to <blockquote>Since when does it say that freedom of press is given scores of up to 150 and political rights given scores of up to 7 and the combined scores averaged out. Both corruption scores and press freedom scores are out of a possible maximum of 100.</blockquote> I was referring to the range <a href="http://www.worldaudit.org/countries/singapore.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.worldaudit.org/countries/singapore.htm</a> in which it shows Political Rights : 1-7, Civil Liberties: 1-7, Press Freedom : 0-150 and Corruption: 0-145.<br><br>And please stop utilising languages with taunting tone, for it provokes men even of the mildest temper into an exchange of words rather than ideas</div>
