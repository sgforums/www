Irish hate English rule, period.<br><br>Then open your world map, the English island is stucked at a miserable far corner between the european continent and republic of ireland.  Compare this to their empire before WW2.  their decline is almost comparable to the fall of the roman empire.  where is rome, the capital of the roman empire, today?  it is a tourist spot.<br><br>History<br><br>After the establishment by treaty with Great Britain of the Irish Free State (Jan., 1922), civil war broke out between supporters of the treaty and opponents, who refused to accept the partition of Ireland and the retention of any ties with Britain. The antitreaty forces, embodied in the Irish Republican Army (IRA) and led by <strong>Eamon De Valera</strong>, were defeated, although the IRA continued as a secret terrorist organization. William Cosgrave became the first prime minister. De Valera and his followers, the Fianna FÃ¡il party, agreed to take the oath of allegiance to the British crown and entered the DÃ¡il in 1927.<br><br>In 1932, <strong>De Valera</strong> became prime minister, and under his administration a new constitution was promulgated (1937), establishing the sovereign nation of Ireland, or Eire, within the Commonwealth of Nations. De Valera's policies aimed at the political and economic independence and union of all of Ireland. The loyalty oath to the crown was abolished, and certain economic provisions of the 1921 treaty with England were repudiated, leading to an Â“economic warÂ” (1932Â–38 ) with Britain.<br><br>During World War II, Eire remained neutral and vigorously protested Allied military activity in Northern Ireland. The British were denied the use of Irish ports, and German and Japanese agents were allowed to operate in the country. However, great numbers of Irishmen volunteered to serve with the British armed forces. The people of Eire suffered relatively little hardship during the war and even profited from increased food exports. The postwar period brought a sharp rise in the cost of living and a decline in population, due in great part to steady emigration to Northern Ireland, Great Britain, and other countries. In 1948, Prime Minister Costello demanded total independence from Great Britain and reunification with the six counties of Northern Ireland.<br><br>The Republic of Ireland was proclaimed on Apr. 18, 1949. The country withdrew from the Commonwealth and formally claimed jurisdiction over the Ulster counties. It was admitted to the United Nations in 1955. Nothing came of the claim to Ulster, and during the 1950s and 60s the republic and Northern Ireland improved their economic relations. The later decade also saw an all-time low in Irish population, 2.82 million in 1961. In the late 1960s the problem of Northern Ireland flared up again in bitter fighting between the Protestant majority and Catholic minority there, aggravated by the actions of the IRA, which was headquartered in the republic.<br><br>In 1973, Erskine H. Childers succeeded De Valera as president of Ireland, and Liam Cosgrave, at the head of a Fine GaelÂ–Labour coalition, replaced Jack Lynch, of Fianna FÃ¡il, as prime minister. In the same year the republic joined the European Community (now the European Union). Childers died in 1974 and was succeeded by Cearbhal O. Dalaigh. Lynch led Fianna FÃ¡il back into office in 1977; in 1979 fellow party member Charles Haughey replaced Lynch as prime minister. In 1981 a Fine GaelÂ–Labour coalition headed by Garret FitzGerald defeated Fianna FÃ¡il on an economic platform. Although ousted in 1982, the coalition was governing again six months later. Beginning in the late 1970s the republic's political situation was more fluid than it had been; there were several general elections and a variety of party schisms. In 1987, Haughey again became prime minister. As unemployment soared, especially among young people, outmigration increased, reaching a peak of 44,000 in 1989.<br><br>During the 1990s, the economy grew significantly, buoyed by EU subsidies and new foreign investment. By the end of the decade, unemployment was below the EU average, although pockets of poverty persisted. In late 1994, after the IRA and Protestant militias agreed to a cease-fire, efforts were begun to negotiate a settlement of the the Northern Ireland issue. Despite some setbacks, agreements were reached in Apr., 1998, and approved by voters in both the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland in May. Women's issues, such as the government's strong antiabortion stance and the constitutional ban on divorce, also became a focus in the 1990s; a referendum legalizing divorce passed by a narrow margin in 1995. In 1991, Ireland elected its first female president, Mary Robinson, and in 1997 Mary McAleese became its first president from Northern Ireland. In 1992, Albert Reynolds, of Fianna FÃ¡il, replaced Charles Haughey as prime minister, and when the governing coalition collapsed, Reynolds successfully formed another. The Reynolds government fell in 1994, and Fine Gael leader John Bruton succeeded him, heading a Fine GaelÂ–Labour coalition. Bertie Ahern became prime minister in 1997, heading a Fianna FÃ¡ilÂ–Progressive Democrat coalition; his coalition was returned to office in 2002. Revelations in Sept., 2006, that Ahern had received loans from business acquaintances in 1993Â–94 while he was finance minister and had not yet repaid them sparked controversy. Ahern said his attempts to repay them had been refused; he did repay the loans soon after they were became public.<br><br>A Political Currency<br>The whole premise of the Euro is unique in the modern world. Normally, a new currency is created after some sort of political unification. But, the Euro's key purpose is to promote political unification. With everyone using the same money, political harmony will follow. Yes, trade within the Euro zone will be easier without having to deal with exchange rates and bank fees. But, the Euro is above all else a political statement rather than simply a medium of exchange.<br>With the switchover to the Euro for everyday business, the point has been driven home to hundreds of millions of European citizens.

Who controls the money controls everything.<br>On 8th January 2002, Ireland, like the other 11 members of the Eurozone, started using Euro notes and Euro coins for cash transactions.
