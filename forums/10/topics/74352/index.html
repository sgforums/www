No car, 3 room pigeon hole for 2 kids, no major illnesses in the family and no job losses among the breadwinners.<br><br>Well, from what I found out in my own job hunting months, experience counts. And it counts a lot, which is why many fresh grads are unemployed or under-employed. Problem is, unlike many other countries, there are no labour laws put in place to put the interests of Singaporeans first (supposedly in the name of meritocracy). So when it comes to the crunch between choosing a PR/foreigner who:-<br><br>- does not have to leave his work behind for 2 weeks reservist training on top of his annual leave and<br>- who can ask for a lower pay due to lower living costs in their home countries and who don't have study/pigeon hole loans to pay off<br><br>and a Singaporean, the choice for an employer is obvious.</div>
