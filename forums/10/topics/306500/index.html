              <p>Upon reading Chia Ti Lik's blog, I am impressed with whatl he writes and how humbly he presents himself. As he positions himself as a promising, up and coming political leader with aims for entering political office and becoming responsible for the leadership of Singapore, I feel it is my duty to inform.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The purpose of this post is not to slam Chia Ti Lik, but as a social
              responsibility to speak up on what i know for people to judge and
              decide for themselves.</p>
              <p>Although Mr Chia writes very eloquently in his blog about leadership and human rights, I believe his integrity and honesty as a man of character is questionable. The "domestic turmoil" he wrote about in his post entitled: "A little bet I placed with myself", refers to a breakdown in his marriage due to him committing adultry with a married woman who has 2 young children. After the affair was discovered, he attempted to end it, but succumbed to temptation a second time when the other woman offered to be his "mistress" and he decided that he would cheat on his wife a second time, he probably also enjoys the thrill of being unfaithful. As a result of this his wife decided to leave the marriage.</p>
              <p>Its been a year since the "domestic turmoil" and Mr Chia has not be responsible in handling the divorce. When contacted to attend to necessary admin matters, he avoids it saying that he is "busy" or hides behind some work. He is probably not lying this time, as it is evident he is busy with acitivities in SG Human Rights, but one really begs the question about how effective or sincere a proponent can be about fighting for human rights and freedom, when one does not conduct one's own life with proper care, integrity and responsibility.</p>
              <p>Is it a man's words or his deeds that defines his character?</p>
