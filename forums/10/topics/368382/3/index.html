              <p><br>OMg...my dear Uncle, didn't you love the greenback years back, so is everywhere and especially so in China, in those years of wonderful anmerica dollars, the chinese are keeping it as saving, at that time they dun trust their RMB, everywhere you go, you give US dollars, the chinese will give you a broad smile. So, as the years goes by, the chinese had accumlated trillions of US dollars both in individual saving and state treasury saving. So do you think they want the greenback to fall???? You still sleeping in your old cot and drinking charcoal brew coffee ar??? careful of caffeine diarrhea ya.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Therefore the american taking this advantage, and trying to rise fund for their ailing banks, sell bonds to china and in turn promise that they will uphold the greenbacks.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>China is not afraid of US sabotage, they never do, the chinese leader told the US counterpart, let us keep our promise, we can play cat and mouse game, but if china fall, i make sure we all fall together.</p>

              <p>Does the angel know how to suck eggs before trying to teach others how to do the same ?</p>
              <p>You must be an ancient angel to think that pot is still being depended by anyone.</p>
              <p>Please read about the real information concerning all that you have written and not depend on your own figment of imagination.</p>
              <p>What you wrote at 11.13 AM is obviously written in a state of stupor, and it will not be fair to knock you down.</p>
              <p>Will let you off the hook.</p>
              <p>Go google on the different world bodies that you have mentioned and come back later when you are ready.</p>
