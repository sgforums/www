              Monetary Authority of Singapore losing money ?
              
              What is the de facto Central Bank of Singapore doing ?
              
              Has it been trading in the foreign currency market and suffer losses as a result of taking positions to hedge against the rise and falls of various foreign currencies ?
              
              Is the MAS working as an independent entity outside the purview of the Finance Minister and his Ministry ?
              
              Will the Government be held accountable or will it white-wash itself from any responsibility with all kinds of clever self-effacing excuses when problems appear ?
              
              
              This amount will have to be added to the US$100 Billion lost by GIC and Temasek.

              <p>All the central banks in the world will lose money and make money from time to time when they intervene in their forex markets.</p>
              <p>The objective of the intervention by the central bank is never about making money from the forex market or worry about losing money in the forex market.</p>
              <p>Its role is to ensure that the external value of the country's currency is conducive for the country's economy through the intervention in the forex market.</p>

              <p>MAS only goes into the forex market to sell S$ to prevent S$ to rise beyond the exchange rate band or MAS goes into the forex market to buy S$ to prevent S$ to fall below the exchange rate band.</p>
              <p>MAS's role is to ensure a gradual change in the stability of S$ in view of the short-run and long-run conditions of the Singapore's economy.</p>

              <p><br>Obviously the "market" has lost confidence in the Singapore economy even as the MAS remain optimistically confident over the long term and will do anything to support the Singapore Dollar to maintain stability.</p>
              <p>This will be a daily exercise that need substantial Reserves to beat back the market speculators, who are bent on taking positions that will shake the S$.</p>
              <p>With the value of the S$ being weighted against a basket of several currencies, which are from our major trading partners, it will be quite remarkable for the MAS to come up with such a loss in one year.</p>
              <p>The loss is more astonishing when the value of the S$ is supposed to have been kept stable over the years - with movements within a controlled band - and the market also aware of the determination of the Singapore Government to defend the S$, which makes it a formidable currency to speculate with (as was the case with the Thai Baht during the 1997 currency meltdown in South-east Asia).</p>
              <p>The air remains fishily salty.</p>
