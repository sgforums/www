There is no evidence from both sides of the causeway that we acceded to their demands. In fact Mahathir has problems with Badawi for not pushing us as hard. At the height of it, we announced that we had developed Newater. We offered a slight increase in price but the Malaysians felt insulted by the offer. That was it, until today there is no agreement.
