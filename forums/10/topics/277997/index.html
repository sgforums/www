It is easy to promise freebies and greater welfare but they have never shown how their figures add up. Someone's got to pay, either through higher taxes or by diverting funds from somewhere else. It lacks credibility when they are not able to put forward a cogent financial plan.

Consider this, just like what the PAP is doing now, when things are going well, they praise their own good governance. When things are not going well, they blame external global influences that are beyond their control. If the Opposition party-cum-Ruling-party does just that, they'll do well for themselves when they are in power.<br><br>Anyway, seriously, if the Opposition doesn't do a good job as ruling party, shouldn't PAP be largely to blame, since it was the PAP who did all they could in keeping the Opposition weak?</div>

It is easy to promise freebies and greater welfare but they have never shown how their figures add up. Someone's got to pay, either through higher taxes or by diverting funds from somewhere else. It lacks credibility when they are not able to put forward a cogent financial plan. I guess they fear any such plan will be torn to shreds by the teams of academics and economic advisors the government has at its disposal.<br><br>So far only the PAP has delivered the goodies, albeit often as a pre-election sweetener.</div></blockquote>WP has only had 1 or 2 seats in parliament all these years. What do you think PAP would do if they were in WP's shoes?<br><br>WP does not promise freebies and greater welfare. Their manifestoes have always been more of proposals. Only the party with potential to capture or retain power has the ability to make promises.<br><br>The role of opposition parties in have always been severely limited, no thanks to factors like the GRC system which does not permit citizens to elect a candidate of their choice. Add media propaganda and distorted school textbooks to that. Well, maybe even the serial numbers on ballot slips.<br><br>Come to think of failed promises, I remember how our PM has promised to make Singapore and inclusive society. A mere cycling event and they are so paranoid about it, while PAP always organise their own outdoor activities.<br><br>And speaking of "fear any such plan will be torn to shreds" reminds me of the secrecy that has shrouded the HDB cost figures all these donkey years.</div>
