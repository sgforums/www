I say this just to put my point across.<br><br>So as not to be misinterpreted, I am not saying that only by paying the highest you can get the best. It depends also alot on the selection. Who selects? The interviewer so-to-speak is the deciding factor, not the candidate in this aspect. Thus, its not just about salary. Its also the selector and I like to stress that the best can also  be not the highest paid.

It is easy to promise freebies and greater welfare but they have never shown how their figures add up. Someone's got to pay, either through higher taxes or by diverting funds from somewhere else. It lacks credibility when they are not able to put forward a cogent financial plan. I guess they fear any such plan will be torn to shreds by the teams of academics and economic advisors the government has at its disposal.<br><br>So far only the PAP has delivered the goodies, albeit often as a pre-election sweetener.</div></blockquote>I believe it is a matter of understanding what the role of a Parliamentary opposition is. In any case, no country has an opposition party running the government. Or why have a government? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>If an opposition party could, say, give people rebates in road tax, it does not mean the opposition is able to deliver. Rather, it means there is a serious leak in the government's / people's money <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> and the CPIB better investigate <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>A fairer comparison would be to compare where the PAP and opposition parties have the same foothold. That would be town councils. This far, Hougang and Potong Pasir has never been at the bottom. Rightfully, based on the concept that the worst part of PAP is better than the best part of opposition, this should be the case.<br><br>Regards</div>

Me too man.<br><br>Seriously speaking, another reason why any opposition who takes over won't be able to run the country is probably because of the amount of government intervention in our economic and non-economic issues.<br><br>If all the government support and intervention was to cease suddenly due to a transition of power, would our economy have the fortitude to stomach it?  A good time for opposition parties to really mount a good challenge is when more and more of our economy becomes more liberal.
