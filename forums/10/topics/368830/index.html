              <div class="articleSubTitle">Nabucco Turkey EU and Obama Geopolitics</div>
              <p>by  F. William  Engdahl</p>
              <p>July 17, 2009</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><em>One of his first foreign visits as new President took Barack Obama to Ankara
              for a high-profile meeting with Prime Minister Recep Erdogan and other
              leading Turkish officials. Obama engaged in classical “horse trading”
              wheeling and dealing. “I give you support for Turkey’s EU membership; you open the diplomatic door to Armenia,” appears to have been the core of the deal. What other inducements the US
              President gave in the case of Turkish influence within NATO and such is
              secondary. Obama’s goal was to break a political deadlock in Turkey to construction of a major gas pipeline to Germany and other EU countries in direct opposition to Russian Gazprom’s South Stream pipeline.</em></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><img src="http://www.acus.org/files/u65/SouthStreamMap.gif" alt="" width="464" height="229"></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><strong> </strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">Nabucco is an integral part of a US strategy of total energy control over both the EU and all Eurasia. On July 13 with a Nabucco signing ceremony in Ankara the first fruits of the Obama soft diplomacy appeared to be bearing fruit. The question remains if it will be bitter fruit.</p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB">Leading Republican Party foreign policy figure, Senator Richard Lugar, went as the Obama Administration’s representative to Ankara on July 13 for the signing ceremony approving the controversial Nabucco project.<span>  </span></span><span lang="DE">EU Commission President Barosso was also present along with heads of government of Turkey, Bulgaria, Hungary and Austria. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span lang="EN-GB">The Nabucco project when and if finished would take gas from the Caspian region, Middle East via Turkey, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary with Austria
              and further on with the Central and Western European gas markets. It
              would run some 3,300 km, starting at the Georgian/Turkish and/or
              Iranian/Turkish border respectively, leading to Baumgarten in Austria,
              costing at least $8 billion. The project is parallel to the existing
              Baku-Tbilisi-Erzurum pipeline and could transport 20 billion cubic
              meters of gas a year. Two-thirds of the pipeline will pass through
              Turkish territory. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span lang="EN-GB"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span lang="EN-GB">Azerbaijan</span><span lang="EN-GB">, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Iran and Iraq are being touted as potential suppliers. </span></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB">Until the Obama-Erdogan
              talks Nabucco had been stalled largely by Turkish lack of interest. Now
              that all appears to be changing and Washington has scored a minor coup over Moscow in the new Great Game over Eurasian energy control. At least on the surface. The reality is far more complex. </span></p>
              <p><strong><span lang="EN-GB">Sensitive geopolitics</span></strong></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB">The importance of Nabucco to Washington
              ranks high on the list. The US Senate just held hearings on how the
              control of energy supplies influences global affairs, something that
              has been at the heart of US foreign policy since at least the time Woodrow Wilson ordered the US Fleet into VeraCruz Mexico to defend the interests of Rockefeller’s Standard Oil in 1913. </span></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB">At their hearing in Washington,
              the august Senators were especially interested in the planned Nabucco
              gas pipeline. Senator John Kerry, chairman of the influential Senate
              Foreign Relations Committee, commented in the hearings, with definite
              understanement "There is a striking overlap between the world's sources
              of energy and the world's sources of instability, and we need to take
              note of that carefully. Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Russia, the Caucasus, Nigeria, Venezuela are all on the frontlines of our energy supply challenges, but also the fault lines of our geopolitics." </span></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB">What the Democrat Senator did not mention is that those countries were on the “faultlines of our geopolitics” because US foreign policy since the end of the Cold War had made them into faultline states in order to increase Washington control over the economic future of Eurasia including both China and Russia, as well as over the energy-dependent European Union. For Washington, that control has been <strong>THE</strong> central preoccupation of all US foreign policy since the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989. </span></p>
              <p><strong><span lang="EN-GB">Gas for Nabucco?</span></strong></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB">The major problem with Nabucco now is not the willingness of Turkey to build the longest part of the pipeline to Bulgaria.
              That has been agreed. What remains however is a huge problem of who
              will fill that pipeline with ample volumes of natural gas to make it
              economically practical. Here is where it gets dicey. </span></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB">Until now the main gas supply for Nabucco should be Azerbaijan, source of large oil reserves to fill another Anglo-American-backed pipeline run by a British Petroleum consortium to bring Baku oil from the Caspian Sea to the west independent of Russia. That Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline was the real reason Washington
              backed the 2004 Georgian “Rose Revolution” that put the erratic
              dictator Mikhail Saakashvili into power, pushing out veteran Soviet-era
              fox Edouard Shevardnadze, who had become too friendly with Moscow for the likes of Bush-Cheney oil geopolitics.<span>   </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span lang="EN-GB">But now Azerbaijan may have problems providing enough gas to make Nabucco feasible. </span>In June, Azerbaijan signed with Russia’s Gazprom for gas from Stage 2 of the Shah Deniz field -- the same field Nabucco hopes to tap for its pipeline.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">The
              Gazprom-Azeri deal states that other purchasers must outbid Gazprom,
              giving Russia a possible lever to stall or even to kill the Nabucco
              project, (which is intended to decrease Europe’s reliance on Russia’s
              gas), by pushing the price of gas from Shah Deniz up too high to make
              Nabucco profitable on commercial terms as a rival to Russia’s South
              Stream. Azerbaijan’s President Aliyev seems to be playing a cat-and-mouse game with both Russia
              and the EU-Washington, to play one off against the other for the
              highest price. Gazprom agreed to pay an unusually high price of $350
              per thousand cubic meters for their Shah Deniz gas, a clear political
              not economic decision by Moscow which owns controlling interest in Gazprom.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">To keep hopes alive for the completion of a viable Nabucco, Washington has few cards to play. Even were Azerbaijan
              to agree to sell gas and Nabucco to buy it on competitive terms to
              Gazprom, industry sources say the Azeri gas would alone not suffice to
              fill the pipeline. Where could the remaining gas come?</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">One possible answer is Iraq; the second is Iran. Both are with huge geopolitical problems for Washington to put it mildly.</p>
              <p><span>Senator </span><span lang="EN-GB">Lugar, just back from his trip to Ankara to observe the Nabucco signing, told his Senate colleagues the answer to the Nabucco gas supply problem might lie in Iraq,
              which he claimed could supply up to half of the gas for Nabucco.
              "Ideally, in the way of the world, the natural gas - and maybe in due
              course oil supplies - coming out of a united Iraq might provide this
              kind of capital, which would be a miraculous happening and a wonderful
              ending to a very tragic period in their history," Lugar said. Ideally
              it sounds nice. Practically is another question, even with the US retaining its vast network of permanent US military bases across Iraq. Iraqui gas to Turkey
              would pass through Kurdish areas providing the Kurds with a lucrative
              new revenue stream, something not too devoutly desired in Ankara. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span lang="EN-GB">The second option, which also happens to hold the world’s second largest reserves of identified natural gas next to Russia, is Iran. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span lang="EN-GB"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span lang="EN-GB">Uuuuuuhaaa. Ouch! That doesn’t quite fit into the geopolitically correct map used in Washington these days. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span lang="EN-GB"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span lang="EN-GB">Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan invited both Russia and Iran to join the Nabucco project, RIA Novosti reported. He stated, “We want Iran to join the project when conditions will allow, and also hope for Russia’s participation in it.” </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span lang="EN-GB"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span lang="EN-GB">For
              its part, Teheran is enjoying the cat-and-mouse game: "European
              companies understand the fact that the project will be economically
              justified in case Iran is the supplier,"" Seyyed Reza Kasaiizadeh,
              National Iranian Gas Export Company’s managing director told press on
              the day of the Ankara Nabucco signing. He claimed, rightly, that
              supplying the Nabucco pipeline with Iran's gas is the most economical alternative. “Despite political oppositions, Iran sees itself as s potential supplier of the project,” he added. That didn’t go down well in Washington.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span lang="EN-GB"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">Richard Morningstar, the State Department's Special Envoy for Eurasian Energy, told the Senate that Iran should not benefit from Nabucco until Tehran agrees to resolve the dispute over its nuclear program. "This would be the absolute worst time to encourage Iran
              to participate in a project in Nabucco, when we have received
              absolutely nothing in return," he said. Significantly, he noted that
              Nabucco could be used as an incentive to get Iran to better cooperate and engage with the international community.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><strong>Why Armenia?</strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span lang="EN-GB"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span lang="EN-GB">The natural route to bring Iranian gas to Europe via Nabucco goes through Armenia, the small and fiercely independent nation sandwiched between Iran, Georgia, Azerbaijan and Turkey. In early 2007 a small pipeline opened bringing Iranian gas to Armenia. A second pipeline, if built, would potentially allow Iran to bring its gas via Turkey
              and Nabucco to European markets. This begins to explain why Obama made
              the issue of Turkish reconciliation of the long-standing tensions
              between Ankara and Armenia over the Armenian charges of genocide during World War I a priority in his April talks with Prime Minister Erdogan. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span lang="EN-GB"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span lang="EN-GB">It
              seems Obama’s advisers are playing a far more subtle geopolitical game
              than did Cheney and Bush. By holding out several juicy financial
              carrots, to Turkey, to Armenia, even to Teheran if it were to abandon
              its nuclear ambitions, Washington hopes to throw a giant monkey wrench
              into the attempt of Moscow to retain a significant control over
              Eurasian energy supplies to the EU, a major lever to ensure more stable
              EU-Russian relations amid growing threats to Russia’s security from
              Washington’s misnamed missile defense shield being built in Poland and
              the Czech Republic. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span lang="EN-GB"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span lang="EN-GB">Notably, on the latter point, it is worth noting that Obama refused to give an inch during the recent summit talks in Russia. That’s because Washington’s
              agenda of geopolitical control over the Eurasian Continent is the only
              lever of maintaining the hegemony of a failing American Century at this
              point. Full Spectrum Dominance or none seems to be the motto.<span>  </span></span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span>BERLIN, July 16 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Angela
              Merkel and visiting Russian President Dmitry Medvedev on Thursday
              agreed on a series of issues to strengthen cooperation between their
              countries. </span></p>
              <p><span>    The two leaders held one-to-one talks at Schleissheim
              Palace, a former summer residence of Bavarian rulers to the north of
              Munich, the Bavaria state capital, while ministers from the two
              countries joined in the talks at a plenary session later in the day. </span></p>
              <p><span>Both leaders agreed to cooperate more closely in
              tackling the current economic crisis, take further steps toward a new
              climate change deal, as well as coordinate foreign policies toward hot
              spots in the world like Iran and the Korean Peninsula nuclear issue. </span></p>
              <p><span>Before the meeting, analysts have
              expected that seeking reliable gas supply from Russia to Germany would
              be a top issue to be discussed by the two leaders, as Merkel wants to
              make sure that the gas crisis in January does not happen again. </span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span>As the EU and Turkey signed a new gas pipeline
              agreement aimed at bypassing Russia to provide energy to Europe, both
              leaders wanted to diffuse the conflict aroused by this Nabucco gas
              pipeline agreement. </span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span>Merkel said the Nord Stream
              pipeline was strategically important and necessary and the two programs
              were complementary. Medvedev responded that the Nord Stream pipeline
              would strengthen energy security across Europe...</span></p>

              <p>Banana Leaf is used as a dish for eating as the leaf contains some nature's chemical that prevent insect from settling on it.</p>
              <p>During NSF field camps, for toilet use - we used to look for a clump of leaves that was better known as "C.B." leaves that is better for cleaning up the "boss" after the dump is completed.</p>
