            <div class='col-md body'>Iraq built the Osirak nuclear facility near Baghdad with French assistance. When intelligence confirmed Iraq's intention of producing weapons there, the Israeli government decided to attack. However, the raid would have to occur before the reactor went Â“hotÂ” so as not to endanger the surrounding community.<br><br>Every detail of the mission was planned meticulously. The target was distant: 1,100 km from Israel. Preparations included building target mockups and flying full scale dressÂ­rehearsal missions. The aircrews were selected from the cream of the Israel Air Force's (IAF) fighter corps.<br><br>The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) ChiefÂ­ofÂ­Staff, Lt. Gen. Rafael (Raful) Eitan, briefed the pilots personally. Displaying unusual emotion, he told them: Â“The alternative is our destruction.Â”<br><br>At 15:55 on June 7, the first FÂ­15 and FÂ­16's roared off the runway from Etzion Air Force Base in the south. After a tense but uneventful lowÂ­level navigation route, the fighters reached their target. They popped up at 17:35 and quickly identified the dome gleaming in the late afternoon sunlight.<br><br>Enemy defenses were caught by surprise and opened fire too late. In one minute and twenty seconds, the reactor lay in ruins.<br><br>The way home was quiet, bringing the mission to its successful completion. It was a perfectly orchestrated opera conducted by the IAF Commander, Maj. Gen. David Ivry. At least for the present, the atomic genie of Baghdad was put back into his bottle.<br><br>From: <a href="http://www.us-israel.org/jsource/History/Osirak.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.us-israel.org/jsource/History/Osirak.html</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The French has been known to take on an independent foreign policy to assert their own skewered principles in being totally different from all others, without considering the implications of their actions on the larger events that are developing.<br><br>Their present actions to take a separate alternate route from the US and UK initiative to disarm Iraq of its WMD, is completely idiotic.<br><br>The French has completely ignored the fact that at least FOUR United Nations Security Councils resolutions have been passed that demand Iraq to disarm, and that this four resolutions have occured over more then TWELVE Years.<br><br>Yet, the French is demanding to give the UN Inspectors more time to locate those WMD.<br><br>The French Government are behaving like spastic virgins in the world of politics, and playing into the hands of Saddam Hussein - in his masterful game of playing political brinkmanship, at the expense of the Iraqis who continue to suffer UN sanctions as a result of Saddam's action.<br><br>The world community should let the US and UK plough into Iraq with their armed forces - as they have done in Afghanistan - then let these large force of 250,000 PLUS soldiers do the job that the 100 PLUS Inspectors are now having problems trying to locate those WMD that Saddam has hidden.<br><br>The current situation is not unlike the time before the US invasion of Afghanistan, the Islamic world was sceptical that Osama Bin Laden was the cause of the WTC 9-11 dIsaster.

            <div class='col-md body'>Editorial: The end of diplomacy<br><br>The Jerusalem Post<br><br>March 14, 2003<br><br>The diplomatic endgame is turning into a farce, and farce is the opposite of what is necessary to defend the free world.<br><br>In a last-minute attempt to take seriously the French claim that they are serious about Iraqi disarmament, British Prime Minister Tony Blair put together a six-part ultimatum. The French reaction: "We cannot accept the British proposals as they are based on a logic of war, on a logic of an automatic recourse to force," said Foreign Minister Dominique de Villepin on French television. Iraq immediately followed suit by rejecting the British proposal as well.<br><br>This French-Iraqi two-step brilliantly illustrates the double futility of any more last chances for Saddam. First, the premise that the French voted for Security Council Resolution 1441, and therefore care about what is says, has no basis. This is the "logic of war" and the French are simply not interested in it.<br><br>Second, there is no end in sight to the combination of French dithering and Saddam's ability to play into it. Saddam can indefinitely destroy a few missiles or otherwise throw bones to UN inspectors, who can be counted upon to declare that progress has been made and therefore inspections should continue.<br><br>Now France has said that it is open to negotiating some formula that will produce a consensus in the Security Council. Sounds nice, but the US should not fall for this either. If Blair's ultimatum was not good enough for the French, it is clear that their game is to buy time for opposition to the war to grow.<br><br>France's objective is not to disarm Iraq, which it does not believe is an immediate threat, but to beat the US. In this context, US President George W. Bush's wavering from his pledge to push for a Security Council vote Secretary of State Colin Powell now says this may or may not happen is a form of blinking in this test of wills between Paris and Washington.<br><br>That said, at this point, going to war without a vote would probably be a better option that forcing a vote and losing. The cards that Bush said should be put on the table are not just those of wavering Security Council members, but of the international system itself.<br><br>Regardless of whether there is a vote and how it turns out, the United Nations has revealed itself to be worse than the League of Nations it replaced. The league, after all, was a dead letter after it failed to stop Italy's invasion of Abyssinia in 1936. The UN is not just failing to stop an aggressor, but is actively thwarting the US insistence on doing so.<br><br>Every moment that the US continues to indulge the UN and grovel for the vote of such bastions of international legitimacy as Guinea and Cameroon serves only to further legitimize a corrupt system and give Saddam more time to plan ways to kill American troops.<br><br>At stake now is whether the Security Council is discredited for obstructing the United States, or the US is diplomatically bloodied for flouting the Security Council. The US can hardly afford to lose its diplomatic battle with France more than it can its military battle with Saddam Hussein.<br><br>Luckily, speaking of cards, the French seem to have overplayed their hand. For the indefinite future, it is hard to imagine the United States going to the Security Council again for its blessing. In the aftermath of this debacle, the US should simply rely upon "coalitions of the willing," leaving the UN isolated and not the United States.<br><br>But all this comes after the war. This war has become a test not only over whether the US will effectively defend itself and the world, but whether it will let divisions among democracies prevent it from doing so. The only way to pass this test is to put an end to the delays and last chances. The time of decision is now.<br></div>

Never mind their role in rearming Saddam after the 1991 war, certain other factors are painfully obvious.<br><br>From watching the numerous delays which the administration has suffered in diplomatic wrangling that Bush had to have known would be useless, it became clear that he very much wants to get rid of Saddam without recourse to war. The idea was most likely to engage the UN in the application of sufficient pressure to force him out of power.<br><br>In order to accomplish this, two things are necessary: a credible threat and an international consensus. The threat of war must be very real indeed. The threat, we have produced. However, French obstinacy prevented the necessary consensus from being reached. So long as we appeared divided, Saddam was encouraged to cling to power until it was too late to pull back from the brink.<br><br>Thanks for nothing, France. Now we are stuck fighting a war that may well have been unnecessary but for you, and it is entirely on your heads. You are no friends of the US, nor of peace. As usual, we are taking the risks and paying the cost. Maybe you should change your national motto to, "Don't pay to walk when you can ride for free."<br>--------------------------------<br><br>I think the writer was spot on.</div>
