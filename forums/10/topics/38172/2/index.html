            <div class='col-md body'>The Palestinians are the pariahs of everywhere they have been...<br><br>No one wants to deal with their treachery...<br><br>As in why no one wants to step in, it's going to be more problems cropping up because of the Arab world's insane hatred for Israel.<br><br>"Palestinians" were allowed as refugees and were basically left alone to find jobs and stuff in Jordan.  What did they do?  Yasser Arafat tried to assassinate their King.  The late-King Hussein of Jordan was so enraged that he ordered all of them deported... with much violence... it is estimated that about 10,000 Palestinians were slaughtered.<br><br>In the recent past, Barak, in what was an extremely unpopular move, tried to make peace with the Palestinians.  He offered 98% of their demands unconditionally.  The remaining 2% was negotiable and subject to step-by-step handing over of power.  In what would be the most damaging move to everyone involved, Arafat walked out!  And then he went and launched the current Intifadah.<br><br>The Palestinians are just cannon-fodder and used by the Arabs to destroy Israel.  They did not exist before Israel's current incarnation and these people willingly let themselves be used.<br><br>Arafat has secretly amassed over US$2 billion in Swiss accounts.  Outwardly he is supposedly one of the richest around with a personal disclosed fortune of a few hundred million.  This fortune is from maintaining a monopoly of all trade in his territories.. something which he will have to let go of if there is peace.<br><br>So for letting his own family live in luxury in the French Riviera, "his own people" (who are not, he's actually Egyptian) must suffer, die and fight Israelis.<br><br>The Palestinian problem cannot be solved unless there is a power move away from the PLO, which is first and foremost a Terrorist Organisation.<br><br>The Palestinians brought this upon themselves.... before, the Israelis allowed them citizenship, rights same as any Israeli.  But no.. they'd rather be cannon-fodder... they'd rather suffer and die so that they can play victim... to them, maybe it's easier than taking personal responsibility and work, live and make a proper life for themselves and their children.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by kyas:</div><div class="quote_body">Think about this as well... What about Israel and Palestine ... it has been more than 50 years... still unresolved... they keep supplying weapons for israel...  and the palestine? zero... so many people were killed... why don't they just step in... and say " wey... enough la wey..." heheh... instead of the talks... the negotiations... 50 years man... 50 years... if i were a palestinian, my whole life is full with cries and sadness......<br></div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>First of all, why are you stereotyping a race or nation?? Are you American? Because only someone as ignorant as an American would say that. (Mind my hypocrisy) Have you ever been to Paris? How are the French idiots? If they're idiots, why do they hold a permanent seat on the UN security council? Do you just hate them for opposing the United States view of Iraq? (which is greatly biased, if you have not been researching) Why are their LuClercs and Rafaels comparable to Abrams and F16's? Please don't be racist like that, because it's only something low people would say. This is Singapore, not America.</div>

Yes, they did a lot of things in the past. They gassed people they fight the kuwait and iran. Howeevr they lose the war years ago and was punished then. During these 10 years, wat have they done ? They didn't start any war and they didn't do any mass killing. Why fight them now ? US say they have weopons of mass destruction, and want them to disarm. Isn't tat wat Iraq is doing before the war ? They destroy lots of missile isn't it ? Why ask them to disarm when they doesn't give them time for it ? Why planned the attack by deploying tons of troops even before they had produce any concrete evidence or inspectors finding anything ? Do u think if they find nothing, they won't attack after such cost of deploying them ? Up till now, they have no concrete proof yet. Chief Inspector still ask for more time and say Iraq cooperate fully.<br><br>Iraqis wanna avoid this war. Their weopons r 3 generations behind and their missile can't go for more than 100km. US fighting with such force is bullying. And they can't fight violence with mroe violence. This only works temporary. After this war, more terrorist is borne,more terrorist acts will start. Wat is the root of terrorism ? They r adding fuel to it instead of plucking the problems from the roots.<br><br>If they r so sincere about preemptive strikes, why don't they attack North Korean then, which they officially declare that it has weopons of mass destruction. The leader in North Korea isn't an angel either. U talk about cruelty during these past 10 years, I find that u can talk more about him than Saddam. They have weopons of longer range, more power and they r closer to US. Why not disarm them first ? REason is.. Iraq have lots of oil. North Korea has lots of hungry people. If they win Iraq, they can control the second highest oil producing country. If they beat Koreans, they have to spend tons of money trying to improve Korea's living conditions. It is all about oil. I can't think of a better reason than this.<br><br>Yes, maybe french and US is same. They r after the money. But the act they did is diferent. French is protecting its investment. US is robbing it. French of course should be in the permanent council !It is because they have the guts to be in the opposition. US is bullying everyone to support its policy. HE is giving the attitude tat if u support me, I give u the carrot. If u don't I give u the stick. He doesn't allow nations to take their stand on their own free will !!! If there is no French, every nation will be bullied into supporting US for all its policies !! It takes lot of morale courage to do tis !<br><br>Kicking doors open to find evidence is another stupid argument. Last time for attack in Afgan, they have the evidence and naturally support from UN is given. The finding of evidence later acts as a BONUS. We cannot attack, hoping to find evidence after it if we cannot justify our attack first ! War is not about just kicking doors open ! It is about going in your house,  killing all your family members and friends and burn down your house and robbing all your possessions ! Wat happend if there isn't any evidence as they hope they can find ? wat ? Say sorry ??<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Excuse me for replying to your post with insertions, as you have opened many points that is best addressed specifically:<br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by stupidissmart:</div><div class="quote_body">I am stunned by the views of the people here...

Do u think if they find nothing, they won't attack after such cost of deploying them ? Up till now, they have no concrete proof yet. Chief Inspector still ask for more time and say Iraq cooperate fully. </div></blockquote>The Iraqis - or its government led by Saddam Hussein - was given TWELVE Years to disarm, but did not.<br><br>After the 1992 Gulf War (Dessert Storm), the Iraqi Government DENIED possessing any Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD), but by the time the First UN Disarmament Inspection Team worked through from 1992 to 1998, this first UN Inspection Team was shocked to discover that Saddam had an organised and secret development PLUS production plan for producing Chemical and Biological WMD, and was in an advance stage of developing a Nuclear Device. This First Team confronted Saddam Hussein with evidence of his WMD program, which Saddam adamantly denied and accused the Head of this First Inspection Team of being a C.I.A spy, and threw out the entire UN Inspection Team in 1998.<br><br>Since 1998 till November 2002, Saddam was left alone without any UN Inspectors to monitor or verify the stockpile discovered during the Frist Inspection Team, and with present revelations of records that remain INCOMPLETE as to the status of those stocks, and the RAW MATERIALS that were purchased to produce MORE stocks.<br><br>BTW, Han Blix is a soft fool, and is easily manipulated by the likes of Saddam. He made a bungle by not discovering the Iranian Nuclear Program, and actually gave the Iranians a clean bill that no nuclear program exist in Iran. What have we today in Iran - if you are into current affairs in daily news ?<br><br>Also, in his last report to the UN Security Council, Han Blix did not say that Saddam Hussein's government is cooperating fully. He actually said that Saddam Hussein's government could have DONE MORE than they are currently doing.<br><blockquote><strong><br>Iraqis wanna avoid this war. Their weopons r 3 generations behind and their missile can't go for more than 100km. US fighting with such force is bullying. And they can't fight violence with mroe violence.

They r adding fuel to it instead of plucking the problems from the roots. </strong></blockquote>if you believe that Saddam desire peace, you might as well believe that "Mahatir loves Singapore".<br><br>Even if the current weapon in Iraq is 3 generation behind, even if the Iraqi population is starving since 1980, that did not stop Saddam Hussein from waging an 8 year war with Iran that cost more then 1,000,000 lives; it did not stop Saddam Hussein from invading and plundering Kuwait and resulted in the useless destruction of the lives that resulted in the reduction of his military by half the original manpower and equipment; it did not stop him from building more then 10 palaces, and dozens of monuments that glorified him while his people die from lack of food and medicine<br><br>Yet he continue to play for time, instead of giving up his WMD within THREE Months - similar to Hans Blix experience to ensure that South Africa's voluntary destruction of its nuclear program is verifyably accounted for inside THREE MONTHS.<br><blockquote><strong><br>If they r so sincere about preemptive strikes, why don't they attack North Korean then, which they officially declare that it has weopons of mass destruction.

In Iraq's case, it is because of Saddam Hussein, that Iraq has no friends that will help. In any case, the Arab world is famous for "many head talk and scream but no action". With regards to the handling of the North Korean matter, USA has given respect to the presence of China and Russia, as well as South Korea and Japan. USA has stated that this is a problem that has to be addressed by the countries of East Asia; while Saddam Hussein is a pariah even within the Arab world.<br><br>You will forget the oil issue as a reason, if you find out the size of the oil reserves that remain untouched as its natural resource inside the USA, and you will be shocked.<br><blockquote><strong><br>Yes, maybe french and US is same.

Were there some big stick hanging on our heads before the Singapore Government openly declare the Singapore Stand on this War as being JUSTIFIED ?<br><blockquote><strong><br>Kicking doors open to find evidence is another stupid argument.

Nearly the entire Muslim World were condemning USA for threatening the Taleban Government, and demanded PROOF, SOLID and VERIFIABLE EVIDENCE to convince the World that OSAMA is responsible for the 9-11 WTC incident ? Are we not hearing the same echoes again ?<br><br>Tell that to our Singapore Internal Security Department that they cannot kick down the doors of anyone of the Twenty odd J.I. members and arrest them BEFORE the evidence were found.<br><br>Just because you suspect them, and have no evidence YET, you cannot break down the doors, to enter and search for those evidence.<br><br>i am not so sure if you and I will be exchanging ideas in this Forum if those J.I. fellas had succeeded, and our I.S.D fellas had practised your style of managing security.<br><br></div>
