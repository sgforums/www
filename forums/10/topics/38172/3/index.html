            <div class='col-md body'>So now everyone wonders is there a better idea than war to stop the threat of terrorists. If u ask me, I think that not giving them a reason to comit terrorist is the best way. Basically wat is their complaints ? I guess mostly is the fact of Isreal and Palestinians. Especially recently there has been a lot of tensions going on there recently.<br><br>I don't know, but the way Sharon did things went a bit too far, and the fact that US nor other nations really step down on things then. Wat they r showing will be wat terrorist will be showing to US too. Isreal can keep bulldozing homes, but Palestinian will keep bombing themselves up. They push an inch, the others will snatch a foot. Revenge will never end and real peace will never comes.<br><br>Hence, it is good if US clean up his record by showing goodwill to muslim countires. They can try to control Isreal situation by being more forceful like how they do it to Iraq. They can support more policies tat benefit the whole committee like pollution, disarment of super powers, helping out third world countries etc. They can build up ties with other muslim nations such as Indonesia and Malaysia and Philipines. And in Iraq case, I think US shouldn't start the attack and do things in a more diplomatic way. If war really has no choice, then it should be done after convincing the world with solid proof and not "I don't give a damn" attitude. If war is compulsory, they should do it much later other after Afghanistan war.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If you think the terrorists are fighting because of the Palestinians, you are dead wrong.<br><br>The Palestinians are just an excuse.<br><br>They are pariahs of the Arab world and the Arabs will not hesitate to kill them anymore than they would Israelis.  Just look at how the Syrians and Jordanians treated them.. and after the Gulf War, how the Kuwaitis treated them... the Arabs were conspicious in their silence!<br><br>It is the insane hatred of Israel, and the knee-jerk "follow the leader" by most of the Muslim world who don't even know what the heck the whole situation is about... just follow the Arabs.<br><br>Do the Palestinians have anything to do with the senseless murders in Bali?  In Philippines?  In Russia?<br><br>There is more to the terror than just Palestinians.  Or Israel, or the US.<br><br>Personally, I would put it down to plain ENVY.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by stupidissmart:</div><div class="quote_body">So now everyone wonders is there a better idea than war to stop the threat of terrorists.

            <div class='col-md body'>I read through their history and have never seen a "people" with so short a history, go through so much suffering caused by themselves and they blame everyone in the world for it.<br><br>I would be lying if I said I did not look down on them... they have been undignified, shameful and counterproductive.<br><br>Israel has tried again and again to help them.. HELP THEM!!  so much so that Barak tried to give them a homeland, almost unconditionally.. the only condition being that they stop attacking civilians.  Arafat started the Intifadah in response.<br><br>There was a boy and his father who was shot to death in a firefight.. the IDF was blamed and the Israelis said nothing and shouldered the blame.  The real cause of their death was this:  THEY WERE KILLED BY FELLOW PALESTINIANS!  they were hiding behind a concrete wall with the IDF the other side of it.  On the same side of the wall were Palestinian gunmen who started the firefight.  There were cameras of the world's journalist at the scene so to increase sympathy for their "cause", the gunmen SHOT the boy and his father, then blamed the IDF for it!  The "journalists" ate it all up.<br><br>Is it that difficult to accept a homeland for peace?  It's what they wanted?<br><br>They did all this to themselves.  Look at how reluctantly Arafat appointed a PM.<br><br>Theirs is a people so corrupt, so pointless, so brutal, so hated by fellow Arabs, it is hard to pity them... especially when they insist on playing victim instead of WORKING for what they say they want.<br><br>It is nothing religious.. just religion used as an excuse and a tool for the idiots to ignore their sin of murder.<br>It is not about a homeland... there were no such things as Palestinians until the present incarnation of Israel.<br>It's about the destruction of Israel... something admitted by the PLO's high ranking officer in a candid interview so many years ago.<br><br>What is Israel to do?  Who knows?  They tried to assimilate the Palestinians into Israel as citizens, they tried to give them their own homeland, they tried to surpress them.. they tried everything... and still the Palestinians are there, killing civilians with their explosive vests.<br><br>If you were Sharon, what would you do?  He's done well pointing out the source of their problems, Arafat.<br><br>What else can anyone do apart from destroying Israel itself for the Palestinians?<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by stupidissmart:</div><div class="quote_body">WellÂ… u say tat problem is because of IsraelÂ… isnÂ’t tat the same as saying the things Israel did to Palestinian ??
