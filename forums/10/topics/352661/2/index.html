              <p>The current financial crisis in the USA could have been forestalled if the original <a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass-Steagall_Act">1933 US Glass-Steagall Act </a>was not repealed in 1999.</p>
              <p>To understand the cause of the present crisis you could try reading - <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.counterpunch.org/kaufman09192008.html">‘Shattering the Glass- Steagall Act’ by William Kaufman </a>- which will reveal that a free wheeling system driven by profit will only lead to a spiral in greed that leads to the blinding of sensible foresight.</p>
              <p>This can happen to the strongest and even the most talented - which has happened even in Singapore, when our self-acclaimed talented politicians cannot resist the idea that their astute political foresight cannot possibly qualify them to be good investors.</p>
              <p>This is surprising for Singaporeans considering that this Government had legislated that Banks in Singapore should diverse themselves from all non-banking activities - (properties, general insurance, stock broking, etc).</p>
              <p>Yet, the Government will not scrutinise themselves from functioning as politicians, and their roles as ministers, while taking assuming major oversight roles in GLCs.</p>

              <p>If i'm not mistaken, this current financial crisis was decades in the making.</p>
              <p>Yet, despite the USA citizens' "supposedly" total control of their own political future their political leadership still led them to the current mess. So can we say the USA citizens really understood what they were voting for?</p>
              <p>Or would they keep getting trained lawyers that could only give them the illusion of hope by fancy speeches but still engaging in the same mistakes of their predecessors?</p>
              <p>I'm not disputing that being able to peacefully transfer political power is not desirable, but before we start demanding change we have to make sure that the people replacing have an idea of how to make things better, not engage in fancy short term plans or attention grabbing antics. </p>
              <p>Democracy is the responsibility of the citizens, not a natural right. When you start believing in it as a right, it means you no longer have to responsible for upholding its integrity.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>We do hv election every 4 to 5 years, but unlike USA who has more talent peoples due to it population and education, they are more enlighted with human rights and not so fragile, we singapore is a small country with no potential oppositions of the right talent to wins over the peoples of Singapore, yet without natural resources, we are a fragile nation, any wrong move in electing the wrong person could be total disaster for the whole nation.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The whole scenrios of politics is different between us and USA, it cannot be an apple to apple comparison, there are culture, history, populations and many others differences to consider.  </p>

              <p>Exactly, its a corporate-fascist hijacking of the US Government that goes back to the founding of the Fed. How can the political leadership remain independent when the money that drives so-called 'economic growth' is subject to the board of the Fed? Kennedy tried to usurp the authority of the Fed by granting the USG the authority (E.O 11110) to issue its own money and look what happened to him. Today, while Obama's choice of well-connected individuals to form his government are being criticised, the real scandal is that most are from the financial sector- ex-Fed, ex-Goldman Sachs exployees.</p>
              <p>As Napoleon said "The hand that gives is above the hand that takes. Money has no
              motherland; financiers are without patriotism and without decency:
              their sole object is gain."</p>
              <p>Even back then he was aware of this inhumane flaw of the monetary system. Today, most are unaware and prefer to indulge in pseudo-intellectual antics that wouldnt solve the fundamental problem.</p>

              <p>Exactly, its a corporate-fascist hijacking of the US Government
              that goes back to the founding of the Fed. How can the political
              leadership remain independent when the money that drives so-called
              'economic growth' is subject to the board of the Fed? Kennedy tried
              to usurp the authority of the Fed by granting the USG the authority
              (E.O 11110) to issue its own money and look what happened to him.
              Today, while Obama's choice of well-connected individuals to form
              his government are being criticised, the real scandal is that most
              are from the financial sector- ex-Fed, ex-Goldman Sachs
              exployees.</p>
              <p>As Napoleon said "The hand that gives is above the hand that
              takes. Money has no motherland; financiers are without patriotism
              and without decency: their sole object is gain."</p>
              <p>Even back then he was aware of this inhumane flaw of the
              monetary system. Today, most are unaware and prefer to indulge in
              pseudo-intellectual antics that wouldnt solve the fundamental
              problem.</p>

                  <p>Hugo Chavez of Venezuela is trying to put a stop to that.</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p><strong>Venezuela: Mass organisation, unity increases as revolution deepens</strong></p>
                  <p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>“This government is here to protect the people, not
                              the bourgeoisie or the rich”, </strong></span>proclaimed Venezuelan President Hugo
                              Chavez on February 28, as he ordered soldiers to take over two
                              rice-processing plants owned by Venezuelan food and drink giant
                              Empresas Polar. <br></em><br>The move was made in order to
                              ensure that the company was producing products subjected to the
                              government-imposed price controls that aim to protect the poor from the
                              affects of global price rises and inflation. <br><br>Under Venezuelan
                              law, companies that can produce basic goods regulated by price controls
                              must guarantee that 70-95% of their products are of the regulated type.
                              <br><br>“They’ve refused 100 times to process the typical rice that
                              Venezuelans eat”, said Chavez. “If they don’t take me seriously, I’ll
                              expropriate the plants and turn them into social property.” <br><br>Four
                              days later, Chavez announced the expropriation of a rice-processing
                              plant owned by US food giant Cargill after it was revealed the company
                              was attempting to subvert the price controls. <br><br><em>Moving against capital </em><br><br>In
                              the following period, “Venezuela’s National Institute of Lands (INTI)
                              [took] public ownership of more than 5000 hectares of land claimed by
                              wealthy families and multi-national corporations and is reviewing tens
                              of thousands more hectares across the nation”, Venezuelanalysis.com
                              reported on March 11. <br><br>This includes the March 5 expropriation
                              of 1500 hectares of a tree farm owned by Ireland’s Smurfit Kappa. The
                              government has pledged to move away from eucalyptus trees, which were
                              drying up the land, and turn the land over to cooperatives for
                              sustainable agriculture. <br><br>On March 14, Chavez decreed a new fishing law, banning industrial trawl-fishing within Venezuela’s territorial waters. <br><br>“Trawling
                              fishing destroys the sea, destroys marine species and benefits a
                              minority. This is destructive capitalism”, explained Chavez on his
                              weekly TV show, <em>Alo Presidente</em> the following day. <br><br>Venezuelanalysis.com
                              reported on March 17 that the government will invest US$32 million to
                              convert or decommission trawling boats, as well as to development
                              fish-processing plants. <br><br>“Thirty trawling ships will be
                              expropriated, Chavez said, due to the refusal of their owners to
                              cooperate with the plans to adapt the boats to uses compliant with the
                              new fishing regulations.” <br><br>Small-scale fisherpeople will have access to the converted boats. <br><br><em>Anti-crisis measures <br></em><br>This
                              latest wave of radical measures by the Chavez government should be seen
                              in the context of the ongoing process of nationalisations since early
                              2006, the onset of the global economic and food crises and the February
                              15 referendum victory. <br><br>The government has re-nationalised
                              privatised industries such as electricity, telecommunications and
                              steel. Cement companies, milk producing factories and one of
                              Venezuela’s major banks have either been, ore are in negotiations to
                              be, nationalised. <br><br>Unlike the state interventions currently
                              being undertaken in the imperialist centres, the aim of these moves is
                              not to bail out bankrupt capitalists, but to help shift production
                              towards meeting people’s needs — in service provisions (phone lines,
                              electricity, banking) and production of essential goods (concrete,
                              steel for housing and factories, and food). <br><br>Last July, the
                              government made strong signals that its next targets would be two
                              strategic sectors previously barely touched — food and finance. <br><br>The
                              day after announcing the planned government buyout of Banco de
                              Venezuela (which, once completed, will give the government control over
                              close to 20% of the banking sector), Chavez issued 26 decrees, a number
                              of which increase government and community control over food storage
                              and distribution — and allow the state to jail company owners for
                              hoarding. <br><br>Moves aimed at increasing government control over
                              food production come amid soaring world food prices and 30% inflation
                              within Venezuela — which is still dependent on imports for 70% of its
                              food supply. <br><br>The government also faces an ongoing campaign of
                              food speculation and hoarding carried out by the capitalist food
                              producers and distributors in order to destabilise the anti-capitalist
                              government. <br><br>With oil prices plummeting by almost $100 per
                              barrel from a high of more than US$140 last year, the government is
                              tightening the screws. Oil accounts for 93% of the government’s export
                              revenue and around half of its national budget. <br><br>The government
                              has already announced the restructuring of its ministries, merging a
                              number of them in order to cut down on bureaucracy. <br><br>The Chavez
                              government is making it very clear that it will be the capitalists, not
                              the people, who will pay for the mess that the capitalist system has
                              created. <br><br>“I have entrusted myself with putting the foot down
                              on the accelerator of the revolution, of the social and economic
                              transformation of Venezuela”, Chavez explained on March 8. <br><br><em>Mandate for socialism </em><br><br>These latest moves follow the government’s victory in the February 15 referendum. <br><br>Officially,
                              the referendum concerned whether to amend the constitution and remove
                              limits on the number of times elected officials could stand for
                              re-election. At stake was the possibility of Chavez standing for
                              re-election in 2012. <br><br>In the context of the intense class struggle, it became a referendum on the socialist project pushed by Chavez. <br><br>Addressing
                              tens of thousands of supporters from the balcony of the presidential
                              palace after the victory, Chavez noted that those that had voted “yes”
                              had “voted for socialism, voted for the revolution”. <br><br>The
                              referendum was proposed by Chavez as a “counter-offensive” against the
                              opposition following the November 23 regional elections. <br><br>Candidates
                              from Chavez’s United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV) won the
                              overwhelming majority of governorships and mayoralties. <br><br>However,
                              opposition victories in key states on the Colombian border (where there
                              is growing right-wing paramilitary activity) and the Greater Caracas
                              mayoralty were viewed as important gains for the counter-revolution. <br><br>Opposition
                              governors and mayors began to use their new positions to attack
                              community organisations and the pro-poor social missions. <br><br>The
                              rapid mobilisation to defeat these attacks by the poor and working
                              people was converted into the formation of 100,000 “Yes committees” to
                              campaign in the referendum, in poor communities, workplaces and
                              universities across the country. <br><br>These committees were the backbone of the successful referendum campaign. <br><br><em>Organising for revolution <br></em><br>The latest measures will undoubtedly intensify the class conflict in Venezuela. <br><br>An
                              example of this conflict has resulted from the government’s program of
                              land reform, aimed at ending the domination over agriculture by a small
                              minority of large landowners. <br><br>Previous attempts by the
                              government to redistribute land have resulted in a violent
                              counter-offensive by large landowners that has resulted in the murder
                              of more than 200 peasants since the land reform law of 2001. <br><br>On
                              March 9, land reform activist Mauricio Sanchez was murdered in Zulia,
                              two weeks after campesino activist Nelson Lopez was shot dead in
                              Yaracuy. <br><br>Increasingly, trade unionists have also been the
                              target of violent repression when struggling for their rights. On
                              January 29, two workers at Mitsubishi plant were killed by police
                              during an industrial dispute — sparking protests and the arrest of a
                              number of police. <br><br>Several peasant organisations are seeking to
                              unite their forces in support of government measures and against
                              repression. The PSUV leadership has also called for a restructuring of
                              the party to better organise the masses for the coming battles. <br><br>Launched
                              after Chavez’s 2006 re-election to help accelerate the revolutionary
                              process, the PSUV brought together a range of revolutionary forces as
                              well as opportunist and corrupt layers. <br><br>On March 6, the
                              national leadership of the PSUV made public a series of decisions aimed
                              at deepening participation and democracy in the party. <br><br>This
                              includes a recruitment drive to sign up new militants, a clean out of
                              the current membership lists, the reactivation of the grassroots
                              socialist battalions and the organisation of an extraordinary congress
                              for August to deepen discussion over the party’s program and
                              principles. <br><br>Building on the success of the “yes” campaign, the
                              PSUV will move to consolidate national mass fronts of workers,
                              peasants, women and students — along with converting the “yes
                              committees” into ongoing “socialist committees”.</p>

              <p>In Singapore, our ONE MAN authority has the arrogance to foresee

              <p><br>The current financial crisis began when the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act was dismantled to allow US Banks to compete with foreign banks who were not regulated by similar legislations.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, unlike the foreign banks that were less gung-ho and more conservative in self-regulations, the innovative and entrepreneurial spirit of the American Enterprise was more pervasive then the Legislators could foresee when dismantlying the original intentions of the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act.</p>
              <p>Although there were alarm bells raised on the questionable growth and multitude of diferent varieties of derivatives, the profit driven Capitalist System were blind sided by those who were more enterprising and able to placate these concerns with the profits that were generated on paper at least.</p>
              <p>Can anyone ever question profitability in the Bottom Line ?</p>
              <p>Corporate America was allowed more leeway by the politician-legislators in a global market that demanded level playing field in free access and free competition, and the politician-legislators also had to answer to their electorates if Corporate America has to lose market shares and unable to keep US Citizens employed.</p>
              <p>Was there a disconnect ?</p>
              <p>There certainly was a disconnect when politician-legislators were not tuned in to the new and more sophisticated financial programmes or instruments that make up a large proportion of derivatives that were traded across borders and international timelines - and touched every financial institutions globally.</p>
              <p>Should politician-legislators be blamed, or the Civil Servants that were supposed to be watch-dogs of the market place to be blamed - or the Citizens themselves ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you are referring to Obama as a trained lawyer <em>"that could only give them the illusion of hope by fancy speeches but still engaging in the same mistakes of their predecessors"</em> - it is less then 100 days of his term.</p>
              <p>Give him a break.</p>
              <p>LKY was a trained lawyer that gave fancy speeches in his younger days too, and gave an illusion of hope for those that were supposed to have been struggling in the 1950s - AND after more then 50 years in politics, Singaporeans are still struggling in this 21st Century.</p>
              <p>Are you suggesting that we do not trust lawyers ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Can you be sure of anyone with a better idea, if you do not put that person to the test on the job ?</p>
              <p>Should anyone employ you on the basis of your effort to market your abilities, or do you need someone to employ you first and put you on the job to see what you can achieve ?</p>
              <p>Should you not give yourself a chance to see if someone can do a better job for Singapore simply based on his plans, now that we know how much the existing plans have consistently drag us into a deeper hole that require us to struggle as much as our forefathers in the 1950s ?</p>

              <p>It is the responsibility of the Citizen to guard DEMOCRACY as a Natural Right of a Citizen of The Country.</p>
              <p>Can one be a meaningful Citizen WITHOUT any NATURAL RIGHT ?</p>
              <p>Only the Singapore Government will lie to Singaporeans that CITIZENSHIP is a privilege to us, and Democracy is NOT a God given Right.</p>
              <p>This is the Political Principle and Philosophy of an arrogant Despot, who will only dispense the rights of Citizenship according to his own standards.</p>

              <p>Excuse me, mei mei...</p>
              <p>Even if the USA has more population than Singapore by another factor of 3x of what I had stated earlier - it still put Singapore's democratic practices to be laughable based on the standards of LKY and the PAP.</p>
              <p>If facts are to be stated accurately, the USA has a population of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/us.html">307,212,123 (est 2009 </a>- while Singapore's population is only <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/print/sn.html">4,657,542 (est. 2009). </a></p>
              <p>Despite the larger size in population and land, the USA has the ability to allow almost 98 percent of the population to participate in the Electoral Process.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>With talents like you, why do you believe in the propaganda espoused by LKY and the PAP that there are few or no talents in Singapore ?</p>
              <p>Despite the supposed dearth of talent, every 5 years or so - the PAP is able to recruit new faces whom they claim to be talents.</p>
              <p>In other words, should we believe that only the PAP has the ability to find the rare Singapore Talents, while everyone not in the PAP are "untalented" ?</p>
              <p>Surely, you are too modest about your own talent, considering the views that you have published in this Speaker's Corner alone ?</p>
              <p>If we compare the difference in population ratio - young Singaporeans have been stated to have excelled the students in the USA in Mathematics and Sciences; and in so many other fields, Singapore has boasted to have even pip the USA in World Ranking.</p>
              <p>Yet, when it comes to Talent - why should this Government insist that we have less talent than the USA ?</p>
              <p>We could allow some correctness in the statements made by LKY and his Government - only insofar as the physical numbers of talented Singaporeans when compared to the USA.</p>
              <p>However, by the same token of ratio in population size, Singaporeans would have the same ratio of talents that this Government refused to allow Singaporeans to know and to believe that we have a sizeable Singapore Talents amongst us.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Singapore is about the size of New York City, but with a much smaller population than the "Big Apple" - estimated to be 18 Million.</p>
              <p>Yet in Singapore, we have more mayors and MPs running this Island City that has a population smaller than New York City.</p>
              <p>Should we then conclude that :-</p>
              <p>either the claim made by LKY and the PAP is false - that they have all the available talents but still need so many talents to run a smaller Singapore City;</p>
              <p>or that the ONE MAN MAYOR of New York City is smarter and more efficient than all the PAP Mayors and MPs that are needed to run all the Town Councils in Singapore?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Yes, culture, history, population, education, circumstances are all different - but politics remains as politics - even as issues may differ.</p>
              <p>The <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Principle</span> of Democratic Practices</em> remains the same, even as variations may exist in one form from the other.</p>
              <p>Can our Democratic Practices in having an Election every 5 years amount to being democratic - considering the manipulation that exist to prevent Singaporeans from fully participating and engaging on the issues ?</p>
              <p>Given the track record of what LKY has said and done, it is obvious that he will not submit himself to the vagaries of a fair and open election system that allow Singaporeans a free and open election - that is to hold one without the broadcast and print media being muzzled, without the election boundaries being manipulated, without the GRC becoming ever bigger, without further increase in rules and regulations that handicap the Alternative Parties, and with the ballot boxes closely guarded by volunteers and properly marked to prevent any claims of tampering by any political parties.</p>
              <p>To put it more simply - can you honestly say that a Blue Label Whisky served in a bar in Singapore is different in taste from a similar Blue Label served in a New York bar ?</p>
              <p>The bar in a Hard Rock Cafe in New York may take on a different decor and present a different atmoshpere from one in Singapore or Hong Kong, but the drinks from the bottles should all be familiar to those who have tasted it.</p>
              <p>The standards of a Hard Rock Cafe should be the same throughout the globe.</p>
              <p>Politics as practised in a Democracy should reflect a certain minimum standard of decency, accuracy, transparency, and honesty - which unfortunately does not exist in the democratic practices seen in Singapore since 1957.</p>
