            <div class='col-md body'>The lady choose to admit her mom-in-law to a <strong> fully private hospital </strong> . The government has no control on how they regulate pricing of private healthcare operators. <strong> However the government can regulate the pricing in restructured hospitals </strong><br><br>They do not have B2/C class at all . How to compare to a restructured hospital?<br><br>However I can tell you admission to a B1 class in a restructured hospital for a bypass can cost less than 20k and they are quite fast. In 2 weeks, they operate. 1 week to settle your will and second week to  enjoy time with your family.<br><br><strong> So do you expect to pay around 800 dollars per year for insurance premium to go to A1 class ? </strong>  You have to be joking right? Like that even I will fly back for healthcare in Singapore for just 800 dollars per year for A1 class hospitalisation .<br><br>Even in other countries (Australia and USA), their insurance premiums for private healthcare is up the roof . Take for example Australia - If I choose to be covered for everything including cardiac bypass surgery in private- my insurance will go up to at least 2k per annum in Australia  , not to mention medicare levy in taxation ( for free public health) which costs me about 700 dollars per year.  And I still have to pay the freaking gap after medicare australia and my insurance pays the hospital.<br><br><strong> Compare this then : A1 class (RESTRUCTURED) for a bypass on average cost around $18k or so , 90th percentile ( just after below top 10 ) costs $24897 - this is taken from MOH website </strong>.<br><br>And remember somethings like disposable monitoring leads , disposable arterial lines cost around 100-450dollars per time of use. IV cannulas around 20-50 dollars depending if you have add ons. Drains cost around 70-200 dollars depending on whether it is disposable or not with drainage tubes which may cost 30-100 dollars depending on complexity. While the special dressing sets and equipment may cost around 200 dollars to sterilise or discard per use . Sterilised gauze , surgical tape , steristrips , saline solution also cost a fair bit depending on what brand they use . Probably they tried to resuscitate the old lady which means pay for the resus items as well and that is a period of the time where you don't care about wastage when it comes to saving a life. After that they might jolly well tabulate what items are used . Each resuscitation I remembered cost somewhere from 500k worth of resources and supply replacement to about 2k when the whole trolley has been used.<br><br><strong> When you choose a fully private hospital, all these will be charged to your account. The government has no regulation of the private sector so don't expect the government to reply on why it costs so much in Gleneagles </strong></div>

The staff nurse does your dressing and that is also a fixed daily nursing fee .<br><br>In A1 class private - the surgeon <strong> charges </strong> you <strong> each time </strong> he sees you. He does your dressing and he puts in additional charges as well per dressing and time taken plus complexity. Basically you can expect between , let's say hypothetically, the amount of 600 dollars per visit to 2k per visit and dressing (based on the bills I have seen in private hospitals) . So if you have stayed for an average of 9.2 days , and every day you needed visits and dressings - it could easily come up to 5.4k for visits alone or if the patient insisted that he does the dressing , it could come up to 18k alone . This is what private surgeons do - they charge alot so that you have the privilege of seeing their faces everyday.<br><br>Another example which is freely available to compare on the internet is Glaucoma .<br>Let's look at gleneagles and SNEC for Glaucoma surgery . Both compared at 50th percentile and 90th percentile .<br>SNEC (PRIVATE CLASS RATES)<br>- 50th percentile , costs a total of SGD 782<br>- 90th percentile a total of SGD 2199.<br><br>Gleneagles -<br>50th percentile SGD 1096 dollars for hospital stay and SGD 2575 for doctor's fees. In total at 50th percentile : SGD 3671<br>90th percentile SGD 1472 dollars for hospital stay and SGD 5940 for doctor's fees.<br>In total at 90th percentile : SGD7412<br><br></div>

No matter how much a nurse can try to help u by calling the doctor, if the doctor doesn't want to come , he doesn't come. Next time - try to yell at your gatekeepers.<br><br>Go to SGH ....it is better especially when the best cardiothoracic surgeons are there . My relative discharged out of Gleneagles to go to SGH private class because the cardiothoracic surgeons are better than his sh!tty one in Gleneagles.<br><br>TTSH is more for communicable disease admissions. TTSH and AH are the worst from what I know.</div>

Unlike you who started telling people to fly a kite . I just told them calmly I want to see the nursing officer in charge if my dad is not seen within 10 minutes because we have been waiting for almost 20 mins to be seen  and he looked worse than before - he looked so red that I thought he was about have a stroke.

Earlier in triage his blood pressure went to 180/100 and that was not critical enough to be seen straight away .  I think it was about 210/150 when I took it at home.  Another nurse took his blood pressure again  and yes it was again off the roof. She called a passing attending doctor to have a look and my dad got seen straight away. They dosed him up with antihypertensives to lower it in the observation bay and monitored him for 24 hrs because his blood pressure was off the rocks. The doctor did say it was lucky that I told the nurses that something was wrong because he could possibly have had a stroke from a high pressure like that.<br><br>I didn't yell at them or anything . I just told them calmly and politely what the situation was and that I will hold the hospital responsible if he collapses. Fast service suddenly. "sue", "lithigation", "hold the hospital responsible" are the key words if you think there is an emergency that your relative needs to be seen. However I don't advise you to use it if it is not an emergency. It is unfair to others who have been waiting.<br></div>

I ever worked 12 days in a row without a day off in one hospital. You take a ridiculous load of patients in Singapore.  The pay is basically was 1/3 of what I earnt in Australia with 1/3 of the workload I get from Singapore. Plus you have people yelling at you for service - it doesn't get better in Singapore.<br><br>I can understand that you are unhappy about your father being treated that way . I am surprised tho on how they treated your dad so mildly . I remembered SGH rushes them straight regardless of class into the resus bay and hook them up to be cardiac monitored.<br><br>Yelling won't get the job done neither does insults. Just talk to them about your situation calmly i.e. I think my dad is having a heart attack and I think he might die.  I am sure someone will see your father immediately.  After all Nurses and Doctors are human beings too. If they refuse , remind them of their legal obligations to the care of a human life. Not one of them want that on their conscience that a human being  dies or suffers as a result of neglect.</div>
