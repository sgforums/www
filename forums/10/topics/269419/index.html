Public hospitals and clinics must continue to find ways to reduce the waiting time, or at least indicate the time taken for patients to be seen. Perhaps, a nurse can be station near the registration counter to assess the category of severity and complaint so as to group those of same diagnosis to facilitate and speed up doctors' time.</blockquote>Minister Khaw Boon Wan has visited Toyota in Japan according to the news to study its famous Toyota Production System.<br><br>Apparently, Toyota has succeeded in coming up with a process management of some kind which has improved the efficiency and productivity of Toyota.<br><br>Today, Toyota has overtaken its competitors in sales not only in Japan but USA in automobile sale.<br><br>How is it that our leaders are not able to emulate good process management like Toyota to decentralize all works and services of government to work towards producing the greatest benefits for the greatest number once mentioned by MM Lee himself.<br><br>If there are major shortcomings with the present top-down leadership system like ours it will most probably be in the areas of implementation with the top leaders' being too obsessed with their own conceptual policy talks but little regard for identifying them in daily work processes carried out by civil servants.<br><br>The whole civil service needs to go through another revamp targeted at:<br><br>(1) decentralizing and delegating all major core tasks, works and services and execution processes to all levels<br><br>(2) using process management to integrate all policies works and decisions to daily time-scheduled work routines of staff.<br><br>This kind of bold implementation excellence is the only way to break away from the strangle-hold of top-down ad hoc and instructional micro-management approach which serve the narrow top-down self-interests of the few top echelon with constant denials of problems without accountability and transparency.<br><br>This kind of governing system called collective or distributive leadership will then be more accountable which will unveil or self-correct internal inherent problems to bring about greatest benefits of the greatest number.<br><br>Autocracy can no longer continue to serve the citizens with more and more problems as seen in all sorts of nkf and the auditor general recent reports of many wrong doings within many ministries. We are becoming a deeply divided society where ordinary citizens' interests are being constantly sacrificed for the narrow governing look-good reports of the top echelon of leaders.<br><br>(read: <a href="http://www.managefranchise.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">www.managefranchise.blogspot.com</a>)</div>
