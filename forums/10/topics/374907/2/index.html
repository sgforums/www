              <li>Again you are making assumptions that more money buys you better performers, have you heard of the term "white trash" used in HK, a term refering to expats who get 2-3 times the local colleagues get, and yet produce nothing, and these "trash" seem to stay in the company like forever?</li>
              <li>Back at your native home - Taiwan - your national budgets are also super high, do you get the same level of productivity as compared to other countries?</li>

              <p><br> Let mei mei tell you all lah, you people so called intellectual
              uncles are all living in your own intellectual world, giving
              intellectual comments and critics about the ruling party, but on
              what basis do you known about why our minister are getting high
              pay? Is it because you all are Jealous, envy or in the very poor
              lower 10% singaporeans? So what if our Ministers get the highest
              pay in the world? If this is the constant arguement to comment
              on our Minister, you can go on for the next 10 years and you can
              come here again and said our ministers' pay is very high again,
              nothing changed? </p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">Maybe its because the minister's pay is part of government expenditure and places a burden on the people? Maybe its because of the "honest mistakes" they make? Maybe its because their salaries are not in-line with politicians from other countries, even the superpower and other great powers? Maybe is because of the perception that the money can be better spent on other areas like healthcare, welfare etc.?</span></p>

              <p><br> So what? rich dun need to die ar?? Rich got rich problems, poor got
              poor problems ya. And most of the time, rich got more problems than
              the poors. The most problematic for the rich is when they are going
              to die...full of problems. Just like my grandfather.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">Not really related to the issue. But there is alot of difference when survival is an immediate concern vs insecurity vs who is going to inherit the wealth after passing on.</span></p>
              <p>Let do the reverse psychology, (hope no one will vomit) Aren't
              we proud that our Ministers are getting the highest paid? Can
              anyone said that money is not a motivation factor? So, who is not
              greedy? and who is not corrupted? Every countries govt is
              corrupted, it just a matter of how much??</p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">Money is a motivation if its variable. As in not guaranteed.  Why should we be proud that our ministers getting the highest pay? Are we putting a flag anywhere? Its a government expenditure where the burden is placed on the people.</span></p>
              <p>LKY studied Confucianism, he is not confused, he understand that
              to achieve the basis of human perfection inorder to create a great
              nation, you need to start from the very base, and that very base is
              you, a person. If you not straight or well nurtured, your family
              will be messy, and that inturn, turns your nation into
              chaos. </p>
              <p>He understands that a perfect person will ultimately bring in a
              perfect and strong nation. But to create a perfect person, you need
              to factor in many perks and opportunities, instill in for him
              patriotism so that he is happy with what he had and will
              produce the goods for the nation in his utmost ability. Therefore
              he put in a lots of emphasis on Education to mould a person,
              provide him with more then enuf funds(paid) so that he can function
              and concentrate on his work without much distress from external
              environment. In this way, Singapore progress.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">If you are talking about "yi ren wei ben". The question becomes what is the word the "ben". Is it "yi ren wei gen ben"(for the people). or is it "yi ren wei zhi ben"(the people as capital).</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">As "perfection" is subjective, maybe you would like to tell us your idea of a "perfect person" and a "perfect nation". You talk about perks and opportunities, given the influx of foreigners, which increased competition for jobs and suppress wages, maybe the perks and opportunities are for a select group of people. Education did not teach me to be patriotic. IMO, it taught me to be rational. Comparing apple to apple, are you suggesting that the ministers in other countries are under much distress due to lower pay in comparison to their singaporean counterparts?</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you look around other most of other countries, you see many
              corruption, some even daylight robbery, I am not saying that we dun
              have corruption, humans are easily bound to corruption, cos greed
              is nature in human instinct. And corruption does not mean only in
              monetary term, even a flavor, is also a corruption. LKY understands
              all these, so inorder to lower corruption and obtain a good
              Govt, he pre paid the Minister extra compensation, so that
              when a Minister is being offered for corrupiton, he/she will think
              thrice? Understand or not...Uncles</p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">Xiu shen, chi jia, zhi guo, ping tian xia". Your essay does not suggest that they actually "xiu shen"ed. And, are we paying them to prevent them from doing something they might do? </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">*lame simple illustration*</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">Me to angel "give me some money or i'll kill you"</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">so you should give me the money? or should you take other preventive measures? do you go to the authorities?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">To tackle a drug trafficking problem, do you legalise the drug, or do you make harsh laws?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">"end illustration*</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">Of cos, its not to say the system does not have its merits, if such a scandal happens, the impact can range from "honest mistake" to threatening the stability of the country (especially if it involved external nations).</span></p>

              <p>If he can do it and he did, what more can you say. Yes, you can
              downgrade him to pig or wolve, but he did it, that is the most
              important. Just like my boss, he always said in the backlane
              board meeting <span style="color: #ff0000;">"I dun care if you are my daughter or
              staff, and I dun care how you do it, but if you can deliver

              history"</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #808080;">That is something a boss can say, not a leader of a nation.</span><span style="color: #808080;"> a boss can change his employees, a leader cannot change his citizens. Even when a boss says that, at most it can only be a slogan; a mere flag to fly. A daughter will always be given more opportunities/tolerance than a staff.  FYI, in the early years of the USSR, their GDP growth rate is very high, at the cost of gross inefficiency(i.e they use more resources to produce a unit of good). The cost of delivering goods is an impt factor.<br></span></p>

              <p>Of course there are other perks and opportunities that bring in motivation for a person to excel, and money is one that cannot be evaded, high achiever leader are people who look for satisfaction before moving on to the next level of archievement or target. To groom a leader that you found, you need to provide him the adequate compensation, be it tangible or intangible, he needs all these before he can truly perform. Once their family is taken care of, education level is achieved or achievable, opportunties lies infront of him with good advancement, he, as a achiever, will charge forward.</p>

              u dun talk to me about cheering, i shop at Cheers and is alway
              cheerful.</p>

              <p>If i and you will to look at thing positively, we will not be
              around here, you hv to respect negative view too.</p>
              <p>Of course there are other perks and opportunities that bring in
              motivation for a person to excel, and money is one that cannot be
              evaded, high achiever leader are people who look for satisfaction
              before moving on to the next level of archievement or target. To
              groom a leader that you found, you need to provide him the adequate
              compensation, be it tangible or intangible, he needs all these
              before he can truly perform. Once their family is taken care of,
              education level is achieved or achievable, opportunties lies
              infront of him with good advancement, he, as a achiever, will
              charge forward.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>YOU PAY PEANUT YOU GET MONKEY</p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">Apparently your standard of "adequate compensation" is flawed. Because their pay is NOT in-line with top-level officials in other countries. Granted, a certain amount of income is needed, but definitely not to this extend. Taking care of families, with their ministerial pay, they can take care of dozens of familes. The talk about peanuts is really peanuts, we are comparing top leaders. Are you saying that other leaders are monkeys? </span></p>

              <p>For me, I stay 2Km from a prestigous school in bishan, but already, they have rejected me 2 years in advance for my son. however, my friend can sell his flat in hougang, move to the flat just infront of this school, and register with ease just before the admission exercise is to be carried out.</p>
              <p>Also, a parent who rented an apartment just for the admission exercise, and once done, return back to their home which is at least 10km away.</p>
              <p>How does that helps parents with their first born?</p>
              <p>Yes, the current structure benefits parents with many many children but what about those who are conceiving for the first time?</p>
              <p>I am not suggesting a removal, but maybe a clause when there should be a 3-5yrs of staying at the location b4 even allowing to participate for the admission exercise.</p>

My kopitiam soon kuay ah soh who sell only in morning has a son, who is an army colonel, very fat and shorty type, just like you, due to his poor young life, he enter Primary school at the age of 10 yo, but he excelled, and it is a very poor school with lots of fighting and poor result, only he did well, later he goes all the way to take scholarship in SAF. Now he use to come in the afternoon to take his mother home. So nice.</p>

My kopitiam soon kuay ah soh who sell only in morning has a son, who is an army colonel, very fat and shorty type, just like you, due to his poor young life, he enter Primary school at the age of 10 yo, but he excelled, and it is a very poor school with lots of fighting and poor result, only he did well, later he goes all the way to take scholarship in SAF. Now he use to come in the afternoon to take his mother home. So nice.</p>

              <p><br>The "hum" never fail to "talk cock and sing song" - can a Colonel "come in the afternoon to take his mother home" ?</p>
              <p>Are there any "very poor school" in Singapore ?</p>
              <p>With you in a blur every morning - after walking the streets all night and pretending to be a manager in your father's Bar, talking cock and singing song with your foreign girls - can we believe you can still be awake to know anything about your "kopitiam soon kuay ah soh" ?</p>

              <p>Congratulations Lionoasis for your efforts - whatever your goals for this thread maybe.</p>
              <p>With so many critical issues that affect Singapore, can 5 questions  possibly cover the many concerns when all are pressing issues ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Question 1.</p>
              <p>Is LKY aware of the unstable legacy that he has created for Singapore in which there is no possible avenues for any smooth transition or handover of executive powers from one political party to another, when he has politicized the all various public institutions that govern Singapore - which consist of the Parliament, the Presidency, the Judiciary, the Legal Services, the Civil Service, the Grass-root organisations, the Police Force, the Military and all the Statutory Boards and Agencies, all Government Linked Companies and their subsidiaries that have been set up with Public Money ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Question 2.</p>
              <p>Why will LKY not give Singaporeans a bigger role or stake in the entire politial process ? </p>
              <p>The present selection process for important positions - to protect the interests of Singapore and Singaporean - is a farce, when LKY and / or the PM approves all the candidates selected for nomination to the various positions of the Elected President, the Chief Justice, Senior Judges, Police Chief, SAF Chief, the Heads of the various Government Linked Companies. If these positions are supposed to be independent and non-partisan, the Selection Panel should similarly be formed by non-partisan citizens. A better alternative for selecting persons to such important positions would have been for the candidates vetted by a panel that is formed by representatives from various Alumni and Associations of Professionals - such as Lawyers, Doctors, Surgeons, Chartered Accountants, Engineers, Architects, and other groups that represent the larger Civil Society. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Question 3.</p>
              <p>Is LKY challenging the collective wisdom of 3.2 million citizens - when he said that in a freak election result, the "ARMY" will have to step-in to resolve a situation, when a Government that is formed by an Alternative Political Party begin their work to unlock the National Reserves ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Question 4.</p>
              <p>Which "<strong>ARMY</strong>" is LKY  alluding to when he did not mention "<strong>the SAF</strong>" - is he referring to his "<strong>Private Army of Gurkhas</strong>", whose existence here, is paid by Singaporeans to protect all the sensitive installations and residences of the PM, MM and SM ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Question 5.</p>
              <p>Will LKY and the PAP dare to level the political ground rules by - (a) releasing the Election Office from being under the control of the PM's Office, (b) have the Elections Commissioner being appointed by a select committee drawn from the Alumni and Association of Professionals, (c) ensure no gerrymandering of election boundaries that are always redrawn at every elections and seemingly from past election results to dilute support for the other parties, (d) releasing the strictures over the print and broadcast medias that slant reporting in favor of the PAP, (e) subjecting PAP members to the same Law governing the Election, (f) ensuring the Police will not be partisan, (g) declaring an Election to be invalid when less then 60 per cent of the populaton will participate in the election, (h) according the full respect from all the Mnistries, Civil Servants, Statutory Boards and Public Administration to the office of an Elected Member of Parliament - irregarless of the political parties ?</p>

              <p><br>question 1</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Temasek is a business entity as all other corporation, they only provide annual financial report for their shareholders which you can obtain it at the Singapore chamber of Commerce.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>question 2</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>CPF is a fund created to overtake the pension funds of yesterday, it is able to meet it obligation and continue to serve the public, so far, no one is deny or unable to withdraw when maturity arrive.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>question 3</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>HDB is the icon of Singapore housing, it will alway offer affordable rate to the people of Singapore, otherwise, it business will goes bust, like all corporation, it need to make profit, however its profits is unlike private organisation which their profit back to shareholders, HDB will plough back it profit to the general citizen of singapore. You must remember that HDB dun just built flat, they also have to dig the drain, bus stop, shelter, parks, exercise areas, seating for old peoples, lifts, cable laying, drainage system, power supply alternate station, road, walkway, car park, garden etc etc...and all these also need money.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4. Satellite dishes banning is not because of illegal viewing of TV, in fact most of us are using optic cable for HD viewing, but also because illegal trading, betting, gambling and gathering can be a social concern for our fragile society. Foreign media is not ban, you can access thru nets and also cable vision, Singapore is one of the top country to protect Intellectual property and copyrights, that is why, we are able to maintain as the best place to do business.  </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>5. As long as Ministers business are not in a way conflict with their political movement, they have the rights to venture into business and shares as anyone of us do. It will be a talent waste if this particular Minister who picked up from a doctor or lawyer and yet cannot carry on with his practice to help the citizens because of his Minister status committment.</p>
