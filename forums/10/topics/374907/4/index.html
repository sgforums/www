              <p>My Qns is as below,</p>
              <p>1) When government want to give money again?</p>
              <p>2) How come the influx of FT wasnt controlled initially?</p>
              <p>3) How is the government going to tackle the widening of the salary gaps</p>
              <p>4) Based on the current escalating housing price, when will be the right time to step in?</p>
              <p>5) How come a failed CEO like Ho Ching can still continue to stay on in temasek holding?</p>

              <p>1. Govt gives only rebates, never money hor</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. FT is alway controlled, it is during that time booming period that we need alot of FT to sustain our economy inorder to meet the demand of the hot up economy</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3. Training, education, skilling and upgrading is the key to close in on salary gap, you can go on and screw your superior for getting a much higher paid then you, but did you look at your credential before make sure remarks? Singapore is base meritocracy, the more merit you have, be it you are a nerd or beng type, the more chances you get higher paid.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4. The best time to step in is not within this one year, the prices is high now, not what you get during the begining of 2008 when it was at it lowest before thing changed in the begining of this year, so, if are going in now, it a bit too late. But Singaporeans are like that, you buy, he bought, she buy, they bought etc etc, it is like a fashion, a trend, but all this will come to an end...by then, what are you going to do with your bell bottom jeans?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>5. Failure is the begining of success, Ho Ching (my aunty) by now is a better and cleverer businesswomen, peoples are alway saying about her lost but never her gain for past decades, it is not really fair to judge a person just because of the global crisis that hit hard on Singapore economy. Oei Hong Leong also lost alot, so it Sand CEO, so is OCBC chief, but they are still the top person there, so why pick on my aunty Ho?? Wouldn't it be a waste to ask Ho Ching to go after she had gained so much experience both in good times and bad times.</p>

              <p><br>There are some truths to this, they the PAP have been in power for far too long that they are sometimes confused between government duty and a polotical party's limitations.</p>
              <p>Eg. Mr Goh (i think it was him) once told the people of Potong Pasir that had the opposition won the election again, they would not be given HDB Upgrades.  WHAT!!??  What has that gotta do with the election results?!  HDB is government run and not PAP run, and "updraging" should not be used as political leverage.  This was very wrong.  Were people of Potong Pasir oppressed, yes for sure.</p>

              <p><br>Remember, MM said that there is no fair game for the oppositions.   If Chiam wins, means Potong Pasir is the ward of the opposition so they will not be treated as equal.    Sad that we have bunch of self serving, self centred, "you die your business" type of ruling party. </p>

              <p><br>harlot, let me tell you, you will never never succeed in putting a stop to freedom of expression from those who do not agree with the ways of your beloved PAP.   YOu think by asking all these retarded questions people will be intermediated by you and stop expressing themselves, you fail, epic fail!</p>
              <p>You are a double headed snake, one moment full of praise of the PAP and the next moment speak ill of them.   PAP is so unfortunate to have a fan like you.</p>
              <p>Having said what you said above, all or most we read from your posts are nothing but shit, nuisance, propaganda to stop constructive discussion here.    If you are not contributing effectively here don't point fingers, harlot.</p>

              <p>You should not be overwhelmed by the contents of my posts, as with your exposure from living in so many different cities and environment for the last 20 years, you will also have formed the same opinions as I have when you spent enough time in Singapore.</p>
              <p>It is from near similar experience as yours that allowed me to compare what Singapore could have been, if not for the self-serving policies that prevent Singapore from truly reaching its full potential.</p>
              <p>It is heartbreaking that Singapore has always to be compared with the worst so as to appreciate what Singapore is today.</p>
              <p>It is even more ironical that Singaporeans have never been encouraged to compare with the best, and to push ourselves to be better then what we are today; but instead we are constantly reminded to watch our backs - for fear that those behind us will catch up and supercede us.</p>
              <p>This is the arrogant methods employed by those who are insecure in their hold over political power, which require existing accomplishments to be endlessly reminded, and the ruthless need to suppress any ambitious passions for alternative ideals that will subvert their tenuously controlled environment.</p>
              <p>This is politics in Singapore.</p>
              <p>One's heart will always be where one's fondest memories have been - as the people and the environment have been your foundation in your formative years to make you what you are today.</p>
              <p>It is good that your heart remains in Singapore despite all the different exposures and experiences that colored your views and values, and it only show the true nature of your character as one who never foresake your roots.</p>
              <p>The many different exposures and experiences that you have gained will surely be beneficial for Singapore if you should decide to return permanently, and contribute to the change that must surely come when the closed inbreeding environment of the PAP create freak politicians.</p>
              <p>The danger for Singapore is not that any Alternative Political Party will takeover the reins of Government and bankrupt the National Reserves - as many others have also observed, which is reflected by a political writer, who had so eloquently written (and I will extract a passage from his article) :</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p><em><em><em>The same newspaper finally addressed the question that people have asked for years: What if a rogue government sprang from the bosom of the PAP? …</em></em></em></p>
              <p><em><em><em>The newspaper noted that of all the scenarios for Singapore’s future, this is about the scariest, and yet, I would add, it is also one of the most likely. </em></em></em></p>
              <p><em><em><em>It is scarier than the scenario of an opposition party winning a general election, forming a new government and then making a hash of things, because this latter scenario would imply that there are competitive elections, which in turn means there is an avenue for the people to throw out the incompetents before long.</em></em></em></p>
              <p><em><em><em><span style="color: #ff0000;">A rogue government springing from the PAP itself is the scariest of all, because it means they will have all the wide powers available to suppress dissent and entrench themselves in power</span>.</em></em></em></p>

Training, education, skilling and upgrading is the key to close in on salary gap, you can go on and screw your superior for getting a much higher paid then you, but did you look at your credential before make sure remarks? Singapore is base meritocracy, the more merit you have, be it you are a nerd or beng type, the more chances you get higher paid.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4. The best time to step in is not within this one year, the prices is high now, not what you get during the begining of 2008 when it was at it lowest before thing changed in the begining of this year, so, if are going in now, it a bit too late. But Singaporeans are like that, you buy, he bought, she buy, they bought etc etc, it is like a fashion, a trend, but all this will come to an end...by then, what are you going to do with your bell bottom jeans?</p>

              <p>5. Failure is the begining of success, Ho Ching (my aunty) by now is a better and cleverer businesswomen, peoples are alway saying about her lost but never her gain for past decades, it is not really fair to judge a person just because of the global crisis that hit hard on Singapore economy. Oei Hong Leong also lost alot, so it Sand CEO, so is OCBC chief, but they are still the top person there, so why pick on my aunty Ho?? Wouldn't it be a waste to ask Ho Ching to go after she had gained so much experience both in good times and bad times.</p>

              <p>Dear Atobe,</p>
              <p>Thank you for your understanding and sharing with me yet another important piece of information.  I SHALL read the article with the keenest of interests.</p>
              <p>Based on my personal experience with a few Ministers, I always felt they lacked the aura and presence that I expected in leaders.  I hope to see someone or people other than the Lee family, who can &amp; will do his/ her duty as the next leaders of Singapore.  The Lee empire will end one day.  We speculated on a few possibilities, Teo/ Yeo/ ..., and the conclusions were never comforting.</p>
              <p>Being born in the 60's, my seniors have mentioned to me many of the tactics that LKY and gang adopted to secure power.  Of course I didn't like what I heard, but I would often take a slightly different stance.</p>
              <p>If I should arrive at the same conclusion after I return home, there will yet be another mission to add to my bucket list.  No, I do not see myself getting into politics as it doesn't suit my charactor.</p>
              <p>Appreciate your comments, always, and for showing me another source of education.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>it is not a matter of whether i replied or not, but simply be frank and realistic to ourselves, PAP is in power, LKY is still alive, and the govt policies is still very much unopposed. That is the realistic things happening, oppositions are not in singapore, they have been around since independent,..so far, only 2 seats. PAP can be that good and that bad too, but i need to applaud them for holding for so long and yet still going strong.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>when i was very young in PAP kindergarden, the former Ong Teng Cheong paid a visit to my class, we kids were asked to do some paper cutting and coloring project for display in a charity for childrens "MINDS" programme. He approached me, very nicely and politely asked me what am i doing and for what i am doing. As i am newly from taiwan, i used hokkien mixed with mandarin to reply him, all people around him laughed except my teacher shaking with fear, but he smiled said, it is good that you know what you are doing, you must have the direction and cause in life, tell me little gal, how are you, as a singaporean now, going to offer to this society of Singapore?..my eyes went red and wanted to cry...but after seeing his smile and my teacher further explanation on the question, i understood what he asked, but before i want to reply, he gives me a hug and said, you dun have to answer but keep this question for the rest of your life.</p>

              <p>Few years later, in my poly years, when we were doing a telecom project sponsored by singtel, Ho Ching drop into our poly as a Guest of Honor, she went thru viewing all our stations but said nothing to anyone. Later, we were required to attend a speech and dialogue by her, during the dialogue, she asked one of our top enginneerging student group about his project, the group explained the technical parts and present their thesis...but she rudely interrupt them to stop and face all of us..i remember she clearly said, "In this world, people paid you to work, all they want is SOLUTION and not your technical know how...as long as you come out with the solution, you survive, you are paid to provide solution not how you do it OK!"</p>
