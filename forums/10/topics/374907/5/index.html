              <p>It will take some effort to find any space for LKY after the way that he has misled Singaporeans to go through the misguided path to fulfill his own ambitions.</p>
              <p>It was surprising to learn from updated information hat he was said to be devastated during the precarious days after Singapore was kicked out of Malaysia, and leaving the day-to-day administration to be managed by Dr Toh Chin Chye with assistance from Dr Goh Keng Swee and Rajaratnam, while he was recuperating at a chalet in Changi Point.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans should stand proud for what we have gone through since the dark days immediately after 9 August 1965, in which collectively we survived the skewed and destructive policies of LKY and his PAP.</p>
              <p>Some of these policies that were imposed on Singaporeans included</p>
              <p>- the Family Planning program that were willfully pursued despite all good advise and all due to LKY's fear of political unrest with an exploding population that threaten his political position when he has no certainty of being able to meet their economic needs;</p>
              <p>- the mess that National Service caused to our lives - especially to those born before 1949 and still had been recruited to provide the initial leadership;</p>
              <p>- the hardships that were imposed onto Singaporeans born during the late 1940s who have to apply for Suitability Certificate that is no more then security check on the background of the student applicant and the family before being allowed to enter University or even Polytechnic;</p>
              <p>- the closed door policy of LKY and his PAP that kept Singaporeans out of politics and made into economic digits contributing to the wealth of the nation;</p>
              <p>- the hardship that LKY and his PAP created when they absorb the major portion of the wages from all Singaporeans by holding the monopoly that provides all the critical essential services for living in Singapore - covering food, transport, and utitlities;</p>
              <p>- the seemingly hopeless impotence in the ability of Singaporeans to seek the return of our legitimate political rights for our voices to be heard and for our views to be implemented;</p>
              <p>Singaporeans should be proud of having survived all these abuses, and still bidding our time when those who have not been given the opportunity at the ballot box - shall give LKY and the PAP a surprise by rewarding the Alternative Party with a significant victory at an Election.</p>
              <p>What we have achieved today is owed very much to ourselves and NOT to LKY or the PAP - as if though they alone can single handedly cause these magic to appear.</p>
              <p>It is the average Singaporeans that work as the economic digits and laboring in the Civil Service, the manufacturing industries, the commercial trading companies that have come together in different ways to make Singapore what it is today.</p>
              <p>Even the impressive speeches made by the Ministers are written by the average Singaporeans assigned to work or assist in the various Ministries, and tasked to provide background research for the speech to have substance; with the Ministers making the final polish to suit their own style.</p>
              <p>Even the plans for the development of Singapore are the product from the minds of average Singaporean tasked with providing the basic plan and the finishing schemes to allow the development to be completed.</p>
              <p>At times, we wonder if the development plans are also not initiated by average Singaporeans challenged to provide ideas for a better future for ourselves.</p>
              <p>Under such circumstances, should we not be proud to be Singaporean - whatever the ethnicity we maybe ?</p>

              <p>Thank you for your answer.</p>
              <p>LKY said PAP would still win over the next two elections, what is he trying to achieve, or was it another comment without thinking much?</p>
