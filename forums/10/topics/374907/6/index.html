              <p>how old is LKY this year, 86? how many terms do you think he will still serve? 2 elections or just the next one? maybe he will decide to call it a day and not stand for election.</p>

              <p>He will not be so flippant with his thoughts that concerns the future of the PAP and his political relevance.</p>
              <p>Two elections is a 10 year span, which will bring him to age 96 - the age when his venerable father passed on.</p>
              <p>He has all intention to serve till 96 - even as his characteristic sharp mind begin to fade, and perhaps he is preparing his exit in a glorious way to die in office.</p>
              <p>One will need to ask - what possibly can his agenda be ?</p>
              <p>Can there be so many skeletons and loose bones in the cabinets within the various government offices that he is determined to conceal ?</p>
              <p>When LHL assume his place that was planned for him as PM after GCT had warmed it for a period of 14 years, LHL had claimed that he will not leave any stones unturned and that there will be no sacred cows for the sake of Singapore's economic and political stability.</p>
              <p>It was a disappointment when Singaporeans heard from him that some stones are best left in their original position, even as they were turned over for examination.</p>
              <p>On the surface, these stones are seemingly inocuous as it merely sought for politics to be liberalised, and for Singaporeans to have wider political space.</p>
              <p>Yet, it was decided that it was unwise for such old stones to be discarded but to be carefully replaced in their original positions and to preserve the status quo.</p>
              <p>This statement is the product from an uncreative mind, who cannot create a better reason to sell a difficult product.</p>
              <p>It clearly show that LHL is not a political animal - as he lacks the basic skill to promote his position.</p>
              <p>The pathetic part is that LHL has no political position of his own, and his existence in the PM's office is to protect the Father's interests.</p>
              <p>Now it seems that LKY insists on being around to plan for the next succession that will again perpetuate the protection of the "dark secrets" that can never be revealed.</p>
              <p>Is it not already telling - in such loud volume - the absence in any Freedom of Information Act in which government archives are allowed to be open for public study or reviews of past policies after a period of 30 or 50 years ?</p>
              <p>Who will take over the political reins from LHL - as the demands made on his person will take a toll on his health and aggravate his present cancer that is in remission ?</p>
              <p>There is some talk that the next candidate to be groomed may well be the Jinx.</p>
              <p>Who else will have a clean and unblemished record that will satisfy and accepted to be trustworthy to LKY's craving for political security for himself and his PAP - except one of his own ?</p>

              <p>TCH seems to be a likely candidate, as someone once mentioned his ties to the First Familee by marriage.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, Georgie will have to take a back seat as he has no ties to the Familee.</p>
              <p>MBT is a bag of controversy, while WKS is already entering the replacement age.</p>
              <p>At the very peak of the upper echelon Elitist Leadership, it is one happy Familee, where one watch the interest of the other, while the other takes the point lead and take the incoming flak.</p>

              <p>The weakness is not about their livelihood as without their present political positions, they would have already harvested sufficiently all that they need through 42 years since coming into political power in 1957.</p>
              <p>The No 1 law firm would have struck gold vein during the late 1960s through the 1980s, when the impression was that using the No 1 law firm would help expedite the completion of the legal documentation for the HDB purchased. </p>
              <p>This impression was allowed to fester in the minds of the thousands of applicants that made a bee-line to No 1 Law Firm after getting their papers from the HDB.</p>
              <p>The insecurity can be seen in the violent reaction to any viable and credible political challengers that appear on the political scene, and one will see the creative best in the methods employed to "fix" these challengers.</p>
              <p>It was the inexperience of LHL during the 2006 Election Rally when he let out the truth that with more Opposition Members elected, he will have to spend more time to think of ways to "fix" them - shocking revelation from a son learning well from the Father !!!!</p>
              <p>What could possibly be the cause for such insecurity - considering the claims of the existence of a righteous, honest, incorruptible and morally superior government since 1957 ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Are there some darker secrets that should not see the light of day ?</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As the archives of the British Colonial Office begin to open its library of historical records, researchers have discovered political gemstones that revealed the truth of the events that transpired.</p>
              <p>From the archives, <a rel="nofollow" href="http://books.google.com.sg/books?id=VQyX-pExxvMC&amp;pg=PA207&amp;lpg=PA207&amp;dq=british+special+branch+lim+chin+siong+not+a+communist&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=hGlYib6llJ&amp;sig=Eui2oeFPhWrfDcQOfXDCJ25kbpU&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=hVy-SpvmO5XW7APGsYmHAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6#v=onepage&amp;q=british%20special%20branch%20lim%20chin%20siong%20not%20a%20communist&amp;f=false">‘it has been shown that even the status of Lim Chin Siong – as a Communist - was not clear to either the British or to the Singapore Special Branch, and remains a point of debate among academics’. (*1) </a></p>
              <p>This is in stark contrast to LKY's insistence that Lim Chin Siong is a Communist, even as no proof has been offered.</p>
              <p>Ironically, we now have <a rel="nofollow">‘the records of the Colonial Office archives revealing the many disgraceful politicking that occurred to grab the political center stage and the powers that come with it’(*2). </a></p>
              <p>It will surprise the uninitiated that the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://sgblogs.com/entry/55906">‘History of the PAP, and the History of Singapore's attempt at Self-Rule - had involved Lim Chin Siong – who was also a key member with LKY in the Singapore delegation led by David Marshall to negotiate for Singapore Self-Rule in 1953 (3)  </a></p>
