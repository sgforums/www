              <p>2.  if next gahmen take over n decided to abolish the scheme, is there enough money to return to the ppl?</p>
              <p>3. r u tat ignorant that HDB build bus stops and parks? so where the accounting?</p>
              <p>4. are we still in the 3rd world in communication?</p>

              <p><br>1. Are u so sure they are borrowing from CPF, where is your basic? if you tell that to LKY, u will get sue ya, be smarter.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. CPF is a fund entrusted to the president of Singapore and it peoples, you think the next gahmen will abolish it with no return for all, i think peoples will roast them in public alive. We got a consitution to protect and honor ok.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3. Why should HDB show you their account books?? who are you, a shareholders or what??? as i said, you can alway obtain an annual financial statement and read it. And if you are a share holder, you can attend their AGM and object anything u dun like.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4. No, for you info, we are going to be the first fastest broadband excessible to all part of Singapore in this part of the world, did u notice alot of ground digging nowadays..more high tech optic fibre will be lay to more remote station for both house, office, workplace, food centre, and all public places.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>5. So far so good, when LKY found a leader, he will nurture him to be better without sacrificing his trade.</p>

              <p>Temasek is a business entity as all other corporation, they only provide annual financial report for their shareholders which you can obtain it at the Singapore chamber of Commerce.</p>

              <p> You would have been more convincing if you intend to be a mouthpiece for your own "hum" instead of trying to be that of the Jinx.</p>
              <p>Only your position as a "hum" will depend on the financial numbers taken at their face vallue from the annual reports.</p>

              <p>CPF is a fund created to overtake the pension funds of yesterday, it is able to meet it obligation and continue to serve the public, so far, no one is deny or unable to withdraw when maturity arrive.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Can an immobile "hum" know the difference between "overtake" and "takeover" ?</p>
              <p>It is doubtful that a "hum" can be mature at whatever age.</p>
              <p>Can a "hum" be any more mature and be allowed to withdraw any amount from the CPF when the stated ages have been constantly changed to a further delayed age ?</p>

              <p>question 3</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>HDB is the icon of Singapore housing, it will alway offer affordable rate to the people of Singapore, otherwise, it business will goes bust, like all corporation, it need to make profit, however its profits is unlike private organisation which their profit back to shareholders, HDB will plough back it profit to the general citizen of singapore. You must remember that HDB dun just built flat, they also have to dig the drain, bus stop, shelter, parks, exercise areas, seating for old peoples, lifts, cable laying, drainage system, power supply alternate station, road, walkway, car park, garden etc etc...and all these also need money.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Does a "hum" know more then the smuck that it is stuck in ?</p>
              <p>Since when has the HDB profit been distributed back to the citizens of Singapore ?</p>
              <p>Is the "hum" not contradicting its own brain left outside the shell ?</p>
              <p>Are Singaporeans not asked to pay for the neighborhood upgrading schemes too ?</p>
              <p>Obviously when the "hum" lives in a small shell - and with the brain left outside - can the hum know that HDB dwellers pay for conservancy charges that form a sinking fund that pays for all the neighborhood amenities ?</p>
              <p>Obviously, can the "hum" understand the larger schemes of the PAP in planning the sources of all its revenue and to recover infrastructure costs so as to report the huge profits from every government departments ?</p>
              <p>When the government is profitable, who are its customers - except the citizens ?</p>
              <p>Can "hums" from Taiwan be a naturalised Singaporean ?</p>

              <p>4. Satellite dishes banning is not because of illegal viewing of TV, in fact most of us are using optic cable for HD viewing, but also because illegal trading, betting, gambling and gathering can be a social concern for our fragile society. Foreign media is not ban, you can access thru nets and also cable vision, Singapore is one of the top country to protect Intellectual property and copyrights, that is why, we are able to maintain as the best place to do business.  </p>

              <p>Only a "hum" living in shell is fragile.</p>
              <p>Sadly, while intellectual property is protected, it does not protect the intellectual rights of Singaporeans in the calls that LKY had made to the British Colonial Government, and also to the Federal Government of Malaysia when Singapore was part of the history during that period.</p>
              <p>Can there be respect for copyrights and intellectual property in Singapore - when even brainless "hum" will copy all the propaganda without any intellect applied to be circumspect and discern critically; but will simple mindedly accept the politics of unscrupulous deceit as the truthful and honorable principles ?</p>

              <p>You know..., I can't help but get big laughs when you guys talked to the "hum", but what is a "hum"?  If it is the "hum' we add to char kway tiao for extra flavor, why call her a "hum"?  Or is it because...oh my god...</p>
              <p>I am probably doing something wrong, I talked nicely to Angel7030, and got talked back violently; you get on the other hand, submissive &amp; playful response, what has become of the world we live in?!</p>
              <p>As always, your particpation has been great.  No Atobe,I didn't have any agenda when I started this forum, except I wanted to keep abreast with the developments back home.  I have lived outside Singapore for 20 years, and I am very homesick, just can't wait to get back into the "shit hole" we are in, hahaha.</p>

              <p>Well, after responding to my comments so many times, and visited my forum - "Top 5 Qestions u wanna ask d Government" multiple times, you finally realize I have questions about our government's policies and practices, deh?!  At least it is a good start!</p>
              <p>I think "against" is a strong word to use, I rate our government 7.5/10 remember?  This forum is about the remaining 2.5 if you have not realized.</p>
              <p>With all the forces against you, and you are still coming back for more, what are you looking for?<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Violet/confused.png" alt="confused.png"></p>

              <p>Noah,</p>
              <p>You mentioned about Mah BT...?  I once looked him in the eyes asking for suggestions of how overseas Singaporeans could contribute more to our country and I got snubbed.  Still think I am a big fan of some Ministers?</p>
              <p>Dun know what he meant by "affordable", they are so distant from the people that they are probably using stats and numbers to determine our level of satisfaction over our quality of life.  Maybe, just maybe, as long as your can still afford some weekend shopping once too often, you have too much money left.  There is a whole lot of conspiracy theory of why governments in general, are not giving too much freedom and power to the people in order to gain control, but I won't go into that.</p>
              <p>One thing is for sure though, while I still give feedback to the government (like through this forum - hopefully), I would rather count on my own ability to out run the costs of living in Singapore.  The brighter side of things is we are re-modeling Singapore, side effects is an unfortunate derivative, but there are new opportunities around.  At least this is what I think.</p>
              <p>Surely there are many complaints amongst Singaporeans, so much so that just earlier today, PM Lee needed to reiterate the government's policy of putting Singaporeans before foreigners when it comes to social welfare.  Can they do a good job at it and by when?  I have no answer to that.  Imperfections are there to stay.</p>
              <p>In a nutshell, while many of the issues stated here are true and are REAL PROBLEMS, I still think we are a relatively better run country.</p>

              <p><br>There are some truths to this, they the PAP have been in power for far too long that they are sometimes confused between government duty and a polotical party's limitations.</p>
              <p>Eg. Mr Goh (i think it was him) once told the people of Potong Pasir that had the opposition won the election again, they would not be given HDB Upgrades.  WHAT!!??  What has that gotta do with the election results?!  HDB is government run and not PAP run, and "updraging" should not be used as political leverage.  This was very wrong.  Were people of Potong Pasir oppressed, yes for sure.</p>

              <p>It is comforting to know that there are no agenda beyond the interest to reconnect with Singapore, and I can only pray that you are not from the group of young Singaporeans in the 60s or early 70s who had left in droves for various reasons.</p>
              <p>The exodus had already begun in the mid-1960s, when many young Singaporeans had left Singapore out of disgust to the many different administrative mistreatment received at the hands of the PAP Government - who was desperately fighting their political foes during the lead up to Malaysia, and then clawing back from the abyss that LKY had misled us in his failed ill conceived merger with Malaysia experiment.</p>
              <p>Those were the days when young Singaporeans applying for NUS were subjected to "Suitability Certificates" being cleared first, and which involved background checks on political activism - not only on the applicant but also on the family.</p>
              <p>Others had left as the PAP had imposed National Service military training for all new applicants to the Civil Service, even when these new applicants were born before the NS statutory birth year of 1949.</p>
              <p>Then there were others in the 1970s - who had left for the political persecution from an insecure PAP determined to de-politicize NUS, Nantah, and all Singaporeans.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Your score of 7.5 out of 10 is too generous to LKY and the PAP.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Singapore is where we are today not entirely due to the success of the PAP policies and planning, but more from a very flexible population that continue to strive and thrive despite all the self-serving policies that the PAP insist on inflicting on Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>Singapore is where we are today due to the plans created by young and visionary Singaporean technocrats that formed the core of many study groups that built the skeletons and fleshed it out - when all that the PAP political leadership did was to set the general direction but with no clue as to how to arrive at the envisioned destination.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>One clear example would be the Bukit Timah Canal that LKY had to smell the black muck that filled the canal from Beauty World to Rochor, and LKY had given the order to clean it - with a promise of gold bars being awarded to the team that succeed.</p>
              <p>This clean-up took over ten years and busted several local leading contractors, until a small local family runned contracting company tackled the project successfully. The company was managed by a family of brothers with little or no education, and had mixed their daring with the training of a few young engineers whom they employed, to test their raw ideas in scientific ways to face the task.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Without the PAP, Singapore will still be where we are today and perhaps maybe even more vibrant - if one is to look at the people of Hongkong whose population is largely Chinese with a cosmopolitan flavor, and with far less direct government interference.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If LKY and the PAP - formed by the same set of founding members - were given any latin country to run, or even one in Africa, it will be very doubtful if LKY or the PAP will be able to achieve what Singapore has been able to achieve todate.</p>
              <p>It will be doubtful that LKY can even manage to bring Malaysia to its present standard with his unaccomodating ways in bull-dozing the population to his determined path.</p>
              <p>More importantly his inability to kow-tow or accept anyone below his own superiority - which include the Royalties in all the 11 Malayan States, most of whom are less academically endowed - would already have handicapped any chances for success.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Concerning the "hum" - it is the cockles that one add to the "char kuay teow".</p>
              <p>In its living state, the "hum" simply breathe uselessly and froth bubbles of ignorance in its typically nonchalant life, when even in the face of imminent danger its "la la la" attitude will persist.</p>
              <p>There is the other depiction of the "hum" as the living "<em>twat</em>" that froths when it tingles in complete stupidity at the slightest provocation.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You could give her a 7.5 for her ignorant life in complete masochistic bliss - which explains for her willful admiraton of LKY and the PAP, and to achieve her intent at derailing any sensible thread out of simple spite.</p>
