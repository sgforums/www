Not only that, the initial claims were that famous muslim political people and Anwar are coming down - note, not that they were going to be baptisted.<br><br>after the police arrived, the muslims then claimed about 200 or 300 university islam students were going to be baptisted in an sms received. what nonsense? if you've read it, you would've known its kinda fake!<br>the people that formed the large crowd were mostly members of PAS, a political party in malaysia on the opposition.<br><br>the church did not notify the police until the last minute when most people have gathered outside the church. their fear was that if a riot went on, and if there were any christians passing by the mosque(which is located quite near) they would be in danger</div>

Tsk.</div></blockquote>As stated in my previous post, one who studies the holy Al-Quran should have a better idea of Apostate (I'll be explaining later below). A true muslim will<br>definitely not turn his back on the religion if he follows the teaching of Islam closely. But sadly nowadays  there is definitely a lot of non-practicing Muslims who are just basically muslim by name.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>To understand the matter , you need to know who is an Apostate  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"><br>Who is an Apostate (Murtadd)?<br>Islam is a form of submission and a muslim is a person who submits to the will of Allah (SWT) and His Messenger (PBUH) .The muslims stronlgy believe that all individuals have entered into a state of covenance with Allah during the period before being conceived. Now the question that arises is :Why don't we remember the covenant? Why did Allah erase it from our memory? Well the answer to this lies within the pages of the Holy Book wherein Allah says that he has suppressed this meeting with Him in our sub-conscious ,and the main reason for the suppresion into the sub conscious is to see whether the muslims can survive ALLAH 's test!<br>So then who is an Apostate and what exactly is apostasy as per Islamic principles ?<br>A person according to Islam is considered an apostate when :<br>1. He makes an explicit declaration that he has objected Allah's Will, and associates other Gods with Allah .This person is known as Usherak -bil-lah<br>2. If he commits acts of <strong>Blasphemy (kufr) </strong><br>3. If he burns or soils the Quran<br>4 . If he enters into a church , temple , synagogue and assumes another form of worship !<br>5.If he believes in re-incarnation<br>6.If he assumes that the universe has existed for all eternity<br>7. If he assumes the Prophets existence in another form , be it comical or hypothetical etc.(ex. the representations of the PROPHET muhammad (PBUH) through the danish cartoons)<br><br>A person who was born into Islam and then converts into another religious practice is known as a natural Apostate or Mutad -Fitri.<br>A person who has converted to Islam and then converts into another religious practice defying Islam is known as Murtad Milli , which means Apostate from the Community.<br>The quraninc or traditional word that describes Apostasy is Irtidad and Apostate is Murtad.<br><br>I hope this answers some of the burning questions are clarified. Do not misunderstand my intent. Peace to all. May God bless you  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br></div>

Someone else had stated that it orders the stoning of apostates, and I was just trying to correct this misperception. I also don't deny the existence and authenticity of the hadith.<br><br>For me, my line of reasoning is the same as you: I would certainly be very disappointed to know if someone else had left Islam for another religion. At the same time, though, I feel that the hadith on this issue were more relevant for the early days of Islam when such hard tactics were needed to keep things in check. This was especially the case when there were people who kept converting in and out of Islam in order to undermine it.<br><br>That isn't the situation now. I feel that judgement on the person should be left to God. So long as there remains a chance for the person to revert back to Islam, then punishment ought to be postponed indefinitely until God judges him.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If we look at the matter closely, such indcidents are so precarious because it deals exclusively with one's personal identity. In this instance, the rumored baptism of Christians is taken as an insult to the religion of Islam and as such some segments of the religiousity took it as an attack upon their identity. I'm pretty certain that present in the equation are individuals who utilize such sentiment as a political tool for their own benefits. I'm certain that both the Koran and the Bible has their own reference to such despicable individuals. I urge everyone, especially in this day and age, to exercise much thought before being encapculated into this conflict of ideals. Afterall, don't we share similarities too, as parallel existence trying to live good lives in accordance with our religious and moral believes?</div>
