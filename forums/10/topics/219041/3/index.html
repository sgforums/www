Protest, riot ? Maybe yes...but in the context of our STRONG mandate government I think this is not feasible.</strong> Killing ? Definitely no... It is definitely against my principle perhaps even in Islam to use violence when dealing with such a sensitive issue. To each his own.<br><br>You said there were a number of court cases on this issue and some are still ongoing. Care to provide the links for me ???<br><br>Click the below link to learn more about the topic.<br>http://www.islamicperspectives.com/Apostasy1.htm<br><br>To conclude, apostasy is the clear repudiation of a faith by a person who formerly held it. Doctrinal differences, however grave, cannot be deemed to be apostasy. <strong>The Punishment for Apostasy lies in the hand of God Almighty, against whom the offence has been committed.

Peace<br><br>-------------------------------------------------------<br><br>I read your posting and I quote Â“Maybe yesÂ… but in the context of our STRONG mandate government I think this is not feasible.Â”  I noted your answer to my question of whether you will participate in the protest, riot ...is both Â“YesÂ” and Â“NoÂ”.  Â“NoÂ” in Singapore because of the STRONG mandate government.  Â“YesÂ” in other countries without STRONG mandate government (my guess was eg Malaysia and Indonesia).<br><br>Your last paragraph stated very clearly, God Almighty decides the fate of the individual in the life thereafter.  So I conclude that you mean the life on earth is decided by the Learned Muslims of the like of you.<br><br>If my understanding is not correct than I apology.<br><br>Now my understanding from you is that the fate of those Muslims who turn away, be it on earth or in the life thereafter, will be decided by the God Almighty.  You or I or any one of us should not play god to protest, riot or doing anything silly to these people as well as to the other religion (and other peoples) they turned to, as we are not God and neither are we above God.<br>[/b]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>For me, I don't really care what the punishment for apostasy for Islam is AS LONG AS the followers don't disregard civil law and commit the heinous <strong>crime</strong> of murder, or even physical assault/harassment on the said apostate.<br><br>I don't condone acts of violence based on religion and certainly look upon such people as uncivilized brutes with no respect for an individual's freedom of choice.<br><br>After all, in Islam, he will go to Hell, and hence it's not for them to judge. Why not let their God do the judging, instead of being 'God' and taking matters into their own hands?<br>In the past, their Prophet allowed the killing of apostates. I don't think that is right, nor applicable today. It's like slavery or polygamy. While in certain countries, women outnumber men, remember that the majority of undeveloped/lesser developed countries (i.e. India, China, parts of Mid-East,etc.) where men outnumber women - as an example.<br><br>Anyway I don't mean to offend anyone I'm just up for a civil conversation. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>Do correct me if you feel I've gone wrong/inaccurate somewhere.</div>
