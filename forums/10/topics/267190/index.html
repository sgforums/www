Economists had expected second quarter GDP to grow 6.6 percent from a year earlier.<br><br>Underpinned by strong growth in the biomedical manufacturing and transport engineering clusters, the manufacturing sector is estimated to have grown by 10.2 per cent the second quarter, up from 4.4 per cent in the previous quarter.<br><br>Fuelled by the property boom, the construction sector is estimated to have expanded by 17.9 per cent in the second quarter, up further from 11.6 per cent in the previous quarter.
