            <div class='col-md body'>It seems that Malaysian Foreign Relations in the hand of their very capable Syed Hamid Albar will see another brilliant move from his pate absent scalp.<br><br>The reported news on Saturday night came as a surprise with the sudden notice of International Arbitration, that gave Singapore a very short timing of TWO Weeks for a Singapore response to their action - on the issue concerning Singapore land reclamation works at Tuas and Pulau Tekong.<br><br>When piecing all the Malaysian actions together, it is quite clear that Malaysia is intending to hog all that they can from Brunei, Indonesia, Thailand, and Singapore.<br><br>Could this be the Malaysian Government sour faced reaction in not getting their way to set up an alternative ASEAN Secreteriat being established in K L ?<br><br><strong><span class="large"><span style="color: darkred;">Reclamation in S'pore: KL takes legal action </span></span><br>Malaysia breaks off talks, refers dispute to arbitration; Republic disappointed at sudden decision but confident of its case </strong><br><br><span class="small">By Lydia Lim </span><br><br>MALAYSIA has launched a legal battle against Singapore by referring its unhappiness over reclamation at Pulau Tekong and Tuas to international arbitration, instead of continuing negotiations.<br><br>It has also applied separately to put an immediate stop to the reclamation works.<br><br>Expressing disappointment over its neighbour's actions, Singapore yesterday described them as 'premature and unnecessary'.<br><br>'It is regrettable that Malaysia has not made a serious attempt to resolve the matter through negotiations,' said a Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) spokesman.<br><br>Foreign Minister S. Jayakumar also told reporters later that he found Malaysia's sudden decision to break off talks 'strange and disappointing'.<br><br>Speaking on the sidelines of the opening of the Apec secretariat building, he said: 'We very much prefer to have negotiations and an amicable solution but they've now decided to take this route and it is their right.'<br><br>Malaysia has also made the immediate stoppage of reclamation works as a precondition to further talks.<br><br>Rejecting this, the MFA spokesman said that the suspension of works was a very serious matter and would be justified only if there was 'clear evidence of serious and imminent danger'.<br><br>'Singapore has provided Malaysia with technical reports and explained in detail that our studies indicate that no significant adverse effects will result from our reclamation works. Malaysia's demand is therefore not justified,' she said.<br><br>Both the MFA statement and Professor Jayakumar's comments came in the wake of a press release on Friday by the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea. It announced Malaysia's request for 'provisional measures', including to stop the reclamation in the western and eastern parts of Singapore.<br><br>These measures are an interim step that states can take to protect their interests before a case goes to arbitration.<br><br>According to the press release, Malaysia said the works were causing 'serious and irreversible damage to the marine environment and serious prejudice' to its rights.<br><br>Malaysia first raised its objections to the reclamation in January last year.<br><br>Following its complaints, Singapore repeatedly asked Kuala Lumpur to back its claims with technical reports. It did not do so until July 4 this year.<br><br>Meanwhile, Malaysian politicians and officials alleged through their media that the reclamation encroached on Malaysia's territorial waters, narrowed the shipping lane and damaged their country's interests in various other ways.<br><br>Singapore rebutted all the claims.<br><br>On July 4, Malaysia sent a diplomatic note giving Singapore notice that it was referring the matter to international arbitration under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.<br><br>It gave the long-delayed technical reports and demanded that Singapore respond within two weeks, or it would apply to stop the works.<br><br>Singapore gave its reports despite the short notice.<br><br>And at Singapore's suggestion, officials and experts also met here on Aug 13 and 14.<br><br>'It was a good start to understanding each other's concerns,' said the MFA spokesman. She added, however, that given the complex and highly technical discussions, it was clear more meetings were needed as both sides had only identified the issues that divided them.<br><br>Singapore had suggested a second meeting to be hosted by Malaysia.<br><br>But on Sept 5, Malaysia applied to the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea, signalling it was closing the door to further negotiations.<br><br>Yesterday, the MFA spokesman expressed confidence that 'Singapore's position will be vindicated' when the issue goes before international arbitration and adjudication.<br><br>As Singapore is small and land is scarce, reclamation was necessary for its survival and prosperity, she said, and its reclamation plans had always been in the public domain.<br><br>'In all our reclamation works, Singapore acted in conformity with our rights and obligations under international law.'<br><br><a href="http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/topstories/story/0,4386,208598,00.html?" rel="nofollow">http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/topstories/story/0,4386,208598,00.html?</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>Actions currently taken by Malaysia:<br><br><strong>TWO LEGAL TRACKS</strong><br><br>Malaysia is doing two things on the legal front at the same time. First, it is seeking arbitration to decide whether Singapore has a right to reclaim land in Tuas and Tekong. Second, it wants to put an immediate stop to the ongoing reclamation works.<br><br><strong>TRACK #1 </strong><br><br>Under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, countries have three options to settle disputes. They can go either to the International Court of Justice, the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea, or decide on arbitration.<br><br>When Malaysia and Singapore signed the Convention, neither specified the route each preferred. By default, their recourse will be via arbitration.<br><br>On July 4, Malaysia served notice to Singapore and started arbitration proceedings. The arbitration tribunal, which has yet to be set up, will comprise five members agreed upon by both sides. They have so far chosen one representative each, with the remaining three yet to be decided. The process starts only after the panel is set up.<br><br><strong>TRACK #2 </strong><br><br>Pending the setting up of the arbitration tribunal, Malaysia wants Singapore to stop the reclamation works immediately.<br><br>On Sept 5, it applied to the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea for what is called 'provisional measures' to stop the reclamation. This process is usually swift. The tribunal may hold a hearing within two weeks and gives its decision soon after. It may rule as early as the end of this month.<br><br>-------------------------------------<br><br><strong>WHO WILL BE IN SINGAPORE'S LEGAL TEAM?</strong><br><br>Foreign Affairs and Law Minister S. Jayakumar said Ambassador-at-large Tommy Koh, who was the president of the Third UN Conference on the Law of the Sea, will lead the legal team.<br><br>The minister expressed 'full confidence' in the team, which will comprise experts from the Attorney-General's Chambers, the Foreign Affairs and National Development ministries, and foreign counsel and experts.<br><br><strong>THE UN CONVENTION ON THE LAW OF THE SEA</strong><br><br>It lays down a comprehensive regime of law and order in the world's oceans and seas. It sets out rules governing all uses of the oceans and their resources. It enshrines the idea that all problems of ocean space are closely interrelated and need to be addressed as a whole.<br><br>-----------------------------------<br><br><strong><br>What's happened so far</strong><br><br>January 2002:<br>Malaysia raises objections to Singapore's reclamation works at Tuas and Tekong for the first time. Singapore asks for reports to back Malaysia's claims.<br><br>July 4, 2003:<br>One-and-a-half years later, Malaysia sends the reports and a Third Person Note, which is a diplomatic note, giving Singapore notice that it is referring the matter to international arbitration. It gives Singapore two weeks to respond and an ultimatum to also stop reclamation works within two weeks.<br><br>July 17, 2003:<br>Singapore replies and includes reports to show that the reclamation will not cause significant impact on the areas of concern.<br><br>August 13-14, 2003:<br>Officials and experts from both sides meet in Singapore to discuss each other's concerns. Singapore proposes a second meeting which it suggests Malaysia can host.<br><br>Sept 5, 2003: Malaysia closes the door on negotiations and applies to the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea for provisional measures to stop Singapore's reclamation works.<br><br>http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/topstories/story/0,4386,208598,00.html?</div>

But it does object editing of its formal reply when it got published in certain paper. Note that the report is in ST, hence reflection of spg's gov posistion is inevitable, unless the KL guys like to start another blizkriez of advert propaganda, both sides will certain make their case heard in court.<br><br>It is interesting to note that only a week after the Sgp's new Defence minister Teo CK made a formal visit and met Badawi in KL, Both announced that both countries hv more to gain than current disputes. Yet, in his usual style, Dr.M unilateraly created another court case . It certainly gives an impression that his is not prepared to let Badawi ran his show another sooner when it is only weeks away from his "retirement".<br>Question is, can Singapore effort to be held-bound by KL's endless list of complains and veil-threats? Dr.M has in many occasion used the word "WAR" when making public comments  about Singapore's relation. He may not directly refers it as a threat, but by freely employing such wording has reflected about 2 things on his belligerent nature.<br><br>1)  He is prepared to flex some military muscles if he is confident that they can take on the SAF.<br><br>2) He lacks statesmanhood and, he knows, for now, choice (1) is suicidal hence the next better choice is the war of words, confrontational attitude and winning more potential international allies. Notice both countries now are playing the "Thailand card" ?<br><br></span><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>Did the New Straits Times of Malaysia finally spoke the truth for the objections raised by the Malaysian Government concerning Singapore's reclamation works at Tekong and Tuas ?<br><br>Interesting read from:<br><a href="http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/columnist/0,1886,16-209044,00.html?" rel="nofollow">http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/columnist/0,1886,16-209044,00.html?</a><br><br><span class="small">SEPT 10, 2003</span><br><br><strong><span class="large"><span style="color: darkblue;">Reclamation puzzle? It's all about white elephants </span></span></strong><br><br><span class="small">Chua Lee Hoong</span><br><br>PUZZLED by why Malaysia is taking Singapore to court over reclamation that's taking place strictly within the latter's territorial waters? Well, don't be. Malaysia's New Straits Times made the reason clear in its editorial yesterday.<br><br>Commenting that reclamation works around Pulau Tekong would result in a narrowing of what it calls the Tebrau Straits and Singapore calls the Johor Straits, it noted: 'Malaysia is acting responsibly in safeguarding the future of Tanjung Pelepas and Pasir Gudang, which stand to become white elephants if reclamation continues.'<br><br>And there you have it. Beneath the mumbo jumbo about sedimentation, damage to the marine environment and preservation of Malaysia's right of maritime access to its coastline, the crux is simple: bilateral economic competition.<br><br>It's a competition that has become more intense since Malaysia decided in the late 1990s to develop its Port of Tanjung Pelepas (PTP) to rival Singapore's PSA Corp.<br><br>Malaysia thinks reclamation works at Pulau Tekong will stymie its development. Pasir Gudang, opposite Singapore's Pasir Ris, is a feeder port through which a lot of cargo transit, some on their way west to the PTP, and some north either to Senai Airport or the inland peninsula.<br><br>At present, most cargo vessels approach Pasir Gudang from the east through Singapore waters south of Pulau Tekong, instead of through Malaysian waters to the north, as the latter are shallower.<br><br>On Aug 27, Business Times also broke the story that the Sembawang shipyard - a former British base which does mostly repairs now - will be moving to Tuas. The move is part of SembCorp Marine's consolidation of ageing shipward facilities now spread between Jurong and Sembawang.<br><br>For Malaysia, however, the impending move must have sent alarm bells ringing: Once the Sembawang shipyard is closed, Singapore won't need a deep-water passageway for ships in those straits. It would have nothing to lose if it decided to build a bridge between Pulau Tekong and the mainland. Malaysia's Pasir Gudang goose would be cooked!<br><br>Ah, now the penny drops! That is why Malaysia is rushing to replace its end of the Causeway with a bridge. For no matter how crooked or unsightly it would be, it would serve one crucial purpose: allow ships to pass through. A crooked cat is still a cat as long as it catches mice.<br><br>So is this a cat-and-mouse game in which one side is choking off access and the other scrambling to open new access lines?<br><br>Nationalistic Singaporeans with no love for the northern neighbour would see it that way. But Malaysia would be loath to be the mouse to the Singapore cat.<br><br>For one, they would have been caught napping if so. This is because reclamation works at Pulau Tekong and Pulau Ubin were announced in Parliament as early as January 1992, but Malaysia did not voice objections until January last year.<br><br>In fact, then Malaysian Transport Minister, Dr Ling Liong Sik, told the Malaysian Parliament in February last year that Singapore's reclamation works had not affected the navigation line leading to Pasir Gudang. The Marine Department, he said, had investigated the matter, and found no impact.<br><br>As for Tanjung Pelepas, it's too far away from any reclamation works to be affected.<br><br>To my mind, the port factor aside, there's another reason why Malaysia would want to refer the reclamation matter to international arbitration.<br><br>It's related to the Pedra Branca case which Singapore and Malaysia recently referred to the International Court of Justice (ICJ). When there are two cases involving the same two countries, what are the chances of the same country winning both? The law of averages - and of human nature - would say these are lower than that of both countries winning a case each.<br><br>To be sure, the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS), which is hearing the reclamation case, is an entirely different panel from the ICJ. The ICJ is a 15-member bench while the ITLOS has 21 members.<br><br>The fraternity of distinguished experts in public international law is, however, a small one. Members of the two panels must be nominated by member states, and are elected by secret ballot. Politics has featured often in the history of both panels; as many judgments have been made on political grounds as on their legal merits.<br><br>How will the reclamation case pan out in court? The merits of the case are obviously in Singapore's favour; it would take severely contorted legal logic to argue that reclamation works in Singapore waters have caused serious prejudice to Malaysia's rights of maritime passage.<br><br>But Malaysia, clearly, is basing its arguments on more than law, at least to its domestic audience. Editorials in both the Malay and English press flog the old line about the claims of friendship and neighbourliness.<br><br>Putting it with polish but disingenuity, the New Straits Times said: '(Singapore) should decide once and for all if civility should be the order of the day in dealings with Malaysia. Mere lip service will not do. Like justice, friendship must not only be maintained but be seen to be accomplished.'<br><br>Let the law, and only the law, decide.<br><br>The writer is Features Editor of The Straits Times.
