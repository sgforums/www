            <div class='col-md body'>That is why the government is right to persuade the madrassahs to adopt the national curriculum. For too long, religious schools have produced school leavers who have no other skills apart from being religious teachers, and we do not need that many in Singapore. It is a sensitive subject but it is a problem that has to be tackled. It is great that this problem has been addressed.<br><br>We do have a large group of post-war baby boomers who left school early in the 1960s to work in labour-intensive industries. Their skills are not longer relevant today. These people, who are now in their 50s, are the ones most badly affected by structural unemployment. They are also the ones least able or willing to handle new jobs in the wafer fabs and the aerospace industries. Hopefully, low-skilled service jobs in the integrated resorts will be able to provide jobs for these Singaporeans, who tend to have little savings for retirement as well.<br><br></div>
