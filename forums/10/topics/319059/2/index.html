              <p>There is nothing wrong with Catherine Lim sharing her opinion.  If Singapore is to become a more open society, we will have to start accepting the fact that not everyone will share our opinion, and neither will everyone will think the way we do.  Acceptance and tolerance of differences in the diverse populace is one sign of a truly cosmopolitan society. </p>
              <p>However, the above doesn't apply to totally OTT (over-the-top), fanatical ideas that are totally irrational, without basis and which push the boundaries of logic and sensibilities!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>In any case, it is a question of ethics.  In countries like Japan, Taiwan or the US (and I'm sure there are many other examples), Ministers who fail in their job will accept responsibility and step down as a form of apology to the citizens for failing to be vigilant and having something undesirable and of huge consequence happen during their watch.  They are often not directly responsible for the error, but it is an acknowledgement of their responsibility, and an honourable demonstration of integrity.</p>
              <p>Leaders who uphold high moral ethics will always inspire followers who respect them.  Likewise, leaders who demonstrate a self-serving attitude and who shirk full responsibilities for major mistakes will just invite ridicule and frustration from the masses.  We might not be able to do anything about it... for now... but the sense of incredulousness and the loss of respect will not wane. </p>
              <p>Hell, even CEO's have been known to quit over mistakes committed during their watch!  Should we expect even less from leaders of an entire country?!</p>
              <p>If not an outright resignation, then at least some form of censure, some sincere apology and acknowledgement of responsibility.  The way the situation has been handled thus far leaves much to be desired.  I am sure there has been much collective rumblings over the issue from the grassroots level up.  I think from the kopitiam to the spanking, posh corporate suites, the same dissent is being voiced.</p>

              <p>Well, the government has mentioned many times that our security is "world class" Yes, WKS already has taken the credit for providing "world class" security for the past few years in the form of "world class" million dollar salaries and bonuses.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now that Mas Selemat has escape, the government has essentially failed to provide the citizens with "world class" security. He must be replaced with somebody who can live up to that promise, or take a pay cut for his inability to provide "world class" security.</p>

              <p>How convenient it will be - to compare government ministerial postions to that of corporate chiefs insofar as ministerial and civil service remunerations are to be appropriately benchmarked, but not in the manner that accountability and responsibility are to be accepted ?</p>
              <p>This must be some very intelligent and scrupulous manner in selectively taking the ''best and rejecting those that are burdensome''.</p>
              <p>Are you defending such an approach in using tax payers money without the obligatory accountability and responsibility ?</p>
              <p>In most corporation, the CEO, his Management Team and the Board of Directors are responsible and accountable to the Shareholders.</p>
              <p>If Singapore Inc is runned as such - with all the inherent features of a MNC - why should the Elitist Leadership not be held responsible and accountable to the Singaporean Citizens, who are the actual shareholders of Singapore Inc. ?</p>

              <p>During the Election 2006 - James Gomez bungling nomination papers saga - he did also gave his apology in a very public manner to the Staff at the Election Office and to the general public.</p>
              <p>Did MM LKY accepted the humility of James Gomez with his apologies and actions taken to make amends towards the Election Office ?</p>
              <p>Surprisingly, MM LKY led hsi MIW Team in driving the screws deeper to get a reaction from the WP Leadership - despite the fact that WP Low Thia Kiang had proposed that what needs to be done had been done and ''Let's move on.."</p>
              <p>Yet, a dissatified MM LKY will not allow matters to rest and further questioned how the WP leaders could call for everyone to ''Let's move on'' when he believed that the erroneous statements made by James Gomez surrounding the missing papers had implied the Election Office to be inefficient and the Staff being dishonest.</p>
              <p>There was no room in MM LKY's intelligence for honest human error - and his skill at extending a superficial injury into a deeper self-inflicted wound based on his art of extreme exageration never fail him in his skills to extract maximum mileage from the mistake of a political opponent.</p>
              <p>He insisted on the WP Leadership to do more then just an apology from James Gomez.</p>
              <p>By his own standards, should we not expect an even higher standard from his Elitist Group of Super-Human Talents - the <em>'creme de la creme' </em>from what little talent that Singapore has ?</p>
              <p>MM LKY had once lamented the lack of personal responsibility from the local culture compared to the Japanese, when the Top Leader of its Corporate World will accept FULL and UNMITIGATED responsibility for the mistakes made by the upper, middle or lower rank staff of the corporation that he head.</p>
              <p>Such a culture is also part of the Japanese character in its Political Establishment, in which we have time and again observed the changes in the Political Leadership of political parties, as well as Ministeries.</p>
              <p>Why will MM LKY expect Singaporeans to consider following such high standards of principles from the Japanese, but will not follow suit in his own standards or that of his own MIW Super Talent Team ?</p>

              <p>admit it, some are sour here just because the ministers r paid highest here but i think they deserve it by the results shown. coming from a tiny dot, how much capable pple can we find here, of that leadership calibre?? pay peanuts, u get monkeys ehh!! better to get these pple to be in public service rather than in pte sectors...</p>
              <p>where do u draw the line?? those responsible directly for the his escape has to be responsible. doesnt matter if they r little pple (in catherine' words) or the in charge of the detention ctr.

              <p>coming from a small dot, already have problems with pple talents willing to take leadership roles with no personal agenda, we shd not lose sight of the real issues at hand, terroism, inflation, economy slowdown, epidemics, or even global warming ...we should move on and show solidarity..........</p>

              <p>If a minister screws up and there is no action taken against him, other future ministers may become slack and take things for granted.</p>

              <p>Is this good for Singapore point_blank?</p>
              <p>You want to defend PAP regime, also must be reasonable lah.</p>
              <p>PAP regime kill your mother, you also defend them?</p>
              <p>I despise Lee Kuan Yew but I still rate him 60% good 40% bad.</p>

              <p>i agree, so in this Mas case, DPM wu screw up boh? or are the operators at fault?</p>

              <p>That is not the issue.</p>
              <p>Mr Wong is in charge of internal security.</p>
              <p>There was a cock up with internal security which is under the charge of Mr Wong.</p>
              <p>As a public official, he should take responsibility and resign.</p>
              <p>If he doesn't resign, people will despise and be resentful towards government as a whole.</p>
              <p>Why our PAP regime so special?</p>
              <p>Pay highest in the world, cock up don't resign.</p>
              <p>Why are they so special?</p>
              <p>I see no reason.</p>
              <p>Can you give me the reason why PAP regime must be special point_blank?</p>
              <p>Highest pay in world and yet cock up no resign.</p>
              <p>Why like that?</p>
