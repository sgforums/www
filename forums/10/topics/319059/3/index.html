              <p>while you are at it... i reccomend that you being a citizen, be severely punished as well for failing to put the right govt and minister in charge with your votes.</p>
              <p>being outvoted by others is no excuse from punishment... since you accepted the rule of majority by holding onto your pink IC.</p>

Thank heavens we have rational people in government who is sanely preventing you and your kind of politics and irresponsibility. Claiming all kinds of allegations and yet, if your kind is given the rule, citizens will be out of jobs with the brand of accountability your kind is pushing for,irregardless of whose fault it truly is.</p>
              <p>At least, with the slimey James Gomez affair brought up here, did MM Lee used 'accountibility' issue to force MPLow TH to resign or made a hoohah EVERYDAY even till today over his con artiste staff, who attempted to be elected to rule over us, handling our affairs and lives for a 5 year term?</p>

              <p>On the other hand, blaming on who is to go or who is to get sack is not going to solve much problem other than creating more chaotic and unstable situation. The main objectives now is to ensure that our country security remain stable and strong, work together to catch the escaped prisoner and if not lastly, to bring back peace and harmony to our country and the world alike. </p>

              <p>To shade 343: 'world class' does not mean 'perfect class'</p>
              <p>Comparing what slimey James Gomez had done with DPM Wong's work for the nation? Ridiculous!</p>
              <p>Japan? With it's revolving door policy of appointment holders? Who's really in charge there? At least they have 127 million people to play musical chairs. How many do we have or shall we call invite foreign talents as office holders, both in the corporate and public service. Is this what you guys want?</p>
              <p>I will not stop your ventilatings. I have not the power nor the will.By all means, let it out. Express your will in the next election. May you all know what kind of society you will be asking or supporting for, if not for yourselves, at least for the next generations. </p>

              <p><br>i agree with ur point of 'expressing your will in the next elections', that is democracy.=)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>but the point on inviting foreign talent... can consider since we already getting them to do an increasing proportion of sg jobs.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>it's a one off thing what.. the direct in-charge(WKS) must know the system, how things are done, check whether they are done, all this correct..</p>
              <p>but is the guard piu chiu what.. a shop manager lay down the rules, ensure that everything sui sui, the shop assistant go and chu stunt and punch a customer, how the manager know? what the manager do? resign? of coz he sack the assistant right? of coz the manager must lan lan kiam gan by customer and take pay cut la, something which WKS never kena.. which is wrong..</p>
              <p>but this kind of piu chiu is different from system flaw what.. if the system is flawed and the in-charge never go do something den something's wrong..</p>
              <p>and u should know the lower ranking ones tend to try to smoke the higher ranking ones and wayang one.. den the higher ranking ones oso kena smoke and blur blur..</p>
              <p>not say that WKS no fault.. but oso not entirely his fault la.. im just pissed he's æ¯«å�‘æ— ä¼¤.. must at least kena abit..</p>
