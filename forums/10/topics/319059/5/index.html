              <p>Does this not confirm that your purpose here is to entertain your ego ?</p>
              <p>Why do you bother if others should judge you or me in any way ?</p>
              <p>Are you so uncomfortable of your position, or do you lack any conviction of your own points made - which is literally 'Point_blank' - that you need others to pass judgment ?</p>
              <p>Like an infantile pre-puberty juvenile, your rudeness and vulgarity is telling, and reveals your frustration in being treated like an ass, and your arse swiped by none other then yours truly.</p>
              <p>Is it so difficult for you to look up the Hansard records of Parliamentary proceedings, and discover for yourself the hypocrisy of some MPs who will voice their own opinions that goes against some of the Bills introduced, but will nonetheless vote according to their Party instructions ?</p>
              <p>In the process, you can also discover the remarks of the Speaker of the House in terminating debate that goes beyond the time bar for each item on the Agenda - even before any outcome has been satisfactorily resolved in a ONE-Party dominated Parliament - as the Speaker is also a member of the Ruling Party.</p>
              <p>Do you not have the honesty to approach some of the retired MPs whom I have named, and seek their opinions, or is it due to the lack of publicity in your attempt outside of this SgForum that allow some satisfaction for your ego ?</p>
              <p>You should realise that in the event that I am proven right by these MPs, it will be more face saving for you not to have to tone down or even offer any apologies for your arrogant vulgarity in a debate.</p>
              <p>As I have said, can you handle the facts that have been brought up, or do you simply avoid to engage on what has been offered, and simply make childish attempts to repeat your position - as if I have avoided your challenge ?</p>
              <p>Have you given up on the ISA subject in handling MSK and Chia Thye Poh - after getting horse whipped like an ass ?</p>

              <p>Some folks don't understand authority in workplace and authority in personal life.</p>
              <p>The hierarchy of management structure is such that the senior officers will manage and supervise the work of their juniors.</p>
              <p>There have been cases where parents are punished for their incompetence in controling their teenage kids.</p>
              <p>If it's not the fault of the higher authorities. Why was the superintendent sacked? Obviously he wasn't the person who committed the error in letting Mas Selamat Kastari use the toilet.</p>
              <p>I guess it boils down to the integrity of the politician in question. Whether they possess the honour to accept the error as their responsibility or push the blame down to the lower ranks.</p>

              <p><em>Susan and Anthony Provenzino of St. Clair Shores, MI, knew their 16-year-old son, Alex, was troubled. His first arrest occurred in May 1995, and in the year that followed, he continued his delinquent behavior by committing burglary, drinking alcohol, and using and selling marijuana. Alex was difficult at home as well, verbally abusing his parents and once attacking his father with a golf club. Although the Provenzinos were disturbed by Alex's behavior, they supported his release from juvenile custody during the fall of 1995, fearing he would be mistreated in the youth facility where he was detained -- a facility where juveniles charged with more violent crimes were housed.</em><a href="http://politics.sgforums.com/forums/10/topics/ch2_d.html#70"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><sup><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>70</em></span></sup></span></a><em> </em></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #993300;">Many students who don’t like to go to school are punished by their parents, but, in this special situation, one of the parents was punished for a student’s mistakes.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #993300;">Brian Gegner was sentenced last week to 180 days in jail after his daughter failed to earn a high school equivalency diploma. The man had been ordered by a judge to make sure his daughter would make a good student and earn her General Equivalency Diploma. As that didn’t happen, Gegner was charged with contributing to the delinquency of a minor.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #993300;">Brittany Gegner, who is 18 years old, said Monday she planned to take a required GED test this month, and that her father shouldn’t be blamed for her mistake, as she had been living with her mother the entire time.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #993300;">"It was my wrongdoing, not his," said Brittany Gegner, as quoted by the AP. "He shouldn't have to go to jail for something I did."</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #993300;">Her mother, who lives with her near Hamilton, agrees.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #993300;">"Brittany is almost 19 years old now and I think it's unfair to put her father in jail," said Shana Roach. "She's an adult now, and it's not right to rip an innocent man from his home."</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #993300;">Butler County Juvenile Court administrator Rob Clevenger Jr. explained Monday that the court still had jurisdiction in the case, as Brittany Gegner was a minor when the truancy problems came up and her father was charged, back in 2007.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #993300;">Brian Gegner’s wife, Stephanie Gegner, said she and her husband feared he would lose his job if he served time in jail. She added that they did their best to keep his daughter in school, but she managed to get away every time.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #993300;">The judge said Gegner may be released before his sentence is up, if his daughter passes the test in the following months.</span></p>

              <p>The UK and USA seems to be leaning towards legislations to hold parents accountable for the misdemeanours of their children - from truancy to poor exam results, from vandalism to petty crimes.</p>
              <p>It seems that based on the history of the problems of the children, parents will be held responsible for any more serious crimes committed by the child - if the parents do not take remedial actions to seek professional help for a trouble child that result in his condition deteriorating progressively into more serious crimes.</p>

              <p>The very act of a DPM WKS resigning will be more disastrous to Singapore than MSK escaping from prison.</p>
              <p>It would be scandalous, shake people's confidence, shake investor's confidence, make headline news, domestic and international, it would be a political scandal.</p>
              <p>I think all people want accountability, and I think the government tries to provide that. But we have to see, accountability is not the ultimate and sole objective, and persued until the point of self-destruction. Singapore should do it in a smart way.

              <p>Is it so difficult for you to look up the Hansard records of Parliamentary proceedings, and discover for yourself the hypocrisy of some MPs who will voice their own opinions that goes against some of the Bills introduced, but will nonetheless vote according to their Party instructions ?</p>
              <p>In the process, you can also discover the remarks of the Speaker of the House in terminating debate that goes beyond the time bar for each item on the Agenda - even before any outcome has been satisfactorily resolved in a ONE-Party dominated Parliament - as the Speaker is also a member of the Ruling Party.</p>
              <p>Do you not have the honesty to approach some of the retired MPs whom I have named, and seek their opinions, or is it due to the lack of publicity in your attempt outside of this SgForum that allow some satisfaction for your ego ?</p>
              <p>You should realise that in the event that I am proven right by these MPs, it will be more face saving for you not to have to tone down or even offer any apologies for your arrogant vulgarity in a debate.</p>
              <p>As I have said, can you handle the facts that have been brought up, or do you simply avoid to engage on what has been offered, and simply make childish attempts to repeat your position - as if I have avoided your challenge ?</p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">You are quite a joke for the masochistic crowd.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Surely your constant efforts in simply cut and paste without any further efforts to reply is simply trying to occupy the pages to tire me out from further reply to your empty pieces so as to claim moral victory to your own position.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Unfortunately, your continued silence and meer repeating with cut-and-paste of your piece reveal the typical 'point_blank' thinking of a juvenile who has lost an argument and is merely behaving badly by vandalising the debate with your repeated posting without further comments.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Juvenile tantrums need to be handled with repeated drumming of the medicine that the juvenile refused to absorb.. here goes and try not to put on a sour face after going through the lot ....</span></p>

              <p><br>That's your best effort? LOL! Asswipe Atobe, YOU HAVE NO EVIDENCES AT ALL and yet brazenly continue on. You talk so much about credibility of others and YET, you offer nothing. You are not just hot air, but a bag of FART. This will be your reputation forever. Till you answer allegations you yourself made, word whore!</p>
