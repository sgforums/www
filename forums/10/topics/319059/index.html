              <p>In straits times forum, catherine expresses her deep dissapointment and sorrow over the punishment for the selmat case.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I disagree with her that she should use such strong emotive words like , deeply dissapointed, saddened by the decisions made by govt, (somewhere along this line), because she could influence many people.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I really think catherine dun noe how politics works. She probably a smart alec jus because she is a famous writer. What she says is that bascially, too few people are punished for such big case. I once said that wong kang seng should be punished. But today, I think that accountability issue is something which i have not really understand.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In conclusion, I will say that we must give the benefit of doubt to govt in that they have punished properly. I will trust the govt because like a couple, a relationship will not develop if you keep being suspicious of each other.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To catherine, pls stop expressing your powderful english essays on local media again...... </p>

              <p>i didnt see the recent article by her, but i remb vaguely there was one which i agreed. it was abt the quality of singaporeans' lives.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>she suggest that because of the harsher conditions of the globalised world and with the percieved 'help' by the govt in bringing in foreign talent to help boost our productivity, the lives of the general singaporean is getting tougher.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>a single and often overlooked eg by her (which i found funny at first but subsequently agreed) was the queues at sg pools. over the years, the queues are increasely longer and this reflects more ppl have to turn to 'trying their luck' to find more $.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i think this is part true, but perhaps also due to the variety of betting options thats well more ppl are betting.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>anw, just my opinon of her. =)</p>

              <p>Haiz, but apparently some people think that the ones in charge, who happen to draw the highest salaries, should not be held accountable for something as serious as that.</p>

              she's one of those fancy daisy type...a little over the top but she's ahead of her time...a decade ago she labeled the relationship between the pap and the populace as a great divide, gct must have felt as if a stick went through his behind as he reacted 'violently'....but it turned out to be very true of what's happening...so don't brush her off without understanding the situation....
              
              as for the punishment, it's strange that the isd command in-charge of the centre was replaced by virtue of his position, shouldn't then the dpm also by virtue of his responsibility also be punished? i am speculating as to why the isd director is spared, simply to create a buffer...so long as he goes off unpunished, the minister himself is safe......

              <p><strong>Note the parts that are edited out by states times</strong></p>
              <p>I refer to yesterday’s report “Mas Selamat escape: Detention centre
              superintendent gets the sack”. So the Government has sought closure to
              the Mas Selamat saga by handing out an assortment of punishments to the
              nine, mainly low-ranking, officers and guards whose security lapses had
              led to the escape of the terrorist.</p>
              <p>I wish to express deep disappointment, shock and pain that in a
              national scandal of unprecedented magnitude and public outrage, it is
              only the little people who are held accountable and punished. <strong>By now, they are probably too frightened to appeal or seek redress.</strong></p>

              <p><br>Her only claim to fame is to author some books. And yes, i did read her books. Good read, but Jung Chang she certainly is NOT. And as for being an intellectual, i would let others decide. </p>
              <p>We live in a pragmatic and equal society. It's true for some that the highly paid CEO or Minister in charge should be held 'accountable' for mistakes made, even down to his cleaner, and should either resign or be censured. </p>
              <p>BUT, there is something call SYSTEM. The CEO or Minister must set up a system whereby he is kept inform of what's going on in the area of his over-seeing, because his job scope will be wide and would need several people to manage the multiple sectors.</p>
              <p>With Mas's escape, the first thing of course is to search him, and then to find out if there was a problem in the SYSTEM that was set up by the minister. Did the managers and operators followed the system, or did they derelict on their duty?</p>
              <p>Let's all keep the emotions in check and allow rationality to rule - CID and an independent committee had investigated. The system of operation was in place, but there was operators' negligence. So was it the Minister's fault? Did his system fail? Did he failed to ensure these experienced operators were properly taught in their duties? Did he skimp on funds to build a caged wired window near the toilet? Did he personally allowed the CCTVs to be inefficient? </p>
              <p>Are we the kind of society that allow emotions to rule us, blame the top men for all kinds of faults even when it is investigated, and found the fault lies elsewhere? Are we doing that out of personal dislike and self gratification to see great men topple? </p>
              <p>I am sure Catherine had lost her mind, but had we lost our minds too?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>PS: And do take note too, of 'accountability'. When such habits of chopping off heads get entrenched into law, your head and mine is as of risk just as anyone's elses, irregardless of whose fault is determined, in our equal for all society.</p>
              <p>There cannot be one law for CEOs and one law for common people. The law applies for all. Similarly with crimes - no such as thing as low or high magnitude, a murder by one man or muders by one man is still a crime in the eyes of the law, common for all. </p>

              <p>For everything somebody does, says or thinks, he/she could never appease the world. Whatever things, good or bad a person do, there will surely be someone to critisize them.</p>
              <p>Thats why, i would not judge whether it is appropritate for her to say such things, because deep down inside there is no definate views regarding some things. What she say may be right for some, but may also not be right for some. But then, she's speaking from her own viewpoint and i see nothing wrong with that. Expressing one's view should not cause people to be that furious, because its only a view as i've said. There is no right or wrong to it afterall.  </p>
