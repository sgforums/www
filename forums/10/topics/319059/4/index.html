              <p>I think the people who criticise Catherine need to respect one thing:</p>
              <p>Not everyone dares to stand up and speak his/her mind.</p>
              <p>Not everyone has an opinion. Many do not have a opinion.</p>
              <p>I respect PLURALISM and personal individual opinions.</p>
              <p>Luckily, life is a self-cleaning toilet. Even the most stinking pile of shit will be self cleaned when his life is terminated by his mortality. Even if there is no hero cum to save the world, Evil will end by its own limited life span. Thus its only a matter of time. Even the worst will come to an end.</p>
              <p>When the time is up :</p>
              <p>He cannot bring his ill gotten wealth with him to meet his maker.</p>
              <p>He cannot breath a single breath anymore even if he owns kangaroos.</p>
              <p>No money can buy life 1 more second, even if he owns his crones and kangaroos.</p>
              <p>No power can demand for life 1 more second, when the time comes.</p>
              <p>Wat time izit? </p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Her recent opinions and voice out has been rather along the same line. IMHO, singapore govt is fairly ok, i give him 80 marks.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am not happy that singapore govt is not scoring 100 marks. But i would not ask the govt to step down and go away because i realize that no one else is higher than 80 marks. So, the conclusions is .. "what to do"</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Persoanlly, with my intervention, I can make singapore reach 100 marks , i think. IN what way?... next time i got more money then see loh... cos now my concern is only making money first ... not politics.</p>

              <p>In fact, i think the world is scoring 40 marks. If you see international news and article.... you will read about a certain topic which says that humanity has placed himself at the last seconds of the clock in terms of our distance from fatal human extinction or destruction.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>From that view, the world is scoring maybe about 10 marks only. Therefore, next time when i am rich, i no choice also have to be like, world gandhi like that.., no choice.. have to reverse the situation and bring the world to 100 marks.</p>

              <p>So your blindly following the P4P's way is the right way? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>What's wrong or right is a matter of perspective, different angles different views.</p>
              <p>Old man wants to consolidate his power base to transfer power to son, while citizens want more democracy so as not to be marginalised by the regime's policies.</p>
              <p>Depends on your understanding of which system of governance benefits everybody, a system rule by a despot or by common equals. Dictatorial regime or Democracy?</p>

They went by the book from the time they started their day. Just their bad luck the great escape happened that day. Another day, and it would not have be them.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">He likened some of the projects to five-star hotels and wondered aloud whether the ministries and statutory boards housed within were competing to see "which can be better than the Four Seasons Hotel". </span></p>

              <p><br>Her only claim to fame is to author some books. And yes, i did read her books. Good read, but Jung Chang she certainly is NOT. And as for being an intellectual, i would let others decide. </p>
              <p>We live in a pragmatic and equal society. It's true for some that the highly paid CEO or Minister in charge should be held 'accountable' for mistakes made, even down to his cleaner, and should either resign or be censured. </p>
              <p>BUT, there is something call SYSTEM. <strong>The CEO or Minister must set up a system whereby he is kept inform of what's going on in the area of his over-seeing, because his job scope will be wide and would need several people to manage the multiple sectors.</strong></p>
              <p>With Mas's escape, the first thing of course is to search him, and then to find out if there was a problem in the SYSTEM that was set up by the minister. <strong>Did the managers and operators followed the system, or did they derelict on their duty?</strong></p>
              <p>Let's all keep the emotions in check and allow rationality to rule - CID and an independent committee had investigated. <strong>The system of operation was in place, but there was operators' negligence.</strong> So was it the Minister's fault? Did his system fail? Did he failed to ensure these experienced operators were properly taught in their duties? Did he skimp on funds to build a caged wired window near the toilet? Did he personally allowed the CCTVs to be inefficient? </p>
              <p>Are we the kind of society that allow emotions to rule us, blame the top men for all kinds of faults even when it is investigated, and found the fault lies elsewhere? Are we doing that out of personal dislike and self gratification to see great men topple? </p>
              <p>I am sure Catherine had lost her mind, but had we lost our minds too?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>PS: And do take note too, of 'accountability'. When such habits of chopping off heads get entrenched into law, your head and mine is as of risk just as anyone's elses, irregardless of whose fault is determined, in our equal for all society.</p>
              <p>There cannot be one law for CEOs and one law for common people. The law applies for all. Similarly with crimes - no such as thing as low or high magnitude, a murder by one man or muders by one man is still a crime in the eyes of the law, common for all. </p>

              <p><br>If a CEO in a listed company erred in it's products or services, most likely he/she will have the integrity to step down from post, else face the wrath of shareholders at the next AGM (or maybe even EGM) and be voted off with disgrace. Fancy a CEO telling the shareholders that it's not his fault, he is not in charge of that department. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> Was he sleeping in his MHA office? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>It's all a question of integrity. But even though if WKS resigns, most likely he will be assigned a post by our PM in one of the many GICs or GLCs, afterall he is a very close family member of the regime.</p>
              <p>It's hard to find such relationships in politics these days, the other country with this policy is China. I have a relative who was a county mayor in China, when he left his post, he was assigned a post in a state owned company in Hong Kong.</p>
              <p>Does any other democratic country have this policy of assigning positions in listed companies based on past political affiliations?</p>

              <p>1. You often alleged in many posts that the Singapore Government imposes ISA arbitarily and is a violator of human rights by not giving a fair trial, locking persons up and 'throw away the key', and wants ISA to be done away with.</p>
              <p>I ask you, did Mas kill anyone?</p>
              <p>2. Yet, in the same breathe, you claim Mas to be a 'class one' terrorist, the highest class, a class whereby he is a vile murderer of humans and accuse ISD of failing to keep him in detention.</p>
              <p>I ask you, aren't you being contridictory, showing your utter stupidity and irrationality? If you dislike ISA and what it stands for, why are supporting it in the detention of Mas and thus rile against ISA for their failure?</p>
              <p>This only proves your forked tongue. You have no consistancy in your belief and the only consistancy is your vile ability to twist words to your desire to satisfy your own personal ego, irregardless of the fools who follow your brand of solutions, or lack of it, to help our People.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>While Mas has not kill anyone, he had shown his propensity for it through evidence of his involvement with Osama and his animals. While no civil society will allow  incarceration of anyone without a fair trial, no society will willingly wait for such animals to commit murder, then to act.</p>
              <p>Thus, ISA was meant for this purpose - to put these animals who had yet to act, under <strong>detention</strong> for interrogation and if they are willing to recant, and shown/proven their remorse, they will be rehabilitated and set free, as some of the inmates had proven to be. Other terrorists who had committed murder would have been sent to a max security prison.</p>

              <p>So is our government 'a violator of human rights' with a humane policy of rehabilitation of society's murderers wannabe? Mas is a terrorist, period. Neither class 1 nor class 10. The only difference is he has yet to kill. And only due to respect for human rights, he is not thrown into a max security prison. So don't exagerate and fan the flames to make others think DPM Wong was wrong to put Mas in detention</p>

              <p>I ask you, aren't you being contridictory, showing your utter stupidity and irrationality? If you dislike ISA and what it stands for, why are supporting it in the detention of Mas and thus rile against ISA for their failure?</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p> <span style="color: #0000ff;">You never fail to amaze me with your efforts in being clever but fail miserably with your 'Point_blank' efforts.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Have you made a difference between Chia Thye Poh's association with a political party, and Mas Selamat Kastari's association with a known terrorist organisation ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Chia Thye Poh was locked up for 32 years, on the whim of LKY's accusation that Chia had advocated 'armed revolution based on Communist ideology' - to which no evidence had been produced after 32 years, and he was finally released as a result of him being a political liability to Singapore's effort in building a stronger relationship with the US. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Chia was a Political Prisoner.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Mas Selamat Kastari detention was based on collected information by the security services and agencies from Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Mas Selamat Kastari's ideology is common knowledge to most Singaporeans, except you for being constantly 'Point_blank' </span></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>This only proves your forked tongue. You have no consistancy in your belief and the only consistancy is your vile ability to twist words to your desire to satisfy your own personal ego, irregardless of the fools who follow your brand of solutions, or lack of it, to help our People.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p> <span style="color: #0000ff;">Have I a forked tongue, or has your masochistic 'Point_blank' brain been lashed across the different threads in this Speakers' Corner that you believe that I am using a 'cat-o-nine' whip ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The one with the personal ego seems to be reflected in your attempt at being ''Point_blank Honest" but failed miserably with your useless attempt at hiding your dishonest arguments - which always lead to "Points that are BLANK''.</span></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>While Mas has not kill anyone, he had shown his propensity for it through evidence of his involvement with Osama and his animals. While no civil society will allow  incarceration of anyone without a fair trial, no society will willingly wait for such animals to commit murder, then to act.</p>
              <p>Thus, ISA was meant for this purpose - to put these animals who had yet to act, under <strong>detention</strong> for interrogation and if they are willing to recant, and shown/proven their remorse, they will be rehabilitated and set free, as some of the inmates had proven to be. Other terrorists who had committed murder would have been sent to a max security prison.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p> <span style="color: #0000ff;">How have you been able to recover yourself so quickly to realise the use of the ISA on a person such as Mas Selamat Kastari ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Can you differentiate between a Political Detainee that is detained for competing against the prevailing autocratic ideology, and one that accept an ideology that is based on violence - whether the ideology is political or religious ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Can we trust your 'Point_blank' ability to even know how to differentiate between the two persons that have been detained under the ISA ?</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Was Chia Thye Poh reformed after 32 years being incarcerated under the ISA ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Prior to his release, did MM LKY ensured that Chia Thye Poh signed any documents that confessed to the accusation that he had advocated armed revolution based on Communist ideology, and that he has disavowed such an action ? </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If MM LKY did accuse Chia of such a vile act towards Singapore - why was such a statement not forced from Chia before he was released, as was done in the case of Singaporean Catholics who were detained after being accused by LKY that they were part of the Communist underground cell to destabilise labor relations in Singapore.</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #000000;">I am STILL awaiting for your claims. Show claims please.</span></p>
