              <p>One can read the character of the person by simply reading the level of tolerance and thought process to be able to gauge the maturity and depth of the person in the manner arguments and words are presented.</p>

              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">THEY give voice to the masses, champion the underdogs, sometimes even step on powerful toes.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">One even had to publicly apologise in 2002 for a careless comment he made about then-Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.</span></strong></p>
              <p>Their contribution often begs the question: Who says Singapore politics and parliamentary proceedings are boring ?</p>
              <p>If you raise your hand, you're obviously not sat through many hard-hitting speeches by several of the most hard-hitting backbenchers.</p>
              <p><strong>USUAL SUSPECTS</strong></p>
              <p>The usual names come to mind: <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Mr Tan Soo Khoon</span> {East Coast GRC}, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Dr Tan Cheng Bock</span> {Ayer Rajah}, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Dr Wong Kai Yuen</span> {Bukit Timah}, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Mr Charles Chong</span> {Pasir Ris-PUnggol GRC}.</strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">These are veteran MPs, "senior" in age and experience who were never picked for the Front Bench, but who have, over the years, built up a reputation for being vocal and passionate - both in and out of the House</span></strong>.</p>
              <p>"The speak from the heart," ex-Nominated MP Chandra Mohan K Nair told The New Paper</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">This New Paper report confirm the event of Tan Soo Khoon speech of dissent made, and the apology that he had to give, as well as confirming the names of the other MPs who were outspoken towards Governmental Policies.</span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Yet, each and everyone of them had consistently voted to approve the Bills that they have been most vocally against.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Hansard Parliamentary records are there to be checked - unless you are simply 'Point_blank' stupid to know how to reach for it.</span></p>

              <p>I laughed at the people here trying to assert their respective positions about Ms. Lim, even to the extent of mentioning their assessment of the "type" of person she is.</p>
              <p>Haha, hello, so what if she's eloquent enough to express her views in such a beautiful way? TS jealous ah? LOL.</p>
              <p>It's like watching a troupe of blind people pointing out where the elephants or tigers are in a circus- they don't even know if the elephants or tigers exist in the first place!</p>
              <p>How did one limping man even escape such a high security place unnoticed? It's not a hospital you know. And if they want to fire someone, I don't really care who they fire, I'm more interested in them debunking the various conspiracy theories that are flying around the internet and such.</p>
              <p>Till today, his escape still remains a mystery to me. I just cannot, for the life of me, fathom how the hell he managed to escape. It's so unbelievable that I'm better off believing that he's actually dead by the hands of the people there.</p>

              <p>The thought of MSK's death was a plausible factor from the beginning - considering the very surprising low operational standards that were initiated to pursue and recapture MSK..</p>
              <p>The entire search and recapture efforts - that was initiated immediately and cointinuing the next morning - was incredibly of ''keystone cop standard''.</p>
              <p>The search  was confined to less then two kilometer radius from the Detention Centre after more then 14 hours since MSK's escape.</p>
              <p>It was only on the fourth day after the escape that a mystery lady lecturer surfaced from the wood work claiming her sighting of MSK on the loose about one hour after the escape was realised - and heading in the opposite direction of the seach and almost 1.5 km from the WRDC. </p>
              <p>WKS retort to WP Low Thia Kiang's remarks of public speculation that ''MSK is dead'', was quite 'dead pan' with WKS asking WP Low if he believe the speculation himself.</p>
              <p>Catherine Lim's letter was no longer discussing MSK escape, but was her critique of the Government's dispensing of punishment only to the lower ranks prsonnel, while the Political Leadership walked free.</p>
