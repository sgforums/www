We just have to do a certain duty as a citizen while treading with caution in whatever we say. There is a saying - no venture no gain. So we need to stay vigilant and for me, I will try my very best to follow your good advice and not go overboard or get personal.</div>

It happened because of political expediency, as medicare and essential government services have grown too expensive being pushed up by government's own high wage policy of the 1980s - 1990s that government has to find an NKF to head off a crisis of sort through charity medicare.<br><br>So it fitted the bill of GCT government to find an alternative of providing medicare through charity explaining its support for and the rise of NKF to offer some kind of relief to moderate the government-driven high medicare costs.<br><br>However this government-backed NKF has created its own problem due to the powerful government support as with such support, no ordinary board of mortality would try to check on such rising power which eventually overwhelmed the board which lost control over its internal running of the kind reported.<br><br>This NKF problems did not happen due to naturally rising costs but was partly created by the government which needed some form of charity base to head off a crisis of high medicare costs which have grown out of reach of ordinary citizens then.

Of course, there will be areas that charges will be pressed for example the infrigement of labour law (recruitement of foreign "Indian National?" under disguise) etc.  But these are of "minor issues?" in nature, which may not satisfy most people (like you and me?) who want to see "blood?" from Mr Durian.<br></div>
