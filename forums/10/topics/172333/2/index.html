As such it has become poltically expediency for the GCT government to head off a certain crisis by lending support albeit a passive one to NKF's charity drive as a way to moderate the over-inflated medicare costs.<br><br>The government might have done the same to Ren Ci's charity drive too lately but it was NKF but not Ren Ci which has got into problems with donors because of certain extravagant spending of donors' charity monies for golden taps and other excessive misuse as disclosed in the SPH/NKF lawsuit that got NKF into problems with the donors and the public at large.<br><br>So isn't it quite clear that the government has a hand in pushing NKF's charity drive. As for NKF and Durai's excessive spending of donors' monies for golden taps the government might not be a party to such spending but the MOH as regulatory authority should be held accountable for checking of any such misuse.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ya lo, we pay them high high salary and we have to struggle struggle paying school fees, medical fees, expensive household equipment due to the high rental fee of shops, and anythng else?? no wonder many ppl buy car to go jb import cheaper necessity back home.<br>But lucky some food stallers still serve $2 noodles/chicken rice. But you live nearby good for you. If you have a car, nice for you. If you only got 2 kahs(aka legs) den you have to pay some transport companies(which raises its fares during high-operation-cost times and nvr reduce back as the high-operation times remain high and can only get higher), juz to reach the 2$ stalls.</div>
