However, the present action is illogical when performed under circumstances of profitable operation. The exercise could have been phased in on an annual basis, or on a natural attrition through resignation and retirement from 2000.<br><br>What would happen, if those companies had listened to NTUC in 2000 and 2001, and did not start the trimming exercise then?<br><br>We would see mass retrenchment on a bigger scale from 2002 to the present time, causing a bigger panic and pressure to the employment scene, and affecting economic confidence.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>We are basically running a tripartite system here.. everyone knows. Seriously, I wont know of how much power and representations that unions have in really representing the working population. The government rationalize the importance of industrial relations by putting a minister in charge of the unions. But when it comes to really retrenching people, going through all the cpf cuts and then now having to watch it stay where it is for another 2 years (who knows maybe more), the unions practically just does whatever the government says or recommends and there really dun seem to be any active fight-back at all... whatever is said is just swallowed and accepted as the right pill to cure the economy...<br><br>And all the sayings about how we need to lower costs, and accept foerign talents... for the better of the economy... the workers? the population in general...wat happens to them? everyone in singapore has practically resigned to fate already.. no struggle etc... everything is just controlled by the govt...<br><br>In the long run.. is this really good? All our future is at stake here.. I m not asking for an open revolt or anti-pap... but.. its really sad.. to already see what is in store for us and that there dun seem to be any recourse..<br><br>Just like to hear what you all think?</div>
