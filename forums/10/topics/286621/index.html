            <div class='col-md body'>I heard of this theory years ago. Decided to share with fellow forumnites.<br><br>Have it ever occur to you why a few of the key ministers hold the rank of general in the SAF? Quote a few examples:<br><br>Prime Minister LHL aka Army Brigadier General<br>Minister Zhang ZhiXian aka Navy Admiral<br><br>There is one theory which goes like this:<br><br>When election comes, the parliament will be dissolved and there will be no Minister of Defense. So who can control the armed forces at this time? Only the generals.<br><br>If there is any riots or crisis ( especially by the opposition or foreign power), these Ministers with the ranks of General have the legitimate authority to commend the SAF in the absence of government. On the other hand, we can view it as absolute power control by the PAP even in times of election. We cant help but be surprised at the far-sightedness of LKY.<br><br>Let us examine something. In other nations, we have Generals who earn their credits through the armies before joining politics(maybe as ministers or something). But rarely(in fact none) do we see full time politicians gain the rank of generals as a ministers. Only Singapore has such a classic government.</div>
