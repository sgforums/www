              <p><strong>Former French diplomat says no to "China threat"</strong></p>
              <p>May 15, 2009</p>
              <p><span>Former French diplomat Lionel Vaironï¼Œwho is known for his book <em>Threat of China</em>?
              ? among the Chinese citizens, has shared his views about China that are
              different from mainstream views held by western people in an online
              interview with the Qiangguo Forum (Strong China Forum) of People's
              Daily Online on May 14, 2009. <br><br>Below is an excerpt of the interview:<br><br><strong>China does not pose any threat to the west</strong><br><br>Q:
              As to the understanding of the relationship between China and the west,
              do you have any views different from the so-called mainstream views of
              people from the west? Since you have reached different conclusions, can
              you explain the reasons behind your viewpoints?<br><br> <img src="http://english.people.com.cn/mediafile/200905/15/P200905151006432452894961.jpg" alt="" width="400"><br>Lionel Vairon's book Threat of China? has been published in China recently.</span></p>
              <p><br>Lionel
              Vairon: I have expressed in my book that my viewpoints are perhaps
              different from mainstream views held by western people. The main
              difference lies in the opinion held by the westerners toward the extent
              of the China threat theory. Some issues involving realities make
              western people anxious. For westerners, they do not know how to
              evaluate and appraise both peril and potential threat relating to
              China, so they feel nervous. Therefore, I think that since we spent a
              lot of time in China, we find that China does not in fact pose any
              threat to the west. The key is that people living in Europe will have
              different opinions about China's military and economic development.
              However, if one often visits China, they will discover that this sort
              of view has been exaggerated to the concept of “China Threat.”<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Q: Why are some countries suspicious of China's rising power?</strong></span><br><br>Vairon:
              I have two thoughts on this issue. The first is from a common
              foreigner's point of view. For common foreigners, they feel threatened
              because China has a large population. There are Chinese people
              everywhere overseas. We see Chinese people traveling and studying
              everywhere in the world. This visual picture creates a sense of
              “threat.” We can see Chinese people in Africa, Europe, all over, so it
              seems that this has created fear. This is the feeling of common
              foreigners. They feel nervous when they see Chinese people everywhere.
              This is a very popular view.<br><br>The second answer is linked to the
              first one. Because there are so many Chinese people, they cannot find
              jobs at home, and therefore they go abroad for opportunities.
              Foreigners feel the Chinese people who go overseas are taking their
              employment opportunities.</p>
              <p>Common foreigners think of Chinese people as
              a threat also because they think that China is still a communist
              country, and they fear this very much. Many foreigners have not been to
              China, they have no idea what China's development in the past 30 years
              was like, neither are they familiar with the "Cultural Revolution" in
              China or the reforms made to China's systems. It is because foreigners
              are afraid of the word “communism.” Whenever “communism” is mentioned,
              the word reminds them of the former Soviet Union and Cuba, nations
              ruled by dictators.</p>
              <p>Therefore, they believe China is also a communist
              nation and that is the reason why they hold this kind of shortsighted
              view. To tell the truth, such views are very deep-rooted. Ninety
              percent of French people, when they see China on the Internet, would
              regard China as a communist nation, a nation ruled by a dictator. This
              is the universal and direct feelings of the French citizens.</p>
              <p>Their lack
              of understanding leads to their fear of China. People fear things that
              they do not know very well, especially when those things are
              everywhere. The French feel threatened when they see Chinese people,
              Chinese culture and tourists from China everywhere. This is the
              perception of French citizens.<br><br>Now let us talk about the western
              governments' views toward Chinese people, mainly from two aspects,
              economic perspective and that of long-term strategy. With regards to
              the economy, the western governments think a rising China is both an
              opportunity and a threat to them.<br><br>In terms of opportunity, many
              enterprises from western countries have earned a great deal of money in
              China, representing an opportunity for them. Enterprises from Africa,
              Latin America and other countries in competition with Chinese
              enterprises lost rather than earned money, and therefore for these
              enterprises China represents a threat and a cause for their losses.
              Generally speaking, there is equilibrium in certain situations.</p>
              <p>But, of
              course, in other situations, it can be unbalanced. European enterprises
              have lost some contracts in the African market in the last three to
              four years, particularly those related to building and infrastructure.
              Because of the loss in Africa of their traditional interests, naturally
              China is a sore point.</p>
              <p>Therefore, to some westerners, China's economic
              rise represents a significant threat. Moreover, the fact that Chinese
              businesses are gradually moving overseas to compete against them and
              seize markets have caused fear, as it may lead to increased
              unemployment for domestic workers.<br><br>In fact, the aforementioned
              economic rise has some objective reasoning. What I would like to talk
              about now is the subjective consciousness of people. Western
              politicians blame China for the recession in the west and other related
              problems, and this is just a type of subjective understanding.<br><br>From
              a strategic point of view, what are their views on China? Of course,
              this question also has its subjective and objective aspects.
              Objectively, China's military, economic and political rise is a factor
              that western leaders, and especially European leaders, must consider.
              European leaders fear that China's rise may cause a chain reaction that
              in turn could bring about the rise of other Asian countries,
              constituting a larger threat to them.</p>
              <p>Even in Asia itself,
              controversies and disputes already exist between China and India, China
              and Japan, and China and other southeastern Asian countries. They fear
              that if these controversies explode, a state of instability may ensue.
              Europeans do not have these concerns.</p>
              <p>For example, the French do not
              worry about a possible invasion of Paris by China's military forces,
              but about the intensification of conflict between China and Japan. In
              other words, they are afraid of conflicts occurring within Asia. Once
              such conflict occurs, European countries will be involved in a state of
              instability. This is an objective worry. They worry about how India and
              Japan will react in the future.<br><br>China's rising military strength
              is the cause for significant concern for US citizens. For US citizens,
              the development of China's military strength is the biggest and most
              immediate threat, since it will directly affect the hegemonic status of
              the US. This concern is different from that faced by Europeans, who
              have never held the hegemonic position. Therefore, US citizens worry
              more about China's military rise to power than Europeans. <br><br>From
              a subjective standpoint, western people consider China's rise to power
              to be an international issue. In fact, China's current rise to power is
              simply regional. If we insist on the view that China is undergoing a
              global rise, we should consider the fact that the west has always been
              the international front-runner over the past 400 years, with leading
              positions in respect to politics, culture and military.</p>
              <p>During these
              400 years, the west has dominated the world's concept of right and
              wrong. With China's current rise to power, since China is neither a
              Christian country nor a country that has the same system as the west,
              if China wants to say “I am not happy,” western countries will have no
              way to deal with the situation.</p>
              <p>However, Chinese people are seeking a
              political influence, something which has never been achieved by Japan.
              Japan is merely a power in terms of the economy, and has not yet met
              its goal to be a political power. Over the past 400 years, western
              people have not been used to the ascent of a non-western country that
              has some impact on the world. It will be very hard for western people
              to accept it psychologically.</p>
              <p><span><strong>How do China build a better image?</strong><br><br>Q:
              From the perspective of the government's behavior as well as from a
              technical angle, what should China do to build a better image?<br><br>Vairon:
              Firstly, China's rise and rapid development makes foreigners extremely
              fearful of nationalism. There also lies a historical reason. China was
              controlled by foreign countries in one aspect or another for nearly a
              century. Therefore, common foreigners are now afraid that the Chinese
              people will resort to retaliation because China has become stronger.
              Overly strong nationalism should be avoided.<br><br>Secondly, as
              Chinese enterprises that expand overseas have not had much experience
              in surviving in the international market, they should gradually learn
              how to work with their foreign partners and how to rapidly develop
              abroad. To a great extent, their behaviors and actions represent the
              image of China. </span></p>
              <p><span>Many businesses invest in Africa and make great
              contributions to Africa and Latin America. But there are also some
              Chinese companies that have caused negative influence on China due to
              their inappropriate acts overseas. Chinese enterprises should know the
              relations between their behaviors and China's image, as well as what
              they should and should not do. These kinds of relations are the most
              useful as Chinese companies' behaviors have a major impact on China's
              image. Chinese enterprises are an important carrier to present the
              image of China.<br><br>Thirdly, the Chinese government needs to adapt
              to the different forms of exchanges with the outside world. From an
              interaction standpoint, we might adopt different ways of exchanges
              between Chinese and Japanese people than those with Americans and
              Europeans. This is because interactions are greatly dependent on
              culture and ways of thinking. For example, the idea of a “harmonious
              society” is purely a concept of Chinese tradition and Confucianism. The
              idea of “harmony” is extremely important for Chinese people and human
              beings.</span></p>
              <p><span> However, foreigners do not understand “harmony” as a
              “harmonious society” and it has no origins and bearing with their
              cultures. As a result, we need to locate a bridge in between and
              explain this Chinese concept to foreigners. Translation alone is not
              enough because the idea embodies many layers of cultural meanings.<br><br><strong>On China-France ties</strong><br><br>Q:
              The friendship between China and France has enjoyed a time-honored
              history, but it has gone off course since the Sarkozy administration
              took office. Since then, what conflicts of interest do you foresee
              between the French and the Chinese?<br><br>Vairon: Firstly, the nature
              of democracy in the Parliament of France should be understood clearly.
              We elect the French president every five years via voting by all
              citizens. The candidates in the running for French president are
              constantly changing, but the voting citizens never change, therefore,
              the two groups should be viewed separately.</span></p>
              <p><span> The government and the
              president will always have their political intentions, however, it is
              certain that the French citizens will not change their views suddenly
              just because of a particular government or a particular president. </span></p>
              <p><span>For
              example, when President Jacques Chirac and President Francois
              Mitterrand were in office, the French and the Chinese people got along
              very well, and certainly, they still maintain a good relationship
              today. Political issue is nothing but political issue and it has no
              connection with the relationship among people between the two nations.
              As far as I am concerned, I never worry that the friendship between
              China and France would change. I am not worried about this because the
              friendship between the French and the Chinese people is deep and
              profound.<br><br>Secondly, I would like to go back to the history we
              talked about before. Since 1964 till now, we have maintained quite a
              good relationship. Maybe in 1840 we did not get along very well with
              each other. Certainly, relationships can often change. However, the
              citizens would never change and only the political world may have
              certain issues. It is certain that the feelings of the citizens may be
              influenced by media at times, but only a small part of them. The basis
              of the friendship between China and France is vigorous and
              long-lasting. <br></span></p>

              <p>This is an outdated argument. Perharps in the 80s or 90s but in recent years I don't see this argument valid anymore.</p>
              <p>If you observe:</p>
              <p>The world continue to pour investment into China. Acknowledge that China is the manufacturing of the world.</p>
              <p>2008 olympics saw nation leaders attending this global events given the respect it has to the host.</p>
              <p>Countries around the world are accepting Chinese mirgant. Basically they are in all 4 corners of the world.</p>
              <p>It has extensive influence over the UN.</p>
              <p>So why China is still perceived not So welcome......Well bad international policy and bad domestics business practices.</p>
              <p>Action comes with Reaction.</p>
              <p>China continue to practice self interest first.... globally. Its influence on Sudan, Zimbawi, and Myanmar does not go down well with Christian Voters of most elected nations. Elected leaders have to balance the act between national interest and reflect upon its value.</p>
              <p>Its does not have political resolution for Tibets, Taiwan. continue to keep its pet DPRK.  </p>
              <p>In Trades it domestics population are caught up being get "Rich Quick" they start to copy and priacy of Western product.   </p>
              <p>internet commercial espionage and political spying to harnest technology.</p>
              <p>All these events does not convince the "People of the World" eventhough China is wealthy but question remain how do they behaved internationally.</p>

              <p>Though immigrants are still coming, but the bulk of the americans are 3rd or 4th or 5th generations local born. Their ancestors came over 200 years ago from Europe. They are not immigrants anymore!</p>
              <p>Over 200 years of American history, with vast land and resources, spared from any destruction of wars, the American society has grown and matured, with their own culture and way of life.</p>
              <p>Their way of life is exported all over the world, hollywood movies, hamburger, Disneyland....and their values were sometimes imposed on weaker countries.</p>
              <p>come to think of it, Singaporeans who are only first generation local born here are already considering themselves "TRUE BLUE" Singaporeans, when facing the influx of immigrants encouraged by the government. Do we have our Singaporeans Way of Life, in 40 years of history as an independent country?</p>
              <p>Surely We Do!! why is there no American Way of Life?</p>

              <p>There is no blaming of the west in any of the posts so far. You are blaming the Chinese for being "parasitic" and "WE did to OURSELVES". and very sad to hear that your (and yours alone) "backward CULTURE is sometimes our (your) OWN downfall" and that you "are indeed a lesser human than them".</p>
              <p>Surely you don't speak for any Chinese who "proud of our own achievement", or any Chinese at all.</p>
              <p>and of course you have another forumite here who blame China for "bad international policy and bad domestics business practices." Is that a threat to the West?</p>

              <p>This is an outdated argument. Perharps in the 80s or 90s but in recent years I don't see this argument valid anymore.</p>
              <p>If you observe:</p>
              <p>The world continue to pour investment into China. Acknowledge that China is the manufacturing of the world.</p>
              <p>2008 olympics saw nation leaders attending this global events given the respect it has to the host.</p>
              <p>Countries around the world are accepting Chinese mirgant. Basically they are in all 4 corners of the world.</p>
              <p>It has extensive influence over the UN.</p>
              <p>So why China is still perceived not So welcome......Well bad international policy and bad domestics business practices.</p>
              <p>Action comes with Reaction.</p>
              <p>China continue to practice self interest first.... globally. Its influence on Sudan, Zimbawi, and Myanmar does not go down well with Christian Voters of most elected nations. Elected leaders have to balance the act between national interest and reflect upon its value.</p>
              <p>Its does not have political resolution for Tibets, Taiwan. continue to keep its pet DPRK.  </p>
              <p>In Trades it domestics population are caught up being get "Rich Quick" they start to copy and priacy of Western product.   </p>
              <p>internet commercial espionage and political spying to harnest technology.</p>
              <p>All these events does not convince the "People of the World" eventhough China is wealthy but question remain how do they behaved internationally.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>there is one statement that is right here "Elected leaders have to balance the act between national interest and reflect upon its value." Yes, China's national interest does not coincide with that of the west, and Chinese culture differs from western culture, in many many ways. </p>
              <p>The small nations, new nations, poor nations had only two choices in the past, the West, headed by the American, and the Commie, headed by the USSR. Even China, had depended on the US and the Russia to kick the Jap out of China. Many cities of China in the north has great russian influence, Heilongjian was even built by the russian. The US crushed the USSR, they thought they had the world, now China is a challenge, a threat, NO?</p>
              <p>Don't blame the arrest of Aung San Su Kyi on the influence of Chinese, Asean need to reconsider their engagement with Burma; India, no influence on Burma, or Myanmar? just to name a few.</p>
              <p>The political problem between China with Tibet, Taiwan began with the British and the Japanese, who occupied these Chinese territories and declared them independent! If China were not strong enough, the countries that occupied many parts of China during the late Qing Dynasty would have had the north eastern provinces, Tianjin, Shanghai all declared independent nations, then today China would have more political resolution to make. The Chinese must be glad that the west had only wanted the colonies, where they could exploit the great resources!</p>
              <p>Looking at the way the Brits handed independence to the Indian subcontinent, which is now broken down into India, Blangadesh, Pakistan, and they are permenantly at war, speaking only english to communicate....again, if Chinese were considered a threat, they are proud of it.</p>
              <p>It is not to "question how do they behaved internationally", it is what you want to do with the existence of a prosperous and wealthy China. Call it a threat?  "Action comes with Reaction."</p>

              <p>There is no blaming of the west in any of the posts so far. You
                  are blaming the Chinese for being "parasitic" and "WE did to

              <p>Surely you don't speak for any Chinese who "proud of our own

              <p>and of course you have another forumite here who blame China for
