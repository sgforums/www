              <p>Though immigrants are still coming, but the bulk of the americans are 3rd or 4th or 5th generations local born. Their ancestors came over 200 years ago from Europe. They are not immigrants anymore!</p>
              <p>Over 200 years of American history, with vast land and resources, spared from any destruction of wars, the American society has grown and matured, with their own culture and way of life.</p>

              <p>come to think of it, Singaporeans who are only first generation local born here are already considering themselves "TRUE BLUE" Singaporeans, when facing the influx of immigrants encouraged by the government.

              <p>First of all, nobody point a gun on every individual head to eat hamburger or watch western movies.  If you walk into a Sushi place does it means that you are a disgrace to Singaporean who have been executed by Japanese during WWII?</p>
              <p>So even if the "West Imposed the Weak" if there are no business demand the shop will closed. So it is more of appealing rather than imposed.</p>
              <p>Immigrants are still walking into the US. In recent decades more n more are from Asia and Hispanic or Eastern European. The mixed of different demographics are changing the aspect of US behavior. Similarly to SG, if you inject too much of one group it will affect and dominate behavior. Its the same in the US. The only different is that it takes longer because of its size.</p>
              <p>Your True Blue Singaporean is only "Temporary" not a static. Those that you maintain as static overtime you call it way of Life. But that is only when artificially imposed such as SAF experience.   </p>

              <p><span style="color: #800000;">My post is a compressed overview of the Western conquest in the last 2 centuries  and how the raise of Asia had made them nervous. In fact, this is exactly what Lionel Vairon had highlighted in his book and in his internviews. (see http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-05/12/content_11358295.htm).</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #800000;">Interestingly, another famous French also voiced similar (warning) about China's raise 200 years ago:</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #800000;">Napoleon once wrote"  "<em>Let her sleep, for when she wakes, she will shake the world.</em>". He couldn't be anymore right on this prediction.</span></p>

              <p>there is one statement that is right here "Elected leaders have to balance the act between national interest and reflect upon its value." Yes, China's national interest does not coincide with that of the west, and Chinese culture differs from western culture, in many many ways. </p>
              <p>The small nations, new nations, poor nations had only two choices in the past, the West, headed by the American, and the Commie, headed by the USSR. Even China, had depended on the US and the Russia to kick the Jap out of China. Many cities of China in the north has great russian influence, Heilongjian was even built by the russian. The US crushed the USSR, they thought they had the world, now China is a challenge, a threat, NO?</p>
              <p>Don't blame the arrest of Aung San Su Kyi on the influence of Chinese, Asean need to reconsider their engagement with Burma; India, no influence on Burma, or Myanmar? just to name a few.</p>
              <p>The political problem between China with Tibet, Taiwan began with the British and the Japanese, who occupied these Chinese territories and declared them independent! If China were not strong enough, the countries that occupied many parts of China during the late Qing Dynasty would have had the north eastern provinces, Tianjin, Shanghai all declared independent nations, then today China would have more political resolution to make. The Chinese must be glad that the west had only wanted the colonies, where they could exploit the great resources!</p>
              <p>Looking at the way the Brits handed independence to the Indian subcontinent, which is now broken down into India, Blangadesh, Pakistan, and they are permenantly at war, speaking only english to communicate....again, if Chinese were considered a threat, they are proud of it.</p>
              <p>It is not to "question how do they behaved internationally", it is what you want to do with the existence of a prosperous and wealthy China. Call it a threat?  "Action comes with Reaction."</p>

              <p>3) Nobody is disputing the cause of Tibet and Taiwan, But its been 50 yrs. if you look  at conflicts across the globe, leaders who are unable to negociate and come to peace tend to fail.</p>
              <p>So Western nation and its people around the World  looking at CURRENT.....</p>
              <p>All the regimes such as Myanmar military junta, Sudan, Zimbawei behave the way they do are because they know that China's abilities to exert its influence in the UN. And they can get away of what they do so long as they trade with China in -- OIL. n  Resources.</p>
              <p>So People around the world is asking what is China doing against the atrocity against the weak when it has the upmost influence in these region!......because it is a communist regime and it is immune and insensitive to the fact that other nations are elected official and are answerable to its citizens.</p>
              <p>Protest against China comes at the Grass root level. It will escalate to the elected official. look at hunger strike by Mia Farrow and Branson. Are they politically motivated? But their action will trigger down to the elected official to response.</p>
              <p>Understand it is people that change politics. Not Govt that change politics.</p>
              <p>That is why i said argument is outdated.</p>

              <p>Frankly, let me mei mei said abit about China.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Firstly, the west should not see China as a threat but rather an opportunity. If they are going to see them as a threat, then they, the west will loose out. And while the west politicians and scholars are argue on the threat from China, their MNC and big corporation are moving there to grab the opportunity. Quite Ironically, the leaders of the west couldn't even hold back their own state corporation moving there, and tons of Chinese funds and bonds are being brought by the western leaders privately. Of course the west can alway close their door or put their influence on the WTO to control China threat, but again, it will contradict the western policy of open economy. Ultimately, in my opinon, these scholars and politicians are just merely talking or writing out of jealousy on China economy progression which in older days, they labelled the chinese, yellow nigger slaves. But today, these yellow niggers (pardon me) are above them, and they start to call it a threat. What threats are there in a open globalise economy. It was always the dream and advocacy of the west during the earlier commie rule for China to open up. And now, when they open up, they said it is a threat. Bullshit.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Secondly, the west should take china openness as an opportunity, china was never a threat to the west, but actually, China is a threat to itself. When i visited Pudong business district in Shanghai, the land is more expensive than Singapore, and peoples there are rich with good spending powers, then i travelled to the Shanghai railway station just across the Bund, and you see the poors arriving from poor provinces in thousands looking for opportunity but was stoppted and controlled by the red guards. Many become beggers asking for foods by the old railway lines. You see a total change of life just across the bund (shanghai river). What I am implying is that there is a very high disparity between the rich and poor in China. It is a social problems. And as some of you said that it is the peoples who change the government, i do agree to a certain extend. Did not the communist came to power from the uprise of the poors?? It just take a person like Mao or Chou or Deng leadership to get the millions of poor together, and China may go into a civil war again. That is the threat i believe China is having. They are not a threat to anybody but themselves.</p>

              <p>Jojo - sounds like your jambans r in the land of the midnight sun - so shall we sing "North to Alaska" together - u sing inside the jamban (as u blow dry yourself) for my listening pleasure &amp; I'll sing outside to chase away any ghost of peeping tom around <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/wink.png" alt="wink.png">.</p>
              <p>As things r today there is no serious flashpoints with compelling developments leading to an attack on China.</p>
              <p>Who would want or dare to attack China when the Chinese r now almost completely self reliant technologically, economically &amp; militaristically (nukes positive so more, not hiv positive, ha ha) - unlike the early years when China was dependent on the former Soviet Union for economic &amp; military assistance.</p>
              <p>The Chinese are said to value 'face' (pride) very much &amp; I am sure they dont want knights in shining armour to assist in any conflict.</p>
