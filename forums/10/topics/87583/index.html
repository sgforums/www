I looking at it, no way it going to lose in Singapore.

Said my piece in othe thread liao.<br><br>Window inspecttion - Neutral. Undecided. Need more Stats. Can see the logic of worry about falling Window. But also can see that commoner need to worry about raising cost.<br><br>ERP/COE - Agree with principal for these ideas. But susipicious about execution. Cited reason for COE is control Car population which is good. Don't want to have car but cannot move. But always have the feeling they control too much and want to make $$ out of it. Using ERP to control traffic instead of COE very good. But ERP implement for a few year liao. Why COE quota still so low? I say time to execute what they say, jack up the ERP price and increase the COE quota to bring down COE price. Also, when people tell them that they should go open bidding, they keep saying no use one... then kenna a few times $1/$50 result before they try it out. Makes one susipicious of them again. Good thing about this government though is they usually admit their mistake later when the facts are overwhelming. So, respect them for this.<br><br>Increase conservative charges - Neutral. Undecided. Again, no stats to say whether it is justified or not. Don't like the vague reply from them. I want to see the figures!!! Where is the increase?? Why can't publish details?<br><br>So, a mix of agrees/disagrees and neutrals.</div>
