            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><span style="color: red;"><strong>Ready for road tolls? </strong></span></span><br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="color: indigo;">Jul 03, 2006<br>The Straits Times </span></span></strong><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="color: darkblue;">IT is a matter of time before Singapore runs out of land for required new roads to cope with the population increase, or available land suitable for roads is deemed better used for other purposes. In either case, road planners have two alternatives for solutions to tomorrow's vehicular demands: go underground or higher above ground. The latter option, in the form of multilevel viaducts made famous by clover-leaf junctions seen in high-density cities, requires pre-planning to take into account load and soil conditions and the locations of traffic dispersal nodes. Stacking one or two more tiers as an afterthought when road space is found to be inadequate is apparently not recommended. But going straight for a multi-tier system way ahead of projected demand risks the project turning into an expensive indulgence. Underground then? Cost will decide.<br>The new Transport Minister, Mr Raymond Lim, hinted at a conference of construction engineers last week that underground road infrastructure was an option the Government may have to consider. It is necessary to bear in mind his motivator was not the question of land availability, which he did not discuss, but the financing of subterranean roads. As this is much costlier than building surface roads, he mentioned private financing, as practised in some countries, as a model. These are turnkey or 'bundled' projects whereby a private concern designs, builds and operates roads. Users pay toll to use the roads. Politically, these projects are often troublesome because of the toll factor. Whether Mr Lim was priming motorists here for the probability of toll roads in the near future is moot. More relevant is the question of need: How many more years before road capacity is saturated?<br><br>To judge from the absence of serious congestion, road space will be adequate for some time. Motorists are already heavily taxed through the loading charges on car ownership (various taxes, COE) and electronic road pricing. The ERP method of sorting out road users has been accepted but paying toll, which can be expected to be higher, is something else. Conceptually, subterranean toll roads can be built as optional routes for motorists who will pay willingly for faster travel. But it will need a stout-of-heart financier to take a gamble with turnkey projects when surface-road traffic 'jams' here are nothing like the two-hour standstills common in Bangkok and Kuala Lumpur. </span></span><br><br><a href="http://www.asiaone.com/st/st_20060703_28655.html" rel="nofollow">Asia1.com</a><br><br></div>

Reverse the double charge on  land and infrastruture costs previously already paid by taxpayers before the corporatisation there will be no need to suffer any losses even if oil prices rise up to US$80 per barrel.<br><br>It is creative accounting like what Mr. Mah has done to HDB's over-charging of HDB flat prices that causes the hikes in public transport costs. Now the lower income earners are spending close to 50% of income on transportation. Is it moral for a minister to over-charge people on basic cost of living and essentials.<br><br>If Mr. Raymond Lim has the calibre he should do it like Minister Khaw in reversing excessive charges done by Minister Yeo Cheow Tong. All the double charge on lands (acquired under Land Acquisition Act at dirt cheap costs and the excessive salaries paid to management of public transport companies, he would no doubt be able to lower the transport costs.</div>
