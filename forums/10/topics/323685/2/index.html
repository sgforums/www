              <p>July 10 (Bloomberg) -- Australia added three times as many <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/apps/quote?ticker=AULFEMPC%3AIND"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">jobs</span></span></a> as economists forecast in June as mining companies, led by BHP Billiton Ltd. and Rio Tinto Group, expanded to meet Chinese demand for commodities.</p>
              <p>Employers hired 29,800 workers following May's 25,600 decline that ended a record 18 months of job gains, the statistics bureau said in Sydney today. The <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/apps/quote?ticker=AULFUNEM%3AIND"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">jobless rate</span></span></a> fell to 4.2 percent from 4.3 percent.</p>
              <p>The local currency rose on optimism the nation will weather a global slump that has sent New Zealand and the U.K. to the brink of recession. Record exports are underpinning Australia's economy as consumers cut spending in the face of the highest interest rates in 12 years and rising fuel prices.</p>
              <p>``This is a clear sign the economy still has life in it, buoyed by a resources boom,'' said <a href="http://search.bloomberg.com/search?q=Sally+Auld&amp;site=wnews&amp;client=wnews&amp;proxystylesheet=wnews&amp;output=xml_no_dtd&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;filter=p&amp;getfields=wnnis&amp;sort=date:D:S:d1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Sally Auld</span></span></a>, co-head of economics at Australia &amp; New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. in Sydney. ``<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">If it wasn't for mining, Australia's economy could be in as bad shape as New Zealand and the U.K.'' </span></strong></p>
              <p>The Australian dollar climbed to 96.92 U.S. cents at 1:07 p.m. in Sydney from 95.55 cents before the report was released. The two-year government bond yield fell to 6.65 percent from 6.69 percent yesterday.</p>
              <p>The median <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/apps/quote?ticker=AULFEMPC%3AIND"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">estimate</span></span></a> of 25 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News was for a 10,000 jobs increase in June.</p>
              <p>The number of full-time positions increased 24,000 and part-time jobs rose 5,800. About half of the nation's 21 million people are employed.</p>
              <p>IMF Report</p>
              <p>The International Monetary Fund said today the strength of the mining industry will add to pressure on consumer prices. The fund said the central bank should be prepared to raise interest rates ``quickly'' if domestic demand doesn't slow enough.</p>
              <p>The Reserve Bank of Australia raised its <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/apps/quote?ticker=RBACTR%3AIND"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">benchmark rate</span></span></a> to 7.25 percent in March, the fourth increase since August 2007. Eighteen of 25 economists surveyed on June 30 said the bank will keep borrowing costs unchanged this year as economic growth cools and helps damp the fastest inflation since 1991.</p>
              <p>``Today's firm employment report underlines it's premature to be talking about interest-rate cuts, but it doesn't build the case for another increase,'' said <a href="http://search.bloomberg.com/search?q=Matthew+Johnson&amp;site=wnews&amp;client=wnews&amp;proxystylesheet=wnews&amp;output=xml_no_dtd&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;filter=p&amp;getfields=wnnis&amp;sort=date:D:S:d1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Matthew Johnson</span></span></a>, senior economist at ICAP Australia Ltd. in Sydney. ``The economy is slowing, so I suspect we'll see soft employment numbers over coming months.''</p>
              <p>Reports yesterday showed <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/apps/quote?ticker=WMCCCON%25%3AIND"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">consumer confidence</span></span></a> slumped in July to the lowest level since 1992 and home-loan approvals fell by the most in eight years in May. Those figures sent the Australian dollar to the lowest level in almost three weeks.</p>
              <p>Rate Expectations</p>
              <p>Traders have assigned 24 percent odds on the Reserve Bank raising its benchmark rate by a quarter point in the next 12 months, according to a Credit Suisse Group index based on trading in interest-rate swaps. The probabilities were 28 percent yesterday and 72 percent a week ago.</p>
              <p>Prior to the May jobs decline, employers had added extra <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/apps/quote?ticker=AULFEMPC%3AIND"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">workers</span></span></a> every month from October 2006, the longest run of gains since the government began publishing monthly figures in 1978. The nation's <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/apps/quote?ticker=AULFUNEM%3AIND"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">jobless rate</span></span></a> fell to 4 percent in February, the lowest in more than three decades.</p>
              <p>Australia, the world's largest shipper of coal, iron ore and wool, may earn 12 percent more this financial year from commodity exports than forecast three months earlier because of higher prices, the government said on June 23.</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.sgforums.com/apps/quote?ticker=BHP%3AAU"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">BHP Billiton</span></span></a>, the world's largest mining company, approved a $1.9 billion expansion in May of its Worsley alumina project in Western Australia. Rio Tinto plans to boost output by 26 percent at its Queensland Alumina Ltd. refinery.</p>
              <p>Job Cuts</p>
              <p>Some companies are shedding workers to cut expenses.</p>
              <p>Insurance Australia, an auto and home insurer, announced yesterday it would cut 600 jobs to help lower annual costs by A$130 million. The <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/apps/quote?ticker=IAG%3AAU"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Sydney-based company</span></span></a> also said it will report the first loss in six years and sell businesses in the U.K.</p>
              <p>Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co., the U.S.-based tire maker, said last month it will close a Melbourne factory and fire 600 workers.</p>
              <p>The participation rate, which measures the labor force as a percentage of the population aged over 15, rose to 65.3 percent in June from 65.2 percent in May, today's report showed.</p>

              <p>Either Tharman is evil himself or he is an evil in the human body.   This evil is expecting common folks to cope with the inflation with the salary they are getting now.   Some low wage workers are having difficulty making ends meet and yet this evil encourages the companies not to raise salary to cope with the inflation caused by the evil PAP.  </p>
              <p>I believe there will be more crap to come from the evil called Tharman.    Very sad that Singapore has a devil Minister of Finance.  <span style="color: #ff0000;"> Calling all those in his constituency, please be kind to yourself, do not vote for him - Tharman.</span></p>

              <p>Mr Poh,</p>
              <p>Why you so toopid one ?</p>
              <p>Increase GST is to help the poor minsters people. Also make sure common people has less money to spend on goods..so demand supply should make price go down.</p>
              <p>Increase wage.. means more people can afford goods.. then price will go up...then when price go up... their million lollar can buy less goods, so that means they become poorer.</p>
              <p>Like that you no understand meh ?</p>
              <p>So they are doing a good job.. they trying to make the price of goods in Singapore DEFLATE.. you understand ?</p>
