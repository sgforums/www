              <p>It looks like even Minister for Finance  also learns fast. He said  employers should not  grant  wage increase now as it will cause another round of inflation.</p>
              <p>That means by over-charging the citizens for public housing, transportation, unnecessary home-bound Toa Payoh type of ERP and by increasing civil servants' and ministers' wage every year under the pretext of NWC or preventing corruption such actions will not cause inflation !!! Only workers' wage increases will caue inflation.</p>
              <p>MM Lee also just told an international conference his government does not tell lies and is never corrupt and he will sue any one for accusing government of corruption.</p>
              <p>Is increasing ministers' salary to prevent corruption itself a corruption?</p>
              <p>Apparently by moderating or lowering the current non-stop excessive government taxes and profiteering like the unwarranted public housing tax amounting to some S$100,000 per household and all the doubling and tripling vehicle taxes and do away the unwarranted home-bound ERP charges he could easily check and lower inflation right away and make the economy competitive again.</p>
              <p>Will he?</p>

              <p><br>And how might you do that exclusively against the USD per se?</p>
              <p>Given the fact the SGD is floated against a basket of common currencies (of which the USD is just a subset of the lot), doing so would actually serve more ill than good considering the burgeoning trade deficit this regime would incur in its trade with numerous other less-developed countries that would invariably hinder trade with a stronger SGD.</p>
              <p>With the greatest respect, I'm absolutely amazed you could even make sense of something that is essentially senseless.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>PS : On a sidenote, if you were a private entrepreneur dealing with trades involving SGD and USD, your logic would make sense in terms of hedging inflation and exchange rate risks. How your interpretation of that fascist's statement works at the macro level for an entire economy is beyond me.</p>

              <p class="first">SINGAPORE : Finance Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam has warned that Singapore could face another round of inflation if companies increase wages to help workers cope with the higher cost of living today.
              
              </p>
              <p>He said this will also affect Singapore’s competitiveness and the ability to create jobs.</p>
              <p>Mr Tharman was speaking to some 500 workers at the Singapore Industrial and Services Employees’ Union dinner on Wednesday evening.</p>
              <p>Higher rice and oil prices have led some Singaporeans to call on the government to set the tone by raising wages.</p>
              <p>But Mr Tharman said such short—term measures are not prudent. Instead, he said the government has provided assistance to help Singaporeans deal with the higher cost of living.</p>
              <p>These include S$500 million in GST Credits — to help citizens cope with the increased Goods and Services Tax — and special bonuses for senior citizens.</p>
              <p>Mr Tharman said Singapore also addresses the problem of inflation mainly through its exchange rate policy. Since the beginning of last year, the Singapore dollar has appreciated by 11 per cent against the US dollar.</p>
              <p>However, the minister said there is a limit to how much Singapore can allow its dollar to rise to fight inflation. Mr Tharman said if Singapore dramatically strengthens its dollar to offset the higher prices, it will instead hurt economic growth badly.</p>
              <p>He said oil prices have increased by 50 per cent since the start of this year. And it has gone up by about 100 per cent compared to a year go. Food prices globally are now up to 60 per cent higher than one year ago.</p>
              <p>Mr Tharman cautioned Singaporeans to brace themselves as oil prices may increase further.</p>
              <p>He said, "We expect inflation to be between 5—6 per cent on average this year, with inflation being lower towards the end of the year. We also expect inflation in the second half of the year to be lower because the effects of last July’s GST increase on inflation will wear out.</p>
              <p>"However, the recent sharp increase in global oil prices will add pressure on inflation. So we are monitoring this and the impact on inflation closely, and will decide if inflation forecasts for this year need to be revised."</p>
              <p>Looking at the global situation, Mr Tharman said the weakness in the US economy could extend into next year. But he maintains that Singapore can expect Gross Domestic Product growth to average between four and six per cent this year.</p>
              <p>Mr Tharman said the lasting solution to inflation is to continue with efforts to help workers upgrade their skills and earn better wages.</p>
              <p>He said it is also important to help experienced, mature workers stay employed and help home—makers get back to work. This will not only increase the household income, but help improve Singapore’s tight labour market. — CNA/ms</p>

              <p>am i getting the wrong message or what?</p>
              <p>keep using the pathetic gst credits to offset inflations. and Singapore dollar has appreciated by 11 per cent against the US dollar? its more like US dollar has depreciated la and thats partially why everything in the world is going up.</p>
              <p>then at the end keep saying brace ourselves. very nice taichi. maybe we are taking an airplane thats crashing.

              <p>If wage increases can cause inflation - Minister Tharman must be speaking from the experience in observing that since the last round of increases to the Minister's salaries in 2006 - being adjusted to the million dollar brackets, Singapore has seen a continuous climb in the inflationary indicators.</p>

              <p>If Singapore's labour market is tight, we should raise wages to attract more people, including homemakers, to join the labour force.</p>
              <p>Yet, from the news report again, raising wages is not the solution</p>
