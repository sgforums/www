              <p>giving more wages = increasing your salary in your current job</p>
              <p>earn better wages = increasing your skills to move to better paying job</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Tharman is correct that increasing salary is a short term solution that will lead to more inflation. More salary means it will cost more for business and thus, they will charge more. When they charge more, workers demand more salary and then the vicious cycle spirial out of control, currency depreciates and very soon, it'll be the end of this little red dot.</p>
              <p>The way to control inflation is not by throwing money at it. It is by trying to control interest rate, reduce the cost of doing business and limit the increase in cost of living by enforcing price control on basic necessities; of course, cutting ministerial pay would definitely help but it has more political milege than economical.</p>
              <p>Sadly, our government is doing none of the above.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Tharman is correct that increasing salary is a short term solution that will lead to more inflation. More salary means it will cost more for business and thus, they will charge more. When they charge more, workers demand more salary and then the vicious cycle spirial out of control, currency depreciates and very soon, it'll be the end of this little red dot.</p>
              <p>The way to control inflation is not by throwing money at it. It is by trying to control interest rate, reduce the cost of doing business and limit the increase in cost of living by enforcing price control on basic necessities; of course, cutting ministerial pay would definitely help but it has more political milege than economical.</p>
              <p>Sadly, our government is doing none of the above.</p>

              <p>i dunoe abt how u get ur logic. yeah, it is always good to up ur workers' productivity. but do you know that the more you try to force out more productivity from workers, it is bad for the economy as a whole?</p>
              <p>employers get to operate at lower cost, hiring fewer workers. industries needing fewer workers = retrenchment of existing workers + decreased job opportunities for job seekers + the surviving workers get even more overworked.</p>
              <p>cutting cost today isn't like when the case 10 yrs ago. 10 yrs ago we import foreign labour to fill in crucial gaps in our workforce, mainly the construction and manufacturing sectors. today, those sectors are like 80% foreigners... so how is that helping singaporeans? what is the point of keeping industries in singapore, when they are not hiring any local workers? so you call that securing jobs for singaporeans?</p>
              <p>now, we have influx of foreign workers working in every sectors. name me any sector, and you will find foreign workers in it.</p>
              <p>alot of the foodcourts in shopping centers are now run by foreign workers. e.g. sengkang mall.</p>
              <p>you find foreign salesgirls, fast food cashiers working in fast food chains and departmental stores.</p>
              <p>you find pei du mama in our coffeeshops in the heartlands.</p>
              <p>we now have PRC bus captains.</p>
              <p>at a supermarket, (i shall not mention the branch), i saw PRC butcher and fishmonger working in the supermarket.</p>
              <p>our hospitals are flooded with foreign nurses.</p>
              <p>our local universities are also flooded by foreign students. the proportion of foreign students to locals is alarming.</p>
              <p>our corporate administrators are spammed with foreigners of all rank.</p>
              <p>so far, the only vocation free of foreigners is in the SAF..... but "wad an interesting career prospect".</p>
              <p>IMO, having some foreigners to work in positions which no one wants to do. however, the problem at hand is that we currently have too much foreigners than our economy can actually support. to the extent that there is negative competition, that their presence is driving down wages, driving off ordinary singaporeans who have families to support in singapore.</p>
              <p>for example, 10 yrs ago, as a office administrator or telemarketers, the rates are usually above $10 /hr.</p>
              <p>now, we are seeing it drop to like $5-8 /  hr. singaporeans do still want to seek employment in these jobs. however, in many cases, the wages are too low for them to support their families, thus making them turn down job offers.</p>
              <p>imagine, 1 foreign worker, and 1 local worker, both earn $1000 per month. the foreign worker would have no problem feeding himself, and sending back any surplus back home. he may spend $800 on himself, and send back $200 back home to china, indonesia, india etc. SGD$200 is a substantial sum in these countries, and can support the worker's family.</p>
              <p>however, this is not so in the case of the local workers. assuming that he scrimps and spend $600, $400 is not enough to support his parents, his parents-in-law, his wife and 2 kids. he will be force to look for a better paying job to make ends meet.</p>
              <p>well, ppl can keep looking for better paying jobs. but so far, there is no job which is free from such negative competition, where foreigners are artificially depressing wages. so many more "better-paying-jobs" are there left? how many will be left unharm by the foreigners wage-depressing?</p>
              <p>eventually, you will run out of "better-paying-job".</p>
              <p>one such case is the case of engineering. 10 yrs ago engineers are earning $5k per month. now, due to companies employing foreign engineers, the wage has been depressed to around $2.5k if you are fortunate.  that is like a 50% drop in wage, can it does serious damages to family finances. furthermore, it seems very unlikely that engineering salary will ever go up again, with companies prefering to import cheap foreign engineers, further depressing wages.</p>
              <p>and back to my earlier point. so what is good about a foreign-own factory employing almost 100% foreign workers in singapore? it is as good as having the factory in thailand, since they did nothing to create employment for the locals. afterall, it is the locals who have to pay taxes. not those bangladeshi workers. not those indonesian maids. not any foreigners, whose low salary exempts them from income taxes.</p>
              <p>when are our politicians ever going to see this existing trend of negative competition in the work force? alr, 60% of all jobs last yr went to foreigners.</p>
              <p>so will they only do smth if 60% of all parliamentary seats went over to opposition? or when 60% of our currently overpaid ministers are replaced with cheap foreign ministers?</p>

              <p>The country seems to be governed by all kinds of hypocrisies and half-cooked assumptions of selfish people in charge of us the latest being that ministers' and top-civil servants' 20% wage increases in 2007 did not cause inflation but the long-overdue ordinary workers' wage increases will lead to inflation and this latter should be stopped.</p>
              <p>Let us examine this scenario: Suppose Oil prices which cause the current decade-long worse inflations across the world are to stop or ease due to falling demands brought about by US sub-prime crisis with the economy going into recession, does it mean that the ordinary workers' wage increases being withheld will be forfeited forever while ministers' and top civil servants' 20% salary increases will stay and belong to these favored ones forever.</p>
              <p>Will Tharman give back all the overdue and long-awaited wage increases witheld by the same token because inflation is no longer happening to be given similar treatment to ministers and top civil servants.</p>
              <p>Does he not realise he will be talking nonsense again treating ordinary workers as sacrificial lambs for any problems in the economy to be used to solve inflation and recession problems while he and his top civil servants will always get away with any types of salary increases with the help of GDP or some fictional NWC recommendations which did not filter down to the ordinary workers at all?</p>
              <p>The biggest problem now is to correct all the hypocrisies and wrongful policy assumptions in administering wages and wellbeing of ordinary people for the country.</p>
              <p>Or will he because of easing of inflation in such a scenario restore all the wage increases held back as a result of oil spiked inflations.</p>
