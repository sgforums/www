Plus do you know what sort of revenue the government desire?<br>Comparing a 4D booth to casino is just like comparing a hawker stall to a restaurant. I am wonder if you will have your wedding dinner at hawker center when you get married.<br>SL : if the project is not enticing enough, it may not be sustainable in the long run, thus ruining collection of taxes in the long run. lots lots. and how much bigger is the restaurant as compared to the hawker stall? you're might be the only person in this world wondering.<br>G : Casino is probably the most profitable, sustainable and least risk component of the whole IR project, hence if the government is only keen on collecting gaming tax revenue I donÂ’t see why you even question its sustainability.<br>SL : by your own admission, you support the statement "the whole objective of IRs is for the government to collect gaming taxes." profitable as it may be, which gambling company would undertake the project earning 0.00001% of the profits.<br>G : Stop acting like a child, I have already mentioned above that Singapore is using the Venetian LV business model as a selection criteria for Singapore IR and that majority of the IR revenue will come from non-gaming business. Stop speculating, you donÂ’t seem to even under that fundamental basic of business. Period!!<br><br><strong>3) Singapore economy to will become like Monaco because we have F1 SL : in what ways? </strong><br><br>G : You ask Atobe<br>SL : why ask atobe when it is your claim?<br>G : Atobe Â“Â”With the IR and these Up-Market Developments, the Government had declared that Singapore shall be the next Monaco to be a playground for the Rich and FamousÂ”Â” http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=252941&amp;page=1<br>G : You are proven wrong again!<br><br><strong>4) The reason why genting won the sentosa IR bid is because of PM Badawi </strong><br><br>SL : back up what you're saying<br>G : Ask Atobe (thatÂ’s his claim)<br>SL : i quote you "4) The reason why genting won the sentosa IR bid is because of PM Badawi". it is your statement so back it up if you have the balls. don't hide behind the skirt / trousers of atobe.<br>G : Obviously you are not aware that this a ATOBEÂ’s claim (Go do some reading)<br>SL : i am aware that you have been twisting other people's words. back up your words if you have balls.<br>G : Atobe Â“the reasons that Genting can beat Eigth Wonders for the Sentosa IR, considering the visit made by PM Badawi at a critical moment of the bidding process, which is all too much to be a co-incidenceÂ”<br>http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=252941&amp;page=1<br>And yes, I do have the balls, and they are both functioning very well,.<br>SL : but your balls are misrepresented. they appear much smaller than they normally are.<br>G : You can say all you want, I have already accomplish my objective here and that is to proof you wrong<br><br><strong>5) Rich people attracted to singapore is comparable to Singaporeans going to JB to buy cheap grocery and food. </strong><br><br>SL : rich people coming to singapore to stay will inflate housing prices here. at least singaporeans going to JB to buy groceries won't stay in JB and cause property price jump.<br>G : Yup it is different, but in my opinion, you argument is misguided by your interest that property prices in Singapore should remain flat or inline with your personal income growth.<br>SL : if the argument is right, it is right. the need to keep property prices in check is not a misguided interest but an impt economic variable that any govt smart enough would come to realize<br>G : Could you tell us which smart government in this world is doing what you claim should be done??<br>SL : could you tell us which smart government pays itself millions?<br>G : Plenty, the Prince of Oman, Saudi, Kuwait, Brunei, etc. However thats beside the point, could you please give us an example of a smart government that is doing what your claim should be done.<br>SL : so democratic singapore is comparable to kingdoms like oman, saudi, kuwait and brunei ... so who's our king by the way?  that which doesn't exist could be an ideal awaiting realisation<br>G : Stop acting like a child, read you own question (could you tell us which smart government pays itself millions?). You are not even capable for giving us an example what make you so sure that what you have suggesting is even achievable? (Just another NATO in the making?)<br><br><strong>6) Mcdonald market strategy is to get kids addicted to their burger and fries and they will eat till they die. </strong><br><br>SL : what are you trying to imply?<br>G : Ask Atobe (his claim is that McdonaldÂ’s food are addictive and you will eat till you die)<br>SL : i can't find that in his postings. are you defaming him?<br>G : Really?

I promise.<br>SL : please stop defaming atobe<br>G : you are making yourself look like a mad dog trying to defend your master atobe<br>SL : no, but i could be talking to a cheap bit-ch resorting to animal antics<br>G : Should I proof you wrong again so that you can shut up and move on with your childish life?<br><br><strong><br>7) MICE activities in Singapore will not benefit Singaporeans. </strong><br><br>SL : but won't it benefit the govt a whole lot more than ordinary singaporeans?<br>G : The question is not about weather the government will benefit more or less, it if it will benefit Singaporeans. Since you are at it, can I know why you say that the government will benefit more than the private companies that organize MICE, the participants the seal business deal during the MICE, and the companies and Singaporeans that are supporting the MICE activities?<br>SL : the most impt conclusion for singaporeans to take away is that the govt is the biggest winner in any decision, including the casinos. with or without the casino, the income from MICE and deals are just the same for private companies. hence the new addition - casino, mainly benefits one entity - the govt.<br>G : Like I said again, the question is not about who is the biggest winning, but will MICE activities benefit Singaporeans.<br>SL : your question is not of interest to me. the question that is of interest to me is why in every decision, the greatest benefactor has to be the govt<br>G: It is not you are not interested, it is because you are incapable, and stop arguing like a<br>spoilt child, that is very childish!!<br>SL: the perfect description of yourself.<br>G : I will let your writing above do the talking.<br><br></blockquote></div>

But what is your point of asking about satay? Confused?<br>SL : of the items you listed, MICE, F&amp;B and hotel are the same whether or not we have a casino. so those components don't change whether or not we have a casino. hence, the only item left - gaming is the only reason for the casino.<br>G : They canÂ’t be the same because without a casino license, no companies will be willing to invest more than $5b in this IR project.<br>SL : if a place is attractive in and of itself for MICE activities, then whether or not we build a $5 billion casino won't change that. hence the purpose of the casino cannot be anything other than gambling dollars.<br>G : The amount of investment one is willing to invest in the MICE, Hotels and F&amp;B outlet is very dependent on the risk level of the project and the reason why LV Sand and Genting is willing to take such a risk is because of the casino license. Hence it is wrong to say that with or without the casino license Sheldon Adelson will still go ahead with the investment.<br>SL : this is a total mirepresentation of what i said. if the reason why MICE activities fluorish is singapore's efficiency, safety, cleanliness, well connectedness, then MICE will fluorish regardless of $5 billion casino or not. hence $5 billion casino is meant for gambling profits.<br>G : Are you suggesting that any tom dic.k and harry with money will be able to develop and succeed with such mega MICE project because of Singapore infrastructure? And  Sheldon AdelsonÂ’s connection and experience in MICE business is not the main reason why he was selected to run the Marina IR?<br><br><strong>9) Countries like Malaysia and Shanghai are losing money hosting F1 </strong><br><br>SL : taiwan and hong kong businessmen making money in china doesn't mean we would make money too.<br>G : I donÂ’t see a logic is what you are trying to say. The question should be, are you sure they are losing money? Or is atobe trying to distort information?<br>SL : i understand, you have proven to be most stupid that's your question. my take is this: if we can screw up in china when our competitors, taiwan and hong kong can fluorish there, there's no reason to say that malaysia and shanghai make money means we're sure to make money<br>G : Calling people stupid doesnÂ’t make you smart. And the question here is IS Malaysia and Shanghai losing money hosting F1? And based on your argument, are you suggesting that Singapore should not attempt to do anything unless it has never been done before? Like we should not have SIA because Malaysia already has their own airline? We shouldnÂ’t have universal studio in Singapore because they already have that in Japan and America?<br>SL : it may not, but it at least explains why you cannot see logic. the fact that they are making money doesn't guarantee that we will make money. if i'm not mistaken, official calculations record losses. no. i am saying that if my neighbour becomes rich selling chicken rice doesn't mean i will get rich selling chicken rice. that's all. since i'm not saying what you say i am saying, i cannot be saying this rubbish that you just spewed.<br>ladies and gentlemen, here is as yet another attempt by him to twist and misrepresent my words. a perpetual liar, i cannot trust what he claims is said by others. so unless he quotes the exact words used by others, he is lying and defaming the rest.<br>G : You are very mistaken and I am not even surprise. Honestly I donÂ’t see what exactly are you driving at when you are trying to question the viability of Singapore hosting F1. IMO you are very childish.<br>SL: i am not questioning the viability of F1 in Singapore. I am questioning the naive logic of concluding that someone else's profitable business must certainly be profitable for us.<br><br>G: I think you are making up the above statement without any facts and only childish people like you are capable of doing that.<br><br><strong>10) there were multiple PM Badawi visits to Singapore before and after the Sentosa IR announcement. </strong><br><br>SL : PM Lee made a personal visit to PM Thatsin just before the signing of the Shincorp deal.<br>G : PM Lee visit to Thailand as got nothing to do with PM BadawiÂ’s visit to Singapore. Obviously you are not aware of what we are talking about, because you should ask yourself this question, (Did PM Badawi visited Singapore in 2006?) before jumping into conclusion that he did. (Example of blind leading the blind??)<br>SL : PM Lee's meeting with Thaksin immediately before the Shin Corp deal is a good example of the possibility of state involvement in the Shin Corp fiasco.<br>G : I only need you to comment if the is indeed a PM Badawi visit to Singapore to influence Singapore government to award the Sentosa IR deal to Genting. (nothing to do with our minister visiting the world)<br>SL : i need you to show me the exact statement that suggests this and not some concoction of yours.<br>G : You have already asked this once, donÂ’t have to repeat because you will embarrass atobe twice.<br>SL: if you can't prove atobe said those words, you are slandering him.<br>G : Are you trying to play that childish word for word game with me?<br><br></blockquote></div>

With regard to your 2nd sentence, you will have to ask why Soul_rage say that Singapore IR are example of protectionism.<br><br><strong>2) Open economy is bad for Singapore and its people </strong><br><br>SL : why do you say that?<br>G : Ask Soul_Rage<br>SL : nothing is ever absolutely good or bad. workfare, which the govt recently implemented, is a form of protectionism. would you say workfare is bad? you wouldn't. hence there needs to be a balance, a balance between staying competitive and ensuring that those who cannot keep up, stay afloat.<br>G : Could you offer Singapore an alternative to prosperous like we did in the past 45 years without having an open economy?<br>SL: could you show me where in this argument did i say that singapore should have a closed economy?<br>G : Just tell me if you agree that an Open economy is bad for Singapore and its people? ( I am not interested in your cock and bull stories and childish excuses)<br><br><strong>3) There is a 80/20 rule in income distribution </strong><br><br>SL : could you illustrate?<br>G : Ask Soul_Rage<br>SL : why ask him when you are the one making that statement?<br>G : I didnÂ’t, I am just highlight the BS that he is contributing to this forum.<br>SL : like the "open economy" bull%%$@ "above which you imply i am against when i am not?<br>G : You will have to ask Soul_Rage because he thinks that is such theory for income distribution.<br><br><strong><br>4) If SIA doest threat you well, you should consider leaving the country. </strong><br><br>SL : if you don't treat SIA well, old man will kick you out<br>G : You miss the point<br>SL : no i didn't, i hit the nail on its head. if you don't treat SIA well, old man will kick you out.<br>G : As a consumer, do we need to always fly with SIA? Could you tell us what do you mean by treating SIA well and what you mean that the old man will kick me out?<br>SL : how often do we ordinary singaporeans get to fly with SIA?  just an extension of your statement "If SIA doest threat you well, you should consider leaving the country"<br>G : You are diverting from your earlier statement  that if we donÂ’t treat SIA well, the old men ( I  presume you are referring to LKY) will kick us out. Again it only shows how incapable you are in such discussion.<br><br><strong>5) Local and foreign companies offer the same benefits to Singapore's future and economy</strong><br><br>SL : foreign companies do not have vested interests and many have voted with their feet already that led to widespread retrenchments.<br>G : You have to ask Soul_rage why he said that.<br>SL : not true. when we merely work for MNCs, we do not develop our own brand / technology which in the long run is what differentiates a truly first world nation from one that relies on first world nations<br>G : thatÂ’s what I thought too, but according to Soul_Rage, there is not difference.<br>SL: come on, show me the words "Local and foreign companies offer the same benefits to Singapore's future and economy" is said anywhere else by any other person. stop misquoting and misrepresenting other people.<br>G : Soul_Rage : Â“As again, I told you, in this case, the govt has set up certain protective rules, so it is not exactly an issue anymore on whether the company getting it, is local or overseas, coz they have to promise, for eg, a certain level of investment into our economy.Â” http://politics.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=250502&amp;page=2<br><br>And please, think and read before you bark.<br><br><strong>6) All casino gaming operators can operate world class IR by themselves </strong><br><br>SL : world class IR like world class public transportation that receives so many complains all the time?<br>G : Again you are missing the point, Soul_rage is suggesting that as a gaming operator, by default you will be able to operate and run business such as Universal Studio, Dreamworks, MICE, whale shark aquarium, without the need of having partners.<br>SL : show me the exact words that soul rage used that suggested what you suggested. if you can't, you are putting words into his mouth.<br>G : Soul_Rage Â”In the IR tender, the govt DID give the tender to foreign companies. Why is that so? Its because none of our companies here have the experience of running a casino or such a huge resort, thus its reasonable for the govt to give this to the foreign company experienced in such a projectÂ”<br><br>http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=250502&amp;page=2<br><br>By saying that, he is claiming that Genting won because they are capable for running the whole IR by themselves and the reason why Keppeland and Capitaland lost is because they have never run an IR because despite the fact that they are partnering companies like MGM, Kerzner,<br>SL : read the exchanges. agree wholeheartedly with soul rage. you have misrepresented him. this is a casino project so the casino operator is key. keppeland and capitaland are local partners, not the main contenders. as such, it was a choice between Genting + Universal studios, Kerzner and 8th Wonder, all foreign companies. hence, soul rage is right to say that "govt to give this to the foreign company experienced in such a project" as there is no local gambling company to give to. your interpretation is a grave misrepresentation of soul rage's posting. given that all three gambling bidders are foreigner companies, and that there are no local gambling companies involved, this example does not support your statement "the result of the IR tender is a clear indication that the government will not favour local firms just because they are local"<br>G : Again, you are speaking without any logic and understand behind the whole IR selection process.<br>a)	This is not just a casino project, this is an IR project and majority of the revenue will be coming from non-gaming related business<br>b)	Harrahs and MGM Mirage are world no1 and 2 players in the gaming industry, and you are questioning their ability to execute this project?<br>c)	Keppeland and Capitaland are minority shareholder in the project hence the whole IR project will be lead by the world class casino players not local companies.<br>d)	There are more than 3 foreign companies that bid for the 2 IR projects, please get your facts right.<br><br><strong><br>7) Singapore employer are suckers for more expensive Indian FT </strong><br><br>SL : singapore govt is sucker for indians<br>G : Why? Can you support your claim?<br>SL : i quote you "i) Singapore employer are suckers for more expensive Indian FT". your statement supports my claim.<br>G : Like I said again, whatever you see here, are just BS coming from soul_rage, and thank you very much for questioning them.<br>SL : it is not bull%%$@. i agree with him.<br>G : You will agree with anybody who give you a bone to chew, and obviously you cant support what you said.<br><br></blockquote></div>

So you are in no position to comment this point. In no way did I say we are anti-PAPs also.<br><br>2) This is where you are so wrong. The Govt will NEVER be the PAP. The only reason why we are caught in this stupid situation is that the PAP is running the entire govt (almost), so people tend to say Govt = PAP. For instance, during elections, the PAP CANNOT use HDB upgrading as a carrot because that is taxpayers' money for upgrading. This belongs to the GOVT, NOT the PAP, so the party cannot use the taxpayer's money as their war chest. Every person who pays taxes are entitled to equal rights for upgrading.<br><br>3) Did I accuse? Please watch your words carefully. I am stating an opinion, everyone is entitled to their opinions, and its up to you to see with your heart whether my opinion makes sense or not. People who see with their hearts know where the govt is going towards. You, on the other hand, see only with your eyes.<br><br>The problem with you is that you tend to point fingers at others, when you are doing the EXACT same thing.<br>When you say we are emotional, aren't you emotional yourself?<br>You go about sprouting vulgarities at others, and you tell me you are not emotional? Answer this question on your vulgarities and abuse of other people. Don't avoid this accusation anymore (yes, I AM accusing you coz this is a FACT, YOU ABUSE others).<br><br>you want me to present facts of your abuse? There are many many pages in this forum that proves your guilt (since you like proof so much)<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>back again. but will not post too much.<br><br>to summarize some of the opposition stance, your perception is that<br><br>government power is to centralized among too few leaders and not enough power is given to citizens, middle level leaders, opposition leaders.<br><br>There is insufficient independent structures that check on the top leaders themselves.<br><br>The goverment uses media to its advantage<br><br>The goverment do not admit their mistakes<br><br>some of the opposition examples are countries in europe where the government do not have so much power like singapore and their lives are better and less stressful and their people are happier.<br><br>However, there are also countries where the government does not have too much power and the country is still in mess also.<br><br>Therefore, it does not mean taking some power away from top leaders will mean a more prosperous country.<br><br>US has congress that argues with george bush sometimes, but there are still US people complaining a range of issues everyday and think that life is not good in their countries. Problems are not solved just becaues opposition has more power than in case of singapore.</div>
