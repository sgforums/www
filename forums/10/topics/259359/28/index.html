            <div class='col-md body'>Gazelle's hall of bullshit fame:<br>1. Insists that middle income pay is increasing despite CNA report that middle income wages has stagnated for the past 5 years by economists from the Institute of Policy Studies<br>2. Economists are stupid people. Gazelle is the smartest, and only words from Gazelle are facts, even reports from CNA or economists are rubbish and BS<br>3. Insists that rising property prices = people having a better life, despite asset prices making it more expensive for people to own a property<br>4. The govt is a high performing govt, nevermind the billion dollar losses in Shin Corp, Suzhou, Global Crossing, etc.<br>5. Paying ministers 3 to 4x above the political market is a smart move, despite himself refusing to pay 50 cents more for quality eggs and insisting on $1.50 eggs, which is only an increase of 33% and not 300-400% above the normal price<br>6. Ministers are worth the money coz he is paying more GST (duh!)<br>7. You can own a car and a house with a monthly income of $2000<br>8. All of us are ungrateful brats who give only $400 allowances to our parents<br>9. Any words or terms not heard by Gazelle is not an official term or word in the dictionary. This implies that the following words are not in the dictionary:<br>- Humility<br>- Consideration<br>- Kindness<br>- Graciousness<br>Becoz as far as we can see from here, he doesn't exhibit any of the above, so I can safely assume he thinks such words are not in the dictionary coz he has never heard of them before<br>10. Says 'NO THESE ARE NOT FACTS' even when reports and statistics are placed right before him (myopic)<br>11. Analysts are stupid people. Only Gazelle is the smartest.<br>12. Statistics from anyone are fake. Only statistics provided by Gazelle are accurate and factual (did he ever provide any?)<br>13. Smart, intelligent and elite people ask others to kiss butt, calls others d..k, bullshit, pr..ks. Why? Coz only Gazelle is smart, intelligent, and elite.</div>
