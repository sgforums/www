            <div class='col-md body'>Hey. Heard of the stagnant middle class before? They are a group of people whose income are relatively stagnant. From what I can remember, their income growth rate is less than 1/3 of our GDP growth. OK you can fight that it is not a good comparision to use GDP. I'll show my calculations below.<br><br>For the middle income, let's take is as the median of the population, that is the third quintile.<br><br>In 1998, their combined household income is $3374, in 2003, their income is $3379. I believe that these figures are not in real dollars.<br><br>Hence, if you go by our GDP per capita growth rate from 1998-2003,<br><br>GDP per capita Growth Rate: http://www.singstat.gov.sg/keystats/hist/gdp.html<br><br>1999: -0.73% (all figures to 2 significant figures)<br>2000: 12%<br>2001: -6.7%<br>2002: 2.0%<br>2003: 1.8%<br><br>Overall, from the period of 1998-2003, the growth is 9.5%. Those percentages are calculated from real dollars, so percentages are accurate to 2sf.<br><br>So, if the third quintile received $3374 in 1998, they should receieve $3374 x 109.5%, that is $3695. That's not the end of the story.<br><br>If we factor in inflation, as $3374 is in 1998 dollars, and the $3379 figure is in 2003 dollars, $3695 is $3784. That's a $404 difference for a middle income family for a month! Sadly, that was not to be. They didn't have $400 more to spend each month. If their income growth is following the national GDP per capita growth, they could have $400 more.<br><br>That's just one case, for the third quintile, and that's for the stagnant income.<br><br>If you consider the lowest 20% population, and the next 20%,<br><br>Lowest 20% (in nominal dollars)<br><br>1988: $615<br>1993: $887<br>1998: $933<br>2003: $795<br><br>Next 20%<br><br>1988: $1072<br>1993: $1645<br>1998: $2118<br>2003: $2059<br><br>That's a decrease even in nominal dollars! The difference is even greater if you factor in inflation!<br><br>OK, let's put all these into perspective.<br><br>The highest 20%:<br><br>1988: $5055<br>1993: $8469<br>1998: $11450<br>2003: $12792<br><br>The fourth quintile:<br><br>1988: $2328<br>1993: $3799<br>1998: $5162<br>2003: $5309<br><br>See a steady increase? Perhaps it is not very steady but it is a generally increasing pattern.<br><br>So, 60% of the population is short changed by the economy growth in Singapore. That's assuming that one-person families are considered, and yes, they are, for the 1998, 2003 data.<br><br>Umm. 2 731 805 people... That's an awful lot.<br></div>

A daughter of a taxi driver, she has managed to win scholarships to get an MA from Cambridge and a Masters from Harvard. So she does better and earns more than her father.

How can a plaintiff be involved (directly or indirectly) in the appointments of the judges presiding in the case(s)?<br><br>4. To outlaw peaceful assembly of individuals and freedom of speech. And then create speakers corner. And stop people from going in to listen to a speaker at the speaker's corner and calling a illegal assembly, even after giving a speaker a permit!<br><br>5. The boast the our courts are fair just and transparent, as we can apply to the highest court of appeal, the privy council of the house of lords in England.

Which is way, a opposition strong enough to be a threat to PAP's stranglehold on the constitution is essential. A mistake is a mistake, people make mistakes and are held accountable for them, and held accountable to the people they report to. The government should be no execption.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by january:</div><div class="quote_body">i myself deal with my personal life makes hundreds of mistakes and decision everyday with knowing whether i have make a mistakes or not . or find that make wrong mistake or find that i think i make a wrong mistake but actually i am thinking too negatviely liao or i thinking that i make a mistake but it turn out to be a blessing in disguise.<br><br>my one small life is already so complex already and what is about managing a country with people having various interests.</div></blockquote>Yep, running a country is not an easy task, that doesn't give any government the right to ignore the people (eg. with a farce of debates) and be unaccountable for mistakes. If they take the people a little more seriously, maybe many mistakes and their fallout can be mitigated.<br>Doesn't give any government the right to restrict the rights of the individual. You are talking about a government leader that said "We decide what is right. Never mind what the people think"</div>

That brings down the inflation rate too.<br><br>If the skills of our workers lag behind those of cheaper economies, their salaries will drop. At the moment, our workers are still paid much higher salaries than their counterparts in China/India but our productivity is not rising fast enough to justify the salary differential. In contrast, the skills of our top earners, the professionals and high level managers are in demand because their salaries, though high, are not as high as their competitors in the MNCs and foreign firms. Therefore the salaries of our top earners will only rise. If a local investment banker does better than one in London but draws half the pay, he can expect his salary to rise even further even though he already earns 100k a month.<br><br>Globalisation benefits those with the highest productivity and who are cost-competitive. The government has to move the economy to embrace higher value services and make our population upgrade their skills to man the wafer fabs and pharmaceutical laboratories. If we haven't got the right people, we will have to rely on FT.<br><br></div>
