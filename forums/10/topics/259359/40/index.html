People who are resigned to receiving only crumbs from the govt, and say there is nothing much else they can do (The self-admitted loser)<br><br>2. People with elitist attitude that insists the govt is doing very well, and that the rest of the population should shut up and resign themselves to fate (selfish elites)<br><br>3. People who whine a lot but yet don't dare to do anything when the time comes (ie elections)<br><br>4. People who protest and think of ways to get themselves out of the mess.<br><br>From what I can see in this forum, most of the voices of protest are people whom geuninely know what they are talking about, and thus should belong to type 4.<br><br>I know I belong to Type 4.

Its to see so many Singaporeans being capable, and yet not able to see that they are worth much more than what this govt claims they are worth.<br><br>Make no mistake. Singaporeans' being generally lowly paid bodes WELL for the elitist govt, becoz being a developed economy, and with our govt pressing our pay abnormally lower than many of the other developed economies, it makes Singapore an attractive destination of investment for many many companies.<br><br>Unfortunately, these investments don't flow down to the people, but instead goes direct into their own pockets. (unless you take their miserable hundreds that they give you for the GST as part of the flow)<br><br>I find it really hypocritical that the Govt pays themselves so well, and then the people are paid so much lower than they deserve.<br><br>Our country is HEAPLOADS RICH, with billions and billions of reserves (Such that the Shin Corp fiasco is small change), but yet, the people are finding it tougher and tougher to make ends meet.<br><br>To the elitist here in this forum, pls don't pretend you know the plight of the general population, when your wife is driving an Audi, and you pretend you know everything we discuss about here (including your stupid insistence that Govt = PAP)</div>

They are overconfident, and soft from their comfortable monopoly of funds &amp; resources in Singapore.

Like the 'emperor's new clothes'.  Our government is in constant denial, and each time their built-on-clouds plans fail, no one is held accountable!  When one can turn real-life failures into successes on paper and still pat themselves on the back for it, that... is real foolish pride.</div>

Just listen and read the way LHL talks, it is not difficult to "detect" arrogance in him.  He is just simply an empty shell!! He really has attitude problems.  The recent response from him regarding Myanmar, really tells what sort of person he is!!  Gahmen just discredit us, the people of Singapore!</div>

I also get alot of "why did you vote them in?" comments..  When I tell overseas friends why alot of people didn't get to vote, they're stunned.  Don't even get me started on the pay comparisons, that's when the jaws really start hanging.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  So yeah, alot of foreigners have the impression that Singaporeans are "rich" and "very well taken care of" until someone tells them otherwise.</div>
