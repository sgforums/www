I never knew <strong> until today from you that the carrot actually includes essential facilities </strong>.<br><br>Well if You want to talk Australian and American:<br>Politicians in Australia and America have opposition parties . If they ignore one community - they get a backlash through the election- so they give promises out. If they do not fulfil their promises , the community has a long memory and will vote them out in favor of the opposition. So the onus is on them to promise everything to every single electorate and carry out what they said to do - and that does not threaten the electorate.<br><br>To tell an electorate that you are not giving them the lifts they need for their elderly people and disabled because they did not vote for your party is akin to threatening their daily lives with inconvenience. <strong>There is a HUGE difference between promising something (promising carrot) and threatening something (threatening carrot). From what you had implied , it seems only Singapore uses the threatening carrot while the rest push the promising carrot. </strong><br></div>

And I wonder why they are puzzled that they can't seem to win Hougang or Potong Pasir over every elections. Asking people to pay for their own carrots is basically a slap in the face, both to those in those areas and those outside of it.<br><br>At the end of the day, all Singaporeans are actually chipping in to pay for these "carrots". We have no choice about it and what they are saying to us is that if we don't bite, then well, too bad then.<br><br>We are duty bound by law to be taxed for your own carrot? Is there not something seriously wrong about that?<br></div></blockquote>The only reason why they are puzzled, is that all the ministers etc. do not understand that money isn't everything. No one really gives a frak about upgrading if it is going to hurt their wallet. It seems that they still haven't gotten this point yet especially after the rejection of a few upgrading projects.<br><br>It then boils down to this: All of them are of the same elitist mound who quantify things in monetary terms rather that of the heart. They are so detached from the ground that they seem to fail to see what it really takes to govern. Thus far, all people see is that they are just milking us dry and dangling carrots.<br><br>There is a difference between Gazelle's alleging that the West do the same. As far as I have seen, none of them have dared to withhold tax payer's money to threaten people to vote for them. Is the money the GOvt's or the taxpayers'? Gazelle is simply too stupid a bigot to understand all this because he is simply a c-o-c-ksucker striving to be at the top, but he will surely be disappointed, because he would never be at the top. A fool.</div>

Start first with lowering Costs of Living, because this is the reason some unfortunate many have given up the Cause for Living.<br><br>Oppositions as many can see, are NOT incompetent. They have been and are still constantly being suppressed by clever Rules and Policies deviced by the prevailing Ruler.<br><br>We can see now that the gov is looking to Foreigners for support as they realize they are constantly losing support from the locals progressively, and that many locals have migrated.<br><br>I know they will not in a sense be seen as 'submisive' by bending their rules to accomodate the people's requests and or demands, so they are in turn, showing us, the people, we are not indispensable by opening up the floodgates to foreigners in an attempt to make people buck up and compete. But this move has and is failing in many aspects, which I'm sure many of you knows and agrees...<br><br>However, our all knowledgeable gov still ignores all signs of the times, and continues with more of their antics, until such time when it will be like another Casino turn-about, and the Stop at Two turn-about.<br><br>They should call themselves IRU - Idiosyncrasies Are Us.
