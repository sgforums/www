            <div class='col-md body'>That's part of the problem, Atobe.  People can't tell the difference between COST of living, and QUALITY of living.  The media's very fond of confusing the two for some reason.  After a while, people are convinced they're one and the same.<br><br>This spills over to other facets of life, too.  Thing is, many Singaporeans lack critical thinking skills.  Many of us have been conditioned to simply accept what the authorities say as fact.  Even those who aren't fooled are weary of talking to a brick wall, with the echoes of their own voices the only reply.  If big brother says it's true, it must be true.  But is it?<br><br>And if we *do* question Big Brother and list out facts along with reasoning and questions, can we truly be said to be "defaming" Big Brother?  Do we not have the right to question what Big Brother is doing..?<br><br>How many of us actually examine the evidence and reasoning offered, and reflect upon it?  Few.  And how many actually act upon discovering a flaw in the reasoning offered?  Even fewer.  While everyone wants to express their "opinion", especially the young ones, they seldom have enough reasoning power to bring it to the next level - to have an <strong><span style="font-style: italic;">educated</span></strong> opinion.  And even those who want to act have to worry about their families - expressing a different opinion has a high cost in Singapore.  One does not have to look farther than Hougang or Potong Pasir for evidence of this.<br><br>Despite the call for increased creativity to be..... "taught"... our education system 'mysteriously' still remains anti-creative.  Why is this so?  Think out of the box?  What about those who obliberate the bloody box?  Can Big Brother accept such people, or will they be made out to be "troublemakers"?  I think right now, we all know the answer to that.  all except sheltered or stubborn people like january - he/she is simply a newly manufactured product of this system that has yet to open his/her eyes.<br><br>All in time.</div>

A Median or mean income figure does not reveal such information. Decided not to use other sources so as to prevent the credibility of the source from being questioned.
