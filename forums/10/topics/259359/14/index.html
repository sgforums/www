(did the gahmen take into account that an average worker looking for a job would probably have a family to feed?) If they can tell the people to take a lesser job or a lesser pay, y the increase in their own salary in the first place?<br><br>commoner's problem : living expenses rising..salary still same or lower<br>gahmens reply      : we need to stay competitive, spend less (how to when Gst is increased, ECP increase god knows what else more to follow..)<br><br>commoner's problem : y the rise in GST?<br>gahmens reply          : to help the poor, we need to save the reserves for the bad times..<br>(so when are the good times actually? during pre election? when progress package is given out? and isn;t it actually from the tax payers money that this progress package are being given out?<br><br>just to name a few.. not to mention the raise of age for retirement..and cpf withdrawals...</div>

If PAP is to lose the election and another political party (eg WP) is to get the majority. then WP is the ruling party and PAP is the opposition. WP will then form the new government until the next election.<br><br>Please do not "confuse" and that it is either PAP or "opposition".<br><br>Also, the "scenario" that you are painted are much too extreme.
