The income of the bottom 30 percent of the population has fallen. What is more worrying is the fact that the majority of Singaporeans in the middle class has only seen about a one percent increase in their nominal income in the last 5 years.<br><br>This is not not just a Singapore problem say economists who point out that stagnant wages is a global problem.<br><br>The chief reason for this is globalisation, especially with India and China introducing a large pool of skilled and unskilled labour to compete with the labour forces of industrialised countries.<br><br>Singapore is susceptible to this because of its open economy.<br><br>Manpower Ministry data shows that 124,000 jobs were created last year and 45 percent of these jobs went to foreigners.<br><br>"With the rate of immigration, even among unskilled and semi skilled labour at a rate twice of what we experienced in the 90s, at a rate fastest in the developed world, the question is - does this dampen our real wages as we grow? Does the strategy itself dampen real wages and depress real wages at the low and middle end of the spectrums? They are sacred cows but we should step back and think about them," said Yeoh Lam Keong, Vice President, Economic Society of Singapore.<br><br>Another reason cited for middle class wage stagnation is the move by the government to cut CPF employer contribution rates for older workers by 4 percentage points over the last 2 years.<br><br>"So if you were a worker in the 50-55 age group, you could have seen your wages fall as much as 10 percent over the last 3 or 4 years. Now with the economy improving, the government could bring that back, the increase is 1 or 2 percent. I'm in support of CPF tinkering but probably it happens far too often, but I think there's probably some justification to look back and think that the restructuring was a bit too aggressive on the CPF side and it has contributed somewhat to a very sandwiched middle class," said Chua Hak Bin, Director, Asia Pacific Econ &amp; Market Analysis, Citigroup Global Markets Singapore.<br><br>The government is looking at increasing CPF by 1 to 2 percentage points in 2007.<br><br>Economists say workfare should become a more permanent pillar of the economy so as to cushion growing inequality.<br><br>- CNA /dt [/b]</blockquote>pls read this Gazelle, you are really a sad case.

            <div class='col-md body'>In response to PM Lee's call to the citizens to speak up, and build an inclusive and cosmopolitan society, it is perhaps a burning question on the mind of many citizens - how has he performed since his taking office as PM in 2004.<br><br>PM Lee Hsien Loong has welcomed people in fact to engage in robust debates on government policies and even invited them to join the party.<br><br>So, I for one has some time ago emailed to youngpap secretary offering to volunteer my service in taking part in its internal policy debates. I was referred from one agency to another without any result.<br><br>As advised, I went to see the MP of my constituency first presumably to subject myself to some scrutiny so that I could be allowed to take a part in such debate.<br><br>I did give my view that as I was only interested in the debates of its policies I should not be subjected such party rules but there was no further reply.<br><br>Lately the government instead of welcoming people to take an active part in debating its policies has announced that it will send anonymous counter-insurgency agents to counter cyber criticisms in internet forums.<br><br>So what does PM Lee actually mean when he announced he would be more open, and build an inclusive and cosmopolitan society.<br><br>Does he really intend to let or encourage people to take a more active part in running of the country and change the past policies to be more open or cosmopolitan or engaging critics in robust debates of policies.<br><br>Of particular great concern is the fact that within one year after the 2006 election, PM Lee has quickly increased the GST by 2% to 7% on the representation that the increase was to enable him to introduce workfare but as it turned out it was actually a prelude to increasing the ministers' own hyper salaries by another million per annum.<br><br>All the above-mentioned actions of PM Lee since he took office do not quite convince people that he will change the past government policies of taxing and recovering the fullest costs of providing services which lead to people suffering high costs of living.<br><br>There is also no change from the past practices of governing the country without accountability e.g. refusing to cooperate with the ex-president in reporting land sale profits and other extraordinary gains made by government in public housing etc.<br><br>There is no efforts made to ensure that the government will not carelessly spend away people's surpluses on extravagant 7 wonders or on foreign investments which benefit the foreigners with heavy losses by the billions.<br><br>There is no change yet to the hypocrisy in justifying mistakes and shortcomings with massaging of statistics like employment figures or GDP to avoid answering to persistent failures in restructuring the economy to value-adding model talked about for years.<br><br>There is no change to the profiteering by the HDB in sale of public low-cost housing at market prices when such housings were built on lands already paid for and owned by the people.<br><br>There has been a lot of monies on helping foreigners in education and securing them jobs at the expense of unemployed citizens.<br><br>Profits made on land sales and investments should have been plowed back to lower costs of essential services.<br><br>The billions spent on biomedical researches are not making any significant returns in job creations.<br><br>If the lower income earners are getting poorer with dropping wages, how could he justify swopping of corporate taxes with GST which hurt the lower income even more.<br><br>The lower income earners are paying more than 50% of their income on basic needs like transportations and utilities as a result of PM Lee's untimely swopping of income tax by the GST.<br><br>Will his MPs and Ministers speak the truths in parliament on the above-mentioned problems and issues affecting most citizens or will they be hip-hopping or putting up wayang kulit to detract people's attention to real problems or be submissive in order to safeguard their own careers ?<br><br>The above-stated questions will be asked again and again and hopefully PM Lee will confront such serious concerns in governing the country.</div>
