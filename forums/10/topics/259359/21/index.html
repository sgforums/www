Which means that we may be doing similarly well, if not better, with or without this present ruling party.<br><br>This, of course, is hypothetical. As stated, they did not do too badly. Secret societies (of the serious sort, not the bully-boy gangs these days) largely eradicated, racism kept under reasonable control, corruption not too rampant, streets largely safe etc.<br><br>But can they do better? An unequivocal yes. More accountability? Definitely. More openess? Please.</div></blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">If all Chinese dominated societies in East Asia are doing similarly well, surely it is telling something - that it is the <span style="font-style: italic;">'driven energy'</span> of an ethnic group that naturally seeks out success for itself ?<br><br>This fact alone simply say to us that the Chinese ethnic group is a <span style="font-style: italic;">'serious ethnic group'</span> with a keen sense of survival instinct, and an acute ability to carve a niche for itself in any society and circumstance.<br><br>The success of the Chinese Communities throughout Asia is based on its own ingenuity and initiative; and most have not even received the kind of purposeful <span style="font-style: italic;">'State sponsored interference'</span>  that is a hallmark of the Singapore Government, which had dared to claim credit when things work fine in Singapore, but will disclaim all liabilities when things go bad.<br><br>To say that this Government has not done too badly, is to say that it is already very bad, but things could have been much worst; or that things are bad, and could have been much better.<br><br>Bad is already bad, and depending on which sector of the various subject groups concerned, the degree of badness or worseness is mere semantics.<br><br>Bad can only be bad or worst, it can never be <span style="font-style: italic;">not too bad'</span>.<br><br>To be successful, one has certainly to be serious and is there a need for complete secrecy ?<br><br>China used to be the center of discovery - having developed the first compass and the use of gun powder, yet the Chinese community had atrophied in almost every field of science and discovery since its golden age a few centuries ago.<br><br>This is largely due to the selfish protection of knowledge for its own self-interests and self-preservation, in which the Chinese ethnic groups will resist the spread of its experience and knowledge to others even from within it own.<br><br>How often have we heard of the Master keeping one last master stroke, while transferring the knowledge to his most faithful disciple ?<br><br>It is only in an environment of open questioning and earnest debate of alternative and competing ideas that the best will surface.<br><br>Why are there such a high number of Asian students heading to the West to advance their educational process in the various Western Centres of famed Tertiary Education in Science and Management ?<br><br>Even the Chinese Government in Beijing has slowly turned around to toy with a new idea of openess and accountability, so as to combat corruption.<br><br>Money was not even a topic to be considered a tool to prevent corruption in Government - not that the Chinese Treasury cannot afford it when they have a National Reserve that is twice larger than ours.<br><br>Can Human Intellect make any advancement in a closed environment, in an<br>environment of monopolistic dominance in all opinions and views ?<br><br>Yes, it is good that you see the need for accountability and openess.<br><br>Unfortunately, between saying accountability and openess is necessary, it has been the policy of this Government to acknowledge such a need so as to pacify the outcry.

            <div class='col-md body'>PM Lee has already said a few times his government will engage critics in robust arguments to debunk untruths said about the government.<br><br>Such a dare to debunk critics implies that he or his government is infallible or the existing policies or actions were always right and critics were obtrusive whiners only interested only to discredit his government which in essence is yet another assumption.<br><br>So following the announcement that minister Lui Tuck Yew was placed in charge of sending cyberspace counter-insurgency agents to debunk untruths in the net, what has happened since.<br><br>To the best of forumers' knowledge long before this news to debunk cyberspace postings, many cyberspace counter-insurgency agents were already sent to counter posting by forumers e.g. Salman and Oxford Mushroom and many others have regularly been posting stereo-typed propagandas trying to paint a bad picture of democracy and freedoms in countries which actually for historical reasons were unable to govern themselves irrespective of political systems but blames were always be put on democracy which in perspective has thrived and led to prosperity in many more countries.<br><br>Salman has had to beat his or her quick retreat after being debunked by our forumers for his or her shallow and superficial hypocrisy. Has Salman really succeeded in convincing us of the righteousness of existing policies like meritocracy or pro-foreigner employment or investment incentives which put off and downgrade our own talents and prospect.<br><br>Another favorite propaganda stereotype is to repeat how great is the policy of meritocracy which at first sight seems reasonable but on close scrutiny has been misused for a long time as a convenient tool for political control of the population by putting up people of their own choice or kind for high offices to enjoy high pays thereby stifling our political evolution.<br><br>Under such a narrow-minded and auto-piloted meritocracy the elites are doing well riding high on assumptions about their ability and talents but the rest of the populations are left to struggle with losses of economic competitiveness, perpetual rising costs of living and competitions from influx of all manner of foreigners only to safeguard their own meaningless GDP and MOM's doubtful employment statistics.<br><br>Quite clearly instead of governing the country to bring about the maximum benefits to the greatest number our ministers are withdrawing themselves into their own comfort zone refusing to change to serve the people better by persisting in operating on all sorts of unquestioned auto-piloted assumptions as civil servant Ngiam Tong Dow has pointed out many times.</div>

The first, a Southeast Asian was given the transfusion but died a few hours later. The second, a South Asian was also given a transfusion but died a few days later. The third, an East Asian, was given a transfusion and survived. That is the X factor in development."</strong><br><br>Lee Kuan Yew at the University of Singapore 27 December 1967, as reported by Chandra Muzaffar in his letter to the author. 14 August, 1996.<br><br>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Understanding any aspect of Lee Kuan Yew's career requires a syncretic approach. but fully understanding his racial views stretches holistic analysis to new limits. Lee's views on race have been a matter of much private, but little published comment. This now changes with the publication of his authorised biography, Lee Kuan Yew: The Man and His Ideas, (7) in which Lee speaks about race with unprecedented candour. Upon close inspection, Lee's racial beliefs prove not to be an aberration or idiosyncrasy in his thinking, but the consummation of his world view and his political thought.<br><br>Until the late 1990s, Lee rarely allowed his public record to be sullied by any explicit statement that could be construed as racist, though on occasions he has come close to doing so. He has, for instance, argued that there are links between economic performance and race.<br><br>In 1993, Lee wrote an article for The Economist in which he speculated on the state of the world in the twenty-first century, with special emphasis on Asia. (8 ) Lee put his own views into the mouth of a fictional Chinese Singaporean, Wang Chang, who then discussed his views with his friend, Ali Alkaff.<br><br>Lee painted a picture of a prosperous twenty-first century East Asian industrial belt consisting of Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and coastal China, while South and South East Asia (except for Singapore) languished by comparison. Singapore, although geographically part Of South East Asia, was economically on a par with the more prosperous East Asian region. (9) In the subsequent "discussion" of these predictions, "Wang Chang" made it clear that race was a factor in his assessment, since he based his forecasting "on a people's culture, heredity and organisational strengths." (10)<br><br>A few years earlier, Lee used his 1989 National Day Rally address to defend the Government's programme of encouraging Chinese immigration from Hong Kong on the basis that the birth rate of Singapore's Chinese is lower than that of the Indians and Malays.<br><br>The numerical preponderance of the Chinese must be maintained, said Lee, "or there will be a shift in the economy, both the economic performance and the political backdrop which makes that economic performance possible." (11)<br><br>Lee enumerated several reasons why maintaining the Chinese proportion of the population at current levels was necessary for economic prosperity - including the "culture" and "nature" of the Chinese.<br><br>Without a hint of irony, Lee also took the opportunity to assure Malays that they need not fear Hong Kong immigrants taking their jobs because the immigrants will all be high income earners.<br><br>In 1977 Lee treated Parliament to a four hour post-election victory speech which could best be described as "uninhibited."<br><br>In this speech, Lee told the multi-racial chamber, "I understand the Englishman. He knows deep in his heart that he is superior to the Welshman and the Scotsman.... Deep here, I am a Chinaman." (12)<br><br>In recent times, Lee has not only been more forthright about his racial views but he has also confirmed that he held them at least as early as the beginning of the 1970s.<br><br>In October 1989, in an interview with Malaysia's New Straits Times Lee revealed that after he read Mahathir Mohamad's The Malay, Dilemma (13) in 1971 in 1971 or 1972, he found himself "in agreement with three-quarters of his analysis of the problem" of the economic and educational under-performance of the Malays. (14) According to Lee and Mahathir, the problem was both cultural and genetic. (15) Lee noted with approval that Mahathir's views were the "result of his medical training, and... he was not likely to change them."<br><br>While Lee has been moderately circumspect in most of his public statements on race, there have been rare occasions on which he has shown less discretion than usual. The earliest such documented occasion was on 27 December 1967, when Lee addressed a meeting at the University of Singapore. (17) After his speech there was a question and answer session, in which a question was asked about "the most important factor, the X-factor, in development." (18 ) Two members of the audience have given the author independent and almost identical accounts of Lee's answer. According to Chandra Muzaffar, Lee responded in these terms:<br><br>"Three women were brought to the Singapore General Hospital, each in the same condition and each needing a blood transfusion. The first, a Southeast Asian was given the transfusion but died a few hours later. The second, a South Asian was also given a transfusion but died a few days later.

(19)<br><br>Each listener took the Southeast Asian to be a Malay or perhaps a member of one of the aboriginal races of the region. Each of them took the South Asian woman to be an Indian, and the East Asian who survived was Chinese, or perhaps Japanese or Korean.<br><br>Lee revealed in this speech, as reported by Chandra Muzaffar a perception of a racial hierarchy of Asians, in which the Chinese and other East Asians are at the top, Malays and other Southeast Asians are at the bottom, and Indians and other South Asians are in between.<br><br>On this occasion Lee made no attempt to disguise his views on race with discussion of related factors, such as culture. <strong>He was talking about the inherent, genetic, strength and weakness of the different races</strong>.<br><br></blockquote></span><br><br><span style="color: darkred;"><strong>continue below</strong></span><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br><span style="color: darkred;"><strong>continuation</strong></span><br><br><span style="color: darkgreen;"><blockquote><br><br>The emphasis that Lee has placed on culture and race in economic development has varied over the years. Only 27 months after Lee argued that race is the "X-factor" in development, Lee credited "ethnic factors" with being one of the variables in economic development, though on this occasion he contradicted his December 1967 statement by arguing that these "ethnic factors" were a minor consideration compared to "cultural factors." (22)<br><br><strong>Regardless of the balance between the two factors in Lee's thinking, there is no room to doubt that both race and culture play related if different roles in Lee's political thought</strong>.<br><br>While Lee believed in his heart that the Chinese were genetically and culturally superior, he separated this belief from his public policy. Only in the late 1970s did his racial beliefs begin to exert a noticeable influence upon public policy.<br><br>The discrepancy between the picture of the Chinese, racial and cultural supremacist which we are able to paint from a collage of' Lee's words is barely reconcilable with Lee's public record up to the late 1970s and with the accounts given by his close associates of forty and fifty years.<br><br>It is obvious that the thesis that Lee was restrained from acting on his beliefs by external forces is insufficient. As is the case with most aspects of Lee's career, the story is much more complicated, and requires a detailed study of the gradual development of his political thought.<br><br>This article has described in detail the character of Lee Kuan Yew's racial views substantially using his own words as evidence. <strong>After a lifetime of being circumspect on the question of race, Lee has finally spoken openly, revealing himself as doctrinaire racist</strong>.<br><br>Yet it would be a mistake to condemn Lee as a hard line racist in every sense of the word. Such a characterisation of his views would be a distortion of both his logic and his natural disposition.<br><br>There can be no doubt that Lee is a racist in the sense that he believes that some races and some ethnically-based cultures are inherently superior to others. His own words leave no doubt about this assertion, though it should be recognised that this in itself hardly makes him remarkable in Asia.<br><br>He is also a racist in the sense that he has integrated his racial views into his political agenda and he has created a regime which accentuates racial categorisation. This assertion, too, is beyond dispute, yet it should be acknowledged that affirmative action programmes in the United States and Australia are based upon racial classifications and are widely accepted as part of modem liberal orthodoxy.<br><br>Of equal significance to our study of his political thought are the aspects of political and personal racism that Lee has avoided by his eclectic approach.<br><br>Lee's idiosyncratic rationalisation of his racial views, for instance, has undermined the tendency to dismiss any race as being irredeemably inferior, or unchangeably superior. He has not conceived of any race as being supreme, even though some are more intelligent and hardier than others.<br><br>Unlike Social Darwinian racists, he does not base his views on the assumption that any race is a lower or higher evolutionary form of humanity. He sees no unbridgeable divide between races. Although his environmental determinism, Lamarckian view of evolution and cultural eugenicism may explain the higher intelligence and better glands of those who hail from a "hard" society, they also create a firm line of continuity between the different races, and give each race the capacity to change for the better or the worse: hence Lee's efforts to "improve" racial communities by "tinkering" with their cultures. (89)<br><br>The result has been that despite instances of overt racial discrimination by Lee's government, and more common occasions of discrimination in Singaporean society, Lee has created a society which has a relatively low level of racial tension, despite having a high level of racial consciousness.<br><br><strong>Considering his own racial views and the nature of the society he inherited, this is a remarkable achievement which, despite its shortcomings, should be acknowledged</strong>.<br><br>Our understanding of the nature of Lee's views on cultural and racial evolution now enables us to perceive a new depth in Lee's public policies and in the development of his political thought.<br><br>More significantly, it gives us a fresh insight into the deep fears which have driven Lee throughout his public life, and especially since his sinicisation in the late 1970s <strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Lee has married pessimism, progressivism and geneticism to produce a vision of a horrible world where every step on the road to progress creates new problems which will drag civilisation down to the depths again - unless the elite takes charge and applies itself creatively and scientifically to overcoming these challenges.</span></strong> (90)<br><br><strong>Such an attitude is, of course, the height of hubris, but this does not concern Lee.</strong><br><br>By the late 1970s Lee was very comfortable with hubris. He had been almost single-handedly transforming and re-transforming the physical, political, linguistic and cultural landscape of Singapore for nearly two decades.<br><br>He had been making and breaking careers and industries, politicians and ideologies, and setting patterns of work, procreation and education for about two million people. He had assumed more control of his countrymen's lives than the Pope claims over the lives of Catholics.<br><br>Furthermore, by the early 1980s ill health and old age amongst his colleagues meant that he could now foresee the day when he would be the last of the "old guard" left in Cabinet a paramount leader without rivals, rather than a primus inter pares. Lee himself spoke of the difference this set of retirements has made to Cabinet. <strong>The old guard leaders were never compliant and were forthright in their opposition to many of Lee's policies</strong>. (91)<br><br><strong>After their retirement, however, he did not "waste time taking opinions all around" the Cabinet, but simply told his colleagues what he wanted and it was up to them to disagree.</strong> (92)<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">One does not have to be a Western liberal to see that this near-omnipotence and unrivalled pre-eminence is not healthy for either the nation or the leader</span></strong>.<br><br>Lee's new freedom, combined with his perception that cultural and dysgenic disaster were imminent seem to have been at the heart of Lee's quixotic approach to politics in the 1980s.<br><br><strong>His eugenics policies and the sinicization programme converged as the complementary answers to the challenge of the West, degenerating genes and the search for talent</strong>.<br></blockquote></span><br><br><span style="color: darkred;">Here is the link if there remains a wish to read the <a href="http://jaundicedlenses.blogspot.com/2005/05/lky-on-race.html" rel="nofollow">Referenced Article - ''Lee Kuan Yew: Race, Culture and Genes''</a> in full.<br></span><br><br></div>
