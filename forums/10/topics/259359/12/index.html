Not everyone can climb the ladder and make it good. Take a toilet cleaner for example. Is the reason why she's just a cleaner because she does not work hard enough? Is a mechanic still a mechanic after 20 years because he has poor work ethics? Given the huge supply of poly and uni grads year after year, is a diploma holder still earning less than $2000/mth after years of working, a bum? Likewise, a degree holder earning les than $3000/mth after years of working, a sloth?<br><br><strong><span style="color: blue;">He replied:</span></strong> if you think minister pay is good, why do you be a engineer, a cleaner or employee.<br><br><strong><span style="color: red;">I also mentioned:</span></strong> These people do not ask for a crutch from the govt. Not everyone can make it good, that is why we need good governance to make life as smooth as possible.<br><br><strong><span style="color: blue;">He deflected my qn: </span></strong>Making every one good life is often not easy. anyway, if people dun always have the "keeping up with jonness" attitude and want this want that, of course they will not have money.<br><br><strong><span style="color: red;">I challenged again:</span></strong> Every society has a hierachy to fill and not everyone can make it good. If everyone can become as they desire, then there shall only be MDs and GMs around, no coffesshop assistants or even cleaners to speak of.<br><br><strong><span style="color: blue;">He played "hide and seek" once again: </span></strong>so if you are a coffee shop assistant and you complain of your low wage, then dun be coffee shop assistant.<br><br>Yes, philosophy, socio-economics and politics can be inter-related. However, too much of philosophy ushered in makes one appear like he's spewing empty air.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">For example, January philosophised:</span> "I take self accountability to get rich and dun like to waste my time complaining policies. It always seems that it is human nature to think that government is doing the wrong thing again instead of also taking account of government progress."<br><br>Theoretically speaking, that should be the correct mentality. However, every society has a hierachy to fill (refer to my 2nd paragraph). <strong>Given this situation, if one still tries to use philosophy to further his stand, then it shows he doesn't understand the situation at all.</strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I should now bring into discussion the topic of the infamous T.T Durai.<br><br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Kidney_Foundation_Singapore_scandal" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Kidney_Foundation_Singapore_scandal</a><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">In August 1997 and December 1998, NKF volunteer Archie Ong and aero-modelling instructor Piragasam Singaravelu respectively were hauled to court separately for defamation when both said that T.T. Durai had been flying first class.<br><br>The former mentioned in April 1997 that the NKF "squandered monies" in a casual conversation with former chairman of NKF's finance committee Alwyn Lim, while the latter has claimed that he had personally seen Mr Durai in Singapore Airlines' first-class cabin. Both paid an undisclosed amount of damages to the NKF, and apologised.<br><br>...<br><br>In 1999, NKF tracked down and again took legal action against Tan Kiat Noi, who allegedly circulated an e-mail from her company e-mail on 5 April, claiming that "the NKF did not help the poor and needy, paid its staff unrealistically high bonuses" and discouraged members of the public from donating. She later published a public apology on local broadsheets The Straits Times and Lianhe Zaobao, and paid a total of S$50,000 in damages. 48 additional workers who forwarded the same e-mail were also sued by the organisation, but the suit was later dropped in consideration that they would face possible financial hardships.</span><br><br>They were successfully sued for defamation, but it was unfair for them due to the lack of transparency regarding NKF. The onus it seems, was on the accused to prove that they are innocent, INSTEAD of the prosecution to prove that the accused is guilty of libel.<br><br>The same can be said of most libel cases involving certain bodies in Singapore.</div>
