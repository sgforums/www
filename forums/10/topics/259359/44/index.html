I question your credibility now.<br><br>Migration can mean taking up permanent residency or citizenship in a country.<br><br>I wonder if you know the difference between those two.<br><br>Permanent residency means you are not a citizen of that country but you get some benefits ( about 60% - 80 %of the citizens in Australia) and you cannot vote.<br><br>Citizenship means you are a citizen of that country.<br><br>Migration can go in the above two ways but it always has to go thru permanent residency first.<br><br>You can't just jump into a country and expect to be its citizen in a month you land there - no country in the first world status allow that at all - NONE AT ALL.<br><br>Permanent residency acts as a trial period -  it is up to you whether you want to renew it, get citizenship or go back to your own country - you can even extend it if you prove to the country you migrated that you have been contributing in someway. You can even acquire citizenship after a said period of permanent residency .<br><br>So some Singaporeans may migrate as permanent residents and stay permanent residents in a foreign country BUT THEY STAY SINGAPOREAN,  while some may choose to take up citizenship there and surrender the Singaporean citizenship .

How come Australia allow overseas voting by Australians overseas without restrictions while Singapore doesn't unless they work for the government overseas ( which has no time limitation) or had stayed in Singapore for 3 full calender years out of the 5 years? That means that because a Singaporean doesn't stay for 3 full calender years since they left in 2000, they are not allowed to vote in let's say an hypothetical election year of 2005.<br><br>I think that is absolutely BS.</div>
