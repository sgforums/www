Now, even considering that you are single, you could be struggling to make ends meet. It's slightly above what the lower-income earn, and that often cut them off help.Â” </span><br><br>Gazelle - <span style="font-style: italic;">Â“10 years ago, most Singaporeans dont own mobile phone, dont have broadband, dont watch cable TV, dont own Ipod or mp3 player, dont drink coffee at starbucks etc. Is the middle earner struggling to make ends meet or are they struggling because of their new lifestyle?Â”</span><br><br>The 2 most expensive items in Singapore are housing and car. In 1997, price of HDB flat were at its peak (even in todayÂ’s standard) and car prices were about 30% higher than what we have today. Hence if you can survive with $2000 per month 10 years ago as middle class, I find it hard to believe that you could suddenly be struggling to Â“make ends meetÂ”, I repeat, MAKE ENDS MEET<br><br><span style="color: blue;">$2,000 and own a car? How many do that? Back it up. 10 years ago, at least 20-30% downpayment of the car's price was needed before you could own a car. Moreover, like you said, prices were high.<br><br>And buying HDBs of $300,000 - $900,000 in 1997 with just a pay of $2,000? HDB policies limit the purchase of flats to the income one earns. Go read up hdb.gov.sg for more details before you embarass yourself any further.<br><br>Do not generalise like what you have done - mistaking the mean income of Singaporeans as if <span style="text-decoration: underline;">all</span>  have benefited. You made this mistake and you still haven't learned, as evident above.<br><br>Your replies also do not prove ndmxiaomayi wrong. Just what have you explained above that serves your stand??</span><br><br>b) If ndmmxiaomayi could claim that Singaporeans salary has not increase for the past 10 years, dont you think that it will be his or her responsibility to support his/her argument with facts. Or else, anybody could also claim that Singaporeans salary has quadruple over the past 10 years isnt it?<br><br><span style="color: blue;">If you refuse to look at the stats given in this threads by other forumites, I cannot help you either. There is often little aid for those who have 2 eyes but choose to be blind.</span><br><br>c) If kilua have reasons to believe that the median income of Singaporeans have remained flat for the past 10 years I am sure he/she must have done enough research before making such comment, or else I would classify this as what I call baseless speculation, that deserve no replies.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Uh huh....your point is?</span><br><br>d) jonst78 -http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Singapore#Growth_in_household_income_by_decile<br><br>This is a piece of article has been recycled by whiners in this forums for donkey times. And for someone to actually use this to support his argument in this context only shows that his lack the understanding that this article, as it it just a snap shot comparing our country's economic situation from it peak in the mid 90s, to its low in year in 2000. Have you asked yourself<br><br>i)	When did the internet bubble burst<br>ii)	When did the terrorist hit WTC in NY?<br>iii)	When was the SARS outbreak?<br>iv)	When did Singapore experience the worst recession?<br><br><span style="color: blue;">To clarify, this piece of statistic is not meant to show Singapore's economic situation. Its main purpose is to illustrate average income per household by decile from the lowest 10% to the top 10%. Did you not understand that?<br><br>You were harping on the mean income of Singaporeans, insisting that income has increased as a whole. So, to prove that your argument based on this is irrelevant, this statistic of average income per household by decile was shown to you.<br><br>It may have surfaced repeatedly in this forum but that doesn't diminish its credibility.<br><br>As for your 4 questions above, I query your ability to analyse and link relevant matters together. It does not explain the widening income gap due to economic factors as all the above have affected many Singaporeans, regardless of income level. Moreover, refer to the timeline of events you have provided. They are post 2000, save for point iv).</span><br><br>e) I have already highlighted to you that the statistic of Singapore median income is easily available from our government website, and I would like to remind you that your job as a Â“secretaryÂ” is to read those article and compile a summary report so that we could save time in this discussion. (Your ACTION will be appreciated)<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Negative. It's missing from the MOM website, available only in singstat.gov.sg. Since this is a statistic of our workforce, shouldn't it be the other way round?</span><br><br>(I am sure this is a valid request, however if you incapable for doing it, I would appreciate that you speak less in this thread)<br><br></div></blockquote></div>

Do you know that in order for you to own a HDB flat, you have to be married or living with your parents or other siblings etc. As such doesnÂ’t it make sense that you are usually a part owner of the flat?

It does not explain the widening income gap due to economic factors as all the above have affected many Singaporeans, regardless of income level.

The income of the bottom 30 percent of the population has fallen. What is more worrying is the fact that the majority of Singaporeans in the middle class has only seen about a one percent increase in their nominal income in the last 5 years.<br><br>This is not not just a Singapore problem say economists who point out that stagnant wages is a global problem.<br><br>The chief reason for this is globalisation, especially with India and China introducing a large pool of skilled and unskilled labour to compete with the labour forces of industrialised countries.<br><br>Singapore is susceptible to this because of its open economy.<br><br>Manpower Ministry data shows that 124,000 jobs were created last year and 45 percent of these jobs went to foreigners.<br><br>"With the rate of immigration, even among unskilled and semi skilled labour at a rate twice of what we experienced in the 90s, at a rate fastest in the developed world, the question is - does this dampen our real wages as we grow? Does the strategy itself dampen real wages and depress real wages at the low and middle end of the spectrums? They are sacred cows but we should step back and think about them," said Yeoh Lam Keong, Vice President, Economic Society of Singapore.<br><br>Another reason cited for middle class wage stagnation is the move by the government to cut CPF employer contribution rates for older workers by 4 percentage points over the last 2 years.<br><br>"So if you were a worker in the 50-55 age group, you could have seen your wages fall as much as 10 percent over the last 3 or 4 years. Now with the economy improving, the government could bring that back, the increase is 1 or 2 percent. I'm in support of CPF tinkering but probably it happens far too often, but I think there's probably some justification to look back and think that the restructuring was a bit too aggressive on the CPF side and it has contributed somewhat to a very sandwiched middle class," said Chua Hak Bin, Director, Asia Pacific Econ &amp; Market Analysis, Citigroup Global Markets Singapore.<br><br>The government is looking at increasing CPF by 1 to 2 percentage points in 2007.<br><br>Economists say workfare should become a more permanent pillar of the economy so as to cushion growing inequality.<br><br>- CNA /dt </strong><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br></blockquote>Gazelle, I am giving you this posting <strong>AGAIN (x2)</strong>.
