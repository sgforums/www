If he were jobless and marginalised by the system, he would be talking against the system and not for it. He left the forum around 12noon and came back 2pm, shows that he can't be at home, because the timing is too regimental. To have 2 hours lunch time is very generous, that's why I think he is quite high ranking.<br><br>So only 3 possibilities:<br><br>1) misusing company's resources<br>2) paid to do this<br>3) nothing better to do<br><br>The 3 possibilities apply only when he is sane, else a fourth would materialise, 4) he is mad.<br><br></div>
