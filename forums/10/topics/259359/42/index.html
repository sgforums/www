            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkred;">Is it not odd that despite all the spanners that this Ruling Party has jammed into the system, this country continue to tick ?<br><br>With all the myriad of taxes - in all the various shades and dubious acronyms - that burden the Citizens, we find a way around it and continue to make the country tick, even as the burden gets more weightier.<br><br>What does this speak of Singaporeans ?<br><br>We adapt to the circumstances, no matter how difficult the government has made the situation from bad to worst.<br><br>Singaporeans coped not with the help of this Government, but through our individual effort and support of immediate families, friends and neighbors.<br><br>Since the 1960s till this present day, the Ruling Party that formed the government from 1957 (self-rule) to this date in 2007, has there been any event that makes Singaporean life any easier ?<br><br>I remembered the remarks of my friend's grandparents about life in the 1950s and 1960s under the leadership of LKY, they were not complimentary. The largely Chinese business community were unkind with their remarks to an overseas English educated Chinese with no knowledge of a single Chinese word in Mandarin or in dialect. Then came my father's generation - that included my friends' fathers and the uncles - no one had anything good to say.<br><br>Now it is our generation, has there been anything great to speak about over the last twenty years ?<br><br>In the early 1960s, when LKY insisted on pushing Singapore into Malaysia, he ignored all the protests from the other politicians and various sectors of the local business community familiar with Malayan politicians. LKY and his colleagues swept aside all the apprehensions over the unequal terms of entry into Malaysia, and it resulted in two long years of political friction between the Singapore and Federal Government; exposing Singaporeans to - never before heard - fierce racial politics from the Federal political leaders that resulted in <a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/1964-race-riots" rel="nofollow">racial riots in Singapore on May 13, 1964</a>.<br><br>When LKY wrote his memoirs, he belatedly reminisce the late Sultan of Brunei's wisdom in not joining Malaysia.<br><br>Singaporeans survived the dark days after being evicted from Malaysia, despite LKY's egotistic leadership in his mid-Thirties.<br><br>Singaporeans coped with the situation and <strong><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">helped</span></span></strong> the Government to overcome the early days of independence despite being sandwiched by two larger and hostile neighboring countries.<br><br>Following the eviction from Malaysia, Singaporeans blundered through several government policies insisted by LKY's government - the <span style="font-style: italic;">''Stop At Two''</span> Family Planning which had long term effect until this day - (and which LKY again belatedly acknowledged in his memoirs). Then there was the mass Housing Policy that continue unabated and changed the landscape of Singapore, making almost <span style="font-style: italic;">''NINETY PERCENT''</span> of Singaporeans to be dependent on the Government for housing needs, and paying for these homes at inflated prices.<br><br>Singaporeans survived till this day despite having to tighten the belts as economic policies had to be adapted that require Singaporeans to lower expectations, and change their life style.<br><br>Whatever became of the <span style="font-style: italic;">''Swiss <strong>Standard of Living</strong>''</span> - after we have been burdened by the <span style="font-style: italic;">''Swiss <strong>Cost</strong> of Living''</span> ?<br><br>Singaporeans continue to cope, and survived despite the government refusal to accept the economists warnings of the bubble bursting, which came with a suddeness that no one anticipated in 1987; and again in 1997 during the currency spiral down a seemingly bottomless hole - when some fund managers made a killing while the Singapore leadership were wringing their hands and wondering what hit the region.<br><br>Millions of dollars were lost from our Reserves through questionable investments in the 1980s and 1990s - from Micropolis to Suzhou Industrial Park; and now we are seeing the lost of Billions in a single ambitious takeover of Shin Corp in Thailand.<br><br>Singaporeans continue to survive, despite these losses, as we cope with higher medical fees, higher GST, higher education fees, higher transportation charges, higher utilities.<br><br>What do we need the Government for, when Singaporeans can cope with whatever difficulties that they create for us ?<br><br>If we can cope with all the rubbish that the present Political Party has caused with the Government that they have formed, does anyone think that Singaporeans <span style="font-style: italic;">''CANNOT''</span> cope with whatever difficulties that a <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>''NEW Government''</strong></span> formed by an <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>''Alternative Party''</strong></span> that is completely <span style="font-style: italic;">''NEW''</span> in the <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>''game of Government''</strong></span> ?<br><br>After nearly 50 over years of life with the Ruling Party, Singaporeans should have enough lessons in learning to cope and fend for ourselves - as the Ruling Party has always expected from us ?<br><br>Why will anyone still need the Politicians from the present Ruling Party ?<br><br>Have we not learnt anything to be independent and less dependent on the Government ?<br><br>Even the two old ladies who prefer to sell <span style="font-style: italic;">''Wanton Noodles''</span> instead of depending on welfare, had shown the way to survive despite the hardship that this Government had caused them. These two old ladies even ventured to finance the purchase of the Hawker Stall, when HDB decided not to be a Landlord, and dictated that all retailers in Singapore will have to buy over all hawker stalls and HDB shops. At the end, the two old ladies simply could not sell enough <span style="font-style: italic;">''wanton noodels''</span> to pay for the overpriced hawker stalls that were sold to the old ladies at Market Rates by the shameless HDB.<br><br>HDB was responsible in making two old ladies to be dependent on welfare that remained non-existent from this Ruling Party or the Government that it formed.<br><br>All that these two old ladies had wanted was to be self-reliant, but the Government had caused two old ladies to be made bankrupts by the Finance Company that gave them the loan for the overpriced Hawker Stall.<br><br>Do we still need any of these overpaid and supposedly <span style="font-style: italic;">''intelligent and capable''</span> ministers in the Government to lead us ?<br><br>If Singaporeans can survive the present Ruling Party, does anyone think that Singaporeans cannot survive any policies from any other Alternative Political Parties that form a NEW Government ?<br><br>As the Secretary-General of the Workers' Party had said - </span><br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">''if we pay peanuts we get monkeys. we will still get monkeys if we pay bananas....''</span></strong><br><br></div>
