            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by snow leopard:<br><br><strong>1) Protectionism is good for Singapore's future and it promotes investment like IRs </strong><br>SL : a good example of protectionism at work is an ex-PM protecting the position of PM for this son.<br>G : I am not sure if you could call that as protestionism, however are you suggesting that protectionism is good for Singapore?<br>SL : what then would you call it? nepotism?<br>G : The question you should be answering is, IS protectionism good for Singapore, and is Singapore IR an example of protectionism when none of the winners are Singapore companies.<br><br><strong>2) Open economy is bad for Singapore and its people </strong><br><br>SL : why do you say that?<br>G : Ask Soul_Rage<br>SL : nothing is ever absolutely good or bad. workfare, which the govt recently implemented, is a form of protectionism. would you say workfare is bad? you wouldn't. hence there needs to be a balance, a balance between staying competitive and ensuring that those who cannot keep up, stay afloat.<br>G : Could you offer Singapore an alternative to prosperous like we did in the past 45 years without having an open economy?<br><br><strong>3) There is a 80/20 rule in income distribution </strong><br><br>SL : could you illustrate?<br>G : Ask Soul_Rage<br>SL : why ask him when you are the one making that statement?<br>G : I didnÂ’t, I am just highlight the BS that he is contributing to this forum.<br><br><strong>4) If SIA doest threat you well, you should consider leaving the country. </strong><br><br>SL : if you don't treat SIA well, old man will kick you out<br>G : You miss the point<br>SL : no i didn't, i hit the nail on its head. if you don't treat SIA well, old man will kick you out.<br>G : As a consumer, do we need to always fly with SIA? Could you tell us what do you mean by treating SIA well and what you mean that the old man will kick me out?<br><br><strong>5) Local and foreign companies offer the same benefits to Singapore's future and economy </strong><br><br>SL : foreign companies do not have vested interests and many have voted with their feet already that led to widespread retrenchments.<br>G : You have to ask Soul_rage why he said that.<br>SL : not true. when we merely work for MNCs, we do not develop our own brand / technology which in the long run is what differentiates a truly first world nation from one that relies on first world nations<br>G : thatÂ’s what I thought too, but according to Soul_Rage, there is not difference.<br><br><strong>6) All casino gaming operators can operate world class IR by themselves </strong><br><br>SL : world class IR like world class public transportation that receives so many complains all the time?<br>G : Again you are missing the point, Soul_rage is suggesting that as a gaming operator, by default you will be able to operate and run business such as Universal Studio, Dreamworks, MICE, Sperm whale aquarium, without the need of having partners.<br>SL : show me the exact words that soul rage used that suggested what you suggested. if you can't, you are putting words into his mouth.<br>G :  Soul_Rage <span style="font-style: italic;">Â”In the IR tender, the govt DID give the tender to foreign companies. Why is that so? Its because none of our companies here have the experience of running a casino or such a huge resort, thus its reasonable for the govt to give this to the foreign company experienced in such a projectÂ”</span><br><br>http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=250502&amp;page=2<br><br>By saying that, he is claiming that Genting won because they are capable for running the whole IR by themselves and the reason why Keppeland and Capitaland lost is because they have never run an IR because despite the fact that they are partnering companies like MGM, Kerzner,<br><br><strong>7) Singapore employer are suckers for more expensive Indian FT </strong><br><br>SL : singapore govt is sucker for indians<br>G : Why? Can you support your claim?<br>SL : i quote you "i) Singapore employer are suckers for more expensive Indian FT". your statement supports my claim.<br>G : Like I said again, whatever you see here, are just BS coming from soul_rage, and thank you very much for questioning them.<br><br><strong><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> Government should not outsource project to overseas companies even if it is better value for money. </strong><br><br>SL : govt should outsource itself, since its menial jobs (including writing forums during office hours) can be done at a fraction of the millions of dollars it now costs us.<br>G : You mean Singapore should be run by another country?<br>SL : no, i mean singapore should be run by singaporeans who genuinely have singaporeans at heart and not hanker over million dollar salaries doing menial jobs like writing forums during office hours.<br>G : This has no relationship to how the government handle its projects.<br><br><strong>9) S-league foreign footballers are all highly educated individual </strong><br><br>SL : nobody watches S-league<br>G : That not what we are asking and again you miss the point.<br>SL : so my answer "nobody watches S-league" points squarely to the irrelelvance of your point.<br>G: We have foreign footballers who are playing for S-League and have been offered citizenship because of their talent in sport.  Hence do you think it is right to say that all FT are highly educated? Are you sure that nobody watches S-League? Are those people seating in the stadium ghost or something?<br><br><strong>10) You need to be highly educated to be consider a talent.</strong><br><br>SL : isn't that the govt's elitist policy for the last 40 years?<br>G : Are you sure?<br>SL: yes<br>G : Are you also saying that those badminton player from China who have become Singaporeans are highly educated?<br><br><strong>11) Income gap = living standard </strong><br><br>SL : income gap = widening living standards<br>G : You could be right, but thatÂ’s not what soul_rage said<br>SL : soul rage said the exact same thing i said<br>G: Really, mind showing me where you get that from?<br><br><strong>12) Singapore government is pro rich people, not pro business </strong><br><br>SL : it is pro rich people's business<br>G : is rich peopleÂ’s business not business? Or are you commenting for the sake of commenting?<br>SL : rich people's business is rich people's business. why do you care?<br>G : Could you give us some example of rich peopleÂ’s business?<br><br></blockquote></div>

Insists that middle income pay is increasing despite CNA report that middle income wages has stagnated for the past 5 years by economists from the Institute of Policy Studies<br>2. Economists are stupid people. Gazelle is the smartest, and only words from Gazelle are facts, even reports from CNA or economists are rubbish and BS<br>3. Insists that rising property prices = people having a better life, despite asset prices making it more expensive for people to own a property<br>4. The govt is a high performing govt, nevermind the billion dollar losses in Shin Corp, Suzhou, Global Crossing, etc.<br>5. Paying ministers 3 to 4x above the political market is a smart move, despite himself refusing to pay 50 cents more for quality eggs and insisting on $1.50 eggs, which is only an increase of 33% and not 300-400% above the normal price<br>6. Ministers are worth the money coz Gazelle is paying more GST and Gazelle thinks its one of the best ideas they have come out with (duh!)<br>7. You can own a car and a house with a monthly income of $2000<br>8. All of us are ungrateful brats who give only $400 allowances to our parents<br>9. Any words or terms not heard by Gazelle is not an official term or word in the dictionary. This implies that the following words are not in the dictionary:<br>- Humility<br>- Consideration<br>- Kindness<br>- Graciousness<br>Becoz as far as we can see from here, he doesn't exhibit any of the above, so I can safely assume he thinks such words are not in the dictionary coz he has never heard of them before<br>10. Says 'NO THESE ARE NOT FACTS' even when reports and statistics are placed right before him (myopic)<br>11. Analysts are stupid people. Only Gazelle is the smartest.<br>12. Statistics from anyone are fake. Only statistics provided by Gazelle are accurate and factual (did he ever provide any?)<br>13. Smart, intelligent and elite people ask others to kiss butt, calls others d..k, bull%!$@, pr..ks. Why? Coz only Gazelle is smart, intelligent, and elite.</div>
