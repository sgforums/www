And here I am not referring only to so-called authoritarian and communist states, but even to freer democratic states who are not beyond similarly using the curriculum and the education system to promote certain political agendas and interests. Again, we should note that the uncritical acceptance of the nation/state-building function of education is likely to run counter to the human rights and social democracy movements that are expected to gain more acceptance in the twenty-first century.</a><br><br>Just because it's in bits and pieces doesn't mean that it doesn't form an impression on the kids.</div>
