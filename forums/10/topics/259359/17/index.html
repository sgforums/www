But Singapore is a small economy. We have come so far through globalisation. Protectionism will not work for us."<br><br>Income disparity can be narrowed if our low paid workers work in wafer fabs instead of selling cosmetic jewelry, or work in shipyards instead of doing general clerical work.  However, I do not think we should aim for income parity...even the communists have learnt that it does not work. What we should go for is an increasing pay for all workers with the possibility of social mobility up the ladder.<br><br></div>

I know that from my own experience and I have also mentioned the ST senior writer whose father is a cab driver. My father earned even less than a cab driver...he couldn't have afforded the education I had. There are scholarships and busaries available. If you have the talent, you can go all the way to Oxbridge and Ivy league colleges...the government and various stat boards will fund you. Those who are not good enough for a scholarship can get bank loans and busaries...if you can get into one of our local Unis, you will not be denied an education because you cannot afford the fees.<br><br>Those who are less talented will not do as well, but not because of financial reasons.</div>

The results of these lower labour cost did not result in lower basic necessities (food, transport, clothing and utilities), but resulted in companies making more profits. Those in the higher salary bracket can afford to emigrate (outflow) to other countries (since they didn't like the way Singapore is run), while there are less immigration (inflow) of these higher salaried professionals (because the way the country is run doesn't attune to their lifestyle), thereby creating an increase or maintenance of their salary levels.<br><br>That's why the poor gets poorer while the rich gets richer.</div>

The new flats from HDB are not overpriced. If they are, we won't have 80% of Singaporeans living in them. Consider this, do you expect the government to sell you a heavily subsidised, new 5-room flat for only 50k, so that you can sell it in the resale market for 250k? The government has 2-room flats and rental flats for the very poor for almost nothing. But for the rest of Singaporeans, the CPF investment in a new subsidized HDB flat is almost guranteed to increase the value of your assets.<br><br>But I do not think it is fair for the government to subsidize too much using tax payers' money. If you think the private sector can build HDB flats more cheaply, then they are welcome to bid for it, as they now do.</div>
