If you have the talent, you are not denied educational opportunities in Singapore. I know that from my own experience and I have also mentioned the ST senior writer whose father is a cab driver. My father earned even less than a cab driver...he couldn't have afforded the education I had. There are scholarships and busaries available. If you have the talent, you can go all the way to Oxbridge and Ivy league colleges...the government and various stat boards will fund you. Those who are not good enough for a scholarship can get bank loans and busaries...if you can get into one of our local Unis, you will not be denied an education because you cannot afford the fees.<br><br>Those who are less talented will not do as well, but not because of financial reasons. </div></blockquote>The fact is that there were over 2000 children whos parents cannot afford education around the year 2001, at the primary and secondary level. And what of those that who are not talented? What of those with an average IQ? They get sucked in back into the poverty cycle? Children forced via circumstance into working to assist parents in bringing home the bacon due to an immediate need? Many of these parents aren't even literate enough to fill in the application forms for busaries.<br><br>Even if there were busaries, parents who are already struggling afford to make ends meet may not even be afford uniforms etc.<br><br>Leaving the untalented and socially challenged to rot away should not be the paradigm of our society.</div>

Look at the recent salary increment!!!<br><br>Perhaps TS does not have that good vocab knowledge that's why use the word "defame".    but one thing i am sure is TS is very unhappy with the people of Singapore,  "defame" is definitely not the word to be used when the reality is people are not happy, they voice out their views, comments, and so on and this is nothing to do with defamation.  Perhaps, TS should do something to improve his or her English.<br></div>
