            <div class='col-md body'>snow Leapord, personally I think you are very dumb to be trying to clean up someone else shi.t because<br><br>a) You have no clue of what we are talking about unless you have read what we have discussed earlier<br><br>b) You are not aware which part of the statement is true and which one is false, which one is from atobe, which one is from Gazelle,<br><br>c) You have limited information of the subject that we are discussing hence it is likely that you can only contribute by speculating.<br><br>d) It is also not in their interest to talk about it because that will just put salt onto their wound.<br><br>Since you are so eager, I will have no choice but to entertain you.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by snow leopard:<br><br><strong>1) Singaporeans will not benefit from the IRs </strong><br><br>SL  : the benefit from the IR will largely accrue to the govt<br>C : The question is not about who will benefit more, it is will IR benefit Singaporeans.<br><br><strong><br>2) the whole objective of IRs is for the government to collect gaming taxes. </strong><br><br>SL : it is the number one reason, even oxford mushroom agrees<br>C :  If you say so, then why does the government suggest the Venetian LV 30/70 business model and limit the floor area of gaming business in the IR?<br><br><strong>3) Singapore economy to will become like Monaco because we have F1 </strong><br>SL : in what ways?<br>G : You ask Atobe<br><br><strong>4) The reason why genting won the sentosa IR bid is because of PM Badawi </strong><br><br>SL : back up what you're saying<br>G : Ask Atobe (thatÂ’s his claim)<br><br><strong>5) Rich people attracted to singapore is comparable to Singaporeans going to JB to buy cheap grocery and food. </strong><br><br>SL : rich people coming to singapore to stay will inflate housing prices here. at least singaporeans going to JB to buy groceries won't stay in JB and cause property price jump.<br>G : Yup it is different, but in my opinion, you argument is misguided by your interest that property prices in Singapore should remain flat or inline with your personal income growth.<br><br><strong>6) Mcdonald market strategy is to get kids addicted to their burger and fries and they will eat till they die. </strong><br><br>SL : what are you trying to imply?<br>G : Ask Atobe (his claim is that McdonaldÂ’s food are addictive and you will eat till you die)<br><br><strong>7) MICE activities in Singapore will not benefit Singaporeans. </strong><br><br>SL : but won't it benefit the govt a whole lot more than ordinary singaporeans?<br>G : The question is not about weather the government will benefit more or less, it if it will benefit Singaporeans. Since you are at it, can I know why you say that the government will benefit more than the private companies that organize MICE, the participants the seal business deal during the MICE, and the companies and Singaporeans that are supporting the MICE activities?<br><br><strong>8.) Tourists in Singapore, will only spend money at Marina Bay Sands and RWS </strong><br><br>SL : is the whole idea of marina sands to earn money from tourists buying satay?<br>G : No, their main income will be coming from the MICE, gaming, F&amp;B and hotel. But what is your point of asking about satay? Confused?<br><br><strong>9) Countries like Malaysia and Shanghai are losing money hosting F1 </strong><br><br>SL : taiwan and hong kong businessmen making money in china doesn't mean we would make money too.<br>G : I donÂ’t see a logic is what you are trying to say. The question should be, are you sure they are losing money? Or is atobe trying to distort information?<br><br><strong>10) there were multiple PM Badawi visits to Singapore before and after the Sentosa IR announcement. </strong><br><br>SL : PM Lee made a personal visit to PM Thatsin just before the signing of the Shincorp deal.<br>G : PM Lee visit to Thailand as got nothing to do with PM BadawiÂ’s visit to Singapore. Obviously you are not aware of what we are talking about, because you should ask yourself this question, (Did PM Badawi visited Singapore in 2006?) before jumping into conclusion that he did. (Example of blind leading the blind??)<br><br><strong>12) Chinese cant afford to attend F1 race in Shanghai </strong><br><br>SL : so?<br>G : Your question should not be so, it should be are you sure they canÂ’t afford?<br><br><strong>13) Malaysians earning in Ringgit cannot afford to attend F1 race in Malaysia </strong><br><br>SL : and?<br>G : Same as question (12)<br><br><strong>14) Cost of Shanghai F1 facility, US$3,000,000,000 ($3b) </strong><br><br>SL : back up your figures<br>G : Ask Atobe or maybe M13, thatÂ’s their claim.<br><br><strong>15) Only Singapore Straits Times cover PM Badawi's visit to Singapore in 2006</strong><br><br>SL : but straits times is the main newspaper in singapore isn't it?<br>G : Do you have reasons to believe that such high profile news will only be covered by 3 media companies and that you cant find news coverage of his visit from internet and our government website?<br></blockquote></div>

Insists that middle income pay is increasing despite CNA report that middle income wages has stagnated for the past 5 years by economists from the Institute of Policy Studies<br>2. Economists are stupid people. Gazelle is the smartest, and only words from Gazelle are facts, even reports from CNA or economists are rubbish and BS<br>3. Insists that rising property prices = people having a better life, despite asset prices making it more expensive for people to own a property<br>4. The govt is a high performing govt, nevermind the billion dollar losses in Shin Corp, Suzhou, Global Crossing, etc.<br>5. Paying ministers 3 to 4x above the political market is a smart move, despite himself refusing to pay 50 cents more for quality eggs and insisting on $1.50 eggs, which is only an increase of 33% and not 300-400% above the normal price<br>6. Ministers are worth the money coz he is paying more GST (duh!)<br>7. You can own a car and a house with a monthly income of $2000<br>8. All of us are ungrateful brats who give only $400 allowances to our parents<br>9. Any words or terms not heard by Gazelle is not an official term or word in the dictionary. This implies that the following words are not in the dictionary:<br>- Humility<br>- Consideration<br>- Kindness<br>- Graciousness<br>Becoz as far as we can see from here, he doesn't exhibit any of the above, so I can safely assume he thinks such words are not in the dictionary coz he has never heard of them before<br>10. Says 'NO THESE ARE NOT FACTS' even when reports and statistics are placed right before him (myopic)<br>11. Analysts are stupid people. Only Gazelle is the smartest.<br>12. Statistics from anyone are fake. Only statistics provided by Gazelle are accurate and factual (did he ever provide any?)<br>13. Smart, intelligent and elite people ask others to kiss butt, calls others d..k, bull%!$@, pr..ks. Why? Coz only Gazelle is smart, intelligent, and elite.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by soul_rage:</div><div class="quote_body">Gazelle's hall of bull%!$@ fame:<br>1. Insists that middle income pay is increasing despite CNA report that middle income wages has stagnated for the past 5 years by economists from the Institute of Policy Studies<br>2. Economists are stupid people. Gazelle is the smartest, and only words from Gazelle are facts, even reports from CNA or economists are rubbish and BS<br>3. Insists that rising property prices = people having a better life, despite asset prices making it more expensive for people to own a property<br>4. The govt is a high performing govt, nevermind the billion dollar losses in Shin Corp, Suzhou, Global Crossing, etc.<br>5. Paying ministers 3 to 4x above the political market is a smart move, despite himself refusing to pay 50 cents more for quality eggs and insisting on $1.50 eggs, which is only an increase of 33% and not 300-400% above the normal price<br>6. Ministers are worth the money coz he is paying more GST (duh!)<br>7. You can own a car and a house with a monthly income of $2000<br>8. All of us are ungrateful brats who give only $400 allowances to our parents<br>9. Any words or terms not heard by Gazelle is not an official term or word in the dictionary. This implies that the following words are not in the dictionary:<br>- Humility<br>- Consideration<br>- Kindness<br>- Graciousness<br>Becoz as far as we can see from here, he doesn't exhibit any of the above, so I can safely assume he thinks such words are not in the dictionary coz he has never heard of them before<br>10. Says 'NO THESE ARE NOT FACTS' even when reports and statistics are placed right before him (myopic)<br>11. Analysts are stupid people. Only Gazelle is the smartest.<br>12. Statistics from anyone are fake. Only statistics provided by Gazelle are accurate and factual (did he ever provide any?)<br>13. Smart, intelligent and elite people ask others to kiss butt, calls others d..k, bull%!$@, pr..ks. Why? Coz only Gazelle is smart, intelligent, and elite.</div></blockquote>Dont border reading them, these are just his personal thoughts.
