Unless I am convinced of the cause, I won't help or even if I do, it will be half hearted effort.<br><br>Have they managed to convince all of us of their cause.  Maybe the older generations who grew up with the racial riots but certainly not this younger generation.  And they know this and they are trying  hard to show us the "cause" by promising a better and more vibrant place to stay , live and work.  Also, they open doors to foreign talents, hoping to swell the ranks and hopefully to convince and naturalise them.  Try they can, if you read today's reports - only 1 in 5 of the PRs converted to citizens.  the rest prefer to remain as PR. its not too difficult to see why.</div>
