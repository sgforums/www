Deep inside, we may even believe them when they say we can't exist without them.<br><br>We don't believe in ourselves.  We don't believe in our own people.  When we hear of fellow Singaporeans making it big abroad or locally, the 1st thing a cynical Singaporean thinks is "sure anot".. followed by "must be rich/elite lah."  Even when it is proven otherwise, instead of admitting our over-judgemental attitudes and being happy for them, we just dismiss it as "some people have all the luck".  We think that if we can make it, no one else can make it.  And unfortunately that's how we are right now and there's no sign of it changing anytime soon.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>When government sold assets to Singapore Power or MediaCorp and MediaWork, assets like substations, electrical network and cabling, licence fees for radios and televisions transferred over were actually owned by the citizens but the government profited from such sale and kept all the sale profits to itself and left it to SP and MediaCorp to charge for lands, assets and depreciation already owned and paid by people all over again.<br><br>Isn't it obvious Utility costs have to keep going up and pay double on substations, pylons etc. once again?<br><br>The current Networking charge is S$0.06-S$0.12 per kilowatt-hour. No wonder businesses in Singapore cannot compete with those in other countries like in Korea or Thailand as they do not suffer such double charge on assets.<br><br>Minus these networking costs the average Utility costs should be less than S$0.09 per kilowatt. Just imagine the windfall profits made by the government which does not even appear on the annual budget surplus.<br><br>That is why PM Lee was able to present a deficit or smaller surplus to parliament to justify further GST increases based purely on creative accounting like the NKF.<br><br>It is sinful to make profits non-stop from sale of assets to GLCs and force GLC to double-charge the citizens.<br><br>Singapore has lost it competitiveness mainly due to this type of creative accounting on lands and assets which give excuses to government and its GLCs to raise fees and charges.</div>
