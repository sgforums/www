I have also submitted a complaint to the moderators here.

But what is your point of asking about satay? Confused?<br></strong><br><br>of the items you listed, MICE, F&amp;B and hotel are the same whether or not we have a casino.  so those components don't change whether or not we have a casino.  hence, the only item left - gaming is the only reason for the casino.<br><br><strong><br>G : I donÂ’t see a logic is what you are trying to say.<br></strong><br><br>i understand, you have proven to be most stupid.<br><br><strong><br>The question should be, are you sure they are losing money? Or is atobe trying to distort information?<br></strong><br><br>that's your question.  my take is this: if we can screw up in china when our competitors, taiwan and hong kong can fluorish there, there's no reason to say that malaysia and shanghai make money means we're sure to make money.<br><br><strong><br>G : PM Lee visit to Thailand as got nothing to do with PM BadawiÂ’s visit to Singapore.<br></strong><br><br>PM Lee's meeting with Thaksin immediately before the Shin Corp deal is a good example of the possibility of state involvement in the Shin Corp fiasco.<br><br><strong><br>Obviously you are not aware of what we are talking about, because you should ask yourself this question, (Did PM Badawi visited Singapore in 2006?) before jumping into conclusion that he did. (Example of blind leading the blind??)<br></strong><br><br>no one jumped to conclusion, i merely pointed out a real visit since you're asking for one.  this is a good example of your blind leading to incomprehension.<br><br><strong><br>G : Your question should not be so, it should be are you sure they canÂ’t afford?<br></strong><br><br>my question is still - so?  so what if they can or cannot afford?<br><br><strong><br>G : Same as question (12)<br></strong><br><br>then why you post twice?<br><br><strong><br>G : Ask Atobe or maybe M13, thatÂ’s their claim.<br></strong><br><br>i quote what you wrote "14) Cost of Shanghai F1 facility, US$3,000,000,000 ($3b)"<br><br>so it is your claim, back it up if you have the balls.  you may ask atobe for help.<br><br><strong><br>G : Do you have reasons to believe that such high profile news will only be covered by 3 media companies and that you cant find news coverage of his visit from internet and our government website?<br></strong><br><br>doesn't change the fact that the main source of news for the masses would come from govt controlled news media<br></blockquote></div>
