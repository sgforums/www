Whatever you FEEL is nothing but you're just mxing two issues.<br><br>The Shin Corp investment incident is just a business mistake in my point of view, if you think business.

That's the true spirit I think.<br><br>As for civil servants (excluding politicians) pay increment, I think it is justified. I doubt any Singaporean would want to be paid less than the private sector, and it would keep corruption out of our government systems in some sense.</div>
