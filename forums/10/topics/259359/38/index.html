[b]For instance, during elections, the PAP CANNOT use HDB upgrading as a carrot because that is taxpayers' money for upgrading. This belongs to the GOVT, NOT the PAP, so the party cannot use the taxpayer's money as their war chest.</strong> Every person who pays taxes are entitled to equal rights for upgrading.

I am also exploring the opportunities available to me (which Gazelle doesn't have, too cowardly), I just don't like those whom have emigrated to label Singaporeans "Sillyporeans", etc, coz its not everyone who can (or has the guts to, which Gazelle doesn't have) take that step.<br><br>Our ancestors left China too coz conditions were too biased against them, and that's how Singapore came into the picture.</div>

How silly is it to  think short term and don't think long term? Maybe your definition is not of a simple life but of a simpleton's life.<br><br>Simple life in Australia maybe - healthcare is free, pension is there to cover the bills , lots of cheap rural properties . Yes you have racists around but who bloody cares as long as you have cash.<br><br>Simple life in China maybe - if you live up the mountains and have your own veggie patch.<br><br>Simple life in Singapore- HAHHAHAHAHAHAH</div>
