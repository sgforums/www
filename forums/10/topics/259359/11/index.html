What's the use of opposition? What's the use of even an half-hearted explanation from the PAP?<br><br>True, everyone should know more about cashflow and investments, but wouldn't it be a bonus if government policies actually do make sense (with logical and acceptable explanation from the government) + you have the "techniques" that you mention?<br><br>Let's say everyone possesses these unique qualities of making sound investments and good cashflow management, does that mean that the government can come up with policies backed with stupid reasons? The answer is still NO! We still expect the government to answer our queries with well thought out facts that are backed with figures and actions! In fact, I expect even more questions!<br><br>I would like to pose this question back to you, if PAP had not come into power in the past, would they be given this chance to perform? What makes you so sure there wouldn't be another RISING STAR from the opposition camp waiting to shine?<br><br>We don't need a RISING STAR propped up by his father's might.

In the past, speaking up agianst these laws will earn you the warth of the "sledgehammer" with ISD and Libel engraved on the sides. That is blatantly unjust. Today the ISD is used less visibly due to slight international pressure. The poilice force instead is used, libel suits are still hot with the PAP leadership.<br><br>The banning of peaceful assembly of individuals, is unjust. The govt has tried very hard to instil the paradigm "protests being non-existant". Non-violent protests are actaully not uncommon in other developed countries, but our media mainly report the violent ones, that get slamed by authorities. Hence a cultral disdain for protesters.. but today people are better traveled, worked and studied abroad, and they realise, wtf has Singapore been going? Singaporeans need to get out of the "Emeperor's new clothes" syndrome.<br><br>In a libel suit, how can the plaintiff be involved(directly or indirectly) in the appointment in the presiding judge?<br><br>In General elections, the rules are not meant to be changed by the ruling party, All parties to compete on equal terms. Again not the case here. Using taxpayers money as a carrot to buy votes? Thats morally correct?<br><br>They abolished public protests when they used it to oust the british in the 50s and 60s?<br><br>They created speakers corner, but when a person is given a permit to speak, others were not allowed to come and listen?<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by january:</div><div class="quote_body">We can give opinions but make sure you listen to govt replies and try to reach some understanding.</div></blockquote>From the a leader who said this?<br>"We decide what is right.
