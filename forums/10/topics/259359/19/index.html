The ST recently reported about even undergrads who pool their resources to speculate in property. We have 35 year-olds who borrow 1.5 million from the banks and own three properties. This is not sustainable and I expect the property bubble to burst. But if prices drop, Singaporeans will also complain and blame the government because their main asset, their properties, have tumbled in value.<br><br>The government has a tough time trying to keep prices low enough for people like me who want to buy and property owners who want the prices to stay high.<br><br>The private property market has an impact on publich housing as well because they compete for the same pool of buyers. Now if the government no longer allows HDB flats to be sold freely in the open market , say set a price cap on the resale value of HDB flats, the cost of public housing will drop.<br><br>But will Singaporeans be happy? With the majority of Singaporeans owning a HDB flat, you will have a revolt. </div></blockquote>$1.5 million for 3 properties? Private or HDB? Doesn't take a rocket scientist to cure this speculation ill, you only need curb the speculation, have more restrictions.<br><br>The government trying to keep prices low? HDB hasn't been transparent about it's pricing policy, from the what I see it's a cost + profits kind of pricing system.<br><br>In the first place, the government was wrong to allow resale in the private market. But they still persist in that direction.<br><br>If you are holding the property as your permanent abobe, it wouldn't make a difference if the price is $250,000 or $150,000. If you sell your house you end up without a roof over you head, unless you are holding it for speculative purposes. The ruling party only wants the peasant to have an illusionary effect, thinking that they have an expensive property, they have accomplished something in life. Hehehe.....Not knowing that if they sell their property, they won't have a place to live.</div>
