First and foremost, increase in GST simply means - things are more costly for everyone and given this is the case, i will cut down / stop spending altogether.  so how is it gonna help?

            <div class='col-md body'><br>I cut &amp; paste:<br>apologies to ndmmxiaomayi for doing that but its for ease of writing.<br>*************<br><br>And our dear minister's answer:<br><br>Reduced taxes doesn't mean increased revenues. Rather, it means a reduction in budget. Take for example corporate taxes. From 35% to 30%, it's a 5% drop, which is a lot, considering that corporations do earn a decent amount.<br><br>Now, how does the GST impact? Consider a worker earning $5000. The GST increase probably only reduced his monthly savings. At the most, his spendings will eat into his savings.<br><br>Now look at a worker who earns $1000. Already, he doesn't have much savings, he has to tighten his budget and spend within the $1000 he earns. With GST help package, it actually gives $300 to $400 to his monthly spendings. (I'm very confused on this part, don't ask me)<br><br>From the above two paragraphs, it seems like the government has made a very bad assumption, it assumes that citizens will still spend as usual.<br><br>Then she answered on the GST increase. Why isn't there a system like luxury tax, necessities tax, etc?<br><br>Her argument is because it blurs the lines. What defines a luxurious good? What defines a necessity? What defines this? What defines that?<br><br>Generally, while one would agree that names like Gucci, Prada are luxurious goods, how about goods like Nokia, Samsung? They are so common. Should they be classified as luxury goods? Or just normal goods? Another common sense answer is what is luxurious to you may not be luxurious to another.<br><br>So the government decided to apply the increase across the board.<br><br>She gave examples on Ireland and England.<br><br>Next question is about the top civil servants' salaries increase.<br><br>This answer is damn zai. I like. Again, it relates to globalization. And the yada yada reasons, so they benchmark themselves against the private sector and gave themselves the increase.<br><br>Also reminded the crowd that during bad economical period, they had taken a pay decrease, with no changes within the past 6 years. So this year's increase sort of justified it.<br><br>++++++++++++<br><br>I am not sure if any of the government ppl is reading this forum but I am sure they do.<br><br>Firstly I don't understand the logic: a worker earning S$1,000 will have $300 to $400 to his spending? The GsT offset package gives a yearly S$300 - S$400 ? That spells out to $33 per month.  Is the government saying that with increment of GST by 2%, an average chap earning S$1000 a month is facing only an increment of spending of S$33 &amp; this is aptly covered by GST offset package?<br><br>Has the government factor in the cost increae for staples, neccessities, utilities ?  Its a domino effect, you increase GST, all other items will see an increase due to GST.  You telephone, internet, water, electricity bills all will see an increase of 2%.  Your groceries, medical bills will also see an increae of 2%.  Unlike merchants who can claim back the GST, we as consumer cannot.  Notice I have kept the examples to the essentials - I don't include travel or luxury goods because as a poor man, you are not supposed to have them.<br><br>I think the issue of luxury good tax is simple - we cannot levy luxury tax not because we cannot define them - simply because we cannot offend the luxury companies, imagine your Chanel, Christian Dior, your LV all decided to get out of the country, we are screwed.  Moreover, we build on being a shopping paradise for luxury goods, the PRs won't spend, the tais tais won't spend here.  to levy luxury goods tax is akin to driving the rich and FTs overseas to make the purchase.  Now the tourists are not affected because they can claim back the tax but not local.<br><br>I think the question still remains - if the objective is to help the poor - is raising the GST the only means?  Its akin to robbing Peter to help Paul.<br></div>

Unless you got the proof that (a) is true. Whatever you FEEL is nothing but you're just mxing two issues.<br><br>The Shin Corp investment incident is just a business mistake in my point of view, if you think business. Who know's the Thais would make a big fuss and then comes a coup, and in the end, hence an investment loss?<br><br>In business, anything can happen.<br><br>For (b), the same thing. You're still mixing two issues base on your feeling.<br><br>Looking at the gobla competition, the GST policy looks good to me securing the job opportunities from overseas company. And in return would help in national coffers and if the goverment does in properly to spread the wealth to the low income group, it'll be beneficial.<br><br>The only thing is the justification of keeping political talents in Singapore to give such a high pay when the pay is already so high for the electorate and the Cabinet doesn't make sense.<br><br>Going into politics is for the loyalty to the nation and the willingness to serve the people. That's the true spirit I think.<br><br>As for civil servants (excluding politicians) pay increment, I think it is justified. I doubt any Singaporean would want to be paid less than the private sector, and it would keep corruption out of our government systems in some sense.</div></blockquote>Shin Corp is a big mistake, apart from Suzhou Industrial Project, Global Crossing and the current Indosat &amp; Telkomsel. If you have a company constantly making wrong major investment decisions, there must be seriously something wrong with your company. Moreover the CEO isn't independently hired for the position based on her abilities, it's based on relationships, much like the politics of China.<br><br>In business, you would also take in the political risk and assess the returns from the investments. The last year's return from the investment was less than 6% (can't be sure as I didn't check, but I remembered it's around that figure), so their investment decision confound me.<br><br>Thailand is a country throughout it's 20th century politics, riddled with coups. Does it not make sense that a coup will inevitably happen in the future.<br><br>How does GST help in securing job opportunities from overseas company? Can you please elaborate?<br><br>Spreading the wealth to low income group? In the past low income groups don't pay income tax, high income group pay income tax. After they impose GST, low income group still don't pay income tax, but they end up paying GST of 5%; whereas the high income group (which used to pay 33% top income bracket), gets income tax reduce to 20% (a reduction of 13%), while paying an increase of 5% GST.<br><br>There is no private market for political appointments, the job scope is different from other positions in the private market. We would like that their pay remain competitive that they attract capable people to do the job. But their pay scale is astronomical by global standards. Why would you want to attract Bill Gates to do the job when the job can be done by a comparable university graduate? Either ways, the job gets done.<br><br>Running a large business corporation is different from running a government. In a corporation, you would need to be a visionary, contend with market conditions and manage the company.<br><br>Running a country is to maintain a basic standard of living conditions for it's populace and maintain law &amp; order.<br><br>You don't need a rocket scientist to do the job of an office administrator!</div>
