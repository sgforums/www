They justify like crazy on why minsisters deserve millon-dollar salary and yet on the other hand, they go around telling companies to adopt flexible pay structure because our cost is too high &amp; not competitive - so tell me, what is what?<br><br>They compared their pays to private sector and they claimed if they don't receive this "competitive" pay, no one will stay in public sector and all will go into private sector.  But they forget, you want private sector's pay but are you prepared to meet the KPIs set out?  I have no complaints if the ministers all list out their KPIs, and at the end of every year, give the public an account of what has been achieved and what has not.  If they have surpassed their KPIs, good, I say they deserve their pay rise.  Otherwise, ps don't talk.  This is the way of life.  Can I tell my boss that if he doesn't give me a pay rise, I will be corrupted?  It does not take much imagination what he's going to tell me.<br><br>One good example of failed KPI, we want to make Singapore an education hub   - but UNSW closed down, thats a black mark on the relevant minstries.  So, what have they done?<br><br>moreover, the latest report have it that our pay ranked highest amongst all third world countries - what an irony - why isn't our costs then third world costs?  What is our learned leaders doing?<br><br>Secondly, I have no gripes if the leaders of Singapore are there because they won an election through public debates and the public / constituency voted them in - be in a slender margin or landslie - I have nothing to say.   However, if you hang onto the coatails of someone else to enter parlliment, I don't know what to say about the leader - I don't see his leadership and I am not even half convinced that he can lead.  And I cannot change this  bceause I cannot use my vote to influence the outcome.<br><br>Every single day, costs of living are higher and given that Singapore being a free economy cannot be helped but surely the government can do something - not to increase the GST??  A mere 2% is peanuts to them but to us commoners its a huge affair.  The justification of having to increase the GST to help the poor is akin to robbing Peter to help Tom.  Does that mean if our GST is not increased, we will lose our competiveness &amp; investments will dwindle?  Aren't we the second most competitive economy?  </div></blockquote>I do agree on the cost of living in Singapore is getting higher and higher. So we should focus on the topic of solving the problem for the lower income families, and not accusing the government for not doing anything.<br><br>The GST credits are given out to all Singaporean, i know is not enough, but i do believe the government will have other plans.<br><br></div>

Oh i forgot they increase GST to help the poor. i'm sad you accepted the bait with GST credit but how long does it last or whether it help? today all the essential are on the rise. all medical cost are on the rise. transport fare are on the rise<br><br>i hope the aother plans are not to project the GST to 10% in the not so near furture.<br></div>

And that is only in the contested GRCs and SMCs. A pity they(oppsition) didn't contest further.<br><br>Take Aljunied GRC for example, I don't dispute that George Yeo is a capable man. But I don't think that the other 4 are of Equal calibre to him. In the GRC system, you spread influence of George Yeo over the geograhical area that is equal to roughly 5 SMCs.<br><br>Then again, bringing back to answer your first post, I'm am here to spread the word, raise awareness that :<br><br>Vote oppsition doesnt equate to overthrowing the government. Say in a ratio of 40% PAP 30%WP 30%SDA/DRP etc... PAP will still form the government, but the difference, they do not make laws of thier own, They have to at least convince other MPs from other parties that the law they are passing is just. Which is very different from LKY passing a bill with PAP holding almost over 90% seats. The constitution can only be amended with s special majority of 66% votes of the electorate, on the second and third reading of the bill. Ordinary law can be enacted with only a simple majority of 51%.<br><br>That my objective, to raise awreness of the above facts among singaporeans. To bring them out of a state of "learned helplessness". To get poeple out of the "Emperor's new clothes syndrome".</div>
