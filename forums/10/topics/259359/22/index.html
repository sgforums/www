            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by january:</div><div class="quote_body">you all are too emotional and have bias towards govt policy.<br>Again, your views are narrow minded , thus govt policy certain point will make you feel unhappy but if you look at the big picture that govt has to consider, which people wont, they will just keep on have things to complain.<br></div></blockquote>To judge all who are anti-PAP as emotional is rather presumptuous on your part, don't you think so. Again, so is your judgement of all who are Anti-PAP being narrowminded. The PAP isn't infailable, and all polices and govt bodies should be able to stand up agianst scrutiny. And thats what the govt should be doing, convicing the people of their decisions. Not don't just hold a debate for the sake of an appearance of transparency when a bill or proposed policy is being intended to be implemented without vote.<br><br>The cabinet should be answerable to the legistation which represents the people. But due to strict party-discipline, handed down from the British, the legislation seems to be following the executive. Hence the executive and legislation are now 1 body. No semblence of an accountablility to the poeple. They are just brushing the poeple off, with the same presumtions that you are having "There will be unhappy people etc etc.. but we are still going to do it". That is why some people are not happy, the govt doesn't listen. Phillip Jeyaretnam is far from middle class and he as spoken out agianst the Minister's pay rise, drawing sharp rebuke from the PAP. Just an example, to show that the unhappy people are nolonger just the middle class.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by january:<strong><br>Preconceived beliefs leads to sensitive emotions. When you are angry, the blame is usually external. therefore, the solution is on moderating you emotions.</strong></blockquote>Preconveived beliefs do not lead to sensative emotions, insecurities do. Like how LHL or LKY get when talking about CSJ or JBJ. Like how LKY lashed out at a young journalist from S.Times on TV before last years GE, when the subject of voting PAP out of fear came up.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>On the contrary, preconcieved beliefs do lead to blindly following a certain value or set of values. Which in your case, is somewhat akin to "The (economic)ends justify the means of which the PAP gets there." Hence blindly assuming the PAP is right, and saying the People who oppose the gvot lack the ability to rationalize and reason due to emotions.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by january:<strong><br>I am just like all  of you. Middle class, still finding job, have gone to 2 nearby countries in my life so far, have university debt of abt 15 k, seldom spend on material stuff.<br><br>You all dun know how to manage your emotions that is why the tendency to blame others.<br><br>as i have say, if you are not rich, dun go buy a 4 room, 5 room. the moment u buy bigger house, u have money problem if u dun earn that much. stress and pressure will come, blaming will occur.</strong></blockquote>Lets take the ministers pay hike for example (there are mnay others as well)<br>Again, I present to you, Sylvia, Chiam, TLK and Phil Jeyaretnam, they seem pretty calm and collected when puting their points across, and with strong evidence against the pay hike. (they are hardly middle class)LKY just brushes them of with claims that Singapore is in a unique situation. IMO, no less unique than any other nations on this planet.<br><br>You talk the talk, we'll see in 10 years, how you walk the walk.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by january:<strong><br>self accountability is missing.<br><br>As to whether the govt is effective with veto power, you people are assuming that by changing decision according to people wishes, thing will be better. Proof? There is tendency to assume that monopoly of govt power is always bad. This is not a universal law or proof.</strong></blockquote>It is not self accountability that is missing, it is Govt accountability to the people that is sorely missing. We are not living in a Kingdom or in an Empire. Democracy was created to enable prosperity, and also to ensure that powers do not get abused, unchecked and thus bringing the nation to its knees.<br><br>If a policy is good for the people, convince the poeple, tis the responsiblity of the Government. The problem is the use of authority to thumb the people down and do what they(PAP) want, for the authority the PAP has is vested in them by the people.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by january:<strong><br>Go read up more how to have simple life and achieve happiness book.<br>Even within the internet forum, opposition parties are convincing and building up a list of the' mistakes of govt' and thus making themselves more and more left wing without checking the validity of the sources and the reasoning.</strong></blockquote>You are again having the preconcieved idea that encomical values is the only reason that the people are not happy with the PAP.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by january:<strong><br>You want to be like taiwan.. people got alot of freedom in say in politics.. newspaper can oppose govt here and there... the result.. do they have a better life? can fight in meeting also.</strong></blockquote>No one wants violence, I can give you a whole list of fully democratice nations that are doing well, with the non-violent protests. No one in the opposition advocates violence.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by january:<strong><br>politics , its is easy to swing the mind of opposition and brainwash them. the opposition themselves will even brainwash themselves. We cannot therefore allow so much freedom of press.</strong></blockquote>If the government policies are good, they can stand up to scrutiny and the govt should be able to debuk convincingly. Not happening here.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by january:<strong><br>other countries have more freedom in blaming govt, is their life better than because of that? </strong></blockquote>Yes. And there is a distinct difference, between questioning the government and blaming them. Questioning them to justify their decisions is not blaming. Contrary to your preconcieved belief that all who opposing PAP are blaming them. Personally, I want PAP to reform the very core of the system, before it gets worse.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by january:<strong><br>casuality is a complex process with many issues affecting one another over time. Go read up on psychology , physcis of time and space and causality and philosphy.<br><br>Human mind don't see the complexity in causality. Therefore, opposition will just line up several reasons in straight line and make judgments. </strong></blockquote>Do you want to be part of the list of casualties and get left behind by the govt polices?<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by january:<strong><br>I am saying that you all do not have real proof that the govtment is indeed doing thw wrong things. Just a bunch of ideas and pseudo evidence. </strong></blockquote>There has been a whole list, not illegal, as they make the law. What is illegal is not always wrong, what is legal is not always right. If you want the list, I'll post it here on this thread again for your sake.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by january:<strong><br>[b]Wont post anymore for today.</strong></blockquote>If you do decide to post again, try not to make sweeping dismissive statements, its not very healthy debating.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>
