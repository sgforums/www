Likewise, a degree holder earning les than $3000/mth after years of working, a sloth?<br><br>These people do not ask for a crutch from the govt.

Isn't that its because its the majority of population? As of the year 2000, 60% of households with at least one income earner earn 4k and below per month. Yep, thats majority in my books. And we know that a large majority of those households have two or more income earners.<br><br>We have one of the lower tax rates for high income earners amongst 1st world nations. Of course the higher up are not complaining.<br><br>The civil service pay hike is not a fundemental reason that people are not for the ruling party. I reckon, its like the proverbial straw that broke the camel's back, for those that recently switched sides. For those who were already opposing the ruling party way before the recent events, have a mayrid of other reasons.<br><br>Most of it being unjust laws. Also most noteably, the PAP sledgehammer with "ISD" engraved on one side and "libel" engraved on the other. Mistakes are one thing, the sledgehammer is a choice. I will concede that there are some capable ministers, but the PAP with total control over the constitution, thus passing unjust laws are a whole other matter altogether. Its no longer just about blaming the Govt for "failing" but making the govt reform.<br><br>Edit :<br><br>Phillip Jeyaretnam is hardly middle class btw...</div>

Why did they think of their own personal welfare ahead of the people, the very people that they are suppose to serve? Have the people of Singapore not express our disappointment at the government's decision?<br><br>Are all those Singaporeans that were unhappy with the government's decision all out to defame our government?<br><br>Is speaking our minds, giving our opinions about the government defaming them? Then in this case there is no need for elections and oppositions anymore. <strong>Let PAP do whatever they want... whenever they want.</strong><br><br>In life, we always question the actions of others. If the government cannot face criticism and queries, let alone answer them, I seriously doubt that the general public would be appeased.</div>

First and foremost, increase in GST simply means - things are more costly for everyone and given this is the case, i will cut down / stop spending altogether.  so how is it gonna help?  Why do they have to go the round circle of increase GST and slap on GST credits?<br><br>Not to be nicky picky, the GST credits are not enough to offset the increase in costs that we are going to face.  Then why do that in the first place.<br><br>You need extra incomce, why don't you increase duties on tobacco or gaming tax since Singapore Pools is one company that makes big profits?  You want money, you should put your million dollar salary into good use by thinking how we can export more.</div>
