With more transparency, dirt has to be kept to a certain level before it surfaces. Unless you think "dirt is just as easy to hide" if you are open to public scrutiny. And to stay on topic/thread, there are people unhappy with the way the Government is avoiding being tranparent, silencing people who try too hard to make the govt transparent.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Gazelle:</div><div class="quote_body">For example,  many people here like to compare our minister's salary to president Bush, hence I assume that USA political scene must have less "dirt" than Singapore huh?<br></div></blockquote>Firstly, there is no corealation between Bush's salary and the amount of "Dirt" he has. I have no heard complaints about PAP cannot raise thier salaries becuase they are more dirty than Bush. The people who are unhappy and use bush as a comparison, feel that his job is no easier than that of our ministers or PM, why should our PM get 4-5 times his wage?<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Gazelle:</div><div class="quote_body">If so, then how would you explain the hundreds of billion spending a year to fund the bush administration war game, which lead the country to no where and hundred thousands of death?<br></div></blockquote>Thats was Bush's responsiblity to explain to the people or they'll vote him  or his party out of office. There were public protests in the States opposing the war, demanding justification of the decision to go to war, the police acted as marhsalls guiding traffic and the proesters, not silencing them.<br><br>A group of protesters wanted to protest in front of the american ambassy, they were stopped by the police, and the American Ambassy questioned the Singapore Govt why where they(the protesters) not allowed to hold a peacful protest.<br><br>The same as, decisions made by the PAP is PAP's responsibility to answer to the people and justify thier decisions.</div>

The income of the bottom 30 percent of the population has fallen. What is more worrying is the fact that the majority of Singaporeans in the middle class has only seen about a one percent increase in their nominal income in the last 5 years.<br><br>This is not not just a Singapore problem say economists who point out that stagnant wages is a global problem.<br><br>The chief reason for this is globalisation, especially with India and China introducing a large pool of skilled and unskilled labour to compete with the labour forces of industrialised countries.<br><br>Singapore is susceptible to this because of its open economy.<br><br>Manpower Ministry data shows that 124,000 jobs were created last year and 45 percent of these jobs went to foreigners.<br><br>"With the rate of immigration, even among unskilled and semi skilled labour at a rate twice of what we experienced in the 90s, at a rate fastest in the developed world, the question is - does this dampen our real wages as we grow? Does the strategy itself dampen real wages and depress real wages at the low and middle end of the spectrums? They are sacred cows but we should step back and think about them," said Yeoh Lam Keong, Vice President, Economic Society of Singapore.<br><br>Another reason cited for middle class wage stagnation is the move by the government to cut CPF employer contribution rates for older workers by 4 percentage points over the last 2 years.<br><br>"So if you were a worker in the 50-55 age group, you could have seen your wages fall as much as 10 percent over the last 3 or 4 years. Now with the economy improving, the government could bring that back, the increase is 1 or 2 percent. I'm in support of CPF tinkering but probably it happens far too often, but I think there's probably some justification to look back and think that the restructuring was a bit too aggressive on the CPF side and it has contributed somewhat to a very sandwiched middle class," said Chua Hak Bin, Director, Asia Pacific Econ &amp; Market Analysis, Citigroup Global Markets Singapore.<br><br>The government is looking at increasing CPF by 1 to 2 percentage points in 2007.<br><br>Economists say workfare should become a more permanent pillar of the economy so as to cushion growing inequality.<br><br>- CNA /dt</div>
