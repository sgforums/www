If someone saves your life, should you still be eternally grateful if he decides to massacre your family later on. They were good in the past, but does not mean that they are good now.<br><br>Was it good for us to gain independence from the British? If we had remained a colony like Hong Kong, our accomplishments could have surpassed Hong Kong. What the old man did was get Foreign Direct Investments (FDI) to invest in Singapore, as a result none of these establish companies hold any loyalty to Singapore. When times are good, they invest in factories, make use of our manpower resources and infrastructure. When times are bad, they leave us for other markets, taking away all their capital with them. Fair weather friends! Hong Kong on the other hand, has a larger share of local enterprises, which results from the British colonial free market system. These local enterprises being intrinsically Hong Kong will have it's loyalty to Hong Kong.<br><br>How did they help us during economic crisis? Can you elaborate?<br><br>Minister assisting during SARS outbreak. Are they not receiving salary? If you pay me a quarter of their pay, I would glady work 16 hours a day every day for 5 years. Are they doing voluntary work during SARS period or are they still paid million dollar salaries? They didn't do anything out of the ordinary, just improvised more registration so that it's easier to trace possible carriers. Any common person could do that.</div>

Somehow the whiners will not complain they they have PS3 to play, and new phone to show off, but when coming to compete with the world, they will make hell lot of noise saying out government is useless and bla bla bla.<br><br>d) Whiner here are just like couch potato, seating comfortably at home, and all they are capable of doing is complaining that this movie is not good, the TV is too small, the sofa is not comfortable, the room is too warm..etc.<br><br>e) When they run out of excuses, they will start to point their finger at the minister salary, which we all already know that its the highest in the world. And just because our system is unique, it is by default that it is wrong and we must follow USA, British or Austrlian style of democracy.<br><br>I am just wondering have they ever question why a CEO or manager should be paid higher than a factory workers when the factory workers are actually work more hours in the company?<br><br>Or could it be that they are unknowingly suggesting that Singapore should be run like a communist country.</div>

They done enough to earn our respect and not insults and complains from us why they need to earn so much money.<br><br>I do agree the society need to be more democratic and free voicing of the people. But how much trust are we prepare to give to the new opposition parties.<br><br></div></blockquote>My take, 2 factors<br><br>First one, the judicary. The heavy handedness of the PAP, the proverbial sledge-hammer. The amending of the constitution to entrench their occupation in parliament. The many opposition members who have been unjustly treated, the creation of unjust laws to curtail freedom of speech and peaceful assembly.<br><br>(If I remember correctly, even the american embassy was perplexed as to why the govt disallowed protestors in front of their compound.)<br><br>Second one, the people want to be taken seriously by government. For example, the debate of the civil service pay raise was not even a substiantial factor in the final decision. Not even a vote was taken. It give an impression of a skin deep presentation of "people having a say" but no real substance or value in the debates of the opposition members, in the eyes of the Cabinet.<br><br>When PAP doesn't have total power, say only a slight majority, they will be alot more sensative to the voices of the general population. Many feel the acute need for the Government to move away from the LKY Quote "We decide what is right, nevermind what the people think".<br><br><a href="http://power2thepeoplesg.blogspot.com/2007/05/voting-for-opposition-bad-move-what.html" rel="nofollow">http://power2thepeoplesg.blogspot.com/2007/05/voting-for-opposition-bad-move-what.html</a><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Firstly, a credible opposition doesn't equate to overthrowing the government, or even a revolution. A credible opposition does not mean destabilizing the Government, which what some people fear. Overthrowing the government is not the objective here. Placing a credible opposition in parliament has to start gradually, by taking small steps....<br></span><br><br>With 40% percent seats in parliament, PAP still in power, but no total control over the government.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">What is the most important key to rule a nation? Its the absolute power and control of the law.<br>And what is the supreme law of the land? It is the Constitution of The Republic of Singapore. </span><br><br>We cannot have a single party have total rule over the constitution.<br><br>[/i]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>So we cannot have PAP occupying more that 66% seats in parliament. Actually 40% 30% 30% would be ideal. So to amend the constitution, at 2 parties will need to be convinced. And PAP will have to streamline to keep only their very best, demand for oppostion memebers will greatly increase and picking PAP as the party to join will no longer be a "nobrainer" for aspiring politicians. Voting will then really involve serious deliberation on the part of the voter.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks for all the valuable input that will make Singapore a better place to live in. I do agree we have incompetent leaders. The policies the present government bring out might please some and also will agitate a few. Some will benefits from the policies and some will suffer.<br><br>We cant be promoting a country tat can please everyone, or taking money out from the treasury to give to the people every month. Do rem that we are a small country, these money are a global advantage for us. Have u ever thought why our neighbouring country keep presuring us and send rumours among our ppl. this is to create a society unstable/chaos, and unfortunately, we prefer to hear things that we like to hear. that is why ppl in singapore keep on complaining on the system of the government.<br><br>In the coporate world, i do believe some of the management personnel also not up to the marks and also drawing millions of dollar a year. This is true and we cant have all the good apple in a big basket, there tend to have some rotten ones.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I take gripes with the civil service pay increment.  They justify like crazy on why minsisters deserve millon-dollar salary and yet on the other hand, they go around telling companies to adopt flexible pay structure because our cost is too high &amp; not competitive - so tell me, what is what?<br><br>They compared their pays to private sector and they claimed if they don't receive this "competitive" pay, no one will stay in public sector and all will go into private sector.  But they forget, you want private sector's pay but are you prepared to meet the KPIs set out?  I have no complaints if the ministers all list out their KPIs, and at the end of every year, give the public an account of what has been achieved and what has not.  If they have surpassed their KPIs, good, I say they deserve their pay rise.  Otherwise, ps don't talk.  This is the way of life.  Can I tell my boss that if he doesn't give me a pay rise, I will be corrupted?  It does not take much imagination what he's going to tell me.<br><br>One good example of failed KPI, we want to make Singapore an education hub   - but UNSW closed down, thats a black mark on the relevant minstries.  So, what have they done?<br><br>moreover, the latest report have it that our pay ranked highest amongst all third world countries - what an irony - why isn't our costs then third world costs?  What is our learned leaders doing?<br><br>Secondly, I have no gripes if the leaders of Singapore are there because they won an election through public debates and the public / constituency voted them in - be in a slender margin or landslie - I have nothing to say.   However, if you hang onto the coatails of someone else to enter parlliment, I don't know what to say about the leader - I don't see his leadership and I am not even half convinced that he can lead.  And I cannot change this  bceause I cannot use my vote to influence the outcome.<br><br>Every single day, costs of living are higher and given that Singapore being a free economy cannot be helped but surely the government can do something - not to increase the GST??  A mere 2% is peanuts to them but to us commoners its a huge affair.  The justification of having to increase the GST to help the poor is akin to robbing Peter to help Tom.  Does that mean if our GST is not increased, we will lose our competiveness &amp; investments will dwindle?  Aren't we the second most competitive economy?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Seriously, for a stable nation, I rather have PAP as having the majority seats of more than 50%. But I would also want to see pposition of at least 45% simply become there is literally no opposition power to resist policies that the people feel it is not good for them.<br><br>I do not wish to see PAP make mistakes and then realised, "Oh, I think we made a mistake. But nevermind, we'll work on it."<br><br>The attitude is going into complecency mode for them.<br><br>As for the salary issue, I simply don't see the point of "increasing the pay so that your loyalty wouldn't go away".<br><br>What happen to the government's National Education?<br><br>Loyalty to country becomes an issue in term of monetary terms? People do politics for their people and loyalty to their nation not for money. There's a difference between giving someone a carrot and teaching them the nobility of being a farmer feeding the society.<br><br>Is it that our government don't trust their own policies anymore, in term of NE?<br><br>If they do not trust, then is it becos' of Singaporeans are too sick of the Singaporean lifestyle? How do you change this?<br><br>I don't think the goverement is looking at the bigger picture here.<br><br>I think the root of the "be a Singaporean or not" issue is the way of life we have now. Singaporean lifestyle is a super rat race, everyone is pretty sick of it. The most simple solution is migration.<br><br>We're working like servants of the rich in this world of globalisation. But why can't we make ourselves masters rather than servants?<br><br>Becos' PAP is bring us jobs, yes. We have jobs and low unemployment. But we're working like dogs. Make us masters, not servants of jobs.<br><br>I hope everyone sees my point.</div>
