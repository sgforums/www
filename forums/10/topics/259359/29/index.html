Insists that middle income pay is increasing despite CNA report that middle income wages has stagnated for the past 5 years by economists from the Institute of Policy Studies<br>2. Economists are stupid people. Gazelle is the smartest, and only words from Gazelle are facts, even reports from CNA or economists are rubbish and BS<br>3. Insists that rising property prices = people having a better life, despite asset prices making it more expensive for people to own a property<br>4. The govt is a high performing govt, nevermind the billion dollar losses in Shin Corp, Suzhou, Global Crossing, etc.<br>5. Paying ministers 3 to 4x above the political market is a smart move, despite himself refusing to pay 50 cents more for quality eggs and insisting on $1.50 eggs, which is only an increase of 33% and not 300-400% above the normal price<br>6. Ministers are worth the money coz he is paying more GST (duh!)<br>7. You can own a car and a house with a monthly income of $2000<br>8.
