No affordable beds?  CPF rates have not been restored although government has said economy is robust and the STI is sky high.  Government tell us to work till later (which I have no objections) but you fear for your job once you reach 40 and everday, you see your workplace populated with more FTs.  They encourage you to be entrepreuner but the NETs transaction fees has just gone up, you cannot sell tissue paper without being harassed for license.  they aim for an education hub but UNSW just closed down and the entrance to University gets tougher for local students.

GST increase LHL has the say.  Any $$$$ involved, LHL is in it.  It is very clear that  the lee very into controlling $$$$$$ in Singapore!!!   Never had it been like that to others when they were presidents, pms in Singapore in the history of singapore.   This is no wonder people of Singapore have lots to comment and say about the lee.  So TS is just being one sided, and sees only one side of the coin.<br><br></div>

Without us, they can't get paid so super high salary.   It applies to every country in the world, as long as the politicians are serving the nation and get paid, the nation is the boss of the politicians.  Singapore is no exception.  If the ruling party thinks otherwise, then don't depend on Singaporeans to get paid for their salary every month.</div>
