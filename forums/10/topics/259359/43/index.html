It lists the principles which may apply in particular situations drawing on past precedent. It applies to all members of the Government (and covers Parliamentary Private Secretaries in section 2).<br><br>1.3 Ministers are personally responsible for deciding how to act and conduct themselves in the light of the Code and for justifying their actions and conduct in Parliament. The Code is not a rulebook, and it is not the role of the Secretary of the Cabinet or other officials to enforce it or to investigate Ministers although they may provide Ministers with private advice on matters which it covers.<br><br>1.4 Ministers only remain in office for so long as they retain the confidence of the Prime Minister. He is the ultimate judge of the standards of behaviour expected of a Minister and the appropriate consequences of a breach of those standards, although he will not expect to comment on every allegation that is brought to his attention.<br><br>1.5 The Code should be read against the background of the overarching duty on Ministers to comply with the law, including international law and treaty obligations, to uphold the administration of justice and to protect the integrity of public life. They are expected to observe the Seven Principles of Public Life set out in the first report of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, repeated in annex A, and the following principles of Ministerial conduct:<br><br>* Ministers must uphold the principle of collective responsibility;<br>* Ministers have a duty to Parliament to account, and be held to account, for the policies, decisions and actions of their departments and agencies;<br>* it is of paramount importance that Ministers give accurate and truthful information to Parliament, correcting any inadvertent error at the earliest opportunity. Ministers who knowingly mislead Parliament will be expected to offer their resignation to the Prime Minister;<br>* Ministers should be as open as possible with Parliament and the public, refusing to provide information only when disclosure would not be in the public interest which should be decided in accordance with the relevant statutes and the Freedom of Information Act 2000;<br>* Ministers should similarly require civil servants who give evidence before Parliamentary Committees on their behalf and under their direction to be as helpful as possible in providing accurate, truthful and full information in accordance with the duties and responsibilities of civil servants as set out in the Civil Service Code;<br>* Ministers must ensure that no conflict arises, or appears to arise, between their public duties and their private interests;<br>* Ministers should avoid accepting any gift or hospitality which might, or might reasonably appear to, compromise their judgment or place them under an improper obligation;<br>* Ministers in the House of Commons must keep separate their roles as Minister and constituency Member;<br>* Ministers must not use government resources for Party political purposes. They must uphold the political impartiality of the Civil Service and not ask civil servants to act in any way which would conflict with the Civil Service Code.<br><br>1.6 Ministers must also comply at all times with the requirements which Parliament itself has laid down, including in particular the Codes of Conduct for their respective Houses. For Ministers in the Commons, these are set by the Resolution carried on 19 March 1997 (Official Report columns 1046-47), and for Ministers in the Lords the Resolution can be found in the Official Report of 20 March 1997 column 1057.<br><br>Propriety and Ethics Team, Cabinet Office, 70 Whitehall, London SW1A 2AS</blockquote>Did our ministers in charge of regulating the affairs of charitable organizations comply with any of the codes of conduct expected of ministers in the whole NKF saga whether in reporting the incidents to parliament or replies to the media if we are to use the above-stated UK codes as an example.<br><br>If the ministers concerned cannot report facts accurately to parliament what would they be guilty of based on the above-stated codes?</div>

They got some lady (supposedly from Hong Kong) to talk about the problems with her migration to Canada (I think). Obviously, it's a lame attempt of theirs to influence the decisions of Singaporeans. You know why it's pure propaganda? It's because they present a one sided view, from a person who dislike migrating to a new country. Why didn't they present the other view? People who actually enjoyed living in their new country. When you want to provide an unbias picture, you should always provide the pros and the cons, not a one sided view.<br><br>They know the migration of citizens is increasing, the smarts who have the ability are moving on, while Singapore gets stuck with rejects like gazelles, lions and mushrooms. There might be a potential brain drain problem, ultimately Singapore is going to end up with fewer intellectuals and will have to rely on FTs to manage the economy.<br><br>Do I think the regime will change it's self serving policies? Nope. Why? The old man has already said, we will do whatever we want to, we don't need your consensus, you guys can talk all you want, but we are not going to listen.<br><br>If you run a huge corporation, you would need to know the consensus with the lower rung workers. Imagine, your worker assembling an aircraft, he tells you that there's a problem with a bolt not being able to withstand the load. You dismiss his complains. Finally your aircraft starts crashing, your company goes out of business, the management and workers loses their jobs.<br><br>Governing is alot like the senses of a person. The brain being the government and all other body parts your workers. You accidentally put your hand on a hot stove, the pain receptors passes the message to your brain, you immediately move your hand away from the stove. In our case, the hand is on the hot stove right now, but the brain is under narcotics, so your hand is staying where it is on the hot stove.<br><br>Good luck to whatever life you have here. I already know what's in store here, but do you know what's in store in other countries?. I only got one thing to say, been here, done that. Other opportunities exist elsewhere.</div>
