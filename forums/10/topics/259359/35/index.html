I am wonder if you will have your wedding dinner at hawker center when you get married.<br>SL : if the project is not enticing enough, it may not be sustainable in the long run, thus ruining collection of taxes in the long run. lots lots. and how much bigger is the restaurant as compared to the hawker stall? you're might be the only person in this world wondering.<br>G : Casino is probably the most profitable, sustainable and least risk component of the whole IR project, hence if the government is only keen on collecting gaming tax revenue I donÂ’t see why you even question its sustainability.<br><br><strong>3) Singapore economy to will become like Monaco because we have F1 SL : in what ways? </strong><br><br>G : You ask Atobe<br>SL : why ask atobe when it is your claim?<br>G : Atobe Â“Â”With the IR and these Up-Market Developments, the Government had declared that Singapore shall be the next Monaco to be a playground for the Rich and FamousÂ”Â” http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=252941&amp;page=1<br><br><strong>4) The reason why genting won the sentosa IR bid is because of PM Badawi </strong><br><br>SL : back up what you're saying<br>G : Ask Atobe (thatÂ’s his claim)<br>SL : i quote you "4) The reason why genting won the sentosa IR bid is because of PM Badawi". it is your statement so back it up if you have the balls. don't hide behind the skirt / trousers of atobe.<br>G : Obviously you are not aware that this a ATOBEÂ’s claim (Go do some reading)<br>SL : i am aware that you have been twisting other people's words. back up your words if you have balls.<br>G : Atobe Â“the reasons that Genting can beat Eigth Wonders for the Sentosa IR, considering the visit made by PM Badawi at a critical moment of the bidding process, which is all too much to be a co-incidenceÂ”<br>http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=252941&amp;page=1<br><br>And yes, I do have the balls, and they are both functioning very well,.<br><br><strong>5) Rich people attracted to singapore is comparable to Singaporeans going to JB to buy cheap grocery and food. </strong><br><br>SL : rich people coming to singapore to stay will inflate housing prices here. at least singaporeans going to JB to buy groceries won't stay in JB and cause property price jump.<br>G : Yup it is different, but in my opinion, you argument is misguided by your interest that property prices in Singapore should remain flat or inline with your personal income growth.<br>SL : if the argument is right, it is right. the need to keep property prices in check is not a misguided interest but an impt economic variable that any govt smart enough would come to realize<br>G : Could you tell us which smart government in this world is doing what you claim should be done??<br>SL : could you tell us which smart government pays itself millions?<br>G : Plenty, the Prince of Oman, Saudi, Kuwait, Brunei, etc. However thats beside the point, could you please give us an example of a smart government that is doing what your claim should be done.<br><br><strong>6) Mcdonald market strategy is to get kids addicted to their burger and fries and they will eat till they die. </strong><br><br>SL : what are you trying to imply?<br>G : Ask Atobe (his claim is that McdonaldÂ’s food are addictive and you will eat till you die)<br>SL : i can't find that in his postings. are you defaming him?<br>G : Really? Obviously you have been reading the wrong thread. If you are polite enough to say please I will show it do you. I promise.<br>SL : please stop defaming atobe<br>G : you are making yourself look like a mad dog trying to defend your master atobe<br><br><strong>7) MICE activities in Singapore will not benefit Singaporeans. </strong><br><br>SL : but won't it benefit the govt a whole lot more than ordinary singaporeans?<br>G : The question is not about weather the government will benefit more or less, it if it will benefit Singaporeans. Since you are at it, can I know why you say that the government will benefit more than the private companies that organize MICE, the participants the seal business deal during the MICE, and the companies and Singaporeans that are supporting the MICE activities?<br>SL : the most impt conclusion for singaporeans to take away is that the govt is the biggest winner in any decision, including the casinos. with or without the casino, the income from MICE and deals are just the same for private companies. hence the new addition - casino, mainly benefits one entity - the govt.<br><br>G : Like I said again, the question is not about who is the biggest winning, but will MICE activities benefit Singaporeans.<br>SL : your question is not of interest to me. the question that is of interest to me is why in every decision, the greatest benefactor has to be the govt<br>G: It is not you are not interested, it is because you are incapable, and stop arguing like a spoilt child, that is very childish!!<br><br></blockquote></div>

Tourists in Singapore, will only spend money at Marina Bay Sands and RWS </strong><br><br>SL : is the whole idea of marina sands to earn money from tourists buying satay?<br>G : No, their main income will be coming from the MICE, gaming, F&amp;B and hotel. But what is your point of asking about satay? Confused?<br>SL : of the items you listed, MICE, F&amp;B and hotel are the same whether or not we have a casino. so those components don't change whether or not we have a casino. hence, the only item left - gaming is the only reason for the casino.<br>G : They canÂ’t be the same because without a casino license, no companies will be willing to invest more than $5b in this IR project.<br>SL : if a place is attractive in and of itself for MICE activities, then whether or not we build a $5 billion casino won't change that. hence the purpose of the casino cannot be anything other than gambling dollars.<br>G : The amount of investment one is willing to invest in the MICE, Hotels and F&amp;B outlet is very dependent on the risk level of the project and the reason why LV Sand and Genting is willing to take such a risk is because of the casino license. Hence it is wrong to say that with or without the casino license Sheldon Adelson will still go ahead with the investment.<br><br><strong>9) Countries like Malaysia and Shanghai are losing money hosting F1 </strong><br><br>SL : taiwan and hong kong businessmen making money in china doesn't mean we would make money too.<br>G : I donÂ’t see a logic is what you are trying to say. The question should be, are you sure they are losing money? Or is atobe trying to distort information?<br>SL : i understand, you have proven to be most stupid that's your question. my take is this: if we can screw up in china when our competitors, taiwan and hong kong can fluorish there, there's no reason to say that malaysia and shanghai make money means we're sure to make money<br>G : Calling people stupid doesnÂ’t make you smart. And the question here is IS Malaysia and Shanghai losing money hosting F1? And based on your argument, are you suggesting that Singapore should not attempt to do anything unless it has never been done before? Like we should not have SIA because Malaysia already has their own airline? We shouldnÂ’t have universal studio in Singapore because they already have that in Japan and America?<br>SL : it may not, but it at least explains why you cannot see logic. the fact that they are making money doesn't guarantee that we will make money. if i'm not mistaken, official calculations record losses. no. i am saying that if my neighbour becomes rich selling chicken rice doesn't mean i will get rich selling chicken rice. that's all. since i'm not saying what you say i am saying, i cannot be saying this rubbish that you just spewed.<br><br>ladies and gentlemen, here is as yet another attempt by him to twist and misrepresent my words. a perpetual liar, i cannot trust what he claims is said by others. so unless he quotes the exact words used by others, he is lying and defaming the rest.<br><br>G : You are very mistaken and I am not even surprise. Honestly I donÂ’t see what exactly are you driving at when you are trying to question the viability of Singapore hosting F1. IMO you are very childish.<br><br><strong>10) there were multiple PM Badawi visits to Singapore before and after the Sentosa IR announcement. </strong><br><br>SL : PM Lee made a personal visit to PM Thatsin just before the signing of the Shincorp deal.<br>G : PM Lee visit to Thailand as got nothing to do with PM BadawiÂ’s visit to Singapore. Obviously you are not aware of what we are talking about, because you should ask yourself this question, (Did PM Badawi visited Singapore in 2006?) before jumping into conclusion that he did. (Example of blind leading the blind??)<br>SL : PM Lee's meeting with Thaksin immediately before the Shin Corp deal is a good example of the possibility of state involvement in the Shin Corp fiasco.<br>G : I only need you to comment if the is indeed a PM Badawi visit to Singapore to influence Singapore government to award the Sentosa IR deal to Genting. (nothing to do with our minister visiting the world)<br>SL : i need you to show me the exact statement that suggests this and not some concoction of yours.<br>G : You have already asked this once, donÂ’t have to repeat because you will embarrass atobe twice.<br><br><strong>12) Chinese cant afford to attend F1 race in Shanghai </strong><br><br>SL : so?<br>G : Your question should not be so, it should be are you sure they canÂ’t afford?<br>SL : my question is still - so? so what if they can or cannot afford?<br>G : If they can afford, the F1 project will make sense, if they cant it wont.<br>SL : jumping to conclusions. the fact that F1 makes money in Shanghai suggests that it may make money in singapore. but it doesn't guarantee that it would or that F1 will work. Ong Beng Seng said so himself, it's his deep personal interest.<br>furthermore being able to afford doesn't imply willingness to pay. also, the shanghai population is so much larger than ours.<br>G : There are statistic to support that the host nation or city will reap in about S$100 to 150m of tourism revenue during the F1 weekend, and that is excluding the ticket sales. I think you should just leave the marketing responsibility to OBS and this team.<br><br><strong>13) Malaysians earning in Ringgit cannot afford to attend F1 race in Malaysia </strong><br><br>SL : and?<br>G : Same as question (12)<br>SL : then why you post twice?<br>G : Because Chinese from China is different from Malaysian in Malaysia.<br>SL : if they illustrate the same thing and your response is also the same, why not group them together instead of posting separately?<br>G : childish!!<br><br><strong>14) Cost of Shanghai F1 facility, US$3,000,000,000 ($3b) </strong><br><br>SL : back up your figures<br>G : Ask Atobe or maybe M13, thatÂ’s their claim.<br>SL : i quote what you wrote "14) Cost of Shanghai F1 facility, US$3,000,000,000 ($3b)"<br>so it is your claim, back it up if you have the balls. you may ask atobe for help<br>G : I am just quoting what Atobe said. You should stop asking me, send him a PM as ask him.<br>SL : no, you're the only person here capable of misrepresenting the words of others. show me those are his exact words and not twisted by you.<br>G : Atobe : Considering that the China Formula ONE organiser has a contract with Formula ONE to host the series from 2004 to 2010, and that they have spent about US$3 Billion to build the Formula ONE facilities, and US$20 Million annually to maintain it, and with the gate receipts for 150,000 tickets bringing a revenue of US$36 Million from the 2004 race - it will be brilliant mathematics to find this event to produce any net gain for the Organiser, and China.<br>http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=252941&amp;page=9<br><br><strong>15) Only Singapore Straits Times cover PM Badawi's visit to Singapore in 2006 </strong><br><br>SL : but straits times is the main newspaper in singapore isn't it?<br>G : Do you have reasons to believe that such high profile news will only be covered by 3 media companies and that you cant find news coverage of his visit from internet and our government website?<br>SL : doesn't change the fact that the main source of news for the masses would come from govt controlled news media<br>G : Obviously you are still not aware that there is no such visiting in the first place and that Atobe is just making up story to defame Singapore government,<br>SL : you have a reputation of misrepresenting the statements of fellow forummers. show me the exact statement made by atobe.<br>G : This is the 3rd time you are asking me the same question.<br><br></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>PROPOSED OVERHAUL AND UPGRADING OF CURRENT CONSTITUTION<br><br>The current constitution (Singapore) is too vague and general without definitions of rights and privileges of citizens of clear divisions of duties and responsibilities between component branches of government.<br><br>Hence in its present form the constitution is vulnerable to abuse or tweaking of its provisions to suit the narrow interests of the party in power for the time being.<br><br>The rights of citizens and the election processes are clearly being jeopardized or trampled upon to suit the pragmatic policies of the government of the day.<br><br>In the hand of rogue government, it can be worse as the constitution could be ignored or tweaked to suit the narrow interests of the political parties in power.<br><br>It is therefore critical to revise the constitution to prevent abuse or tweaking by any political party in power as follows:-<br><br>(1) To safeguard the freedom of citizens to elect any candidate of their choice based on the universal One Man One Vote principle so that no individual who wishes to stand for election will not be hindered from doing so by being subjected to any pre-conditions like the need to group himself or herself with some other candidates in any block or group of constituencies or raising of election deposit to jeopardize his chance of standing for election.<br><br>(2) To provide a more suitable alternative of ensuring equitable representation of minority racial candidates by providing for 20% of seats of parliaments to be reserved for contest among minority racial candidates.<br><br>(3) To prohibit use of block- or group-representation voting system to avoid shackling of the one-man-one-vote universal electoral system.<br><br>(4) To safeguard the Basic rights of all citizens irrespective of race, culture, religion or tenets so that citizens will be guaranteed by the state of freedoms of speech, political beliefs, right to stand for election without any impediments of any forms or being sued for civil libel for utterances made about policies or practices of government in power in the course of electioneering.<br><br>(5) To refer all situations of conflicts of interests e.g. appointments of judiciary, approval or recommendations of salaries or bonuses or retirements schemes for ministers and MPs of government executives, legislature, judiary and civil service to an independent panel with representations from a cross section of people so as to establish primary Rule of law, justice, fairness and equity for nation building.<br><br>(6) To Establish a low-cost independent panel open to observers from UN agencies to oversee election process and political participation by citizens.<br><br>(7) To Establish powers and procedures for Investigation and adjudication by an idependent sub-court of reported conflict of interests<br><br>(9) To fundamentally safeguard choice and association as conditions essential to encourage further growth of social, cultural and economic vibrancy, entrepreneurship and creativity of citizens.<br><br>The constitution should be the central document of nationhood to nurture the growth of social, cultural and economic vibrancy of the citizens to bring about a more more competitive, entrepreneurial and united country.<br><br>Singapore will then grow further as a nation with entrepreneurship and creativity accountability and transparency in the governing of the country irrespective of belief, cult, race, religion or political views or inclinations.</div>
