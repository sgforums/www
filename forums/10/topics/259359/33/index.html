            <div class='col-md body'>Hey ppl,<br><br>it appears the mods are not giving (informed) comments here, so i think I shall make a few comments:-<br><br>1) People like the starter of this thread should refrain from using such strong terms as "defame", especially since they are bound to incite strong and unconstructive comments. It is rather ironic that the starter of this thread and his/her supporters later castigate the anti-PAP camp for being blind or being too emotional. Calling somebody defamatory does not solve any problems or misunderstandings; it just adds to the hostility and breaks the harmony in this forum. And interestingly, why is there ever a need to defend somebody's reputation? Will not the person's actions and words and treatment of others be testament enough? Which is why - on an interesting side-note - I have always found the intent of a libel/slander/defamation law to be quite sinister.<br><br>2) Gazelle and Company, you all <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">do not</span></strong> contribute to the quality of information in this thread. By making baseless accusations like "opposition destablilise the government", Gazelle is merely attracting flaming. If you support a policy, do your homework, and come up with reasonable statements, rather than evasive quips like "they are just doing their job" or quoting trite propaganda statements that will just get the anti-Camp infuriated. That way, the Anti-camp will have less reason to get angry. Many of them are genuinely frustrated, but I don't think they will turn away properly-provided explanations. These might ease the tension too. THe problem is that you ppl on the Pro-Camp seem to repeat the smae point over and over, even when it has been rebutted on several occasions. After which, you rub salt in the wound by telling the anti-Camp ppl to do their own homework, when soemtimes you haven't done yours too.<br><br>3) As for the anti-camp, mind your manners too, will you? (human), creating most interesting equations do not improve the quality of your posts. ceecookie, heaping nicknames on the PAP simply attracts the people-who-think-they-are-so-objective, and invites a flaming war. Rock^Star, you do have reasonable criticism, but the quality of some of your posts might be improved if you stop swearing. Same goes for others like foomwee88. Rane, stop taunting others with childish implements like "meow, meow, what sort of cat are you?" ShutterBug, express your views, but tone down your language, or you will tend to incite more of Gazzellian Pro-Establishment rhetoric. And please all of you, beware that you ppl do not get sucked into an SDP propaganda trap. I believe all of us do want to do your bit to improve our country, but we need to take a more tempered approach and do our research, so that pro-estab junkies will have less ammo to throw at us.<br><br>I don't think I have time to comment on posts beyond the first 7 pages, but just my 2 cents' worth (I'm sure there are more where all these came from.<br><br>Regards,<br>the pikamaster (who is really sick of useless arguments in this forum)</div>

HIDDING SOMEWHERE?<br><br><strong>5) Rich people attracted to singapore is comparable to Singaporeans going to JB to buy cheap grocery and food. </strong><br><br>SL : rich people coming to singapore to stay will inflate housing prices here. at least singaporeans going to JB to buy groceries won't stay in JB and cause property price jump.<br>G : Yup it is different, but in my opinion, you argument is misguided by your interest that property prices in Singapore should remain flat or inline with your personal income growth.<br>SL :  if the argument is right, it is right. the need to keep property prices in check is not a misguided interest but an impt economic variable that any govt smart enough would come to realize<br>G : Could you tell us which smart government in this world is doing what you claim should be done??<br><br><strong>6) Mcdonald market strategy is to get kids addicted to their burger and fries and they will eat till they die. </strong><br><br>SL : what are you trying to imply?<br>G : Ask Atobe (his claim is that McdonaldÂ’s food are addictive and you will eat till you die)<br>SL : i can't find that in his postings. are you defaming him?<br>G : Really?

But what is your point of asking about satay? Confused?<br>SL : of the items you listed, MICE, F&amp;B and hotel are the same whether or not we have a casino. so those components don't change whether or not we have a casino. hence, the only item left - gaming is the only reason for the casino.<br>G : They canÂ’t be the same because without a casino license, no companies will be willing to invest more than $5b in this IR project.<br><br><strong>9) Countries like Malaysia and Shanghai are losing money hosting F1 </strong><br><br>SL : taiwan and hong kong businessmen making money in china doesn't mean we would make money too.<br>G : I donÂ’t see a logic is what you are trying to say.
