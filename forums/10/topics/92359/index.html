            <div class='col-md body'>We should adopt Australia's system of selecting foreigners for employment.Their entry is given priority based on a existing job offer.And they have stringent rules which outline that only if an Australian citizen cannot be found for this aprticular, then and only then are you allowd to employ a foreigner.This foreigner , before entry , if he wants to achieve PR status, has to undergo a eligibility test based on many different criteria, e.g education, qualifications, relatives, skills, language spoken etc..Their entry requirements are openly displayed under their Immrigation Agency's website.It's interesting to note that our immigration system does not do much to filter out the trash and instead of really genuine talent, much of our immigrants do work which you and I can do.Immigration for the mere sake of population is a short-term measure and it does not mean that a larger population will make the economy stronger, especially if there are five competitors for one single job.The other four will suffer from over abundance of the same skills and are not matched for any other job.Re-training these four will introduce another time-lag element which taxes our already dead economy, because the majority of the other sectors are definitely not growing.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>"Ever felt like "eh, wait a minute. Did i take a plane and am i in china now?"<br><br>Looking around me, there are so many China compatriots. Is it really necessary? Look at our jobs that they've taken. I went for a sales engineer job interview and had a long chat with me, and shared this wisdom: these foreigners (mostly China-chinese and India-indians) are almost always getting the jobs from the locals, especially in technical jobs because they have lower salary expectations, they (may be) more skilled technically, and they can't communicate so effectively with the rest of the populations (singaporeans).<br><br>Tell me your view, is it necessary to import talents by the masses?
