              <p>The frustrated pent up impotence is slowly emerging to reveal the true colors of the infamous resident "zwei-siao-pseudo-Bavarian-Hog" in this Speaker's Corner.</p>
              <p>Clearly, it is lacking in any style with its boorish behaviour that is so typical of its true nature as a "zwei-siao-Hog" - and with its disturbing hang-up as a pseudo-Bavarian.</p>
              <p>In truth, it is no more then a Turd from a Turd World Country of Turdistan that has a permanent fixation with anything from the bottom side of the World - from a piece of fecal matters and dickies.</p>
              <p>It is not a surprise for its "zwei-siao" fixation with the much maligned CSJ's little dickie - that despite the "little-ness" the "zwei-siao-Hog" cannot even keep in its greedy mouth, and continue to fail with its attempts to tackle the offer from dirty old Harry and his sidekick Tommy.</p>

              <p><br>The pathetic sufferings of a "zwei-siao-HOG" with its "men-o-pause" can only be in a more advanced state then earlier seen.</p>
              <p>With its deluded and confused state of not knowing who had made "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">the infamous Sinkapore remark</span></em>" - it will not be a blunder for the "zwei-siao-HOG" to shoot its pop gun uselessly in every direction and hoping to hit a target - with one specially placed at the tip of its nose that it will probably not see.</p>
              <p>Is caring for Singapore all about being indignant to "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">the infamous Sinkapore remark</span></em>" that it does not even know who the author can be ?</p>
              <p>It is pathetic that it will get agitated over a simple remark, but will persecute the PAP agenda to kill off CSJ by tormenting CSJ's dickie in a "zwei-siao" fascinating display of personal infatuation by the "zwei-siao-HOG".</p>
              <p>How else could the "zwei-siao-HOG" know that CSJ possess a little dickie, unless it had the opportunity to have taken a bite out of spite towards CSJ ?</p>
              <p>What possibly could CSJ have done to incur such scorn from a "zwei-siao-HOG" that takes on such a personal edge of misguided childish vengeance - which come close to pathological execration ?</p>
              <p>From all the unsophisticated, boorishly crude, vulgar profanities and expletives that form the base vocabulary of a "zwei-siao-HOG" - to express its deepest and darkest emotions towards anyone who will dare cross its path - the remaining conclusion can be that the "zwei-siao-HOG" is what nature makes it to be "zwei-siao" as its true origin being a Turdish Citizen from Turdistan, a Turd World Country.</p>

              <p><br>Why will a Taiwanese 'hum' concern itself with what a "zwei-siao-HOG" will be and call it to "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">Diam diam lah</span></em>" ?</p>
              <p>Why will the "hum" want to sabotage the "zwei-siao" efforts of the "zwei-siao-HOG" - as it is only suffering from a symptomatic "men-o-pausal" delusion ?</p>
              <p>Will the "zwei-siao-HOG" take away too much attention from the Taiwanese 'hum' and compete for the title as an "Attention Seeking Whore" ?</p>

              <p>If you do not know about the <a rel="nofollow" href="/forums/10/topics/384696?page=2">‘<strong>inside story’</strong> </a>in the other thread - <a rel="nofollow" href="/forums/10/topics/384696?page=2"><strong>‘Govt failed to create wealth for the GEN Y ?</strong>’ </a>- then it is better for you to keep control of your clitoris from being damaged,as you let it wagged loose as you have done to your tongue. </p>
              <p>The "zwei-siao-HOG" has only "<em><span style="color: #888888;">genuine care for the common people</span></em>" that it can dominate with its anger, aggression, dominance, delusion, and impotence.</p>
              <p>Are you afraid that the "zwei-siao-HOG" will compete with a hum for the same <a rel="nofollow" href="http://blog.jarofjuice.com/2008/03/attention-seeking-syndrome-the-early-experiences/"><strong>‘A.S.S.’ </strong> </a>that forms its "zwei-siao" nature ?</p>

              <p><br>With you having your period flowing your verbiage every day, it is obvious that you are not aware of how "swei-siao" it can be for business.</p>
              <p>If only you can appreciate and service the rich towkay more carefully to introduce the towkay to your flesh trade, you would not have been looking to "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">post for fun</span></em>".</p>
              <p>With your kind of attitude, it is not a surprise that "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">collecting rooms rental more very boring</span></em>" - as you will condemn a game of Monopoly that only dates back to the 1904, instead of benefitting from it to manage your assets to get more rentals from a better managed flesh trade.</p>
              <p>Obviously all the big talk about BA and ER from Ngee Ann and SIM is nothing more then to draw attention to your ways as an "Attention Seeking Whore".</p>

              <p>Is it not obvious that the Taiwanese 'hum' will insist on "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">what have really changed, nothing, nothing at all</span></em>" ?</p>
              <p>Why does it not ask itself - WHY has nothing changed ?</p>
              <p>Is it not due the fact that the Taiwanese 'hum' has contributed nothing except its flippant remarks of irrelevant and irrerevant statements that are no more then gossips and mischevious controverial taunts - designed to satisfy its orgasmic needs of an "Attention Seeking Whore" ?</p>
