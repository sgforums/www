              <p>The PAPA will face a uphill task trying to control this new breed of singaporeans. This new breed, can be best described as meticulous, cunning, technology aware, dissecting and worst of all impatient. They dont hesitate to  to turn each sin against the sinner.</p>
              <p>They dont   believe these things the govt say.. I think they want to believe them, . And they want the govt  to agree with them, and they  say, "Yeah, yeah, yeah. You're right. It's all fucked up. It's a fucking mess. We should all go live in a fucking log cabin.You're no messiah.You do the talking. Put that silver tongue of yours to work. You're a movie of the week. You're a fucking t-shirt, at best.You know, we're all going to be really glad when we get rid of you". Their motto is simple; "What sick ridiculous puppets we are / and what gross little stage we dance on / What fun we have dancing and fucking / Not a care in the world / Not knowing that we are nothing / We are not what was intended."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But They won't ever agree. They don't agree . They do not. They can't. If they ever broke the law, they say things like ""The voices made me do it. My dog made me do it. Jodie Foster told me to do it." ect ect. All of these,  Simply because the world has changed and the old ways of governance dont work any more. Welcome to the world of the new singaporeans , who grew up under western influence</p>

              <p>Unlike docile singaporeans, these new citizens are more fiery when it comes to protecting their own interests.</p>

              <p>In fact, I think singaporeans have a lot to learn from them in this aspect. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>There are many ways to "fill the stomachs, and also to dull the minds" - the only problem for him now is that minds are becoming agitated by the pre-occupation with jobs and money to pay for the food that keep getting more expensive.</p>

              <p>I think it was a very big mistake for a peranakan like Lee Kuan Yew to come and lead Singapore and come and destroy chinese culture.</p>
              <p>Why it is that Singapore cannot have a leader from the hokkien dialect group to come lead Singapore?</p>
              <p>Japan, Japanese lead, Malaysia, Malay lead, Indonesia, javanese lead, but why Singapore cannot have hokkien lead?</p>
              <p>Why peranakan lead?</p>
              <p>Why must dialect be go and be suppressed in Singapore?</p>
              <p>This is our country.</p>
              <p>We speak our own language in our own country.</p>
              <p>i told you before leave the prenakans out of this mess and agian i WILL disagree with you on this, firstly look at the policys on that is affecting the country, it is in reverse of what you think..prenakan lead?? at the cost of slowly eroding the entire prenakan here with the large influx of PRCs in spore??</p>
              <p>maybe you have to rethink that part again, the inflow of PRCs and indians will jumpstart the population to their substainable levels but it will further also force local sporeans and the prenakan culture to further dissapate into a even more rarer state. i am a prenakan myself so i know , besides if you look into the pieces of the puzzle, it will look like the prenakan which you claimed will be down to only a few family branches, so what will other prenakans not involved lead to??have you really factor this in?</p>

              <p>i accept your apology however you must see that prenakans not related or involved in the links are also slowly dying, the culture itself is declining, for those you resent  they want to be " like china's own pple", likely abandoning the roots they came from</p>
