              <p>When the money tree has been squeezed &amp; strangulated till all its leaves &amp; branches went dry - something can happen, you know.</p>
              <p>A big dehydrated &amp; emaciated branch of the money tree may in a moment of desperation say to itself: "what the heck!  I am already sucked high &amp; dry &amp; you are still coming to squeeze some more! - ok if that's what you want, u can have the whole big branch of me!".  Immediately it shouted "timber!", the branch fell &amp; fatally crushed the squeeezer to death.</p>

              <p>This is just a clever scheme to justify their increases in stratospheric salaries. It is so much easier for them to make the top 50 private bankers/lawyers/doctors/engineers richer than to make millions of the lower paid workers richer. The ministers would be highly incentivised to give more tax cuts to the rich, access to financing and business opportunities from the govt  to these individuals i.e use the services of these top bankers, lawyers/doctors etc for billion dollar govt projects.. and the Minister's pay increases respectively!! What a wonderful performance metric! For the ministers, all they have to do is use all of Singapore's taxpayers money to enrich the top 50 elites and Voila! they are considered to be doing a fantastic job!! And their annual pay will increase another few million. Redistribution of wealth from the masses to the rich. That's what incentivises the Ministers now.  One wonders how this metric would not encourage corruption or cronyism.  </p>
              <p>What about the other 4,499,900 clueless Singaporeans (assuming there are 50 ministers benchmarked to the top 50 highest earners).They don't even factor in the equation. So what if cleaners earn 2-3k a month.. the ministers don't get a single extra dime. And of course it's so much harder to make 100,000 cleaners to get even a 10 dollar pay rise, so why would our high paying ministers be bothered with raising the incomes of the poorer paid individuals?</p>
              <p>So indirectly it's true that our Ministers are the brightest in this world, they created themselves a job where you get paid millions for such an easy job scope.. But I am not sure whether the average Singaporean will benefit from their intelligence.</p>
