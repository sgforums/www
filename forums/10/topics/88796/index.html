            <div class='col-md body'>He should say something like that to shock everyone:-<br><br>Â“Good evening, fellow citizens. Thank you for your support for the last 14 years.<br><br>Since I am leaving this post soon, I shall speak freely in a way that was never done before since 1965.<br><br>Please bear in mind that I have always speak on the behalf of PAP, to nourish them, to support them in order to keep them in power. But please understand that I do not have a choice - since I am working for them, I cannot possibly reveal those things that shouldnÂ’t be said in the public.<br><br>Please know that there are times then even I myself have disagreed with many of PAP's policies.<br><br>However, this time have had enough to be a seat warmer already and couldnÂ’t care less whether I will be sued or sacked by PAP, for I will be telling the truth - the Whole Truth &amp; nothing but the Truth.<br><br>I HAVE CONFESSION TO MAKE. Here it goes...<br><br>Firstly, We the PAP are wrong and sinful and would like to apologise<br>for oppressing citizens. WE THEREFORE ASK FOR YOUR FORGIVENESS.<br><br>Secondly, We the PAP are totally wrong to fine the citizens indiscriminately for so many years. We have been wrong and sinful to propose countless means just to get money from you.<br><br>FROM COE, RIDICULOUS MAID AND HOUSING LEVIES, TO TRAFFIC FINES, HOUSING CHARGES, ETC. in fact everything comes at a high price for living in S'pore.<br><br>WE SHOULD HAVE TRIED MANY OTHERS WAYS, IMPLEMENTING LAWS TO CURB PROBLEMS, BUT WE ALWAYS TAKE THE EASIEST ROUTE - FINES, CHARGES, LEVIES AND MORE FINES, MAKING PEOPLE 'PAY AND PAY'.<br><br>And I know you all will be laughing at this, but itÂ’s the truth.<br><br>Although all of you have a bread to eat, we have been forcing it down your throats; its BITTER bread that is terrible to swallow.<br>I fully understand that. WE THEREBY ASKED FOR YOUR FORGIVENESS.<br>...........<br><br>THE MONEY THAT HAS BEEN TAKEN FROM ALL OF YOU IS A HUGE SUM INDEED, AND HAS MADE OUR GOVERNMENT VERY RICH TO ACCUMULATE FUNDS UP TO US$100 BILLION (SG$160 BILLION) IN OUR GIC, CHAIRED BY LKY.<br>http://www.gic.com.sg/index.htm<br><br>I COULDNT SLEEP WELL FOR THE PAST 14 YEARS, CONSTANTLY PLAGUED BY NIGHTMARES AND RECURRING DREAMS TO FIND WAYS AND MEANS TO HELP FELLOW SINGPOREANS.<br>FINALLY, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT OF THE SUFFERINGS OF S'POREAN CITIZENS ALL THESE YEARS,<br><br>I THEREBY PROPOSED THAT THE PAP GOVERNMENT MUST RELEASE THE US$100 BILLION FUNDS IMMEDIATELY TO EVERY HOUSEHOLD. I WILL MENTION THE DETAILS LATER. INSTEAD OF GIVING PATHETIC SHARES, WE WILL BE GIVING A HUGE AMOUNT THIS TIME.<br><br>IT SHALL IN FACT CREATE A GREATER BOOST TO THE GDP, BECAUSE THE MONEY WILL CERTAINLY BE SPENT, CREATING MORE JOBS, MORE SALES AND MORE HAPPINESS FOR THE WHOLE COUNTRY.<br><br>THE FUNDS SHALL BE RELEASED IN THE FOLL0WING MANNER:-<br><br>1) SG$200,000 BE RELEASED IMMEDIATELY TO EVERY FAMILY HOUSEHOLD<br>IN THE LOWER AND MIDDLE INCOME GROUP. THRE ARE ABOUT 700,000 HOUSEHOLDS IN THIS GROUP - HENCE IT SHALL ADD UP TO SG$140 BILLION.<br>(SG$ 140,000,000,000)<br><br>2) THOSE IN THE HIGH INCOME GROUP, OF MORE THAN SG$8000 PER FAMILY HOUSEHOLD, SHALL HAVE NOTHING.<br>THEY MUST ALSO CONTRIBUTE $1000 EVERY MONTH FOR 10 YEARS, TO MAKE UP FOR THE SHORT FALL IN BUDGET. THIS ADDS UP TO SG$12 BILLION, WITH ABOUT 100,000 HOUSEHOLDS IN THIS GROUP.<br><br>THE GOVERNMENT WILL THEN USE SG$12 BILLION OUT OF THE REMAINING SG$20 BILLION TO MATCH 'DOLLAR-FOR-DOLLAR' TO KEEP THEIR FUNDS IN GIC. IN THIS WAY, THE HIGH INCOME GROUP SHALL LOSE NOTHING, AND ALSO CONTRIBUTE TO ALLEVIATE THE SUFFERINGS OF THE POORER.<br><br>AS THIS IS NOT A SMALL AMOUNT, MAS AND ERC ARE STILL IRONING OUT THE DETAILS AND WE SHALL INFORM YOU WHEN TO COLLECT THE MONEY IN THE SHORTEST TIME POSSIBLE.<br><br>WITH THIS MIND, HYPOCRITICAL CHARITY EVENTS LIKE NKY PRESIDENT'S CHARITY ON TV ETC SHALL NOT BE NEEDED, FOR THEY CREATE A LAUGHING STOCK AND INDUCE MORE ANGER AMONG THE LOWER AND MIDDLE-INCOME GROUP.<br><br>BEAR IN MIND THAT THIS IS A ONE-TIME RELEASE, HENCE PLEASE SPEND THE MONEY WISELY, FOR E.G. EDUCATION FOR KIDS, SOME SAVINGS FOR RETIREMENT ETC.<br><br>OF COURSE, DO FEEL TO SPEND THE MONEY ON TRAVELS, CARS AND ANYTHING YOU WISH, AS IT IS YOUR MONEY AFTER ALL.<br><br>THIS IS JUST MY SINCEREST WISH AND HOPE FOR THE CITIZENS, FOR I DO NOT WISH TO DIE A TERRIBLE DEATH IN THE FIERY HELLS AFTER THAT.<br><br>AFTER MY DEATH, I AM NOT SURE WHETHER THE INCOMING PM WILL BE ADOPTING THIS BALANCED BUDGET ANYMORE.<br><br>IN CONCLUSION, WE WISH YOU ALL HAPPY NATIONS DAY, SORRY FOR WHAT WE HAVE DONE, MAY YOU ALL FORGIVE US.<br><br>(At the time point of time, LHL went over and slapped GCT across the cheek, calling him insane and senile, then sacked him on the spot and take over the Throne. LKY also collapsed suddenly from heart attack and pronounced dead shortly.<br>Next GCT was arrested BY ISA for felony, a 'communist' and upsetting law and order. BUT UNLIKE LHL, HE YEARNS FOR THE CHANCE TO EXCAPE FROM THE FIERY HELLS WHEN HE DIES)<br><br></div>
