              <p><strong>West bells China and says catch the mice</strong></p>
              <p>By Lau Nai-keung</p>
              <p>First, there was G7, the group of seven industrialized countries.
                  Then came G8. Now the buzz revolves around G2, making it explicit that
                  China has been recognized as a new "superpower". But China is not ready
                  for this new status.</p>
              <p>So what happened to all the brouhaha over G7 (or G8)? The G7 has
                  enjoyed a free princely feast for years, and is thoroughly drunk on its
                  importance. The US has made a mess of itself, forcing many in the West
                  to look for a country that can help fix the problems it has created -
                  but is unable to solve. As for G20 members, most of them are trying to
                  solve their own problems, created by the global economic crisis. The
                  European Union (EU), being a member of G20, would have been the ideal
                  US partner in G2. But it is in no better shape than the US. The same is
                  true of Japan.</p>
              <p>So the global onus seems to have fallen on China, which with its $2
                  trillion foreign reserves and an amazing 8 percent growth despite
                  worldwide recession is seen by many to have the ability to help fill
                  the trillions-dollar <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>black hole created by the West. </strong></span>It's a different
                  matter altogether that China, as a developing country, is itself a
                  victim of the West's economic misdeeds and is desperately trying to
                  solve its own problems.</p>
              <p>But why do the rich nations expect the developing world to help them
                  out of the economic mess? Whenever developing economies have needed
                  help to emerge out of a crisis (mostly created by the rich world), the
                  G7 and the Bretton Woods organizations they run have prescribed bitter
                  pills.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>During the Asian financial crisis, for example, the
                  International Monetary Fund offered the "Washington Consensus" to
                  Southeast Asian economies, which incidentally were victims of Western
                  investment bankers and hedge fund operators' machinations.</strong></span> Since these
                  bankers are at the root of the present crisis, should we prescribe the
                  same medicine for the West: Tighten your belt and monetary policy, and
                  let the economy just shrink and, voila! Before you know, you'll be back
                  in good economic health.</p>
              <p><img id="1409460" style="width: 189px; height: 111px;" src="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/opinion/images/attachement/jpg/site1/20090522/00221917e13e0b8039d034.jpg" border="0" alt="West bells China and says catch the mice" align="right"></p>
              <p>These are not times to experiment, or prescribe the bitter pill for
                  the West, which concocted it in the first place to con the world. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>But
                  one thing is for sure, if the West does not change its extravagant
                  consumption habit and wasteful lifestyle, it cannot emerge out of the
                  crisis without scars.</strong></span></p>
              <p>A crisis of this magnitude can only be resolved with every player
                  playing its role. US President Barack Obama was elected to the Oval
                  Office on the promise of change. But do we see any fundamental change?
              <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> The West has the propensity to continue with its lavish lifestyle,
                  expecting the rest of the world to foot the bill.</strong></span></p>
              <p>American kids are taught in high schools the principle of "no
                  taxation without representation". This is the basic tenet of "freedom
                  and democracy" that the West wants to proselytize us with. It's high
                  time we told the West to please walk its talk, and let responsibility
                  start with rights.</p>
              <p>If the West really wants China to help clear the mess it has
                  created, it has to give the Middle Kingdom more say in matters
                  pertaining to the global economy. But despite all the fancy talk about
                  G2, China is still worse than a junior partner, discriminated against
                  in many fields. Even though China is willing to loosen its purse
                  strings and buy sick enterprises or mines, it cannot because the West
                  won't allow it to. The sauce for the gander in this is not sauce for
                  the goose.</p>
              <p>What the West wants from China is: Pay as told without knowing why
                  and for what. Why? The answer is simple: If the West goes down, China
                  goes down too. China is supposed to play the role of a responsible
                  stakeholder for the US and the G7, whereas in the true spirit of G2, it
                  should be an equal partner.</p>
              <p>There's no denying the fact that if world economy falls apart, China
                  too will go into depression. But it can't be denied either that it will
                  emerge stronger than others from the pit.</p>
              <p>Of course, it's not in China's interest to see the situation
                  deteriorate. It is willing to help too. As a true stakeholder in the
                  global economy, it will try its best to minimize the damage caused by
                  the industrialized West and protect itself and its neighbors, which
                  together constitute about 60 percent of the world population. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>It won't
                  do it to please the West, or to save the West from the perils of its
                  own creation,</strong></span> or to become a "superpower", and that's precisely why it
                  deserves to be treated as an equal partner by the rest of the world.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>China has been playing as important a role as in many international
                  matters, and it will work for a world without domination, a world where
                  every country - large and small, rich and poor - will have a fair
                  chance to develop and prosper.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Not so long ago, China was weak and poor, and its people have not
                  forgotten what the accompanying shame, subjugation and deprivation
                  meant. It will not collude with the US or the G7 and never become a
                  bully on the world stage. Instead, true to what it preaches, it will
                  endeavor to bring peace and development to every nook and cranny of the
                  world.</p>

              <p><strong>Gordon Brown Spills the Beans on the IMF </strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif; font-size: xx-small;">By MICHAEL HUDSON </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Last
                  month the G-20 authorized the International Monetary Fund to increase
                  its loan resources to $1 trillion. It’s not hard to see why. Weakening
                  currencies in the post-Soviet states threaten to raise default rates on
                  foreign-currency mortgages as collapse of the Baltic real estate bubble
                  drags down Swedish banks, while the Hungarian property plunge threatens
                  Austrian banks. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">It seems reasonable to infer that creditor-nation banks
                  hope to be bailed out. The IMF is expected to lend the Baltic, central
                  European and other debtor-country governments money to pay them. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>These
                  hapless debtor economies are then to follow IMF “conditionalities” to
                  squeeze enough money out of their populations to pay foreign creditors
                  – and repay the Fund by imposing yet more onerous taxes on their labor
                  and industry, making them even more high-cost and therefore pushing
                  them even further into trade and credit dependency. </strong></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">This is why there
                  have been so many riots recently in Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia and
                  Ukraine, as was the case for so many decades throughout the Latin
                  American countries that introduced the term “IMF riot” to the global
                  vocabulary.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">For
                  fifty years the IMF has organized such payouts to creditor nations.
                  Loans are made to debtor-country governments to “promote exchange-rate
                  and price stability.” In practice this means pouring tens of billions
                  of dollars into currency markets to make bad gambles against raiders. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">This is supposed to avert the beggar-my-neighbor nationalism and
                  financial protectionism that aggravated depression in the 1930s.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> But
                  the practical effect of IMF lending is to demand that debtor countries
                  impose onerous IMF “conditionalities” that stifle their domestic
                  markets. This is why the IMF was left with almost no customers until
                  last year’s debt crisis deranged the world’s foreign exchange markets.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">It
                  is supposed to be<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> merely incidental that the largest IMF shareholders,
                  the United States and Britain, happen to be the major creditor nations
                  and their banks the main beneficiaries of IMF loans.</strong></span> But in a
                  Parliamentary question-and-answer session on May 6, Britain’s Prime
                  Minister <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Gordon Brown spilled the beans. </strong></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Under pressure for his
                  notorious “light-touch regulation” as Chancellor of the Exchequer
                  (1997-2007), <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>he undid half a century of rhetorical pretense by announcing
                  that he was pressuring the IMF to bail out Britain in its nasty dispute
                  with the Icelandic owners of a British bank that went under.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"> He was in
                  a position to know the nitty-gritty of who owed what and which nation’s
                  monetary authorities were responsible for which banks. So when he said
                  that he was strong-arming the IMF and other organizations to force
                  Iceland’s government to pay for his own government’s mistakes, he must
                  have known this was breaking the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>unwritten law of pretending that the
                  IMF is <em>not</em> the servant of creditor nations</strong></span> in bilateral disputes with smaller economies...</span></p>

              <p><strong>How the IMF Props Up the Bankrupt Dollar System</strong></p>
              <p><br><br>One of the crucial pillars of support for today's Dollar System is Washington's control of the International Monetary Fund, the IMF. The way this actually works is carefully disguised, behind a facade of technocrats and economic theory of free market ideology.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>In reality, the IMF is a modern era collection agency for the Dollar Empire. It collects its tribute</strong></span>, through major international banks, who use the dollars to further extend the power of American financial and corporate hegemony, in effect the driving motor of what is globalization...<br><br>...Globalization is a word used today, often without precision. If we use the word globalization to refer to the entire process of IMF and WTO-led neo-colonialism under the Dollar System, then it is a descriptive term.<br><br>It describes the creation of a global dollar imperium, a Pax Americana. Establishment critics of the IMF system such as Joseph Stiglitz, himself a former Clinton adviser and World Bank official, make accurate charges against the IMF. They assume, however, that it is merely misguided policy that leads to the problems.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The entire IMF institution, along with the World Bank and WTO, however, have been deliberately developed </strong></span>to advance this globalization of the Dollar System, the second pillar of Pax Americana after the military power.<br><br>It is <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>no mistaken policy, no result of bureaucratic blunders.</strong></span><br><br>That is the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>crucial point to be understood.</strong></span><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The IMF exists to support the Dollar System.</strong></span></p>
