            <div class='col-md body'>I believe that singapore, with its policy on practicality, may have brought about economic sucess but also resulted in a huge social cost.Its not so much so that singapore actually sacrificies its culture and society, but fails to put enough attention into it as compared to our economy.<br><br>I wanna hear your views on this.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>singapore's economy isn't successful either. we don't have anything to support our economy. our economy depends on foreign investments to survive. without foreign investments singapore's economy might as well collapse. lets take asian economies for example. south korea has samsung, LG, kia, hyundai. japan has sony, toshiba, toyota, nissan, mitsubishi, pioneer. what does singapore have? creative tech? gosh thats really insignificant. yes its listed on nasdaq or whatever but without creative, the world wouldn't be any different. without .. lets say... toyota? now that'll make a lotta difference cause millions worldwide would be without an affordable car. toyota look around the roads everywhere in the world. you are bound to see at least 1 toyota for every 4 cars. creative? bleh... i would say that singapore has failed miserably. both socially and economically. we have failed to set up a self sustainable economy and we lack money to take good care of our people.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Success comes from people. Without total people commitments, the system is unsustenable.<br><br>So look at how Singapore was governed. Is it managed by the people according to people's wishes. Is the system listening to the people and implementing people's wishes at best a system can based principle of accountability and transparency.<br><br>So if the starting point is people, it would be sustenable. If the starting point is the self or party, it will not be sustenable.<br><br>So, because there is no nexus with the people except for self-justification and packaging, it will:<br><br>(1) either have to sustain itself by putting up an appearance of good governance with cooperation of the controlled press;<br><br>(2) or require regular transfusions of energy, vitamin (M) or blood (new) to keep it from failing.<br><br>Like any self-centred organisim, it will die of natural death as the nucleus ages. Can anyone expect the nucleus to clone itself?<br><br>A system premised on "we", "I" or "we know best" will have to keep calling on youths or new bloods as it cannot sustain itself based on mass support and participation.<br><br>Look around. Are great nations so obsessed self like "I", "We" are basically unproven and presumptuous of the minds of some men. What if the minds are not working or turning senile?<br><br>How are accountable and transparent systems like the Swiss or Finnists coping? Do they have to worry who will succeed whom or else everything will really be  falling apart? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>but what im more concerned is with the fact that our society isnt really advancing in any way,in fact, it is degrading to a point where there are cases of parents sueing their children for not taking care of them,where maids abuses cases are on the rise and where most singaporeans lack the courage to take action.<br><br>more importantly,almost all of our local intellectuals have fled the country seeking better job oppoturnities and foreign talent isnt really flooding the country,its more like foreign mainstream job competition.We arent exactly getting what we need* for the advancement of society and what left is being drained away.<br><br>as quoted frm obviousman quote of an indian sociologist: "Yes, Singapore will get all the white trash it wants. Yes, it will get all the brown trash it wants. Anything's better than living in villages without electricity. But it's going to have problems getting the brown sahibs it needs."<br><br>if it goes on like this i wouldnt be surprised if singapore deindustralises<br><br>*im referring to positions like sociologist,scientists,etc,not jobs like clerks,umm u know...those office positons and jobs like that*<br><br>if i have offened any1 in anyway,i apologise in advance.<br></div>

I cannot even buy a house if I stayed in Singapore to work.  Oh wait , my current australian apartment which costs the same as the HDB 4 room flat is freehold , NOT A 99 YEAR LEASE.<br><br>How about healthcare? Healthcare in australia is next to nothing since they run it on a welfare system. Public health care is comparable to Singapore yet their citizens pay almost nothing. In Singapore, you pay as you use, you also pay as your parents use. And let me remind you - subsidised beds are now given according to income earnt, your social status of  family support doesn't get factored in ( even if you have  3 very sick children - that still doesn't count).<br><br>[quote] <strong><br><br>Within our social constraints, it is up to each individual to carve for himself or herself the kind of life they want to live.<br><br>There are social constraints, but much less than before.
