As a result some Muslim theologians, at a time when Islam still had an organic theology, issued "fatwas" against any depiction of the Godhead.<strong> That position was further buttressed by the fact that <span style="color: blue;">Islam acknowledges the Jewish Ten Commandments--which include a ban on depicting God--as part of its heritage.</span></strong> The issue has never been decided one way or another, and <strong><span style="color: blue;">the claim that a ban on images is "an absolute principle of Islam" is purely political</span></strong>. Islam has only one absolute principle: the Oneness of God.<br><br><strong><span style="color: blue;">The claim that the ban on depicting Muhammad and other prophets is an absolute principle of Islam is also refuted by history.
