              <p><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Foreign worker enclaves mushroom in Singapore</strong></span><br> <br> SINGAPORE, Singapore (AFP) — More than 20 percent of Singapore's 4.8
              million residents are foreigners, many from less-developed Asian
              countries, and it shows. On weekends and holidays, malls teeming with
              foreign workers add an extra dimension to Singapore's claim of being a
              multi-racial state.<br> <br> For foreign workers like P. Baskaran, <span style="color: red;">the sprawling recreation centre set up by the Singapore Contractors' Association is a home away from home.</span> <br> On his days off, the Indian air-conditioning technician visits the
              complex to play cricket, buy cheap groceries and share a few beers with
              friends.<br> <br> "This centre is very good, it has everything I need," said Baskaran,
              flashing a toothy smile as he gestured in the direction of the
              four-hectare (10-acre) complex located in an industrial suburb.<br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>With a supermarket, clinic, remittance services
              and a cinema, the centre was built for foreign workers who help power
              Singapore's labour-short economy.</strong></span><br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>The centre has become a second "Little India" to
              workers from South Asia in addition to their original enclave along
              Serangoon Road,</strong></span> a 90-minute bus ride away.<br> <br> While more affluent expatriate families live in upmarket areas, workers
              like Baskaran are often housed in far-flung, cramped dormitories, and
              congregate in their thousands at favourite locations to relax on their
              days off.<br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>Lucky Plaza, a run-down shopping mall along swank
              Orchard Road, is where Filipinos gather to eat fried pork, drink San
              Miguel beer and send money home.</strong></span><br> <br> "This is the centre of the Philippines in Singapore, this is the place
              where we all come to," Imelda Rico, 43, who been a maid in Singapore
              for 15 years, told AFP.<br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>At Golden Mile Complex, on the other side of the shopping district, is Little Thailand </strong></span>where
              famous Thai singers perform on two television screens in a music shop
              next to the entrance, while the scent of lemongrass and spices fills
              the building.<br> <br> "I like to come here," construction worker Prayun Kalangram said at a
              supermarket where he buys Thai delicacies and other products from home.<br> <br> In yet another part of town, Aung Soe Paing offers solace to nostalgic compatriots at an eatery in <span style="color: red;"><strong>Peninsula Plaza, Singapore's Little Myanmar</strong></span>.<br> <br> Movie stills featuring the history of the country formerly known as
              Burma, as well as pictures of its famous actors, adorn the walls of the
              cosy restaurant managed by the former design student belonging to the
              Shan minority.<br> <br> "<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Every group has their congregation area</strong></span></span>. Peninsula Plaza is our gathering area. We come for the local food, and to hang out," he said.<br> <br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Singaporeans are a minority in the foreign enclaves</strong></span></span>,<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: large;"><strong> highlighting a social divide between guest workers and locals that experts say is unbreachable.</strong></span></span><br> <br> "We need foreign workers, but we don't want them to integrate into
              society," said Gavin Jones, a sociologist at the National University of
              Singapore who has worked on population and development issues in other
              Asian countries.<br> <br> But the foreign crowd is a boon for Singaporean entrepreneurs,
              providing a number of niche markets that many business people are happy
              to exploit for a number of reasons.<br> <br> "Thai people are very friendly, more friendly than Singaporeans, they
              don't bargain with you over a five-cent difference, not like locals,"
              said Jimmy Phua, owner of a mobile phone shop at the Golden Mile
              Complex.<br> <br> Las Tang, a Singaporean saleswoman at a fashion accessory shop in Lucky Plaza, agrees.<br> <br> "The Filipino customers are better than the locals, they're all very friendly," she said.<br> <br> Maids like Rico look forward to spending their one day off a week at
              the mall, which on Sundays looks more like a busy Manila shopping
              centre.<br> <br> "This place reminds us of home," Rico said with a smile<br> <br> ---------------------<br> <span style="color: navy;"><strong>Latest updates at <a href="http://singaporenewsalternative.blogspot.com/">Singapore News Alternative</a></strong>:<br> <br> 1.

              <p>Yxxxone, I don't understand the point of the article and especially your underlined words.  Singaporeans are welcome in all those places.  I never hear of Singaporeans having a hard time in the enclaves.  In Little India you get to have food as good as back in India, Singaporeans love going to Golden Mile for some good Thai food.  In each of those places you get a chance to immerse yourself in another culture. I tell you it's far better than a homogeneous chicken rice nation.</p>
              <p>The word unbreakable implies it's something that needs breaking.  Loaded language at its best.  Divisive, fear-mongering rubbish.</p>

              <p>These "foreign enclaves" have created sub-cultures in the identity of the respective foreign nationals that they served.</p>
              <p>Money is the motivating force in setting up these "foreign enclaves" - and for obvious reasons there are no barriers to Singaporeans in these places.</p>
              <p>The risks posed to Singaporeans are that these will become the future "ghetto" and all associated "activities" that are linked to such an environment.</p>
              <p>At worst, these enclaves witll become socially or commercially "Second Class" districts that adds new stress lines - in terms of public security, property values, health and public hygene standards - and making life more difficult in a densely populated City that is taking on more cosmopolitan flavors.</p>
              <p>It is fine, if these foreign enclaves will contribute their share to the National Budget that provide the necessary infrastructure and supporting services to take care of these "foreign enclaves".</p>
              <p>It will be not so fine if the collected revenues fall below par, when most foreigners will repatriate their monthly earnings back to their respective homelands - with the tabs being taken up by taxes levied onto Singaporeans.</p>

              webben, the gist of the article is that though more and more foreigners are in Sg they are not embraced by the locals. The article substantiates that statement by saying that few locals visit those foreign enclaves. No where does it say that the locals are having a hard time in those enclaves.
              
              The word unbreachable is not divisive or fear-monfering as it merely means that the divide between the guest workers and locals can't be broken down as locals don't socialize with foreign workers.
