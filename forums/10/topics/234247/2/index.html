            <div class='col-md body'>Read what the TS post.<br><br>Read this post.<br><br><a href="http://www.yawningbread.org/apdx_2006/imp-269.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.yawningbread.org/apdx_2006/imp-269.htm</a><br><br><blockquote><br>On August 4 last year , when Jagatheesan Krishnasamy met Gunaprakash N Thuraisamy to collect on a loan, little did he know that Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) officers were watching and waiting to bust Gunaprakash the moment he delivered ecstasy pills to an undercover CNB officer, who had arranged a trap purchase. Following his arrest, Gunaprakash claimed that Jagatheesan had supplied the drugs. Seemingly on the strength of Gunaprakash's word alone, Jagatheesan was arrested -- even though he was not the target of the CNB operation and was never seen with any drugs. So began Jagatheesan's nightmare, which culminated in his being convicted and sentenced to five years' jail and 10 strokes of the cane for drug trafficking.<br><br>On May 26 this year, Jagatheesan's ordeal finally ended when the appeal court quashed his conviction. He was a free man -- but not before having served months of imprisonment and being saddled with debts of tens of thousands of dollars for legal costs. Should Jagatheesan be left to bear the crushing burden of debt from legal costs? Although the High Court, after hearing appeals from the Subordinate Courts, has the power to order the prosecution to pay costs to a person who is acquitted, that power is practically never exercised. The situation is worse in the trial court. The law only allows recovery of costs by a person acquitted after a High Court or District Court trial if the prosecution was "frivolous and vexatious", making the right to costs practically illusory. The provisions relating to Magistrate's Court cases are even more archaic. The maximum amount that can be recovered upon acquittal is $50.<br><br>It is anomalous that the Singapore courts routinely award costs to successful defendants in civil cases, but never to successful defendants in criminal cases. On the other hand, the law does not place any constraints on the power of the courts to award costs to the prosecution on conviction -- no $50 limit or requirement that the defence was "frivolous and vexatious", for example. In some cases, the courts have awarded costs of tens of thousands of dollars to the prosecution upon conviction of the accused person.<br><br>"If the prosecution can get costs on conviction then even more so it is only right that an acquitted person should be entitled to costs. After all, what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander," said leading criminal lawyer Subhas Anandan, who acted for Jagatheesan.<br><br>The position in Singapore contrasts sharply with that in England. The law in England states that if a person is acquitted, the court should normally make an order of costs in his/her favour unless there are positive reasons for not doing so. It would further the cause of criminal justice in Singapore if this approach were adopted here. Currently, many who are charged are reluctant to spend on legal costs to defend themselves when even a win means losing their savings. The outcome of a trial may be uncertain, but that they have to pay their lawyers is for sure. So, knowing that they have no prospect of recovering their legal costs may very well cause innocent persons to plead guilty.<br><br>A person should not have to choose between a wrongful conviction and personal bankruptcy. There is no cogent reason why a person found innocent should have to bear the costs of his defence. The risk that a person can be wrongly charged cannot be altogether eliminated. The question is who should bear that risk. Surely, it is more apt for the state to do so. Since more than 95 per cent of cases end up in convictions, it is only in a handful of case that the state would have to bear such costs. Allowing an acquitted person costs would also signal to the prosecution that putting an innocent person through a trial has cost consequences. This is bound to serve as a healthy check on the prosecution.<br><br>It is high time that the law in Singapore on costs in criminal cases was reviewed. Defence lawyers can take the lead by making more eloquent and forceful applications to the court when appropriate. But, ultimately, legislative changes are called for to make the criminal process more fair to serve us all. After all, the presumption of innocence probably sounds like a hollow promise to a person who walks out of a courtroom with the pyrrhic victory of an acquittal earned at the cost of a mountain of debt and without any compensation for the ordeal he/she has been through.<br><br>The writer is a lawyer. This is his personal comment.<br><br></blockquote></div>

While our official take is "innocent until proven guilty", many times it is not the case.<br><br>One very <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=21334&amp;Cr=singapore&amp;Cr1=" rel="nofollow">recent example</a> is the case of the Nigerian Trafficker.<br><br>[b]Â“It is a fundamental human right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty,Â”  </strong>UN Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions Philip Alston said in a statement, noting that the trial judge ruled that although there was no direct evidence that Iwuchukwu Amara Tochi knew the capsules contained heroin ignorance did not exculpate him.<br><br>Â“The standard accepted by the international community is that capital punishment may be imposed only when the guilt of the person charged is based upon clear and convincing evidence leaving no room for an alternative explanation of the facts,Â” Mr. Alston added.  <strong>Â“Singapore cannot reverse the burden and require a defendant to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he didnÂ’t know that he was carrying drugs.Â” </strong><br><br>Awaiting an apology from you for presuming I'm guilty till proven innocent  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> [/b]</blockquote>Haha.. I will apologise to you though.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br>I'm sorry if my reply came as rather strongly-worded. In all probability, it was.<br><br>However, I do feel that an accused person is innocent until proven guilty. Maybe I'm just being idealistic, but I still think that the prosecution has to prove that there are grounds to believe that the accused is guilty, before we have a case lah. I'm sure you already know my viewpoint, as I have already expressed it with my previous post.<br><br>With regards to the Nigerian drug trafficking case, would you care to elaborate?<br><br>But I still feel that the same principles which I have talked about earlier did come to the fore: The Nigerian man came into Singapore, and he was found to be in the possession of drugs. Eventually, it would turn out that there were indeed grounds to believe that he was the one who brought in the drugs, and it was now up to him to prove that he was indeed not the owner of the drugs. Or at the very least, that he had no knowledge of the drugs.<br><br>The full facts of the case are probably known only by those who were present then I guess. Unless of course, someone here can present to us the facts...<br><br>And you're innocent until proven otherwise lah.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  erm... should I apologize again then?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

Just take a look at the statutes and you can see a whole variety of laws which you can choose to break. However, not all laws attract jail time though. Quite a number, simply warrant a fine. One very common reason why people get jailed for seemingly trivial offences is actually a very simple one: Either they cannot afford to pay the fine, or they choose not to.<br><br>Handcuffs are used to secure a person, lest he run away. Upon being detained, and having sufficient grounds to believe that the person has indeed committed the offence that he has been accused of doing, the person would then have to be handcuffed, simply because one would have to secure him, before bringing him back to station. The reasoning is simple: if he were to escape from legal custody, how? It is the responsibility of the police to ensure that the person arrives back at station.<br><br>Bail is basically used to allow the accused person freedom until the date of his court hearing or any other legal proceeding. They also ensure that the person, upon being released on bail, returns to court/wherever he is required to report to on a future fixed date.<br><br>If the person 'jumps' bail, then the bailor would have to be held responsible for the safety of the accused person. So the use of handcuffs [or sometimes grip restraints] and bail have to be adhered to religiously, of course. Can you imagine if people placed under arrest escape because they were not secured? And you have to remember that many people already take advantage of the bail system by jumping bail. So with regards to the religious adheration of the usage of bail and handcuffs [or grip restraints], I leave it up to you to do the math.<br><br>How do you know how a person is treated under police custody when you are not that person yourself? Simply because, if a person is in police  custody, no one can gain access to that person for he is already at the station.<br><br>I understand that one of your main concerns is that in which, "What if a person has been wrongfully arrested?" I completely understand your viewpoint, simply because plenty of damage has already been done, whether financially, to the reputaion, or otherwise.<br><br>Basically for situations like these, efforts can be made to clear one's name. If indeed a wrongful arrest has been made, it would be a big, big case indeed. The goverment would pay damages to the aggrieved person, and well as make an official apology, things like that [please don't say it hasn't happened before. because it has.] If i this particular case [the drug tip off] , I believe the next course of action would be to take legal action against the security guards, or the company that managed those goons.<br><br>Again, I must stress, if there are no grounds to believe that the person has committed the offence he was accused of doing, he would be released, and no charges filed. The drug tipoff case we earlier discussed is a classic example.<br><br>And lastly, all I can say is this: No legal system is without its flaws. There will always be loopholes for people to exploit, regardless of the country that one finds oneself in.</div>
