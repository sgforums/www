            <div class='col-md body'>I am not sure what to make of this, but I am however sure, this isn't the only case as with most things, there will always be those un-reported ones...<br><br>So is there any 'safety net' in our system that vindicates the poor who is Wrongfully Accused?<br><br>I wonder....<br><br>===================================================<br><strong>Accused of being a drug addict, jobless ex-cleaner borrows heavily for lawsuit to clear his name.</strong><br><span class="large"><strong>He claims: I WAS SHAMED IN PUBLIC  </strong></span><strong>Everyone in mall saw police take me away<br>By Tay Shi'an </strong><br><br>January 28, 2007<br><br>HE was wrongly accused of taking drugs and suffered the shame of being led away by police in a shopping mall filled with people.<br>Mr Chan plans to take his ex-employer to court if there's a settlement. He's prepared to accept two months salary as full and final settlement. -- MOHD ISHAK, TAY SHIAN<br><br>The police apparently cleared him of any wrongdoing.<br><br>But that was not enough for former cleaner Johnny Chan, 49.<br><br>He has borrowed money from relatives and friends for a private prosecution against his alleged accusers.<br><br>His lawyer has also written to his former employer claiming compensation for wrongful dismissal.<br><br>However, the employer denies he was sacked as a result of the arrest.<br><br>Mr Chan's parents have been standing by him and it is his mother who borrowed - from her siblings and friends - most of the $3,000 he has spent so far in legal fees.<br><br>He and his parents had been living on his salary of $1,400 a month before he lost his job 1Ã¢Â€Â¢ years ago.<br><br>He has not had a steady job since then.<br><br>Mr Chan claims he was wrongfully detained by three security guards at a shopping mall in the western part of Singapore in August 2005.<br><br>The guards allegedly said Mr Chan was taking drugs and he was allegedly kept in the security room until the police arrived.<br>Mr Chan has taken money from his mum and dad to fight the case. They also borrowed money from their friends to help him.<br><br>His lawyer, who declined to be named, said Mr Chan was never charged with any drug offences related to the incident. It is believed his drug test following the arrest was negative.<br><br>"I took his case because his relative knows my secretary, who asked me for help," said the lawyer.<br><br>"She also asked if I could accept a lower fee because they are poor. So I've lowered the fees for him, to less than half the usual...<br><br>"To him, it's still a big sum."<br><br>The cost has already exceeded the sum that Mr Chan is seeking to claim from his former employer. But he said the cost is not important.<br><br>"It's very tough, fighting two sets of lawyers. I know the legal fees will pile up," Mr Chan said.<br><br>"But I want to prove my innocence. My friends tell me I have to by all means go after them, and my brothers and sisters agree."<br><br>He has four siblings who are married and living separately.<br><br>Mr Chan, who is single and lives with his retired parents in a three-room flat, said he was sent by his cleaning company to work at a shopping mall as a cleaning supervisor.<br><br>According to court papers, three of the mall's security guards allegedly restrained Mr Chan wrongfully around 10am on 1 Aug 2005, after accusing him of consuming drugs.<br><br>NEWS SPREAD<br><br>Mr Chan still remembers vividly the shame he felt. "When I was taken away by the police, the mall was fully functioning. Everyone saw me, it was so embarrassing," he said.<br><br>He claims that he lost his job shortly after, and has had trouble finding a job since. He said his most recent job was part-timing at a fast-food restaurant.<br><br>He claimed: "The cleaning industry is so small, the news (of the drug case) spread like cancer."<br><br>He tried going to the Legal Aid Bureau, but he was not eligible as he had earned more than $10,000 in the previous 12 months. After he found his current lawyer in September 2005, a magistrate's complaint was lodged against the three security guards.<br><br>Said his lawyer: "The judge directed for an investigation to be done by the police. But a few months later, the police decided not to prosecute the three guards.<br><br>"My client (then) instructed me to commence the private summons."<br><br>At least one of the three guards has hired a lawyer to fight the case.<br><br>Those found guilty of wrongful confinement can be fined up to $1,000 and jailed up to a year.<br><br>The lawyer also wrote to Mr Chan's ex-employer's law firm.<br><br>He said: "My client was prepared to accept two months' salary as full and final settlement. But they only offered two weeks' salary without admission of liability, which was not acceptable to my client."<br><br>The cleaning company's director denied the claim of wrongful dismissal, saying instead that it was Mr Chan who suddenly stopped coming to work.<br><br>Mr Chan, in turn, denies that.<br><br>The lawyer said Mr Chan is planning to file a lawsuit against the ex-employer if there's no settlement.<br><br>He said private summonses usually involve compoundable cases, which usually do not result in jail sentences unless in exceptional cases.<br><br>Said the lawyer: "If found guilty, the defendant is fined by the state, and the money goes to the state. The client doesn't get anything out of it."<br><br>He added that if they get convictions against the three guards, "we will pursue damages for wrongful confinement in a civil suit".<br><br>Mr Chan said that while he's determined to see the case through, he he felt bad taking money from his parents, aged 71 and 68.<br><br>Said Mr Chan: "My mum and dad went around borrowing money from friends. They went all the way out to help me get money to hire a lawyer.<br><br>"I feel so bad, I'm supposed to be the one supporting them, but I'm not even able to return the money to them."<br><br>ILL HEALTH<br><br>Both parents recently had health problems - his mother had cataract surgery on her left eye a month ago, while his father had gastric surgery about six months ago.<br><br>But his mother, Madam Kan Oh Ho, said in Mandarin: "He's my son. He used to give us money when he had a job. Now, if we don't help him, who will?"<br><br></div>

If the police had not acted and a crime results, Singaporeans will rightly blame the police for not doing anything. The innocent will be released after investigation, as this case illustrates.
