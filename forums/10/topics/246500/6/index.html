To attract more talents? Attract more corrupt talents that is... They want a good talents in government, incorporate a desire to serve the country in the education. Incorporate selflessness, not selfishness and motivated by material things. People motivated by money cannot accomplish things, just look at history itself. People who left behind a legacy is motivated by passion. There are simply too many examples for me to list them all down. They are simply not addressing the root of the problem and in fact might create another problem.

I'd be more than happy to reason with you till the cows come home if you want to tackle this issue...<br><br>Granted, taxes are a hell lot higher in all the Scandinavian countries and the UK, but have you the faintest idea the social welfare that exists in such countries?<br><br>The unemployed can walk into the dole office to get a monthly stipence, the sick can get free medical care for life when they seek treatment at public hospitals, the elderly are entitled to a "bus pass" when they turn 65 (they basically get to travel for free on public buses in the UK), civil servants are entitled to pensions, parents are granted extended paid maternal/paternal leave for every newborn, education in public schools are free - these are just some of the social welfare that exists in at least 1 of the 5 countries (namely Finland, Norway, Denmark, Sweden and the UK). All that before considering there's minimum wage to safeguard the rights of the working class from unscrupulous employers and there're more than sufficient avenues(from trade unions to the courts) for workers who think they have been shortchanged to seek redress...<br><br>So tell me, what perks do your taxes generate in Singapore besides going into the private coffers of those who are effectively disconnected from reality?</div>
