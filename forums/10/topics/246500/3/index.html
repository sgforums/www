Their pays are to justify for the tough and inhuman ideas they carry with them. They are being paid to put country before self, (so to say in a noble way) One day, if someone were to be able to justify logically how the sacrificial of 1 Singaporean life could bring in millions of dollars for the country of singapore, then he will be the highest paid minister in the gov, of course risking damnation to his own family for many years to come.

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, he is right when he talked about comparing millions to billions. We have to admit that we have capable ministers and thus we are the riches S.E Asean country. From a village to where we are now, no doubt, i praise the govt ministers work. They deserve high salary or mayb increase in their pay.<br><br>But than again, we have said it many times. If from the start you wanna step into politics and you know prolly you can earn much more elsewhere den dont expect to gain too much in terms of financial from it. For the doctors, go open your own clinic or smt.<br><br>Pay raise for ministers.. Is that issue sooo impt right now? I bet we can bring up more impt issues to discuss . Seems like Lau Lee like to talk on small figures like 10-20 millions compare to billions..<br><br>I suppose now he talked about this pay raise, less than a month he will implement it. We cant do anything but rant , as usual.<br><br>This topic will soon be faded as time pass by..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well some fourmites here talk about the lost of a few billions in investments being nothing to the government but heres a question any idea how much profits GICs create for Singapore annually? Is there any investor in the world who never had any failed investments before? I believe as long as the long term returns r there short term losses must be accepted. Its all part of investment.<br><br>Oh n about LKY's point that the salaries of ministers need to be raised in order to remain competitive, i feel that its reasonable. Well how many people are that noble to put in alot more effort relative to his achievable income. Singapore is small. True we need to attact such noble people to the govt but with a population of 3m how many of such people exist in Singapore ? Theres has also been comments that the civil servants r no longer as motivated and effective as before, perhaps the salary could be attributed to it. Majority of the population who are taking up posts in the govt now or in the future have lived the life of a developed country citizen. Just like you or me. There couldnt be as much leaders as in the past who are fuelled by the desire for country even at the expense of monentary incentives.<br><br>So tell me this cannot, that cannot, so how ?<br>Why not share a more effective solution</div>
