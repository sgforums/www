Is there any investor in the world who never had any failed investments before? I believe as long as the long term returns r there short term losses must be accepted. Its all part of investment.<br><br><span style="color: red;">So you know how much profit is created annually? Do you also know where exactly our GICs invest? Given that any listed company the world over is accountable to her stakeholders, what more a country to her citizens.</span><br><br>Oh n about LKY's point that the salaries of ministers need to be raised in order to remain competitive, i feel that its reasonable. Well how many people are that noble to put in alot more effort relative to his achievable income.<br><br><span style="color: red;">Based on this sentence of yours, it suffices as a sad day for patriotism here in S'pore. Wonder how many more think like you.</span><br><br>Singapore is small. True we need to attact such noble people to the govt but with a population of 3m how many of such people exist in Singapore ? Theres has also been comments that the civil servants r no longer as motivated and effective as before, perhaps the salary could be attributed to it. Majority of the population who are taking up posts in the govt now or in the future have lived the life of a developed country citizen. Just like you or me. There couldnt be as much leaders as in the past who are fuelled by the desire for country even at the expense of monentary incentives.<br><br>So tell me this cannot, that cannot, so how ?<br>Why not share a more effective solution<br><br><span style="color: red;">Money is the only solution to attract talents? Not necessarily. The education system must be revamped. More emphasis on character building and nationalism rather than paper chase. But then again, that's not up to me to say.<br><br>Lastly, money lessens a politician's patriotic desire. Just like how monetary rewards attract donations but corrupt the purity of charity.</span><br></div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Are they TALENTS???<br><br>============================<br>Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong makes the claim that the PAP Government performs so well that he and his ministers must be paid salaries that most Singaporeans find outrageous and unacceptable. Here's some facts and figures on what the PAP does for (some people argue, to) the people.<br><br>7,340 households were not able to pay their utility bills as of Sept 2005. (Channel News Asia, 20 Sep 05)<br><br>31,570 Singaporeans sought financial aid from the government in 2003. This was an increase of 40 percent from 2002 where 22,500 people sought assistance and 120 percent from 2001 (14,300). (Straits Times, 29 Jan 05)<br><br>17,000 families or individuals sought help from Family Service Centres due mainly to retrenchment and debt problems in 2003 - up 32 percent from 2002. (Straits Times, Jan 3, 2005)<br><br>37,823 households could not afford to buy their own flats or rent homes as of the end of 2004. (Straits Times, 29 Jan 05)<br><br>18 divorces take place on average in Singapore every single day in 2003! In 1993 there were only 2,313 divorces, in 2003 there were 6,561 cases - an increase of 180 percent. (http://www.getforme.com/previous2004/240704_statisticsondivorces2003.htm)<br><br>22,540 This is the number of un-discharged bankrupts as of August 2005 (Straits Times, 7 Nov 05)<br><br>150,000 credit cards were in default as of the end of 2003. (Straits Times, 7 Nov 05)<br><br>46 percent. This was the increase in the number of young people below 35 who were issued writs for overdue debt - from 5,019 in 2000 to 7,328 in 2003. (The New Paper, 24 Sep 03)<br><br>21,434 Singaporeans went bankrupt as of 31 December 2004 - the highest in Singapore's history. (Straits Times, 19 Jan 05) 4,190 people were made bankrupt in the first 11 months of 2004 - the highest number in 19 years. (Straits Times, 5 Jan 05)<br><br>1 Singaporean commits suicide everyday on the average. (AFP, 8 Sep 03)<br><br>70 percent of those who commit suicide in Singapore are between 20 and 49 years of age. They kill themselves mainly because of "financial commitments, having stress at work, caring for the elderly and the children at home." (AFP, 8 Sep 03)<br><br>1,692 dollars is the average monthly retirement income an average retired Singaporean will have Â– one of the lowest among 15 countries (including Australia, Canada, USA, Spain, Italy, Hong Kong and Japan) surveyed by AXA Insurance Group. Canada ranked first with $4,216. Yet, Singaporeans contribute the most to savings plans, that is, the CPF. (Today, 25 Feb 05)<br><br>85 percent of elderly Singaporeans feel that their lives would be worse five years down the road. This is up by 14 percent in 2000. (Today, 21 Jun 05)<br><br>54 percent of nearly 3,000 laid-off workers in the first quarter of 2004 were aged 40 and above. Those of you who are younger better think about this: 53 percent of Singapore's workforce will be 40 or older in five years' time. (The Star, 27 Feb 05)<br><br>14,000 children were seen by psychiatrists at the Institute of Mental Health, of which 2,233 were new cases. (Straits Times, Apr 02)<br><br></div>

Yes it's important but it won't be the deciding factor in a person's aptitude to run a country.<br><br>It's true that opposition has been the laughing stock for many years but if you look at the recent election, it's already been improving. Check out WP. I can't say the same for the rest. Opposition is in the state it's in all these years....no thanks to the govt for putting fear into voters, press censorship, limited coverage and continuos ridicule.<br><br>And govt's votes are not mandates. There are so many civil servants out there who are afraid to vote against their "employer". SAF, HDB, EDB, MOE, WDA etc etc.....a lot of our lives are under the govt's scrutiny. Not to mention prospective HDB flat buyers who are afraid of voting against the govt for fear of reprisals.<br><br>Think about it. It's not a mandate, it's a joke to me.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>How about this suggestion? The ministers go live in bungalows or whatever they like. But the places are not given to them such that if they no longer serve as Ministers, they won't get to keep those houses. Of course, some other benefits may apply such as cars.<br><br>So, all these Ministers can live like rich people only while they are still Ministers. And they should be paid the mode income or something for their wage. To feel how most Singaporeeans would feel. Isn't that enough incentive for any true Singaporeans to serve the country? A true countryman will only live for what he needs and care for the lives of his countrymates. I doubt it's not enough. A politician equates to richness?? A country is not a corporation where all is judged by economic performance. There are still standards of living that need to be accountable. Cost of living perhaps? Standard of living anyone?<br><br>If anyone is into politics for the money, go fly kite man! Correct me if I'm wrong. George Washington did not have any formal education. His offered pay was $25,000/year which he refused back then. So, why all these talks about pay rise? $2.7m is not enough?? Maybe the rest are paid less but i'm sure it's much more than what we, me included, the poors, earn.<br><br>Anyway, here's a story of Prophet Muhammad. He lead his own people and preached about the teachings of Islam. But for all of his worth and value back in his time, he slept on a mat and lead a simple life. Was he corrupted?<br><br>Well... It all lies in the heart. To dangle monetary incentives to make these "top grade" ministers stay uncorrupted is an insult to their pride. It's like as if what they earn is too little that they have to resort to bribes to feed their families.<br><br>What have the ministers done these days anyway? If the money is for the people behind the rebuilding of Singapore back in the 1960s, i'm fine with that. Cos they have done so much for us. But for the current batch of ministers, what they did is just to set the timer and ensure that the food in the microwaves doesn't go wrong. How hard can it be when there's instruction manuals everywhere? Advisers and analysts exist everywhere that they can rely upon.<br><br>It's just up to these ministers to think what it's right or wrong for the people. The question is are they thinking with their job at stake or are they thinking with the people heavily in mind? Any idiot can run a country as simple as Singapore. With all the Yes and Yes and Yes. The point is who is the one working harder for the nation. We, the people or them, the ministers? Think about it. They are clever to initiate a pay rise for themselves and we are stupid not to deny them.<br><br>Heh.. Sorry if you find any flaws in here, i've just finished school and am just a kid. but seriously, i'm all for the opposition once they can make some senses. in my opinion, what we have here are political parties with lame pitches. what's with the money dangling before election and upgrading of estates for those in favour? Still dare to ask for pay rise. Stop acting democratic cos what we, the people, gonna say will have no power anyway. The ministers will still get their pay rise no matter what we gonna say. Sorry for the naggy post.</div>
