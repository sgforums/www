            <div class='col-md body'>Somehow i hear a lot of barking, sound of govt DOGS.. i dont really want to make arrogant comments here, but i read so a few rebarbative comments that really stir up my feelings. Some ppl talk abt investment when they don,t know what is market timing. The timing is just not right when the ministers want to raise their pay when they want a GST hike? How do we know the GST will not go to there pay?<br>I also think the pay raise is ridiculous, but the government will still go ahead with the decision  with their power. People have no right to criticise people who whine in forums... that part purpose of the forums to express their views. I personally believe that people who criticise people who complain thinks they themselves are so capable, why dont they be the ones who pay more instead? Pride comes before a fall, it's really laughable why people think they themselves are so great cause there are certain things u cannot control like this situation. Since they are for the pay raise, maybe they are the beneficiaries themselves <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br>If it is true that even great economies like America with even more people=more problems to manage, their government do not get such a high salary, why our country deserve more. 1 million is really more then enough. Furthermore, their government party don't have much competition unlike other countries so they stay in the job and in the position for pretty long.<br>Not that i want to be rude, since some are rude i shall pay them back with their own coin. Some are just students who have not even gone through NS and work and just know how to talk big, most probably propogated by social studies. No use to argue with them. Some are worse, they use economics but have limited knowledge and think they are John Maynard Keynes. Demand and supply only hold under certain assumptions and i don't want to bother going through the whole theory.<br>I came to air my view cause i really despise arrogance and is getting more and more prominent, especially some elites or PRs. I mention the word "some" not "all". Just because they have a good education does not mean they act so good cause there are always people better than them and knowledge is limitless... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br></div>

In other words, what Federer earns isn't assured - he has to win tournaments to earn his keep, unlike others who are assured of a basic keep regardless of their ineptitude...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Back to the comparison he drew with Goldman Sachs. The CEO of Goldman Sachs had USD53million for his bonus in 2006 alone - if his cabinet members, who are effectively "disconnected from reality" (quoting a certain Mr Arsene Wenger) anyway, were that capable, why would they settle for a miserable SGD1.9million per annum(and that's for the top man) and not try their hand at managing one of the top investment banks/financial institutions?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br></div>

In other words, do what they earn commensurate with what they're paid?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> Applying some simple logic, Singapore's politicians are the highest paid(highest by a long mile, in fact) in the world - have you got anything tangible(for a start, Singapore's economy is nowhere close to being the best on this planet whichever yardstick you wish to use to measure economic progress) to back up that kind of pay? Is there another industry in Singapore whose top earners are also the highest paid in the world for that industry? So on what basis are we benchmarking the fascists' pay against?<br><br>More importantly, it really isn't an issue of pure dollars and cents whether it makes a big difference to anyone's life - if that were the case, can I go round extorting 1 cent from every stranger I meet on the basis that 1 cent means nothing?<br><br>At the end of the day, I don't think anyone begrudges what Bill Gates earns as the chairman of Microsoft (for the record, Gates is only paid USD1million per annum in wages) or what Tiger Woods and Roger Federer earn as prize money for the tournaments they win because that's money deserved and it's not an amount they could simply authorise to pay themselves at a whim.

How can you equate a high price with the actual quality of the item?  I.e If I pasted a $1 price tag on a piece of diamond, most people will not have the intelligence to purchase it... only an accomplished jeweler who happen to see the item will know that it is a real diamond and rejoice at such a find.  Thus you have to actually examine the item carefully to determine its real value.  Similarly, talents need to be groomed carefully with the proper values and capabilities.  You do not give anybody heavy responsibility without first testing that persons abilities.  It is always start from small tasks then move on to bigger tasks.<br><br></div>
