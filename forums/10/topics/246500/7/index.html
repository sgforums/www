It's only not good for "a few Singaporeans", those that crave for power and money. Singapore like any good organisation can function without the need for top management for a certain period, till replaced.

The company still functions till new management takes control, management exist to strategized on the future directions of the company.<br><br>Do you think the world will stop spinning if LKY kicks the bucket?

Its all part of investment.<br><br>Oh n about LKY's point that the salaries of ministers need to be raised in order to remain competitive, i feel that its reasonable. Well how many people are that noble to put in alot more effort relative to his achievable income. Singapore is small. True we need to attact such noble people to the govt but with a population of 3m how many of such people exist in Singapore ? Theres has also been comments that the civil servants r no longer as motivated and effective as before, perhaps the salary could be attributed to it. Majority of the population who are taking up posts in the govt now or in the future have lived the life of a developed country citizen. Just like you or me. There couldnt be as much leaders as in the past who are fuelled by the desire for country even at the expense of monentary incentives.<br><br>So tell me this cannot, that cannot, so how ?<br>Why not share a more effective solution</div></blockquote>The profits the GIC created is drained from Singaporeans, not overseas. They overcharge us for transport, electricity, water, mobile phone, etc. I agree that long run returns is more important, but can you justify that such long run returns will occur with Global Crossing &amp; Shin Corp, both major investments in Temasek's portfolio, such long run returns will never occur because Global Crossing is bound to face chapter 7 soon and Shin Corp's fate still hang in the balance. The other overseas investment that they have only made normal profits not supernormal profits, while on the hand we are losing capital from our investments like Global Crossing and Shin Corp.<br><br>Is there any investor in the world who never had any failed investments before? The investor that made 2 major investment blunders will cease to be an investor immediately, because he lost all his capital, no more money to invest. Most end up as superman.</div>

Old folks picking out drink cans from rubbish bin the eke out a living. So what if you are ranked number 1 in business and competition. The quality of life is Singapore is not what I envisage it to be with it's current GDP. Singapore ranks 34 for place to live, work and play!!! Doesn't it tell you something, they might have the best port, airports, but Singaporeans generally have a low quality of life. They charge us so much for basic necessities that we lack the savings to see us thru our old age.</div>
