Is there any investor in the world who never had any failed investments before? I believe as long as the long term returns r there short term losses must be accepted. Its all part of investment.</div></blockquote>Have you heard of Index Fund? Any Fund manager can beat GIC in bringing returns by passive indexing.  Who are you trying to kid? Bring in below market average returns then say losing a few billion is nothing? I am sure Optus is an honest mistake...<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from"></div><div class="quote_body">Oh n about LKY's point that the salaries of ministers need to be raised in order to remain competitive, i feel that its reasonable. Well how many people are that noble to put in alot more effort relative to his achievable income. Singapore is small. True we need to attact such noble people to the govt but with a population of 3m how many of such people exist in Singapore ? Theres has also been comments that the civil servants r no longer as motivated and effective as before, perhaps the salary could be attributed to it. Majority of the population who are taking up posts in the govt now or in the future have lived the life of a developed country citizen. Just like you or me. There couldnt be as much leaders as in the past who are fuelled by the desire for country even at the expense of monentary incentives.<br></div></blockquote>Maybe you could suggest to LKY not to terrorize the opposition, sue them until<br>they are bankrupt, or dig they entire life history, then lots of able men would come and serve.<br><br>Or can dont kick up such a big fuss over a form?<br><br>Maybe also can suggest to him give up the control of the press...<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>What I think is the gvt is simply using the people as atms. They just take and take and take, and while they walk around with fat wallets, use our money instead for their own investments, and they know we can't do a thing about it.<br>The progress package was like dangling a bigger piece of meat in front of semi-hungry lions(no pun intended). Given that the gvt giving back to us is rare, we hope for a little more. Truth is they'll just sit back and grin while they watch us vote.<br>You want change? Then just protest. Don't think their jails can hold all of us. I agree that Singapore is one of the safest places in the world and its commendable, but the only reason why the PAP exercises such control over us is through fear. That's wrong. What I'm only afraid of is when you cage people for so long and the moment they get their chance at getting what they want, it may become chaotic. Just my two cents worth.

Come on, face it. Although our government are more competent than some of our neighbours' and I do admit that boost things up a lot, we do not have as many problems as they do. Our population is small so it's so much easier to control. Our landmass is small so it's easier to govern and build upon. Our small size also means we can reach the peak much faster because we only have this much landmass to concentrate upon while the bigger countries have to build on so landmasses that's more than ten times our size.<br><br>Sometimes not having it good is not due to lack of brains and hardwork. Of course people with high pay won't be complaining. It doesn't affect them too much. Honestly, so what if people in the lower wage segment is feeling sour and jealous? They have a right to. Sometimes they are stuck at that wage segment and have alot of difficulties moving upwards. So what do you expect when the price of everything except for their paychecks are going up? To make matters worse, the ministers are having a payraise when they hardly got one. It does make their lives more difficult because the rich only get richer while the poor gets poorer.<br><br>You show a clear lack of grasp in reality, and seems to be also quite insensitive to the plight of those people in the lower wage segment. You give me the impression that you are either making enough money not to worry, never being poor before, your parents are rich or that you've never worked before. You also sound like a certain someone, you know? I'm surprised you didn't end your post with 'get out of my elite uncaring face'.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

Some of the look like Josh Groban and Justin Timberlake. We should compensate them for providing sex appeal to the civil service. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

Come on, face it. Although our government are more competent than some of our neighbours' and I do admit that boost things up a lot, we do not have as many problems as they do. Our population is small so it's so much easier to control. Our landmass is small so it's easier to govern and build upon. Our small size also means we can reach the peak much faster because we only have this much landmass to concentrate upon while the bigger countries have to build on so landmasses that's more than ten times our size.<br><br>Sometimes not having it good is not due to lack of brains and hardwork. Of course people with high pay won't be complaining. It doesn't affect them too much. Honestly, so what if people in the lower wage segment is feeling sour and jealous? They have a right to. Sometimes they are stuck at that wage segment and have alot of difficulties moving upwards. So what do you expect when the price of everything except for their paychecks are going up? To make matters worse, the ministers are having a payraise when they hardly got one. It does make their lives more difficult because the rich only get richer while the poor gets poorer.<br><br>You show a clear lack of grasp in reality, and seems to be also quite insensitive to the plight of those people in the lower wage segment. You give me the impression that you are either making enough money not to worry, never being poor before, your parents are rich or that you've never worked before. You also sound like a certain someone, you know? I'm surprised you didn't end your post with 'get out of my elite uncaring face'.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> </div></blockquote>i do not come to a well to do family, i am not earning a fat paycheck, in fact i am still studying. i've been in diff jobs since my secondary school days, and know the difficulties of earning money. my parents are the type of pple that ur describing, feeling sour, stuck at that wage having difficulties moving up. but i also recognise that they ain't doing much to improve themselves. yes they work hard, but not smart. i am come to recognise that u dun blame any1 for ur low paycheck but urself for ur lack of competence. whats the point of whining? does it help? y not use ur brains and think of how to make money? there are so many cases of retrenched workers who make it gd after upgrading themselves or starting a biz. no, i did not quote these examples from the newspapers, but i'm refering to my fren's parents. as for the part "get out of my elite uncaring face", i will not use such phrases because it is plain rude, but neither will i sympathise wif those pple who juz sit around all day whining.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
