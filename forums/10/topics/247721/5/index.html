His is a/an international President position unlike our govt in Singapore.  Put these people from ruling party to do the same job as the US President I don't think they can make it.   They are obviously overpaid and still talks so much so desperate to find excuses to support the pay rise.

It's nice to hear your thoughts... now it's time for my other perspective:-<br><br>ok, the sgp govt is one unique entity - sgp inc. - and its citizens are one unique lot and thus it's govt has gathered its roots deep and moulded its peolpe to think the way the govt prefers....<br><br>our govt won't stand for any gossip or stain of repute. but the presidents (most power one, as compared to us, it should be the prime minister most powerful) of many countries are not without blame... therefore if any other officals think they can run our govt, they must think twice....<br><br>i seriously think that our govt people no smoke, no drink, no party, no fling, no girls, no affairs, no gamble, no drugs, no movies, no shopping, no nothing..... and their spouses also the same....<br><br>don't you all just pity them, no lives???<br><br>that's why i said, our govt has such high standards of conduct and they need to be paid to remember to stay high of morals... maybe....<br><br>seriously in our country of complainers, if any of our govt have juicy gossips available publicly, i think our citizens won't accept it. the US? ah well, you can see Mrs Clinton running for president right?? here? well, you tell me.</div>

The skillset of these occupations are completely different, because you have the talent to come out with plans to wipe out dengue fever, will that give you the skill to perform demanding operations on a person's brain?

So they wouldn't even need the high salaries in the first place. However, in Singapore it seems to be the other way round. Civil service and public office become the route to riches.<br><br>Talking about civil service in terms of monetary opportunity costs undermines the intrinsic values of honour and integrity that have underpinned public office since the classical times. Is that the kind of politicians we want to breed? The kind that thinks only in terms of "what is there in it for me?"</div>
