Will not help their family members or friends get out of trouble? Will not give projects to them? Can you ensure that?<br>b]</blockquote>I love this arguement.   Let's pay our politicians an obscene amount of money up front so they don't have to steal it.   Why waste time with concepts like a system of checks and balances to make sure they maintain their moral standing?  Too difficult, just build corrupition into the system.<br><br>Let's use that same logic to rid ourselves of other social problems too.<br><br>We will eradicate shoplifting by making it legal for all Singaporeans to take anything they want from any shop.   Now there is no more shoplifting cause it's legal.<br><br>Give every Singaporean a Honda Civic... now no more car theft.  If in the following years we find there are still cases of car theft, then maybe a Honda isn't enough.   Let's increase it to a BMW, then a Porsche and so forth... cause these are the cars top CEOs drive.<br><br>Even better, lets pay all Singaporeans millions each year... no more crime altogether.<br><br>In my opinion... THESE A**HOLES ARE FREAKIN NUTS!!!  They should all be locked up in padded cells with permanent straitsjackets WELDED on!</div>

I believe most Heads of State in general get perks and other freebies which they may consider unimportant to let the public know about, but which may actually be of some importance to the public.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well i guess its a debatable issue at the end of the day. Competant or not, but face it. There are so many conspiracy theories on what the Bush government is doing. How they have sub companies that they sit on as boards of directors and stuff. Ie Haliburton and such, do you really think politics is the main game for them? I beg to differ, it truly is and has been quite evident the wars on Afgan and Iraq have reaped significant projects for many US industries, these have been somewhat linked to politicians of high standing in the US. Im just grateful that no such scandals are associated with our leaders. Its not rocket science to figure that money truly is a motivator. If used correctly it can reap the right reusllts. In the past 40 years i believe there are few countries who can boast such marked improvements. That is justification in its own of these pay rises.</div>
