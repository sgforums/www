            <div class='col-md body'>1. If the PAP wants to use Private Sector pay as a yardstick, then it cannot be just based on one <strong>KPI (Key Performance Indicator)</strong> of GDP Growth.  As the PAP claims that the main driver for ministerial pay hikes is the attrition rate in the elite Admin Service, then shouldn't <strong>"<span style="color: blue;">Succession Planning</span>"</strong> be included as one more KPI in addition to the other valid ones suggested in Parliament during the recent debate???    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>2.  It was reported in the press that "the elite Admin Service has lost entire cohorts of young capable officers to the private sector".  This is DESPITE the fact that salaries of AOs at SR9 (the first Superscale grade) are currently at $372k per year pegged to the top earners aged 32 in the private sector (ie, 103% of the benchmark of $361k).  Hence, this group would NOT be getting any pay adjustment for this round.  This clearly proves that the disastrous brain drain is happening even though the Gahmen is paying ABOVE the benchmark.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"> <strong> <span style="color: blue;">Our ministers and senior civil servants have failed miserably in grooming/retaining their successors but are getting rewarded with bonuses and salary increments??? </span> </strong><br><br>3.  <strong><span style="color: blue;">Serious suggestion: </span></strong>After the first 10% attrition per annum for this category of next-generation-leaders (from SR9 to below-Superscale D), for every 10% resignation thereafter of the junior and middle ranks in this elite Admin Service during the year of evaluation, the ministerial and senior civil servants' salary and bonus be cut by 1%.<br><br>4.  <strong><span style="color: blue;">Another factor - Post-retirement benefits: </span></strong> We must NOT forget that in the private sector, once you lose your job (whether by retirement, retrenchment or restructure), that's it.  In the govt service for these Top Brass - there's a pension scheme of sorts (replete with almost free medical care) that goes on until death for those who retire after the official retirement age.  An "imputed" cost of benefit should be added to the remuneration package if the PAP wants to peg Public Service Pay Scale to the Private Sector.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  Fair enough???</div>
