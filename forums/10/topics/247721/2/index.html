So it is necessary to give themselves the highest pays when the GST was increased before it is spent on some other expenses like workfare.<br><br>What kind of governance is this - good or bad time ministers were still entitled to pay increases and when it is good time they will be quickly given the increases even before any one or the citizens are entitled to their reliefs.<br><br>It is like saying that no one can commit crimes, or take company's monies and only the ministers can because ministers have waited for 6 years since the last recession and now is the time for them to do so as soon as GST is increased - workfare or any other schemes can wait.<br><br>So Durai could not take but ministers can take any amount.
