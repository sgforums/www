              <p>Touche...Nice parry there. I admit, the people of this forum does not constitute as the majority of the population in singapore, and thus as opposed to the number of people who vote in PAP every GE, is rather small. You are right to say that the ministers deserve to be paid well for their efforts. Though one has to admit that they are overpaid don't you think?</p>

              <p>If you wanna make $100,000 a month or more, then go make it. The SG govt isnt stopping you.</p>
              <p>If people arent happy with the ministers salaries because of the drastic difference compared to theirs, then do a self check why you arent earning as much as them.

              <p>Obama can ask the US Congress thru the Senate &amp; the House of Representatives for a huge increase of his salary by using tiny little Sg as a benchmark to peg with the increase.</p>
              <p>He can argue on the grounds that since the Sg elected politicians are getting so much money for running a little red dot, it will be a shame for him to be getting so much lesser when he has to manage such a big country USA.</p>
              <p>Most likely he will get his pay rise approved since the Democratic Party now has majority control over the Senate &amp; the House of Representatives.</p>

              <p>1.  I will interprete that the American voters are now shocked out of the dreams (nightmares) as the recent landslide victory by the Democrats evidently shows.  Additionally one of the factors which contributed to the loss of the Republicans is the sh..t/mess/frustrations created by this Bu...sh...t.</p>

              <p>The possibility of this happening is unlikely, not even by a very long shot, simply because if the Congressmen have give the approval, they should be shot 1st rather than the one who got the salary raised by them!</p>
