PA and all its grassroot organizations are set up with funds from the govt, not PAP. Such simple concept also cannot differentiate!<br><br>Goh Meng Seng<br><br>http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/singapore/story/0,4386,275287,00.html?<br><br>Opposition MPs criticise SingPower over vouchers<br>OPPOSITION MP Low Thia Khiang (Hougang) has criticised utilities provider Singapore Power (SingPower) over the distribution of vouchers to help needy families pay their power bills.<br><br>The MP said he did not receive any for distribution in his constituency and was not made aware of the existence of such a help scheme.<br><br>Advertisement<br><br>More of the residents who approached him for assistance could have been helped if he had known about the voucher scheme, the Workers' Party chief said in a statement issued on Tuesday night.<br><br>'I regret that SingPower chose to operate the scheme in such a covert manner, thereby resulting in some of the households that face financial hardships (having) to live in darkness,' he said.<br><br>His comments were in reaction to a Straits Times report on Tuesday that 16,800 vouchers, worth a total of $504,000 were made available by SingPower last July as a one-off gift for needy families.<br><br>Distribution in each of the 84 constituencies was left to the discretion of MPs or the areas' grassroots advisers.<br><br>In his statement, Mr Low asked if vouchers were provided for his constituency, and whether these had been handed instead to the People's Action Party (PAP) grassroots adviser in Hougang.<br><br>A SingPower spokesman, when asked for a response to Mr Low's assertions, would say only that 'we obtained the distribution list of grassroots organisations from the People's Association. This list included the Hougang Grassroot Organisation'.<br><br>Potong Pasir MP Chiam See Tong, who also did not receive any vouchers, was also critical of the move, saying last night that 'a scheme to help the poor had been made into a political activity'.<br><br>He added that while saddened by what had happened, the move did not surprise him as the Government 'would do anything to win votes'.<br><br>Both grassroots advisers in the opposition-held wards - Hougang's Eric Low and Potong Pasir's Sitoh Yih Pin - said they received the vouchers some time ago and distributed them.<br><br>Mr Low Thia Khiang asked in his statement why SingPower decided to give the vouchers to the adviser rather than the elected MP: 'Is SingPower of the view that grassroots advisers are better placed to help constituents than their elected MPs? Or does SingPower deem that an opposition MP, elected and mandated by the people, is less legitimate in making discretionary decisions on the distribution of vouchers than the PAP grassroots adviser?'<br><br>Saying that SingPower is still owned by the Government, he asked if the move is 'a new strategy to help the PAP MPs and grassroots advisers in opposition wards win votes for future elections'.<br><br>Hougang grassroots adviser Eric Low, who stood against the WP chief in the 2001 election, said: 'As advisers, we work with grassroots organisations that were set up by the PAP to serve Singaporeans. It is a transparent system and we serve all residents, even those who did not vote for me.<br><br>'Hougang is not a PAP ward and we are continuing to serve residents here. Now that Mr Low knows I have vouchers, he can approach me or tell his residents to come and see me or my grassroots organisations. We will help them.'<br><br>Similarly, Mr Sitoh, who stood in Potong Pasir, said giving the vouchers to grassroots organisations for distribution made sense.<br><br>'We have the commitment, expertise and experience to help these families,' he said, adding that the groups had provided residents with other forms of assistance, such as with school fees and job searches. -- Sue-Ann Chia<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Eric Low, PAP man in Hougang "appointed" as advisor to PA's RC, claims that the grassroot organization is set up by PAP!<br><br>I quote from ST.<br><br>"Eric Low, who stood against the WP chief in the 2001 election,<br>said: 'As advisers, we work with grassroots organisations that were<br>set up by the PAP to serve Singaporeans."<br><br>PA has always claimed that it is apolitical that is setup by the government. But it seems that PAP members think otherwise!<br><br>As a matter of fact, this issue demonstrated the unhealthy mindset of Singaporeans as a whole. Not even PAP member could differentiate between Govt and PAP!<br><br>PAP itself does not really have its own active "grassroot" organizations. It does have 84 party branches around Singapore but it is pretty "inactive" when compared to RCs and CCCs which are grassroot organizations set up by PA funded by taxpayers' money. When PA gave the list to SingPower, PA could only possibly give out list of RCs or CCCs. Thus when Eric Low said "grassroot organization set up by PAP", hey, what is he talking about?<br><br>We have kept quiet about PAP MPs and candidates using Public funded grassroot organization to enhance their party's ground work for this long. This is not appropriate at all. If PAP want to run its own grassroot network, then please fork out money and setup its own grassroot organization!<br><br>Termasek Holdings is own by Govt, not PAP. Thus, there is no excuse on this one. MPs are mandated and elected by the people, not some losers in grassroot organizations!<br><br>Only authoritarian govts will have such "identity" problem. KMT in Taiwan used to take national assets as its own. Now, it has to returned most if not all of these assets. Most communist regime will always say party is govt, govt is party! PAP is better but it seems to me that they couldn't differentiate between PAP and govt in this instance. Not even normal Singaporeans could distinctively differentiate between a party and a govt. Espeically with the HDB upgrading "carrots" thrown at voters, it makes the line even more blur. Even those working in RCs always assume that they are working for PAP! Strange!<br><br>This is a very unhealthy development for Singapore.</div>
