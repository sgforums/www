               something was amiss, as it now turns out, what was declared was no 
              simple premonition; indeed what has evidenced since amounts to a clear

               Isn't the PA a statutory board run by senior civil servants? That so, 
              how does the PSD reconcile PA's obviously partisan prejudice with 
              reference to PAP MPs being awarded through the PA, titles of 'grassroots
               adviser' to their respective constituents- wherein elected opposition 
              MPs are summarily discredited in favor of the rejected PAP candidates? 
              Does the PA serve the interest of Singaporeans or is it just the PM's 
              exclusive fan club?<br> <br> MBT's thus roughshod, crony, not forgetting illegitimate co-opting of Mr
               Eric Gan through PA's prejudiced 'grassroots adviser' scheme as 
              Hougang's LUP 'announcer' received immediate observer protest (not on

                separation of powers is a model for the governance of a state. The  
              model was first developed in ancient Greece and came into widespread use
                by the Roman Republic as part of the unmodified Constitution of the  
              Roman Republic. Under this model, the state is divided into branches,  
              each with separate and independent powers and areas of responsibility so
                that no one branch has more power than the other branches. The normal 
               division of branches is into an executive, a legislature, and a  
              judiciary. ..."</em><br> <br> Which then begets the question: <strong>'Civil servants – no longer politically neutral?'</strong>:<em> "The question which arises is: should civil servants be involved in a political party and participate in its activities?"</em> [<a href="http://sgblogs.com/entry/civil-servants-longer-politically-neutral/394075">TOC, 27Feb2011</a>]<br> <br> So it leaves me with little choice but to conclude that the PA is 
              perhaps simply the Prime Minister's private fan club, one exclusive to 
              those who  "answer to the ruling party", whilst being well funded by 
              national reserves to the tune of $320m (Y2008)[<a href="http://geraldgiam.sg/2009/10/how-pap-uses-taxpayer-funded-grassroots-for-political-gain/">G Giam, 10Oct2009</a>]-
               a statutory board whose sole intent, based upon its obviously partisan 
              'grassroots adviser' scheme is that of driving a systematic wedge 
              between Singapore citizens and any political opposition; PAP hegemonic 
              rule being the ultimate goal.<br> <br> And in the latest report (appended below) <strong>'Chiam calls attention to upkeep of state land'</strong> [ST10Mar2011], we see how difficult it is for an opposition MP to 
              request that state land in his constituency be demarcated and up kept; 
              that his constituents might directly contact the relevant authorities 
              should need requisite (as is uniformly the case everywhere else in 
              Singapore). Rather then deliver the usual "state land- no dumping" signs

               it seems that the Senior Minister of state (Law) Mr Ho is intent upon 
              maintaining ambiguity of state land in Potong Pasir, preferring that 
              opposition town councils be repeatedly challenged to call the respective
               govt agencies to plead their case; wherein civil servants governed 
              under the PA's systemic, hegemonic and prejudiced 'grassroots adviser' 
              scheme would most likely be expected to exercise their partisan 
              commitments, fixing the opposition at every step of the way- onward PAP!<br> <br> That, by PM Lee's definition, is perhaps the essence of a civil service

              up signs on state land to indicate which government agency is in charge 
              of its maintenance. The Potong Pasir MP noted that when residents in his
               ward saw dirty or poorly maintained areas, they assumed it was because 
              the town council, which he heads, “did not pay enough attention".<br> However, many of the areas residents complained about come under the 
              charge of other agencies - including the Land Transport Authority, 
              National Parks Board and the Singapore Land Authority (SLA), he said.<br> He wanted signs informing the public of the agency in charge of the state land, and how it could be contacted.<br> "(The agencies) should also conduct regular supervision and ensure proper upkeep of their respective areas," he added.<br> In his reply to Mr Chiam, Senior Minister of State (Law) Ho Peng Kee 
              said there is no need to put up signs because “the key agencies, really,
               are only a few", and the town council knows who to call when residents 
              approach it.<br> "Indeed. if they are not sure who to call, the town council can call 
              HDB, and HDB will then direct the right agency to come and do the 
              maintenance,” he said.<br> Associate Professor Ho also suggested that Mr Chiam publish the phone 
              numbers of the relevant government agencies in his town council 
              newsletter.<br> Mr Chiam could not be contacted yesterday, but Potong Pasir town 
              councillor S. Kunalen told The Straits Times that one area residents 
              often complained about was a piece of land behind the Hindu temple along
               Potong Pasir Avenue 3, which comes under the purview of the SLA.<br> ELGIN TOH<br> <a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/Singapore/Story/STIStory_643350.html">http://www.straitstimes.com/Singapor...ry_643350.html</a> </blockquote></div>
