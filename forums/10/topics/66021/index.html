            <div class='col-md body'>Let me try to start properly.<br><br>What my previous beliefs were - as I've said, predominantly idealism. The belief that people are good, that people will work together and co-operate. The belief that technology will solve our problems. That if you've got the technology, by all means use it.<br><br>wuming78, you're quite right, NS was only 2.5 years, it might have been too short as you said.<br><br>Well, couple of years later, into university. Much less idealism, but I still believed that technology would solve our problems. Why else would I study computer engineering but to try to help solve problems?<br><br>Fast forward into the roaring tech bubble. Blissfully unaware of the bubble, I was now an IT professional, doing what I've learnt to do - code, design, solve problems.<br><br>March 2000, NASDAQ bubble burst, still unaware. Switched jobs, still coding, still designing.<br><br>2001, 2002. Married, promptly in debt due to the usual array of loans at this stage in life - housing loan, renovation loan, car loan, hire-purchase payments ...<br><br>2003. My personal Awakening. The year I realised that something was not quite right with the society I live in. In fact, something was very wrong. The year I finally realised why, what went wrong, and how far we have been headed in this direction. I have since realised that technology may not be able to solve our problems, and in fact, Humankind's abuse of technology may have been the cause of many of them in the first place. Realisations on Peak Oil and Gas, 9/11, the monetary system, energy, the role and threat of debt in the financial structure, the role of derivatives, mass media, consumerism, the environment. The global decline, in short. Despair, despondency, finally, acceptance, resignation. What is one to do, faced with mind-blowing information? The need for deeper context, the realisation that knee-jerk reactions are not helpful. The need to know more.<br><br>2004. I have not yet found any solutions, if at all there can be any solution. But I will try to spread the word. And here I am.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes, fugue, I believe you have already made your point abundantly clear. Thank you.<br><br>Now do you have additional, more useful input besides attacking a former idealist's past point of view?<br><br>Not that it was 100% optimism. I was vaguely aware of problems in other places and in other times - Africa and the victims of hunger, AIDS, politics. Earthquakes and devastation elsewhere. The Great Depression of the 1930's.<br><br>But, it seemed to happen to other people, in other places, in other times.<br><br>Atobe,<br><br>Exactly. Welcome to the Real World, indeed. Onward to a worldview based on unflinching realism.<br><br>Now for the problems that will be happening to the people here, in this place, in this time.<br><br>Hmm. Where do we start?<br><br>Maybe we'll start where I started.<br><br>Perhaps we'll start with a very simple calculation.<br><br>Total up all your (or your family's) outstanding debts - housing loan, car loan, renovation loan, hire-purchase, if any.<br><br>Divide by your annual household income (perhaps yours + your spouse, or if you're younger, your father's and perhaps mother's income).<br><br>Multiply to get in terms of %.<br><br>So it's :<br><br>total debt / total income x 100%<br><br>Got it?<br><br>Now let's compare to averages. For the Singaporean national average, it's about 178%.<br><br>What does this mean?<br><br>One way to look at it is that it  means that the average Singaporean will take 1.78 years to pay off all his debt if he puts aside 100% of his annual salary to pay it off.<br><br>Of course that's not possible, so the re-payments are stretched over time.<br><br>Is it healthy to be in such debt? No. Are most working-class people in debt? Yes.<br><br>Is this a healthy situation? Probably not.<br><br>What's a good number for this debt-service ratio? 0.00%. But few people have the ready cash to instantly pay up for the big-ticket items.<br><br>The exact ratio to be "comfortable" with is highly subjective. For some people it may run up to 300%, 400% or more - pretty dangerous grounds.<br><br>IMHO, anything over 100% is already quite shaky.<br><br>From a personal, family debt issue, one then realises that hey, "I'm not alone!" It is a nation-wide problem. It is not only a Singapore problem, it's the same in many other so-called "developed" countries.<br><br>From here on, it's not just "developed" countries, "developing" countries are staggering under debt as well.<br><br>So are companies. Very large companies.<br><br>The total amount of debt in the world is staggering. It is just as staggering for individuals as it is for SME's, MNC's, and entire countries.</div>

Has it got something to do with the fact that pehaps our psychology makes us inured to fighting for ourselves after the basic needs have been met and luxuries are made readily available for us to indulge in a little fine living or dining? I believe that we have become a society that is mostly shallow, unable to think and critically analyse what truly matters, our heart and mind.We have gone from a promising country with gung-ho citizens to a state where superficial interests reign, we would sell our souls to live in a condominium which will never be worth the financial slavery that we yoke ourselves to, owe banks more than what we earn for the right to flash some plastic for one minute at the checkout.<br><br>Do we help one another?Look around, the handicapped have less welfare than pets! How many Pet taxis can you see around?Dozens can be found in the phone book.But when a disabled human being wants to get to work, what are the options available to him?A car may be affordable to some, but most cannot even afford to take a cab to work.Bus companies do not really care and they have violated the very reason for their existence as a public service provider.Semantics notwithstanding, if my education serves me correctly, public means to serve without distinction.The naked pursuit of the bottomline is irrelevant for they are government owned.The state is obliged to provide for its citizens.We are not a corporation and in a corporation, even shareholders have influence in the matters at hand.Surely you can judge for yourselves whether we have more or less say in the running of our society in the big picture and the long run?<br><br>Well, draw your own conclusions for the layman can tell that something is not right, we are being treated in a way that is inherently evil to our nature as humans.The comfort zone is like a car with its engine running over time, sure, its cool but the slow death will take over soon.I'd rather be in the scorching sun with the insects for tis natural and alive.Decide which you want.We are living on the precipice, there is a thin line between the slow and rugged way up and the degeneration of our society into one which is animalistic and cold. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

Has it got something to do with the fact that pehaps our psychology makes us inured to fighting for ourselves after the basic needs have been met and luxuries are made readily available for us to indulge in a little fine living or dining? I believe that we have become a society that is mostly shallow, unable to think and critically analyse what truly matters, our heart and mind.We have gone from a promising country with gung-ho citizens to a state where superficial interests reign, we would sell our souls to live in a condominium which will never be worth the financial slavery that we yoke ourselves to, owe banks more than what we earn for the right to flash some plastic for one minute at the checkout.<br><br>Do we help one another?Look around, the handicapped have less welfare than pets! How many Pet taxis can you see around?Dozens can be found in the phone book.But when a disabled human being wants to get to work, what are the options available to him?A car may be affordable to some, but most cannot even afford to take a cab to work.Bus companies do not really care and they have violated the very reason for their existence as a public service provider.Semantics notwithstanding, if my education serves me correctly, public means to serve without distinction.The naked pursuit of the bottomline is irrelevant for they are government owned.The state is obliged to provide for its citizens.We are not a corporation and in a corporation, even shareholders have influence in the matters at hand.Surely you can judge for yourselves whether we have more or less say in the running of our society in the big picture and the long run?<br><br>Well, draw your own conclusions for the layman can tell that something is not right, we are being treated in a way that is inherently evil to our nature as humans.The comfort zone is like a car with its engine running over time, sure, its cool but the slow death will take over soon.I'd rather be in the scorching sun with the insects for tis natural and alive.Decide which you want.We are living on the precipice, there is a thin line between the slow and rugged way up and the degeneration of our society into one which is animalistic and cold. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

In California, the median price of a home is about USD $400,000, which incidentally makes it relatively unaffordable to 75% of the population. Yet they still go into just this amount of debt just to buy a home!<br><br>Crazy?<br><br>No crazier than Singaporeans going into debt buying homes and cars at such high prices.<br><br>While, like many, I would have liked to lay the blame squarely at the government's feet, I have also realised that it goes beyond that.<br><br>You see, having most of the citizens in debt and working off their collective behinds to service their debt can be considered to be "a means of control". [/b][/quote]<br>The situation in the USA is purely commercial, as the political system is based on an open political process.<br><br>In Singapore, the political process is similar to that of a Third World in which the Government creates an environment in which the Citizen is totally dependent on the Government.<br><br>What better way then to create an environment of perpetual indebtedness, in which the Citizen's ability to service the debt will be dependent on his own economic survival, which in turn is supposed to depend on the perpetuation of the present political status quo ?<br><blockquote>continuing post by Iowem:<strong><br>[quote]Originally posted by Atobe:<br>[b]The only way to shake ourselves out of this bind, is to change the status quo in the next election. </strong></blockquote>Coming from a political angle, yes, perhaps if the "right" people are elected (it does not matter from which party), perhaps things might change.<br><br>But coming from a systems approach angle, I now believe that there are some things beyond the power of government to control.<br><br>Tolerances and limits have been breached in many areas in the financial sector. Though they are for the most part invisible, the manifestations of their effects are starting to be felt.<br><br>From the resources angle, too, we are also beginning to see signs of limits being reached.<br><br>Having the "right" arrangement of people who are nominally in charge of things might help - hopefully!<br><br>But I wouldn't bet my individual behind on that.<br><br>On the other hand, trying to appeal to individuals to change their destructive behaviour is a huge task, and that is an understatement.<br><br>There may be a solution. Or there may not. We don't know. Nobody knows.
