Perhaps Singapore could be a bit more respectful of international legal protocol, especially since Romania has thus far seemed quite cooperative for their part (already indicting him on 2nd Feb for negligent homicide). Think complying w International norms would be better for the image of Singapore rather then a 'high-handed' approach.<br>Also, given Romania's obvious preference to abide by international laws of diplomatic relations, perhaps Singapore should cooperate closely with Romania in persecuting Dr Ionescu for the moment as the practice of such 'one-upmanship'- bypassing the Romanian government in disciplining its diplomat against international diplomatic norms- might be viewed negatively by the Romanian people, God forbid it be viewed as 'brinkmanship' and regrettably backfire.<br>I might be wrong of course...<br>May we be at peace with the world.<br>(see highlighted parts for the Romanian response below)<br></span></span></p>

                      Foreign Ministry of the steps taken by the Romanian authorities for a 
                      lawful investigation of former Romanian envoy to Singapore Silviu 
                      Ionescu blamed for a hit-and-run accident in December, Romania’s Foreign
                       Ministry said Friday.<br> <br> Neagu reiterated Romania's commitment to uphold procedures needed to 
                      clear out all aspects related to the case and stressed that all the 
                      public statements made by Ionescu regarding this case were his personal 
                      standpoint and did not represent an official stance of the Romanian 
                      Foreign Ministry or the Romanian authorities, the ministry said in its 
                      press release Friday.<br> <br> Considering the criminal charges brought against Ionescu by the Romanian
                       General Prosecutor's Office, Ionescu was suspended from his diplomatic 
                      duties within the Romanian Foreign Ministry under the provisions of 
                      article 60 of Law 269/ 2003 regulating the Statute of Romania's 
                      Diplomatic and Consular Corps.<br> <br> Neagu also underscored that the Romanian authorities wanted to fully 
                      abide by the law and international procedures in dealing with this case.<br> <br> According to the press release, on January 5, 2010, the ministry 
                      submitted a request to the General Prosecutor's Office to investigate 
                      the accident on December 15, 2009 in which a vehicle of the Romanian 
                      diplomatic mission in Singapore was involved. On January 6, 2010, the 
                      Prosecutor's Office set off the criminal prosecution against Ionescu, at
                       the ministry's request.<br> <br> On January 11, 2010, judicial authorities in Singapore were asked to 
                      provide all available accident-related data. The request was submitted 
                      via international police cooperation networks, namely, the Romanian 
                      Interpol Office and the Singapore Interpol Office, respectively, 
                      according to the press release.<br> <br> On January 26, 2010, the Romanian Foreign Ministry provided information 
                      to Interpol Singapore on whether Romanian judicial authorities are 
                      entitled to probe, try and sentence Romanian citizens for crimes 
                      committed abroad, the press release also read.<br> <br> On January 29, 2010, Interpol Singapore offered additional information 
                      to the Romanian General Prosecutor's Office and said more information 
                      would be provided only in keeping with the investigations that were to 
                      be unfolded by the Singapore Coroner's Court.<br> <br> On February 2, 2010, the Romanian General Prosecutor's Office indicted 
                      Ionescu for negligent homicide, fleeing the scene of the accident and 
                      false statements. In consequence, Ionescu was suspended from his 
                      diplomatic duties within the Romanian Foreign Ministry, under the 
                      Romanian law, until the end of the investigation. Singapore' authorities
                       were duly informed, the press release also noted.<br> <br> On February 11, 2010, Romania's Justice Minister submitted a series of 
                      requests to Singapore's Justice Minister, via an international rogation 
                      commission, calling for full observance of procedural provisions under 
                      Romanian laws.<br> <br> Romania's Embassy Chargé d'Affaires attended the Coroner's Inquiry 
                      proceedings unfolded between March 3 and March 10, 2010. Various 
                      documents were handed to him informally to better understand the legal 
                      proceedings. No reference was ever made that the said documents were 
                      meant to be an official response to the above -mentioned requests of the
                       Romanian Justice Minister, therefore, they could not be considered as 
                      such under the international procedures, the press release also read.<br> <br> <span style="color: magenta;">On March 16, 2010, Singapore's Justice Ministry 
                      issued a preliminary answer assuring the Romanian General Prosecutor's 
                      Office that Singapore's authorities are ready to work closely with the 
                      Romanian General Prosecutor's Office throughout the criminal 
                      investigations, while observing Singapore's laws.<br> <br> Singapore's Police sent to Interpol Romania an international arrest 
                      warrant against Ionescu who is held responsible for a fatal hit-and-run 
                      accident in Bukit Panjang, people close to the matter said Thursday.<br> <br> Prosecutor Marius Iacob, chief of Romanian General Prosecutors' Office 
                      criminal department, told MEDIAFAX Thursday that Interpol Romania 
                      received the international arrest warrant against Ionescu from 
                      Singapore's police.<br> <br> Romania's Foreign Ministry said both Romania and Singapore joined the 
                      Vienna Convention regarding diplomatic relations, therefore, 
                      investigations into Ionescu's case must be carried out by Romanian 
                      authorities.<br> <br> According to the Vienna Convention regarding diplomatic relations, a 
                      diplomat enjoys immunity from the criminal jurisdiction of the receiving
                       state, which does not exempt the respective diplomat from the 
                      jurisdiction of the sending state.</span></td>
