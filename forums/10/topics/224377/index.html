            <div class='col-md body'>The Corruption Perception Index (CPI) is compiled by Transparency International, a global civil society organisation dedicated to the fight against corruption. It is well respected globally and its survey findings are quoted by the BBC (<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/3567745.stm" rel="nofollow">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/3567745.stm</a>) and national governments (<a href="http://www.senate.gov.ph/publications/AG%202006-04%20-%20Corruption%20Facts%20and%20Figures.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.senate.gov.ph/publications/AG%202006-04%20-%20Corruption%20Facts%20and%20Figures.pdf</a>).<br><br>The higher the CPI, the lower the experience of corruption among those surveyed. In its latest published figures for 2006 (<a href="http://www.transparency.org/news_room/in_focus/cpi_2006/cpi_table" rel="nofollow">http://www.transparency.org/news_room/in_focus/cpi_2006/cpi_table</a>), the CPI for Singapore is the fifth globally at 9.4, after Finland and Iceland (tied at first place), New Zealand and Denmark; putting Singapore ahead of Sweden (6th), Australia (9th), UK (11th), Hong Kong (15th), USA (20th), Taiwan (34th) and South Korea (42nd). Singapore has the highest CPI score of all the Asean nations, with the next highest being Malaysia (44th), Thailand (63rd) and Vietnam (111th).<br><br>The Philippines, arguably the most democratic of Asean nations has a dismally low score of 2.5 at 121st position.<br><br>Corruption exists in every nation but it can be curbed by stringent laws, strong political will by a clean government, upright judiciary and efficient administration.

Yet their graduates have no jobs, their women have to work as your maids, and their nation still remains poor and corrupt-ridden.<br><br>Democracy does not produce wealth, good governance does.</div>

Hardly. It simply means the people are cowed through a serious of defamation suits that stifle free speech and will ask less of the 'why' questions, allowing the ruling party to dictate terms with ease. It is easier for men in such positions to abuse their power and influence policy and the constitution, even if it is at the expense of the people.<br><br>Conversely, the government need not explain to the people WHY they are implementing this policy. They simply DO IT.<br><br>The fact that national referendums in HK could overturn the government's intention to implement sales tax is in direct contrast to our referendum over the Integrated Resorts. It really shows how 'big' the people's teaspoon of salt means to the current administration.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>The index is based on perception. And it is relative. Being the top place does'nt mean that Finland and Iceland are corruption free countries.<br><br>Coming back to look at Singapore, this topic is about corruption subject alone. Personally, I think it is a blessing to be very sure that, Singapore is so much better as compared to our neighbouring country where bribery runs at street level - if you are stopped by a police for speeding (whether you did or not), you can easily get out of it, by giving you know what. And that is a bad thing. That actually means that corruption runs top-down where the wealth of the nation goes mostly into the pocket of the corrupt few, and every citizen bloody knows that, but can do nothing about. So you corrupt, he corrupts, the whole nation is corrupting.</div>

They are assessed significantly worse by respondents from non-OECD countries Â– the same divide is evident for the United Arab Emirates Â– indicating a sharp double standard in business practices. "<br><br><a href="http://www.transparency.org/news_room/in_focus/2006/bpi_2006" rel="nofollow">http://www.transparency.org/news_room/in_focus/2006/bpi_2006</a><br><br>both articles go hand in hand. why report only half the story?[/b]</blockquote>Stringent domestic policies to curb corruption makes Singapore attractive to foreign investors. If local businesses gives out 'discounts' in return for business opportunities (which would constitute corruption at home), the damage, if any, is not done to Singapore but the foreign nation.<br><br>It's not our job to make sure other governments are clean. If they cannot control their officials from accepting bribes from Singaporean businesses, that's their problem.<br><br>As long as it benefits us more, that's fine with me. Anyway, Singapore's ranking in the BPI is still respectable.</div>
