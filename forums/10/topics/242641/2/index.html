But whenever I leave or return to Singapore, the glum looking custom officers are a real put off. It seems all the improvements are targeted at the transit passengers. As a Singaporean wanting to visit the airport just for a different experience like watching aeroplanes and having nice foods, it's becoming less and less enjoyable. They have greatly reduce the viewing gallery area so they can build more expensive restaurants and others I presume. They put up some kind of notice at the basement foodcourt of T1 to inform us that the "canteen" is meant for airport workers and visitors should patronize other"expensive" outlets. Well, is that how they treat their own workers? Eating in a canteen that looks no better than some factory canteen, only slightly better foods? The canteen at T2 is only somewhat like a foodcourt in a shopping centre. And don't talk about the parking charges - cut throat.<br></div>

When My kids were young, I used to take them to the airport occasionally just to look at the planes, very different from flying in one. The airport must be seen as an educational place as well, not just for the business of making money, catering to transit passengers and impressing them.</div>
