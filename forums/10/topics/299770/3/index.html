            <div class='col-md body'>Found your facts in another thread. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br>My response in bold.<br><br><blockquote>Fact is, the number of foreigners + PRs exceed the number of Singaporeans in the total labour force in Singapore (1.16 : 1), but a certain forumer continued not to accept this fact, and in fact, took it as a form of an attack, which I have no idea why.<br><strong>Your fact? Source? </strong><br><br>Fact is, public service, the largest employer in Singapore, employ mostly Singaporeans, and thus, how would one expect a high ratio of Sgreans working in other companies? Yet a certain forumer failed to accept this point and decide to use his wonderful amount of working experience as a backing to his baseless claim.<br><br>Fact is, my calculations has shown at least a 96% employment rate of citizens, assuming 100% employment of foreigners + PRs, and as explained earlier, it is highly likely that a high proportion is in government agencies (SAF, GIC, DSO, MINDEF, etc, etc). Thus the normal observations of more foreigners in private companies. However, a certain forumer would continue to correct me that many foreigners are indeed snatching locals of their jobs because he has seen 3 companies, one of which has 20 employees, and in total &lt;0.1% of the labour force of Singapore.<br><strong>Civil service : 60,000 strong?  So, 2.6m locals need to work in private sector? Is the number a fair assumption? I donÂ’t have the figures. 4% unemployed approx. 104,000? So little? ThatÂ’s unbelievable. As a number, itÂ’s still big considering that foreigners and PRs enjoyed 100% employment. Ask the MOM or statistics dept. to produce real figures to convince the people. This is the best.<br></strong><br>Fact is, there are certainly loopholes here and there for employers to exploit such that it seems like they have a good citizen to foreigners ratio on paper, yet in actual fact more foreigners than normal. Thus the averages in the statistics can sometimes mislead, and these loopholes are the main thing that is worth discussing. Yet a certain forumer would continue to harp on the statistics, and not why the numbers could be screwed up due to these loopholes.<br><br>Fact is, there are indeed Singaporeans who were displaced by cheaper foreign talents from China and India. Yet imagine, Singapore was a country that relied on foreign workers since its founding. Have our ancestors not also displaced the original "inhabitants" of the land of Singapore too?<br><strong>Singapore was a colony then. ItÂ’s a nation now. We are no more subjects. We are the citizens now. GovtÂ’s priority is to the citizens. During the the 80s, there were still jobs that citizens shunned during a recession. Unemployment was not serious because the country overcame the recession with pay freeze and cpf cuts. These were restored when the economy bounced back. So, how are foreigners recruited today? Place job ads  in Singapore to hire locals first? No reponse than recruit from overseas? Is that how it works? Today, foreigners are treated better than the citizens.<br></strong><br>Fact is, even if you do go abroad to work, there are 2 things that can happened. Firstly, you could too get displaced by cheaper workers from India and China too; they migrate everywhere. Secondly, you will also be regarded as a foreigner that displaced a local of his/her work; you are doing exactly the same thing that you have despised.<br><strong>No worries if they become naturalized citizens of that country. Welfare, remember?<br>In Singapore, you have to Â‘fallÂ’ into the MRT tracks.</strong><br><br>Fact is, if you have the real ability, you would be able to rise up in this sea of foreign workers. With the real ability, you could lead them in work, instead of competing with them for work. Manage them. Get them to do the work for you. Why compete in an area they have an advantage of? Know your advantages, and make full use of them to have an edge. The never ending problem occurs when people only think linearly of competing in an area without any advantage.<br><strong>Middle-aged U and poly(even a handful of PHD and Masters) grads driving taxis, anyone?<br>The problem is that the govt gives the employers freehand in its hiring practices. You only need to read up our own labour laws. ItÂ’s very simple. Then you read the labour laws of the first world countries. Make a comparison. The employees here have no bargaining power at all. Join NTUC union and enjoy the benefits of members? ItÂ’s all enticing members to spend. Who need that sh!t? People need jobs with pay that can cover the cost of living and still have some left to pursue happiness. Singapore is such a small country. If there are still people who have to live from hand to mouth, please donÂ’t advertise Singapore as a first world country. </strong><br></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>four sided opinions about ministers' salaries.<br><br>side 1:  LKY knew that corruption is rampant in this region and he wanted to make sure Singapore does not have it after he is gone.  He knew that the most effective and cheapest method to fight corruption is by check and balances.  But he will not let go of the political grip which the party has over the population.  So to "cover" this failing of the party, he pumped up the salaries of the ministers.  So high that he hoped that it can fight corruption.  The philosophy so far he has for Singapore is to solve problems by money and science.<br><br>side 2:  Fighting corruption by increasing the ministers' salaries is only an excuse.  The real reason behind is very simple, Greed.  Because it is possible to implement effective internal check and balances.<br><br>side 3:  First world standard in salaries and living refers only to civil servants and GLC employees with pink NRICs with a minimum educational level.  Because our rich government has no control over the private sector's salary levels.  So the ministers' salaries is a "beach head" commando signal that salaries of Singaporeans will rise to first world standard.  Declaration of first world standard refers to public sector.  Private sector can do what they want. Eventually, over the long term, the private sector will realise that Singaporeans are expensive and they have to pay up, otherwise they have to hire cheaper FTs.<br><br>side 4:  Got to compete with private sector salaries to retain the people within the government.<br><br>which side are you on?<br><br></div>

Or at least, give proper facts, research and analysis before an attempt to discredit the government.<br><br>There are a few attitudes in this forum (feel free to add on):<br>1) Only know how to complain but do nothing {not even some simple research to substantiate} (armchair general)<br>2) Complain without proper facts, evidence and research (baseless allegations)<br>3) Complain wrongly liao start personal attacks, which is out of point from the original thread (sore loser)<br><br>Fortunately, this forum is somewhat saved by a few rather good threads, although such threads do go out of point sometimes.<br><br>Sigh...</div></blockquote>Why are you surprised.
