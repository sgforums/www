Hope you get what I meant.<br><br>With regards to your facts,<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by googoomuck:</div><div class="quote_body">Your fact? Source?</div></blockquote>This is in another discussion in which I have raised the statistics. Thread: Puzzle #2 by threadstarter reddressman<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by googoomuck:</div><div class="quote_body">Civil service : 60,000 strong? So, 2.6m locals need to work in private sector? Is the number a fair assumption? I donÂ’t have the figures. 4% unemployed approx. 104,000? So little? ThatÂ’s unbelievable. As a number, itÂ’s still big considering that foreigners and PRs enjoyed 100% employment. Ask the MOM or statistics dept. to produce real figures to convince the people. This is the best. </div></blockquote>Check the MOM site. Civil service employment stands at 120,000 strong. In addition, check out my calculations of 1.25 mil local workers out of a strong labour force of 2.6mil. Obviously, you have not read my calculations in Puzzle#2 in which my 46k was the estimation of the number of unemployed.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by googoomuck:</div><div class="quote_body">Singapore was a colony then. ItÂ’s a nation now. We are no more subjects. We are the citizens now. GovtÂ’s priority is to the citizens. During the the 80s, there were still jobs that citizens shunned during a recession. Unemployment was not serious because the country overcame the recession with pay freeze and cpf cuts. These were restored when the economy bounced back. So, how are foreigners recruited today? Place job ads in Singapore to hire locals first? No reponse than recruit from overseas? Is that how it works? Today, foreigners are treated better than the citizens.<br></div></blockquote>As I have already said, it is industry related. Even if Singapore was a colony, it is still fact that our ancestors has displaced the original "inhabitants" of the land of Singapore, isn't it?<br><br>Regarding CPF, I still wonder why it was not totally restored to pre recession levels.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by googoomuck:</div><div class="quote_body">No worries if they become naturalized citizens of that country. Welfare, remember?</div></blockquote>If you have followed the arguments, one of the concerns here was that foreigners/PRs become citizens of Singapore, and are included in the calculations of citizen labour force.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by googoomuck:</div><div class="quote_body">Middle-aged U and poly(even a handful of PHD and Masters) grads driving taxis, anyone?<br>The problem is that the govt gives the employers freehand in its hiring practices. You only need to read up our own labour laws. ItÂ’s very simple. Then you read the labour laws of the first world countries. Make a comparison. The employees here have no bargaining power at all. Join NTUC union and enjoy the benefits of members? ItÂ’s all enticing members to spend. Who need that sh!t? People need jobs with pay that can cover the cost of living and still have some left to pursue happiness. Singapore is such a small country. If there are still people who have to live from hand to mouth, please donÂ’t advertise Singapore as a first world country.<br>In Singapore, you have to Â‘fallÂ’ into the MRT tracks. </div></blockquote>This is Singapore labour law. Sigh...<br><br>But it acts like a double-edged sword to the economy, doesn't it? On one hand, it guarantees employers minimum/almost no labour strikes thus attracting more potential employers. On the other hand, employees do not have any bargaining power. Though I agree here that it is ultimately the government that earns from taxes.</div>
