Further more there is no winter here, which is hell of problem. Anyway sg is not a bad place to stay after all if u compare, however, there is still alot of things to concern to ensure the things stay in this way or improve in the future.<br><br>As for the complaint part in this forum....I already gave up talking to idiots who likes to take sides. I rather spend my time holidaying than argue with them. If u like it, stay, if u dun, fark off. What we need in sg is constuctive suggestion to improve, not whining or boasting about the government. We just want to have a better enviroment for everyone to stay in sg. China become stronger because they can united after the revolution, so y cant the sgporean united too?<br><br>So....I will reply selectively on ppl that is worth the attention. The rest of them, I will treat them like those maggots in the bar, ignore them. Kinda waste of time to reply to them rite?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

He's with one of the Japanese MNC in SG...<br><br>He tells me that he likes it here, things are cheaper than in Tokyo where he was from and he and his family loves the weather here.<br><br>He still speaks fondly of his home country though... Politically, he's apathetic... he finds Japan's constant spat with China irritating and thinks that its much better for business if both countries can get along properly and he's not a big fan of sending troops overseas too.<br><br>It strikes me that he knows the difference between the country and the government and he's proud of his country even if he finds the government distasteful.<br><br>The point is, do we know what we're upset about here in Singapore? Is it sentosa? it is marina south? is it pulau ubin? Or toa payoh or jurong?<br><br>NO! a lot of us love this country and say what u like, some of us are actually happy with our little HDB pigeon hole in the sky!<br><br>A lot of Singaporeans are simply upset with the GOVERNMENT and the ruling party. And it doesn't help that the ruling party has been such a dominant part of everyone's life since independence.<br><br>The entire urban landscape and way of living bears some marks of the ruling party so intuitively, anything wrong with our lives or the country, the ruling party gets blamed, whether justifiably or not!<br><br>This does not help the cause of patriotism!<br><br>Unfortunately, many Singaporeans prefer to have a centralised source of blame-storming and simplistically lump everything together as "the PAP's fault".<br><br>Its a very tragic situation. I actually love this country but I do not always agree with the government and its policies. But when I step up and say "Singapore's a nice place to be", I get bombarded by coffee shop critics on an anti-PAP rampage...<br><br>I'm not talking about loving the "cheng-hu"... I'm talking about my home and how can I not love my home???</div>
