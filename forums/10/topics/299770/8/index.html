There is this particular one condemns people complaining and said he disagrees with the way of PAP but when credit is due he wil give credit.   He is against people organising Black Saturday and the wear black have dinner at Centrepoint today saying that these disrupt peace.   Sounds like PAP's running dog.</div>

Their purpose is to let the pap knows there are people who are not happy.    This is a form of expression in itself, just like people come to this forum and view their views and unhappiness about the gahmen.  The only difference is other than speaking, they put in action to show their displeasure, there is nothing wrong.   There are far too many people who keep talking but do nothing when others put into action they are not happy.   I admire people who talk and also put into action,  talk alone is cheap!</div>

Talking about GST increase, the CNA stated that shoppers and retailers not affected by kick off of GST hike.  This is obviously propaganda and untrue.   How can this be?

If there are no complain, and the local media reporting only on the partial truth, you can't blame the average ppl to be deceived to really believe the media and support the gov policy.</div>
