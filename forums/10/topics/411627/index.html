                   party whips in situation like these and let MPs vote sincerely and 
                  based on their morals and the electorate's wishes.<br> <br> In fact:<br> Make all MP parliamentary actions transparent to the electorate.<br> Ban the party whip from influencing MP decisions in electing the cabinet
                   or any parliamentary decision for that matter, ban overt partisan 
                  influence of parliament.<br> For the electorate vote either independent candidates or candidates from
                   parties which do not place partisan interest over that of the 
                  electorate's.<br> Remove the partisan element from SG's GRC system of elections (it 
                  promotes gerrymandering) and slim it down to the minimum size and 
                  numbers necessary: see calculation proving that: <a href="http://forums.asiaone.com/showthread.php?p=458168#post458168">'12': the correct number of (3-Memb) GRCs for Singapore</a>-
                   which explains why this optimum no. of GRCs, which also provides for 48
                   SMCs, based on the current 84seat parliament is able to balance racial 
                  minority interest whilst holding sacred the partisan <strong>independence </strong>of MPs in parliament.<br> <br> Political parties (like any professional institution) should have the

                  various publications, influence the decisions of the electorate and so 
                  their votes - they should NOT actively determine how an MP speaks or 
                  acts in parliament nor sway votes by threatening an MP's political 
                  career. For too long have political parties manipulated the government 
                  with their selfish egos and greed and I think that this is precisely the

                  non-conformity? Does voting a PAP MP equate voting by default for Mr Lim

              <p>Thank you for you interest in my article.<br> <br> Whilst it's obvious that 'Hung Parliaments' are the new bane of the 3 western democracies described, (you described: "<a href="http://forums.sgclub.com/singapore/vote_any_pap_301419.html#post3915307">a dreadlock(sic) - (where) nothing can be done, debated, or implemented</a>").<br> It would be good if one could investigate the root causes of such a conundrum rather then merely stating the obvious.<br> <br> What I have, in authoring <em>'Vote for any PAP MP= vote (by default) for Mr Lim Swee Say?'</em> is to draw attention to the problem of the electorate falling during 
              elections for the partisan politics game played out by insincere 
              politicians from 'big church' political parties, exploiting the naivete 
              and uninformed electorate.<br> <br> In the case of Singapore (as my essay began with); all PAP MPs have to 
              avow absolute abidance to party rules and, with the exception of prior 
              permission being sought granted, vote according to party agenda:<em> "The
                free vote is given to them when they make a request, and the Whip will
                consider. In the past it was simply: 'No you can't even request'"</em> [<a href="http://www.singapore-window.org/sw02/020321af.htm">Singapore lifts whip on orchestrated parliament</a>];
               the current PAP party whip being Mr Lim Swee Say. This obviously 
              results often in conflicts of MP's constituency interest over partisan 
              interest. The latter often being the default tie breaker must have 
              instinctively invoked the forum participant to conclude: "<a href="http://theonlinecitizen.com/2009/05/political-changes-are-for-long-term-strength-and-stability-says-pm-lee/comment-page-1/#comment-77398">PAP MP are bound by PARTY WHIP, ie they vote accordingly party line  and not the constituencies interest and personal conviction</a>." <br> <br> This concept of partisan interest first, electorate interest second 
              (post elections)- is by my observation, the same root cause for the 
              'hung parliament' problem in the 3 foreign <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_democracy">parliamentary based democracies</a> described; whereby an electorate naivete of the disruptive and 
              'anti-competitive' nature of partisan politics have permissively allowed
               such practices to pervade through out the political system- thus 
              resulting in much partisan political bickering and leadership 
              stalemates, whereby even the formation of a cabinet has become 
              problematic if not impossible. The desperate co-opting of independents, 
              minority parties being the eventual outcome- the pre-election promises 
              now diluted by partisan bargaining.<br> <br> The 2 local examples wherein professional bodies were disallowed 
              publication of their respective 'guideline on fees' are examples of the 
              high 'pro-competitive' standards the government requires of local 
              professional bodies whereby publication of even non-binding fee 
              guidelines by these societies- whatever the intent- have been deemed 
              uncompetitive and thus made illegal.<br> <br> It is thus shocking that in this internet age of high population 
              literacy and even amongst 1st world economies, MPs still have to 
              routinely compromise their personal convictions in support of partisan 
              agenda/ political dynasty- or else face sanctions, even to the extent of
               disqualification from parliament as is the situation locally. <br> <br> Why do people around the world still depend on '<a href="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/big+brother">big brother</a>'
               politicians to govern their country? What has happened to cordial 
              interpersonal relations, mutual cooperation and independent ingenuity 
              that has guided humanity over the centuries? Must the conduct of every 
              parliamentary session- from inception to dissolution- be done 'big 
              brother' style and along partisan lines? Are good ideas so unique that 
              they should be sole monopoly of only 1 party? Must our differences 
              remain the focus amongst our politicians? Is a quiet festering 'civil 
              war' the ideal outcome of democracy?<br> <br> With hung parliaments sprouting as ubiquitously worldwide as the recent 
              recession spread, the faith of people in 'big church' political parties 
              must be wearing thin.<br> <br> Using the example of small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) as a distant example: <a href="http://english.people.com.cn/200703/05/eng20070305_354411.html"><em>"SMEs
               form an important pillar of the city-state's economy, employing  56 
              percent of workforce and contributing 42 percent of gross domestic  
              product (GDP)."</em></a> even the economy is currently being populated by
               smaller, 'independently run' companies- not over sized MNCs nor their 
              clumsy subsidiaries. - This local example also applies locally- where 
              PAP is the 'big church' party and where excess partisanship and 
              gerrymandering remain the core problems inherent in the current <a href="http://forums.asiaone.com/showthread.php?p=467896#post467896">GRC system of elections in Singapore</a>.<br> <br> For how long more 'big church' political parties can continue play their
               dirty little partisan games in the midst of recurrent hung parliaments 
              and an increasingly aware and literate electorate is a question that I

              <p>Somemore, earlier he come up with a story that nobody hear
              before, about a frog story which was contradicting itself.</p>
              <p>As quoted: <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.straitstimes.com/STI/STIMEDIA/sp/budget2010/0403_dont_just_criticise_be_part_of_the_solution.html">http://www.straitstimes.com/STI/STIMEDIA/sp/budget2010/0403_dont_just_criticise_be_part_of_the_solution.html</a></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">THE story goes that in a kingdom
              of frogs, the tallest tower in the world is built for an annual
              competition.<br> <br> And when the event is held, many aim to become the champion by
              making it to the top, but fail as they are discouraged by the
              audience, who warn that the climb is too dangerous.</span> <span style="color: #ff0000;"><br> <br> All except one frog who did reach the top. And when asked
              afterwards why he ignored the crowd, the frog said: 'I'm deaf. I
              can't hear them.'</span> <span style="color: #ff0000;"><br> <br> Funny how the frog was deaf and could answer the
              question.</span></p>

              to come out and tell some unheard tales too.</p>
