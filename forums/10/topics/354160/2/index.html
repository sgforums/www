              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>I'm currently a foreign talent in the US, or what the Singapore
              government refers to as a "quitter".</p>
              <p>I feel that the US system for bringing in foreign talent legally
              is very fair. It's based on a limited number of work visas issued
              per year based on what projected shortfalls they have in areas of
              industry where local talent is insufficient (technology
              mainly).</p>
              <p>Most importantly, when they employ foreign nationals into a job
              position, there is NO WAGE SUPPRESSION. I'm paid dollar for dollar
              the same as my US-born counterparts. Therefore, it's absolutely
              clear that the only motivation for requiring foreign talent is to
              really fill any voids in key job positions. This makes sure that
              any foreign talent the US brings in is only of the highest caliber,
              and you can see this from the fact the ~50% of Silicon Valley
              companies are formed by foreign nationals.</p>
              <p>What the Singapore government is doing appears to be the
              complete opposite. No doubt, they bring in large numbers of low
              wage and lowly educated foreign workers for the construction
              indursty, which is labour intensive, but why do we also see
              numerous China nationals working in our F&amp;B and service
              industries? I think Singaporeans are more than willing to take
              these jobs.</p>
              <p>Also, you see many Filipino and China engineers now, but they
              are paid 60% of what their Singaporean colleagues make. How is that
              fair?</p>
              <p>In addition, why is it also that the majority of education
              scholarships now provided by the government are earmarked for
              foreigners only? These are scholarships paid for with Singaporean
              tax dollars. I've met many a Chinese national here in the US who
              studied(scholarship) and worked in Singapore for a few years, only
              to come to the US for graduate school and live here. Singapore has
              become only a stepping stone for them, and the government should
              really start trending this statistic.</p>
              <p>Enough said, I have to get back to my job as a foregin
              talent...</p>

              <p>All the best, mate.</p>
              <p>For those who are reading this, my take is, do your best to get a job that allows you to have international exposure, so that you open up opportunities to many other places for you to see the world.</p>
              <p>Don't treat Singapore like the ONLY place in the world that is heavenly, perfect as a place (prison) to live in.</p>
              <p>I have been in 2 MNCs so far, and my exposure is in the international arena. I have worked with people from US, England, Belgium, Germany, Italy, China, Taiwan, Japan, Singapore, etc, and this exposure, believe me, is VERY useful when companies look for people who can excel in international roles. This would then open your eyes to the different countries and then you will realize how small this island is.</p>

              <p>Shouldn't we be like Japan? Practise or use what we preach?</p>
              <p>Anyway, I am past the life of a student. I did not have the luxury to have an international education (cost being a huge factor), but at least I managed to get a scholarship to support my university fees.</p>
              <p>So now that I am a working professional, do the next best thing - an international career. This IS within your control, unlike education, when your family background may not allow you to have an international education.</p>

              <p>I must say that from what I'm reading in the papers,  NUS/ NTU are making leaps and bounds in trying to gain some level of pedigree.</p>
              <p>They have joint course agreements with MIT, Yale, etc. now. God knows how much they paid to establish these...but at least it'll put them on the academic map in Asia. The weird thing is how they've adopted the GPA system from the US.</p>

SENGKANG MARKET is expected to have 40 wet market stall, 10 dry sundry stall, 50 cooked food stall.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">So $500 000 a month, it means KOPITIAM must collect at least $5000 per month from each stalls! That's obscene.</p>

              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">Who should be blamed for the rising cost of living? KOPITIAM or HDB? For those who feel that Singapore tax little on our income, do think twice.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">Or course your indirect tax will be higher if you stayed in SENGKANG.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">Can we say no to KOPITIAM? What's wrong with current scheme of having HDB/NEA owning the Markets and Food Centres?</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">I am glad I stayed near 2 upgraded markets where the coffee stalls there still charged a cup of coffees at 60cents.</p>

              <p>This is all about them living in their ivory towers, not understanding the plight of the common person, and then insist everything is good and well.</p>

              <p><br>Are you kidding, wonder how can u be a business man? </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Inflation can determine a minimium wage, so too is cost of living. If given a chance, most western govt would like to abolish minimium wages, but their Unions would hv created a big big strike.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Wages should be set as flexible as possible, this is to prevent retrenchment leading high amount of jobless and in the end social chaos, for those unskilled jobless peoples, they will think of crimes, for those talented jobless, they will think of scam. No govt in any country will like to see jobless, the best is that all have jobs. Once peoples have jobs, they will think of other stupid thing to do, but of course for some peoples, they are lazy bums who dun wan to work even given a job, and then just like my Uncles...start to blame here and there, cos Uncles got no job, more time for comment and complain.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>During good times, minimium wage are usually negotiated upward in countries with minimium wages, no problem, everyone is happy with it, but in Bad times, their unions and workers will fight all the way  to prevent lowering of minimium wage set in good times, that created an inflexibility in the wages. And legally speaking the workers are on the right, cos the law already state min wage criteria. So, it become a hard time for companies to survive in these countries with minimium wages. And when the govt wanted to lower the minimium wages, street protests and strikes leading to a lose lose situation for all parties. Look at the Europeans, if they dun have degrees or skills, good luck to them, they can hardly find an operator job anymore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ours wages adopt a flexible wage system, just like liquidity, make it as soluable as possible. Our govt even implemented MVC, a variable component to allow wage cut in time of downturn, you may not appreciate these system in good time, but let me tell you, it work wonder in Bad time. A lot of job was saved. The govt also pour money to upgrade the skill of only Singaporeans who are instead of retrenched, were sent by the companies to take full time courses by paying nearly 80% of their salaries and when the economy is good again, Singaporeans can then be ploughed back to their own organisation with higher skill and education.</p>
