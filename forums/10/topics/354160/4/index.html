              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">MVC Component</span></strong></p>
              <p>MVC component. Really just another silly tool that complicates HR matters.</p>
              <p>Assuming you earn $3000.00, and part of it, let's say, $300 is MVC component, so what? What is the point of that? You are still getting $3000 per month, the worker doesn't CARE whether how much is MVC. Your salary is $3000, PERIOD.</p>
              <p>Bonus, on the other hand, is different. You can freeze bonuses, and the worker knows what it is, coz bonus is never a guarantee. MVC is just saying that $300 is something like a bonus, and yet it's not a bonus, thereby complicating matters.</p>
              <p>And when companies execute a pay cut, they <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">don't care </span></strong>how much of a MVC you have. Companies determine a pay cut mostly on a broad scale in order to make things simple. So they can choose to cut the pay of those who are earning less by, say 5%, and managers by, say 15%.</p>
              <p>At no point in time, do they care, how much MVC you have. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">EVERY single employee's MVC is DIFFERENT (based on their salary movements). Therefore, cutting pay using MVC is a heavily complex method that will tax your HR staff to the max.</span></strong></p>
              <p>Companies cut a percentage, and <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">do not care</span></strong> if they eat part, all of your MVC, or even impact your base pay.</p>
              <p>So, I am still waiting for angel7030 to substantiate her stand that MVC helps companies and save jobs. Based on my years of experience, most companies DON'T CARE.</p>

              <p>Actually as far as I know, I don't think many companies are using this variable component thing.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You are right in saying your monthly pay is your monthly pay.  The variable part is actually your bonus which even before this variable thing came along, is already variable anyway and dependent on company whether they want to give you 1 month or 5 months.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>They can come up with all sorts of equations stating you reduce this or increase that during a recession, but at the end of the day, everybody knows it's just for show.   If this was working, then why did they come with the recent job credit scheme?</p>

              <p>Hi charlize,</p>
              <p>you don't need a HR personnel to tell you more.</p>
              <p>You look at the papers and read about those pay cuts. Pay cuts are determined and fixed across-the-board for each group determined by the company. For instance, if you are an executive, your pay cut is n%. If you are a manager, your pay cut is m%.</p>
              <p>This already show that the companies executing those pay cuts do not care about MVC, because its more practical to implement an across-the-board pay-cut either based on:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Career Level you are on (Manager, executive, non-executive, etc)</li>
              <li>The dept you are in</li>
              <li>The country in which you are working in (for MNCs)</li>
              </ul>
              <p>The above already shows that MVC is never part of their consideration, because it doesnt' make sense. EVERY person's MVC component is different, because EVERY person's salary movement is unique. Executing a pay cut based on a person's MVC component is too complicated.</p>

              <p>What they do not realise is that there are top people out there who wants to do civil service. These people are genuinely interested in serving the nation. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Dont u ever tell me Rudd is stupid for becoming prime minister when he can be paid top $$$ if he works in ANZ or NAB. It is because one is alinged to one's social principles in their lives which drives them.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Paying top $$$ to attract talent may get u people who have a money motive in mind. And money spent on them will be wasted.</p>
              <p>Attracting people based on their interests will get u genuine people willing to excel. Then implement progressive wage increase to retain this group of people with regard to performance.  this is a sure way to weed out underperformers.</p>

              <p>Singapore uses marketing gimmicks. The word Talent is used to describe any foreign worker even if he or she is a toilet cleaner is because it will make the foreign workers think that in this country , like Australia every job is a respectable job but in reality , it is a different scenario.</p>

              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">MVC
              Component</span></strong></p>
              <p>MVC component. Really just another silly tool that complicates
              HR matters.</p>
              <p>Assuming you earn $3000.00, and part of it, let's say, $300 is
              MVC component, so what? What is the point of that? You are still
              getting $3000 per month, the worker doesn't CARE whether how much
              is MVC. Your salary is $3000, PERIOD.</p>
              <p>Bonus, on the other hand, is different. You can freeze bonuses,
              and the worker knows what it is, coz bonus is never a guarantee.
              MVC is just saying that $300 is something like a bonus, and yet
              it's not a bonus, thereby complicating matters.</p>
              <p>And when companies execute a pay cut, they <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">don't care</span></strong> how much
              of a MVC you have. Companies determine a pay cut mostly on a broad
              scale in order to make things simple. So they can choose to cut the
              pay of those who are earning less by, say 5%, and managers by, say
              15%.</p>
              <p>At no point in time, do they care, how much MVC you have.
              <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">EVERY single
              employee's MVC is DIFFERENT (based on their salary movements).
              Therefore, cutting pay using MVC is a heavily complex method that
              will tax your HR staff to the max.</span></strong></p>
              <p>Companies cut a percentage, and <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">do not care</span></strong> if they
              eat part, all of your MVC, or even impact your base pay.</p>
              <p>So, I am still waiting for angel7030 to substantiate her stand
              that MVC helps companies and save jobs. Based on my years of
              experience, most companies DON'T CARE.</p>

              <p>if it does in opposite directions, then the economy is a dud. The point of economy is to co relate with how we live and not destroy how we live.</p>
