            <div class='col-md body'><p>For many years, the Government has advocated a pro-business environment in Singapore. This is aimed at attracting foreign investors to set up businesses here and create more jobs for Singaporeans.<br><br>This strategy has been successful. Singapore has received many international awards for being a competitive economy and a world class workforce.<br><br>A hard working, well educated, productive and co-operative workforce is an important contributor to this pro-business environment. This strategy has also benefited many Singaporeans. They have the opportunity to get good jobs at high wages. Many multi-national companies set up their operations in Singapore to serve the Asian region. The demand for talent and for professions in accounting, legal, marketing, business development and other services have contributed to this happy situation.<br><br>To cope with the shortage of talent, Singapore has an open door policy to attract professionals and foreign talents to work in Singapore.<br><br>Depressed Wages<br><br>The open door cannot be restricted only for the talents that are scarce in Singapore. In any case, this type of people has not been defined clearly. <br><br>In practice, the open door policy has also been applied to other sectors of the labour force. The demand for workers willing to work for competitive wages extends down the skill ladder.<br><br><strong>Although there are controls to ensure a balance of local and foreign workers, they have been difficult to apply in practice. As a consequence, we have an abundance of low wage workers in Singapore</strong>. The actual number has not been published. If we look at the people who do not speak like Singaporeans working in the heartlands and in the factories, one can conclude that there must be a large number.<br><br><strong>One unfortunate consequence of this influx of foreign workers is the large number of local “mature” workers above 40 years who are unemployed.</strong><br><br>Choosy Workers<br><br><strong>A common explanation for the large number of unemployed workers is that they are “choosy”. They are not willing to do certain types of outdoor work, especially if they are risky or dirty. <br><br>I suspect that it is a question of adequate wages. If the jobs now shunned by Singaporeans pay adequate wages, I believe that many Singaporeans will be willing to do the work.</strong><br><br>I have spoken to many taxi drivers who are willing to work 12 hours a day just to earn $2,000 to feed a family. <br><br>There are many older Singaporeans who earn less than $800 a month as cleaners or security guards. They have no choice. They have to work or face starvation. Singapore does not provide any welfare.<br><br>I do not consider Singaporeans to be “choosy”. <br><br>Foreign workers<br><br>Employers will prefer to bring in foreign workers, as they are willing to accept any job and work for a low wage, so long as they earn enough to feed a family in their home country, where the cost of living is much lower than Singapore’s. They are usually provided with accommodation near their place of work and can save on the high accommodation and commuting cost.<br><br>In contrast, a Singaporean has to earn enough to feed a family in Singapore, with its high cost and standard of living. He has a family and social life in Singapore, he cannot live in a dormitory near his place of work. He has to incur high accommodation and travel costs. <br><br>Outsourcing<br><br>For many years, <strong>the public sector has been a source of employment for many lower educated workers in our society</strong>. They work as cleaners and provide a wide range of services in our hospitals, airports and other public services. <br><br>They earn a low wage, but it is adequate to feed a family. They are represented by the public sector’s trade unions, which look after their interests.<br><br><strong>In recent years, many of these jobs have been outsourced to the private sector</strong>. Instead of employing the direct workers, the government agencies have reorganised the work and retrenched the direct workers. They outsource the work to private contractors, to reduce their cost of operation. <br><br><strong>A contractor has to submit a low price to win the tender on a contract. The contractors re-employ the retrenched workers at lower wages, to do the same work that they did previously as direct workers. If the local workers are “choosy”, the contractor can find foreign workers willing to work for less. </strong><br><br>The contract is for a term of two or three years. On the renewal of the contract, the contract price is likely to reduce further, due to competition. This means even lower wages for the local contract workers.<br><br>Adequate salaries<br><br>I believe that local workers deserve to have an adequate salary for a hard day’s work. This salary has to be commensurate with the cost of living. It should be adequate for a worker to feed a family, at least in a frugal way. The worker should not be expected to work for 12 hours a day, and still not earn enough for the family.<br><br><strong>In some countries, this is achieved through a “minimum wage”. Even America, which is the strongest proponent of a free market economy and a flexible labour force, finds it necessary to have a minimum wage.<br><br></strong>Business has to be competitive<br><br>It has been argued that competitive wages and a flexible labour market are necessary for business to remain competitive and to stay in Singapore. This argument has been pushed too hard by our leaders. Many Singaporeans accept this argument quite blindly.<br><br><strong>Does it really help the country much for the public sector to save a few million dollars a year, by depressing the earnings of the contract workers who were previously the direct workers of the agencies?</strong><br><br>If businesses have to pay a more adequate wage to the low income workers, will the businesses become non-viable? I do not think so.<br><br><strong>These businesses can reduce the exorbitant earnings of their top directors and managers, or spend less on lavish offices or other business expenses</strong>. These businesses may earn less for shareholders, but will probably still find it quite attractive to remain in Singapore.<br><br>Pride to be a Singaporean<br><br>I believe that more people will be proud to be Singaporean, if they find that the nation looks after their interests and is willing to give them a fair standard of living for a hard day’s work. I hope that the wages of the lower income workers can be increased. This is even more pressing in 2008, due to the high inflation rate.<br></p></div>

              <p>I emphasize this, let the foreigners do the "choosy" jobs and citizens doing the higher end jobs. It is one of the ways to avoid problems instead of the "fair for all" policy. If u let foreigners do all kinds of jobs including the higher end ones, Soon u will  run into turnover and staff retention problems. The cycle is self feeding and it will continue until measures are put into place to address the root cause.</p>

              <p>I agree it is a skewed angle, and best is a shallow one. have we seen any intervies , stats or surveys on this? I dont remember seeing one</p>
              <p>What is their definition of a choosy job? toilet cleaner, construction worker ect? The citizen population of course, having a higher standard of living will not want to do such jobs , then the government should specifically address this problem and impose restrictive and binding  measures on hiring foreigners like what they do in commonwealth countries. In those countries, foreigners are only allowed to do the particular job they are given entry for.</p>
              <p>But yet i dont see the relation between competitive wage and minimum wage. How low can a competittive wage go?</p>
              <p>Any assumption is a dumb assumption if there is no baseline to do analysis. And how do not make sure that companies dont toy around with wage level fixing?</p>
              <p>Till now we dont have any statistics shown to us the relation between economic performance and wages. By far, wages have remained stagnant since the early 90s and its is getting only lower.</p>
              <p>The govt argues that maintaining a high population will ensure that business thrive in singapore but it also does not wish to acknowledge the fact that too many people willing to work will drive down wages.</p>
              <p>The solution is a minimum wage framework and a competitive leeway using this model will be the most ideal.</p>

              <p>In good time, singapore unemployment rate was only 2.0%, it is only now that there is a recession, so it may goes up to 5.0%. The govt is urging peoples to make changes and take on SPUR programme to upgrade themselves, skill redevelopment is critical for one employment.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As an aging population workforce, we need foreign physical powers and talents to help us grow. Of course those lazy ones will alway said that the govt dun take care of them and give jobs to foreign, but C"mon! nobody earn you a living, even a pros need to market herself for a price.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Like it or not, we must accept that our economy is a globalised one, very flexible yet volatile, one must work his/her way to competite against not just singapore, but the world.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If foreigners will to send back now, more companies will move out, and the result will be more singaporeans will be out of the jobs.</p>
              <p>The initiatives of Job credits by govt and effort put in for employing older workers is very much on the agenda of the govt. We therefore, hv to work hand in hand with foreigners, take them as a helper who keep our economy vibrant.</p>

              <p>those countries that set up office or factories in singapore is just here for cheap labour? our labour are never going to be cheaper than thailand, malaysia or china. so what is the pt? minimum wage without the require productivity to show for it is ppintless, that why indonesia failed. setting minimum wage structure will push companies to retrain or upgrade their facilities to increase the productivity of the factory of offices. This will inturn reduce the nos of foreigners needed and thus it is a win win situation for both singapore, employers, and singaporeans!</p>

              <p>The basic reason for minimum wage is essentially to ensure that people are making enough to cover their very basic cost of living in terms of food and lodging in that country.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Nobody is asking for $10 an hour minimum wage.  Just a reasonable figure that a worker can earn in a month just to survive.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Cost of living in singapore is already starting to get out of hand.  You can tell the low skilled workers to keep upgrading to improve on their productivity, but with the extreme open door policy of the government, there is bound to be a foreign worker equally productive that will demand a lower wage than those upgraded workers.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The role of the government should be to balance economic growth with social development.  If there is a need to sacrifice a little bit off GDP growth for the sake of social harmony, then be it. </p>

              <p>yes, it is across the board for every trade. it is one of the most important policy fundamentals which made Australia thrive as an economy, an attractive destination for workers from all over the globe.</p>

But still they are the same or lower price than in singapore.  Why is that their system can thrive and not ours?</p>
              <p>Only problem in Australia is the low population. Once this problem is solved, i can guarantee tax levels will do down int he future and it will overtake singapore as the most preferred place to live.</p>

              their minimum wages cannot compete with other countries flexible
              wages system. So be it, if they set Minimium wages, we gain from
              it. Without a flexible wages system, companies may survive on the
              context of good economy, but not in downtime, they simply cannot
              paid that kind of wages and stay competative.</p>

              <p>Social unrest in indonesia is partly due to jobless becos of
              minimium wages, all jobs had gone out.</p>

              <p>yes, in Australia things are still going fine. Australia is a
              very fair place. After taxes u still make 2x more in any job than
              in singapore. Adn their services have 10% GST. But still they are
              the same or lower price than in singapore.  Why is that their
              system can thrive and not ours?</p>
              <p>Only problem in Australia is the low population. Once this
              problem is solved, i can guarantee tax levels will do down int he
              future and it will overtake singapore as the most preferred place
              to live.</p>

              <p>Seriously, Australia IS already a preferred place to live, at least for many Singaporeans who finally get so pissed with the govt here, that they emigrate to Australia and finally found out that we are being duped here in this small little well.</p>
              <p>I have been there myself, and I love the huge and beautiful country that can be explored endlessly. And like we have mentioned, the cost of living is not any higher than ours. So what is so great about our island, other than our own fear of embracing something new and moving to somewhere to start afresh?</p>

              <p>I'm currently a foreign talent in the US, or what the Singapore government refers to as a "quitter".</p>
              <p>I feel that the US system for bringing in foreign talent legally is very fair. It's based on a limited number of work visas issued per year based on what projected shortfalls they have in areas of industry where local talent is insufficient (technology mainly).</p>
              <p>Most importantly, when they employ foreign nationals into a job position, there is NO WAGE SUPPRESSION. I'm paid dollar for dollar the same as my US-born counterparts. Therefore, it's absolutely clear that the only motivation for requiring foreign talent is to really fill any voids in key job positions. This makes sure that any foreign talent the US brings in is only of the highest caliber, and you can see this from the fact the ~50% of Silicon Valley companies are formed by foreign nationals.</p>
              <p>What the Singapore government is doing appears to be the complete opposite. No doubt, they bring in large numbers of low wage and lowly educated foreign workers for the construction indursty, which is labour intensive, but why do we also see numerous China nationals working in our F&amp;B and service industries? I think Singaporeans are more than willing to take these jobs.</p>
              <p>Also, you see many Filipino and China engineers now, but they are paid 60% of what their Singaporean colleagues make. How is that fair?</p>
              <p>In addition, why is it also that the majority of education scholarships now provided by the government are earmarked for foreigners only? These are scholarships paid for with Singaporean tax dollars. I've met many a Chinese national here in the US who studied(scholarship) and worked in Singapore for a few years, only to come to the US for graduate school and live here. Singapore has become only a stepping stone for them, and the government should really start trending this statistic.</p>
              <p>Enough said, I have to get back to my job as a foregin talent...</p>
