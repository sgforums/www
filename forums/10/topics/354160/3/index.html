              <p><br> Are you kidding, wonder how can u be a business man? </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Inflation can determine a minimium wage, so too is cost of
              living. If given a chance, most western govt would like to abolish
              minimium wages, but their Unions would hv created a big big
              strike.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Wages should be set as flexible as possible, this is to prevent
              retrenchment leading high amount of jobless and in the end social
              chaos, for those unskilled jobless peoples, they will think of
              crimes, for those talented jobless, they will think of scam. No
              govt in any country will like to see jobless, the best is that all
              have jobs. Once peoples have jobs, they will think of other stupid
              thing to do, but of course for some peoples, they are lazy bums who
              dun wan to work even given a job, and then just like my
              Uncles...start to blame here and there, cos Uncles got no job, more
              time for comment and complain.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>During good times, minimium wage are usually negotiated upward
              in countries with minimium wages, no problem, everyone is happy
              with it, but in Bad times, their unions and workers will fight all
              the way  to prevent lowering of minimium wage set in
              good times, that created an inflexibility in the wages. And legally
              speaking the workers are on the right, cos the law already state
              min wage criteria. So, it become a hard time for companies to
              survive in these countries with minimium wages. And when the govt
              wanted to lower the minimium wages, street protests and
              strikes leading to a lose lose situation for all parties. Look at
              the Europeans, if they dun have degrees or skills, good luck to
              them, they can hardly find an operator job anymore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ours wages adopt a flexible wage system, just like liquidity,
              make it as soluable as possible. Our govt even implemented MVC, a
              variable component to allow wage cut in time of downturn, you may
              not appreciate these system in good time, but let me tell you,
              it work wonder in Bad time. A lot of job was saved. The govt also
              pour money to upgrade the skill of only Singaporeans who are
              instead of retrenched, were sent by the companies to
              take full time courses by paying nearly 80% of their salaries
              and when the economy is good again, Singaporeans can then be
              ploughed back to their own organisation with higher skill and
              education.</p>

              <p><br>Recently british given away most of it low skill and labouring jobs to Italy workers who dun mind getting lower pay than the minimum wages. Same goes to Mexicans and south americans who went up north to take up lower paid jobs in America that the owners are allowed to pay them below minimium wage standards. The govt of these countries actually wanted to abolish welfare funds and also minimum wages so as to allow flexibilities in term of market condition. In the case of GM motors, Obama had pointed out to the Unions, you either except wage cut to below minimium wages or no bailing out. Same goes to their executive minimium wage critieras.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However since colonisation, alots of western countries and some asian colonised countries adopted welfare fund and minimium wages. Yes, as a citizen you are part of the country, you are eligble for welfare fund if the country govt dun provide a job for you, but however alot of abuse were taken to lay hand on the welfare fund, it is not that there is no jobs, it just some people dun wan to work and gives lots of excuses, all these only encourage laziness, non competitive, lack of performance and weak productivity.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Minimium wages tends increase during good times, because labour competition will be tight, alots of workers is needed, it is a labour market improvement, so unions will take this opportunity to demand for higher min wage, at that time, the desparate employers would agree to it, and the govt in good times will raise the min wages and demand for labour increase.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But then when the bad times arrived, do you think the workers and their unions are willing to forgo and reduce the minimum wages...not without a fight that can cause chaos to the country economy and strike that can move companies out of the country.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You are wrong, MVC do helped both public and private sector, it is under mandatory laws that MVC must be negiotate first before retrenchment and retrenchment is the last resort. Sony reduced it MVC once, so is HP, so is Siemen, so are many others, but of course not all successful, after MVC reduction, company still cannot maintain it cost, then retrenchment sat in. In whatever the popularity of MVC or other variable components in salary structure, it act as a buffer as far as it can withhold, but of course if a company tell the govt that cutting MVC also cannot survive, then that is it.</p>

              pay, or cut jobs.</p>
              <p>If you feel that what I said about MVC is wrong, then show us
              statistics on how MVC helps us. I see no practical usage of it
              during my years of work.</p>

              <p><br> Recently british given away most of it low skill and labouring jobs
              to Italy workers who dun mind getting lower pay than the minimum
              wages. Same goes to Mexicans and south americans who went up north
              to take up lower paid jobs in America that the owners are allowed
              to pay them below minimium wage standards. The govt of these
              countries actually wanted to abolish welfare funds and also minimum
              wages so as to allow flexibilities in term of market condition. In
              the case of GM motors, Obama had pointed out to the Unions, you
              either except wage cut to below minimium wages or no bailing
              out. Same goes to their executive minimium wage critieras.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However since colonisation, alots of western countries and some
              asian colonised countries adopted welfare fund and minimium wages.
              Yes, as a citizen you are part of the country, you are eligble for
              welfare fund if the country govt dun provide a job for you, but
              however alot of abuse were taken to lay hand on the welfare fund,
              it is not that there is no jobs, it just some people dun wan to
              work and gives lots of excuses, all these only encourage laziness,
              non competitive, lack of performance and weak productivity.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Minimium wages tends increase during good times, because labour
              competition will be tight, alots of workers is needed, it is a
              labour market improvement, so unions will take this
              opportunity to demand for higher min wage, at that time,
              the desparate employers would agree to it, and the govt in good
              times will raise the min wages and demand for labour
              increase.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But then when the bad times arrived, do you think the
              workers and their unions are willing to forgo and reduce the
              minimum wages...not without a fight that can cause chaos to the
              country economy and strike that can move companies out of the
              country.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You are wrong, MVC do helped both public and private sector, it
              is under mandatory laws that MVC must be negiotate first before
              retrenchment and retrenchment is the last resort. Sony reduced it
              MVC once, so is HP, so is Siemen, so are many others, but of
              course not all successful, after MVC reduction, company still
              cannot maintain it cost, then retrenchment sat in. In whatever the
              popularity of MVC or other variable components in salary
              structure, it act as a buffer as far as it can withhold, but of
              course if a company tell the govt that cutting MVC also cannot

              <p>You see, you are again taking minimum wage system as a binary 1 or 0, like a true Singaporean. Why is it that there is no other way of improving a system that helps to act as a protection against exploitation of workers?</p>
              <p>Granted, in the West, there are many countries that have too much welfare, BUT, that is about welfare, EVERY benefit in the system. Minimum Wage system is but just one of the many tools that can benefit the worker.</p>
              <p>We learn through history. What is so wrong about the ideals of a Minimum wage system, that you are so dead against a benefit for you? If we learn how to be OPEN to ideas, and to reengineer the system to improve its implementation, why do you then think we will follow the failure of the West?</p>
              <p>Everything has a first. The first attempt at inventing the fork failed because the fork point was too blunt and the inventor was not able to demonstrate its effectiveness. If everyone is like you, insisting that others have tried before and have failed, then how do we as a human race progress? How do we, Singapore, a country who is encouraging Singaporeans to be creative, progress? Because EVERYONE learns through failure</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">MVC</span></strong></p>
              <p>I am sorry, I don't agree with your views that HP, Siemen has tried to reduce the MVC. My company is affliated to HP, so I can only think you are getting your information from heresy, and not directly experiencing it. As far as I know, HP did a pay cut, and its regardless of your MVC component.</p>
              <p>I would also like to clarify your <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">incorrect </span></strong>representation of the MVC. It is NOT mandatory for a company to consider reducing the MVC component of the salary during bad times. It is ONLY A GUIDELINE that the MVC should be considered during expense controls (There is minimal protection for workers above a monthly salary of S$2,000.00)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">You, a Consultant? Please show us some standards first</span></strong></p>
              <p>If you want to be a consultant, you need to have a certain level of standards. No, I will never pay for your services, because you do not even get your research done properly. Not to mention, you are too rigid and not being able to offer me more creative solutions to problems (since you feel that the Minimum Wage System concept will 100% fail, it only shows you cannot differentiate the concept from the implementation)</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Facts don't support minimum-wage critics <br><br>By James Weatherford<br><br>State Rep. Colleen Meyer is sounding a false alarm based on familiar, if unfounded, warnings about increasing the minimum wage ("Minimum wage hike would hurt everyone," March 27). The oft-repeated siren of minimum-wage doomsayers warns that an increase in the minimum wage would close businesses and cost jobs.<br><br>To add to this siren, Meyer spreads before us a game of chance: one pea, three shells. I wonder who owns the pea in this game? Not a minimum-wage worker trying to feed a family on $6.25 an hour. For that family, playing a game with a pea doesn't happen. A minimum-wage worker would rather share the pea with her hungry family.<br><br>The shells? Think shelter.<br><br>Rep. Meyer, R-47th (Ha'iku, Kahalu'u, La'ie), alludes cryptically to unidentified "studies" that "show clearly" the dire consequences of increasing the minimum wage.<br><br>I refer to research by the Fiscal Policy Institute and the Economic Policy Institute that reveals a reality different from the apocalyptic claims of minimum-wage doomsayers.<br><br>The research has found no correlation between minimum-wage increases and a rise in business failures, either in the year the increase occurred or in the following year. The economy, especially small business, has done well in the years following implementation of a minimum wage. In the wake of minimum-wage increases in both 1990 and 1997, the U.S. economy had strong growth. Between 1998 and 2001, the number of small-business establishments grew twice as quickly in states with higher minimum wages.<br><br>A comparison of states with minimum wages above the federal level has shown that increasing the minimum wage has not resulted in less hiring. Since the minimum-wage increase in 1997, low-wage workers, particularly single mothers, have found employment at increased rates. Those who will benefit most from a higher minimum wage are concentrated among working women, many of whom are single mothers. Among the workers to benefit from a minimum-wage increase, 60 percent are female and 72 percent are age 20 years and over.<br><br>The reality is that minimum wages do not cause business failure nor result in job losses, as claimed by the doomsayers.<br><br>How does a higher minimum wage affect the economy?<br><br>Raising one worker's "minimum wage from its current rate of $6.25 to as much as $8" does give that one worker a "28 percent wage hike." However, for a wage-earning worker now at $6.75 or $7.75 an hour, the pay raise is less than a "drastic" 28 percent.<br><br>Nevertheless, about that one worker: Ms. Cleaning Lady would get a 28 percent raise on her job where she empties the trash cans and washes the urinals of million-dollar executives.<br><br>Ms. Cleaning Lady might spend some of the extra wage on clothes for herself and her family, or maybe for a new sofa or refrigerator. If she is frugal, she can save some of these extra earnings for her child's high school education. If she is a miracle worker, she can save for the child's college education.<br><br>When a low-income worker with minimal material wealth gets an increase in wage, a large part of that increase is spent on basic personal and household items. Purchases of clothes, sofas and refrigerators circulate money in the economy and register demand for these products. Because satisfying customers' needs is what matters most in a market economy, employers increase hiring to satisfy demand generated by increased income.<br><br>The economic common sense of workers as buyers, and wages as expenditures, seems to escape minimum-wage doomsayers, who also appear naive to the futility of trying to sell anything to a customer who has no money.<br><br>James Weatherford is a resident of Kea'au, Hawai'i. He wrote this commentary for The Advertiser.<br></p></div>

              <p>Seriously, whether Singapore builds in a minimum wage or not, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">does not impact me at all </span></strong>in terms of my salary, and may only increase upon my cost of living (if those critics of welfare to the average worker are proven true).</p>
              <p>So why am I arguing for it then and going against the likes of angel7030 on this issue?</p>
              <p>It's because I feel this is an effective method to ensure the lower income families are able to reap some benefits from the economic progress of our country.</p>
