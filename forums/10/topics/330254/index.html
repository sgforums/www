              <p><strong>Oscar Iden Lecture Three: "The State of  Individuals"</strong></p>
              <p><strong></strong><strong>Prof. Carroll Quigley</strong></p>
              <p>This is the most difficult of the three lectures I'm giving on the
                  history of the thousand years of the growth of public authority. What
                  happened in the last two hundred years is fairly clear to me, but it is
                  not easy to convey it to you, even those of you who have had courses
                  with me and are familiar with the framework of much of my thinking. One
                  reason for this difficulty, of course, is the complexity of the subject
                  itself, but after all, the preceding eight hundred years were quite as
                  complex as the last two hundred years we will deal with this evening. A
                  much more fundamental reason for the difficulty is this: The reality of
                  the last two hundred years of the history of the history of Western
                  Civilization, including the history of our own country, is not
                  reflected in the general brainwashing you have received, in the
                  political mythology you have been hearing, or in the historiography of
                  the period as it exists today.</p>
              <p>I will divide the period from 1776 to 1976 into two parts. The
                  first, to about 1890, was a period of expansion of industrial society;
                  the last eighty years, approximately, have been an age of profound <br> crisis, not only in our own country, but in Western Civilization, which
                  is the unit in which I carry on my thinking on the subject. In order to
                  deal with this period, I have to go back to fundamentals, and
                  particularly to the fundamentals of human values, and to do that, we
                  must have paradigms.<br> The whole thousand years, as I explained in my first lecture, is a
                  shift from a society made up of communities in 976, to a society today,
                  where we have states of monstrous power and atomised individuals. I
                  will use certain definitions: A society is an organization of persons
                  and artefacts-- things made by people-- and it's an organization to
                  satisfy human needs. It would not exist if it had not come into
                  existence to satisfy human needs. Notice: I do not say human desires.
                  One of the striking things about our society today is the remoteness of
                  our desires from our needs. If you ask anyone what he wants, what he
                  desires, he will give you a list of things which are as remote as can
                  be from human needs. In our society, the process we have been tracing
                  for a thousand years is the growth of the state. As I indicated in the
                  first lecture, a state is not the same thing as a society, although the
                  Greeks and the Romans thought it was.  A state is an organization of
                  power on a territorial basis. The link between a society, whether it be
                  made up of communities or individuals, and a state is this: Power rests
                  on the ability to satisfy human needs.</p>
              <p>Now I will put on the board something with which former students are
                  familiar. I always call it the levels of culture, the aspects of a
                  society: military, political, economic, social, emotional, religious,
                  and intellectual. Those are your basic human needs. The interesting
                  thing about them is that they are arranged in evolutionary sequence.
                  Millions of years ago, even before men became human, they had a need
                  for defence of the group, because it is perfectly obvious that men
                  cannot live outside of groups. They can satisfy their needs only by
                  cooperating within a group. But I'll go further than that, and return
                  to it again in a moment: Men will not become men unless they grow up in
                  communities. We will come back to that because it is the basis of my
                  lecture tonight.</p>
              <p>If you have a group, it must be defended against outsiders; that's
                  military. Before men came out of the trees they had that need. If your
                  needs are to be satisfied within some kind of group, you must have ways
                  of settling disputes and arguments, and reconciling individual problems
                  within the group; that's political. You must have organizational
                  patterns for satisfying material needs, food, clothing, shelter: that's
                  economic.</p>
              <p>Then came two which have been largely been destroyed or frustrated
                  in the last thousand years of Western Civilization. Men have social
                  needs. They have a need for other people; they have a need to love and
                  be loved. They have a need to be noticed. Sirhan Sirhan killed Robert
                  Kennedy because no one had ever noticed him and he was determined that,
                  from now on, someone would know he existed. In fact, most of these
                  "motiveless" assassinations are of this type. Someone went up to the
                  top of the University of Texas tower and shot something like seventeen
                  people before they caught him. That was because no one had ever noticed
                  him. People need other people. That's the social need. The basis of
                  social relationships is reciprocity: if you cooperate with others,
                  others will cooperate with you.</p>
              <p>The next is emotional need. Men must have emotional experiences.
                  This is obtained in two ways that I can see: moment to moment
                  relationships with other people--moment to moment-- and moment to
                  moment relationships with nature. Our society has so cluttered up our
                  lives with artefacts-- TV sets or automobiles or whatever-- and
                  organizational structures that moment to moment with nature are almost
                  impossible.  Most people don't even know what the weather outside is
                  like. Someone said recently that until September we had a great drought
                  here in Washington, and four or five people standing there said,
                  "That's ridiculous." We had a shortage of about eight inches of rain.
                  Because they're in buildings, it doesn't matter to them whether it's
                  raining or not.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The next is the religious. It became fashionable in Western
                  Civilization, particularly in the last hundred years, to be scornful of
                  religion. But it is a fact that human beings have religious needs. They
                  have a need for a feeling of certitude in their minds about things they
                  cannot control and they do not fully understand, and with humility,
                  they will admit they do not understand them. When you destroy people's
                  religious expression, they will establish secularised religions like
                  Marxism.</p>
              <p>Now, on the intellectual level: people have intellectual needs.  I
                  used to tell students that Marilyn Monroe had profound intellectual
                  needs. And when no one would treat her as an intellect or even as a
                  potential intellect, for obvious reasons, she was starved for
                  intellectual experience. That's why she married a man like Arthur
                  Miller: she thought he was an intellectual.</p>
              <p>All right, those are human needs. Power is the ability to satisfy
                  those needs. And someone who says that power is organised force, or
                  that power is the outcome of an election, or that power is the ability
                  to cut off our oil supply, has a completely  inadequate way of looking
                  at it. My experience and study of the destruction of civilizations and
                  the collapse of great empires has convinced me that empires and
                  civilizations do not collapse because of deficiencies on the military
                  or the political levels. The Roman army never met an army that was
                  better than it was. But the Roman army could not be sustained when all
                  these things had collapsed and no one cared. No one wanted to serve, no
                  one wanted to pay taxes, no one cared.</p>
              <p>The other part of this will require you to put these things together
                  to some extent. Persons, personalities if you wish, can be made only in
                  communities. A community is made up of intimate relationships among
                  diverse types of individuals--a kinship group, a local group, a
                  neighbourhood, a village, a large family. Without communities, no
                  infant will be sufficiently socialized. He may grow up to be forty
                  years old, he may have made an extremely good living, he may have
                  engendered half a dozen children, but he is still an infant unless he
                  has been properly socialized and that occurs in the first four or five
                  years of life. In our society today, we have attempted to throw the
                  whole burden of socializing out population upon the school system, to
                  which the individual arrives only at the age of four or five. A few
                  years ago they had big programs to take children to school for a few
                  hours at age two and three and four, but that will not socialize them.
                  The first two years are important. The way a child is treated in the
                  first two days is of vital importance. He has to be loved, above all he
                  has to be talked to. A state of individuals, such as we have now
                  reached in Western Civilization, will not create persons, and the
                  atomized individuals who make it up will be motivated by desires which
                  do not necessarily reflect needs. Instead of needing other people they
                  need a shot of heroin; instead of some kind of religious conviction,
                  they have to be with the winning team.</p>
              <p>Human needs are the basis of power. The state, as I said, is a power
                  structure on a territorial basis, and the state will survive only if it
                  has sufficient ability to satisfy enough of these needs. It is not
                  enough for it to have organized force, and when a politician says,
                  "Elect me President and I will establish law and order," he means
                  organized force or power of other kinds. I won't analyze this level;
                  it's too complex and we don't have time. I will simply say that the
                  object of the political level is to legitimise power: that is, to get
                  people, in their minds, to recognize and accept the actual power
                  relationship in their society.</p>
              <p>Next Tuesday a decision will be made as to who will be President of
                  the United States. That will not necessarily reflect the actual power
                  relationships in the United States at all. If all the people who are
                  intellectually frustrated would vote, the result might be quite
                  different. Many of you come to these lectures because you are
                  intellectually frustrated, and you want to be exposed again to my
                  insistent demands that you think about things. For example, we no
                  longer have intellectually satisfying arrangements in our educational
                  system, in our arts, humanities or anything else; instead we have
                  slogans and ideologies. An ideology is a religious or emotional
                  expression; it is not an intellectual expression. So when a society is
                  reaching its end, in the last couple of centuries you have what I call
                  misplacement of satisfactions. You find your emotional satisfaction in
                  making a lot of money, or in being elected to the White House in 1972,
                  or in proving to the poor, half-naked people of Southeast Asia that you
                  can kill them in large numbers.</p>
              <p>The state is a good state if it is sovereign and if it is
                  responsible. It is more or less incidental whether a state is, for
                  example, democratic. If democracy reflects the structure of power in
                  the society, then the state should be democratic. But if the pattern of
                  power in a society is not democratic, then you cannot have a democratic
                  state. This is what happens in Latin America, Africa and places like
                  that, when you have an election and the army doesn't like the man who
                  is elected, so they move in and throw him out. The outcome of the
                  election does not reflect the power situation, in which the dominant
                  thing is organized force. When I say governments have to be
                  responsible, I'm saying the same thing as when I said they have to be
                  legitimate: they have to reflect the power structure of the society.
                  Politics is the area for establishing responsibility by legitimising
                  power, that is, somehow demonstrating the power structure to people,
                  and it may take a revolution, such as the French Revolution, and it may
                  take a war, like the American Civil War. In the American Civil War, for
                  example, the structure of power in the United States was such--perhaps
                  unfortunately, I don't know-- that the South could not leave unless the
                  North was willing. It was that simple. But it took a war to prove it.</p>
              <p>I defined sovereignty last time, but I want to run through it for
                  the benefit of those who weren't here. Sovereignty has eight aspects:
                  DEFENSE; JUDICIAL, settling disputes; ADMINISTRATIVE, discretionary
                  actions for the public need; TAXATION, mobilizing resources: this is
                  one of the powers the French government didn't have in 1770;
                  LEGISLATION. The finding of rules and the establishment of rules
                  through promulgation and statue; EXECUTIVE, the enforcement of laws and
                  judicial decisions. Then there are two which are of absolute paramount
                  importance today: MONETARY, the creation and control of money and
                  credit--if that is not an aspect of the public sovereignty, then the
                  state is far less than fully sovereign; and the eight one, THE
                  INCORPORATING POWER, the right to say that an association of people is
                  a fictitious person with the right to hold property and to sue in the
                  courts. Notice: the federal government of the United States today does
                  not have the seventh and eight but I'll come back to that later.</p>
              <p>In the meantime, I'm still on my introduction for this evening, and
                  I want to discuss what happened in the last thousand years. If we go
                  back before 976, when you had communities, the main core of people's
                  life and experience, which controlled their behaviour and determined
                  their lives--controls and rewards, I call it--was in the religious,
                  emotional and social levels. They had religious beliefs, they social
                  and emotional relationships with the people they saw every day. That
                  was the core of their lives. The significant thing is that those
                  controls and rewards were internalised: they were what was acquired
                  very largely in the first four or five years of life. When a child is
                  born, he is nor a person, he is a human being. He is utterly potential.
                  When someone becomes a personality, such as you or myself, then he has
                  traits, which were acquired out of his potentialities as the result of
                  experience over numerous years.</p>
              <p>This is why they could get along without a state in 976: all the
                  significant controls were internalised. I took the year 976 because,
                  although Western Civilization had come into existence about two hundred
                  years before that, it began to expand in 976. By that I mean they began
                  to produce more goods per person per day per year. You know what I mean
                  by expansion if you took my freshman course: increased output per
                  capita, increased knowledge, increased geographic area for the
                  civilization itself, and increased population. That began in 976, and
                  we'll put an arrow here at the economic level to indicate it. The
                  economic expansion was achieved chiefly by specialization and exchange:
                  instead of each little group's trying to satisfy all its own needs,
                  groups began to concentrate and, for example, produce wool and exchange
                  it for other things. That process of increasing specialization and
                  exchange, which is the basis of expansion in our civilization, I call<br> commercialization. As long as the society is expanding, that process of
                  commercialisation will continue as it has for a thousand years in our
                  society, so that today everything is commercialised, politics,
                  religion, education, ideology, belief, the armed services. Practically
                  everything is commercialised; everything has its price.</p>
              <p>When this expansion reaches a crisis, you get increasing
                  politicisation. I won't go into the details of this. It can be
                  explained in detail, as most of you, perhaps, know. Politicization
                  means that the expansion is slowing up, and you are no longer
                  attempting to achieve increased output per capita, or increased wealth,
                  or increased satisfactions, or whatever is motivating you, by economic
                  expansion, but you are doing so by mobilizing power. We have seen this
                  going on in our society for almost a century.</p>
              <p>And then, as the society continues and does not reform, you get
                  increased militarisation.  You can certainly see that process in
                  Western Civilization and in the history of the United States. In the
                  last forty years our society has been drastically militarized. It isn't
                  yet as militarized as other societies and other periods have been; we
                  still have a long way to go in this direction. Our civilization has a
                  couple of centuries to go, I would guess. Things are moving faster than
                  they did in any civilization I ever knew before this one, but we
                  probably will have another century or two.</p>
              <p>As this process goes on, you get certain other things. I've hinted
                  at a number of them. One is misplacement of satisfactions. You find
                  your satisfactions--your emotional satisfaction, your social
                  satisfaction-- not in moment to moment relationships with nature or
                  other people, but with power, or with wealth, or even with organized
                  force--sadism, in some cases: Go out and murder a lot of people in a
                  war, a just war, naturally.</p>
              <p>The second thing that occurs as this goes on is increasing
                  remoteness of desires from needs. I've mentioned this. The next thing
                  is an increasing confusion between means and ends. The ends are the
                  human needs, but if I asked people what these needs are, they can
                  hardly tell me. Instead they want the means they have been brainwashed
                  to accept, that they think will satisfy their needs. But it's perfectly
                  obvious that the methods that we have been using are not working. Never
                  was any society in human history as rich and as powerful as Western
                  Civilization and the United States, and it is not a happy society. Just
                  this week, I looked at a book called "The Joyless Economy", by an
                  economist, Tibor Scitovsky, who diagrammed some of these things.</p>
              <p>In the final aspect of this process, controls on behaviour shift
                  from the intermediate levels of human experience--social, emotional and
                  religious--to the lower, military and political, or to the upper,
                  ideological. They become the externalized controls of a mature society:
                  weapons, bureaucracies, material rewards, or ideology. Customary
                  conformity is replaced by conscious decision-making, and this usually
                  implies a shift from your own conformity to someone else's decision. In
                  its final stages, the civilization becomes a dualism of almost
                  totalitarian imperial power and an amorphous mass culture of atomized
                  individuals.</p>
              <p>All of this is for the sake of establishing a few  paradigms.</p>
              <p>What happened in the last two hundred years? In 1776, Western
                  Civilization was approaching a revolutionary situation.  A
                  revolutionary situation is one in which the structure of power--real
                  power--is not reflected in the structure of law, institutions, and
                  conventional arrangements. Law and legal arrangements, including
                  constitutional structures, were not legitimate in much of Western
                  Civilization in 1776. They were not responsible because they did not
                  reflect power. Whether it was the English Parliament, which had a legal
                  right to rule America; or the nightmarish constitution of France, which
                  no longer reflected the structure in French society in any way; or,
                  east of the Rhine, the enlightened despotisms, the laws of the polity
                  did not reflect the power structure of Europe at all, as Napoleon very
                  soon showed them. This, therefore, is a revolutionary situation.</p>
              <p>Let's look a little more closely at these.</p>
              <p>In England, the laws of the polity established control of the
                  country in an oligarchy of landowners, the Whig oligarchy. Members of
                  the House of Commons were sent to Parliament by pieces of land, and
                  anyone who owned a piece of land with the right to send a member to
                  Parliament, could do so whether anyone lived on the piece of land or
                  not. It was not a reflection of the power structure of England to say
                  that pieces of land were powerful. I do not have to demonstrate to you
                  that the legal arrangements by which the British Parliament made rules
                  to govern life in the United States were equally unrealistic.</p>
              <p>I'll leave France for a moment and go east of the Rhine. In Central
                  Europe we had what was called Enlightened Despotism: small
                  principalities ruled by despots who had a legal right to say, "This
                  will happen; that will happen; something else will happen." In the
                  period from 1776 onward, for about twenty-five years, they tried to
                  establish a more rational life in their principalities, but they
                  couldn't do it. Their system of weights and measures--I won't attempt
                  to describe them to you--were absolute, unholy chaos. They had a
                  different weight or measurement for every commodity and those
                  measurements changed as you went from village to village or from
                  district to district. They also had been changing in size for hundreds
                  of years, because the power of the creditors was so great that, if you
                  owed a bushel of wheat to your landlord, all the landlords together,
                  over generations, could make the bushel a larger measure.</p>
              <p>I discussed Eastern Europe adequately in my last lecture. I'll
                  simply point out that in this period Poland disappeared, because the
                  Polish landlord class would rather keep their serfs than be politically
                  independent. They were unwilling to organize a modern army with modern
                  weapons and modern military training to defend Poland against outside
                  enemies, such as Prussia, Russia or Austria. As a result, those three
                  got together and divided up Poland in 1795, so Poland no longer
                  existed. Under Napoleon there was a Grand Duchy of Warsaw, but Poland
                  did not exist again until 1919.</p>
              <p>In France, as I described to you last week, the polity had reached a
                  condition of total paralysis. The government did not have sovereignty.
                  It did not have the taxing power; it did not have the legislative
                  power; it did not have the incorporating power; it did not have the
                  judicial power; it did not have most of the eight aspects of
                  sovereignty I've mentioned to you. And in 1776 the government became
                  aware of this, when they tried to abolish the guilds and could not do
                  so, because under the law they could not be abolished unless their
                  debts were paid. The government could not pay their debts because it
                  did not have the taxing power. And it didn't have the taxing power
                  because it didn't have the judicial power: if it took someone to court,
                  the judges would say, "No, you have no right to examine his income. You
                  can ask him what he has been paying for the last couple of hundred
                  years on that piece of property or whatever it is."</p>
              <p>The result was the explosion of the French Revolution, which
                  produced, by the time of Napoleon, let's say 1805, the most sovereign
                  state in Europe. Notice: Napoleon was an enlightened despot, the last
                  one in Europe. Anyone who says, as Robert Palmer, for instance, that
                  France was leading the parade in 1789 in terms of government and public
                  authority, just doesn't know what he's talking about. In 1789 France
                  was bringing up the absolute rear as far as public authority and
                  sovereignty were concerned. That is why France gets its enlightened
                  despot so late. He wasn't <br> even a Frenchman; he was an Italian;
                  and he imposed an Italian government on France. Because it was so
                  rational, so powerful, so well-organized, and the new sovereignty was
                  embodied in a new entity, the nation, it had a power which made it
                  possible foe Napoleon to conquer almost all of Europe. He was, however,
                  ultimately defeated, as most conquerors of all Europe have been
                  throughout history: William II in 1918, Hitler in 1945, Phillip II in
                  the sixteenth century, Henry V of England the early fifteenth century,
                  and so forth.</p>
              <p>By 1820, after the Napoleonic system had been replaced, all four of
                  these geographical zones I have mentioned were unstable, but they were
                  much more stable and much more legitimate then they had been in 1776.
                  Now, although I say that in 1820 they were fundamentally not that
                  stable, we know there was political stability in Europe for at least
                  three generations after that date, until at least the 1860's. There was
                  a brief war in 1866 but I won't go into that. The stability of Europe
                  from 1815 to 1855 is something on which we now look with nostalgia. The
                  reasons for this apparent stability had nothing to do with the
                  structure of the state, except the degree to which<br> the structure of
                  the state had become sufficiently rationalized and sovereign through
                  the period of revolution from 1776 to about 1820. With additional
                  events, the situation looked like stability, and these additional
                  events produced a new Age of Expansion.</p>
              <p>The first of these was the expansion of technology, including the
                  Agricultural and Industrial Revolutions. The Agricultural Revolution of
                  about 1720 and onward made it possible to produce more and more food
                  from land with less and less labour. The Industrial Revolution began
                  about 1750 and was the application of inanimate energy to the
                  production on a large scale. (Incidentally, 1776 is a very significant
                  year, and this is not just because the American Revolution began during
                  it. Watt's patent of the steam engine was in 1776; Adam Smith's Wealth
                  of Nations was published in 1776; the failure of the French to
                  reorganise their political system occurred in 1776, and so forth.) The
                  disruption of communities, the destruction of religion and the
                  frustration of emotions were greatly intensified by the Industrial
                  Revolution: railroads, factories, growth of cities, technological
                  revolution in the countryside and in the growing of food, and so forth.</p>
              <p>The appearance of stability in the nineteenth century Age of
                  Expansion was also due to the externalisation of rewards and controls.
                  This eventually brought on an acceleration of the main focus of the
                  main focus of the activities of the society downward again to the
                  levels of culture, from the areas of internal controls to the areas of
                  external controls. If you can be bought, with a higher salary, to go to
                  San Diego and give up all your friends and associations, that is an
                  external control. If you can be forced to go there by the draft, that
                  is militarization.</p>
              <p>Another thing which became very obvious in the nineteenth century
                  was the increasing role of propaganda for the purpose of changing
                  people's ways of looking at society, and the success of this propaganda
                  helped to create an impression of stability. At the beginning of the
                  lecture, I offended some of you by saying you had been brainwashed.
                  This is not an insult; it's a simple statement of fact. When any infant
                  is born and socialized in a society, even if he is to become a<br>  very mature individual, he has been brainwashed. That is, he has been
                  given a structure for categorizing his experience and a system of
                  values applied to that structure of categories. But in our society, in
                  the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, this has now become a
                  propagandist system in which emphasis is put on the future: Think only
                  of the future. This is the ideology against which the young people of
                  the 1950's and 1960's rebelled. Future preference: plan; study<br> hard; save. All the things I used to hear from my maiden aunts: "Wise
                  bees save honey; wise boys save money," and they each secretly gave me
                  a dollar as I was leaving. "A penny saved is a penny earned." "A stitch
                  in time....." Everything that's in "Poor Richard", the Benjamin
                  Franklin propaganda machine.</p>
              <p>Another aspect of this nineteenth century propaganda system is the
                  increasing emphasis upon material desires. If you had the material
                  things you wanted --a nice house in the suburbs, a swimming pool, a
                  couple of big cars, a place in the country, a motor boat, a trailer to
                  take it back and forth--you should be happy and satisfied. Now it's
                  endless--a pocket computer, citizens' band radio, whatever you want.</p>
              <p>A third idea we were brainwashed into believing was that the only
                  important thing was individualism. They called it freedom. There is no
                  such thing as freedom. There is something called liberty; it's quite
                  different. I'll not spend much time on this. If you're interested, read
                  Ruggiero's "History of European Liberalism", Oxford University Press,
                  1927, particularly the first couple of chapters. That's the English
                  translation of an Italian book. Freedom is freedom from restraints.
                  We're always under restraints. The difference between a stable society
                  and an unstable one is that the restraints in an unstable one are
                  external. In a stable society, government ultimately becomes
                  unnecessary ; the restraints on people's actions are internal, there're
                  self disciplined, they are the restraints you have accepted because
                  they make it possible for you to satisfy all your needs to the degree
                  that is good for you.</p>
              <p>Another thing that they have brainwashed us into believing in the
                  last 150 years is that quantitative change is superior to any
                  qualitative attributes. In other words, if we can turn out more
                  automobiles this year than last, it doesn't matter if they're half as
                  good. The same is true of everything. We are quantifying everything,
                  and this is why we are trying to put everything on computers.
                  Governments no longer have to make decisions; computers will do it.</p>
              <p>Another thing they have succeeded in doing is to give us vicarious
                  satisfactions for many of our frustrations. It is unbelievable to see
                  how the American people are hung up on vicarious experiences:
                  television, movies, mass spectator sports. You have no idea what the
                  small towns of America are like on Friday nights, like this, when the
                  local high school football or basketball team is engaged in competition
                  with their neighbour eighteen miles away. And what a gloomy place the
                  chapel or church is Sunday if they lose-- it won't matter if it rains.
                  People need exercise; they do not need to watch other people exercise,
                  particularly people who already had too much exercise. Another
                  vicarious satisfaction is the sexy magazines; this is vicarious sex. To
                  anyone rushing to buy one, I'd like to say, "The real thing is better."</p>
              <p>The brainwashing which has been going on for 150 years has also
                  resulted in the replacement of intellectual activities and religion by
                  ideologies and science. It is hardly possible to discuss the problems
                  of the historical past without running up against Marxist
                  interpretations. I have nothing against Marx, except that his theories
                  do not explain what happened, and this, to me, is a fatal defect. The
                  very idea that there is some kind of conflict between science and
                  religion is completely mistaken. Science is a method for investigating
                  experience, and religion is something quite different. Religion is the
                  fundamental, necessary  internalisation of our system of more permanent
                  values.</p>
              <p>Another thing they have tried to get us to believe in the last 150
                  years-- and the idea is now dying in front of us-- is the myth that the
                  nation as the repository of sovereignty can be both a state and a
                  community. This is the great ideological innovation of the French
                  revolution, you see. The nation can be the repository of sovereignty.
                  But suppose weapons in a society are such that it is possible for a
                  government to impose its will over an area a thousand miles across. And
                  suppose that in that thousand mile area there are a number of nations,
                  such as the Bretons, Catalonians, the Welsh, the Lithuanians. These are
                  as much nations as the ones that somehow or other became the
                  embodiments of sovereignty in the nineteenth century. Why did the
                  English, the French, the Castilians, the Hohenzollerns, and others
                  become the repository of sovereignty as nations: (notice: they missed
                  out in the whole Balkan and Danube areas.) They did so because, at that
                  time, weapons made it possible to compel obedience over areas which
                  were approximately the same size as these national groups I have
                  mentioned. As a result, they were able to crush out other nationalisms,
                  such as the Scots, the Welsh, the Irish, the Catalonians-- who had a
                  much longer and more cultured history than the Castilians-- the
                  Provencals, and many others. In other words, nationalism is an episode
                  in history, and it fit a certain power structure and a certain
                  configuration of human life in our civilization. Now what's happening?
                  They all want autonomy. The Scots think they can get their independence
                  and control oil in the North Sea, and then England will become a
                  colonial area for Edinburgh. And so forth.</p>
              <p>In 1820, thus, the state was essentially unstable, in spite of
                  appearances. It was not fully sovereign. For example, it did not have
                  the control of money and credit in most places; it did not have control
                  of corporations in most places. It was not stable because the nation is
                  not a satisfactory community. The very idea that, because everyone who
                  speaks French is in the same nation and, in the nineteenth century, in
                  the same state, they must therefore be in the same community, is just
                  not true. The nation or the state, as we now have it in terms of the
                  structure of power, cannot be a community.</p>
              <p>Another thing which may serve to point out the instability of the
                  power system of the state: the individual cannot be made the basic unit
                  of a society, as we have tried to do, or of the state, since the
                  internalisation of controls must be the preponderant influence in any
                  stable society. Even in a society in which it appears that all power is
                  in the hands of the government --Soviet Russia, let's say-- at least
                  eighty percent of all human behaviour is regulated by internalised
                  controls socialized in the people by the way they were treated from the
                  moment they were born. As a result, they have come to accept certain
                  things that allow the Russian state to act as if it can do anything,
                  when it obviously can't and knows it can't. Notice the new Russian
                  budget announced this week: as a result of our pouring our food
                  surpluses into Russia, they are now going to increase the consumption
                  of their expenditures.</p>
              <p>Also related to the problem of internalised controls is the shift of
                  weapons in our society. This is a profound problem. I have spent ten
                  years working on it throughout all of history, and I hope eventually to
                  produce a book if I can find a publisher. There will be endless
                  analyses of Chinese history, Byzantine history and Russian history and
                  everything else, and the book is about nine-tenths written. I'd say in
                  the last ten years the shift of weapons in any civilization and, above
                  all, in our civilization, from shock weapons to missile weapons has a
                  dominant influence on the ability to control individuals: individuals
                  cannot be controlled by missile weapons. Notice that if you go back
                  several hundred years to the Middle Ages, all weapons were shock, that
                  is, you came at the enemy with a spear or a sword. Even as late as
                  1916, in the First World War, you came at the Germans with bayonets
                  after a preliminary barrage with artillery. But we have now shifted
                  almost completely to missile weapons. Missile weapons are weapons that
                  you hurl. You may shoot, you may have bombs dropped from an airplane,
                  you may throw a hand grenade: these are missile weapons. The essential
                  difference between a shock weapon and a missile weapon is this: a
                  missile weapon is either fired or it isn't fired. It cannot be
                  half-fired. Once you let it go, it's out of your control. It is a
                  killing weapon. But a shock weapon--a billy club or a bayonet-- can be
                  used to any degree you wish. If you say to someone, "Get up and get out
                  of my room," and you pull out a machines gun, or you call in a B-52
                  bomber, or you pull the pin in a hand grenade....But with a bayonet you
                  can persuade him.</p>
              <p>In our society, individual behaviour can no longer be controlled by
                  any system of weaponry we have. In fact, we do not have enough people,
                  even if we equip them with shock weapons, to control the behaviour of
                  that part of the population which does not have internalised controls.
                  One reason for that, of course, is that the twenty percent who do have
                  internalised controls are concentrated in certain areas. I won't go
                  into the subject of controls. It opens up the whole field of guerrilla
                  resistance, terrorism, and everything else; these cannot be controlled
                  by any system or organized structure or force that exists, at least on
                  the basis of missile weaponry. And, as I said, it would take too many
                  people on the basis of shock weaponry. We have now done what the Romans
                  did when they started to commit suicide: we have  shifted from an army
                  of citizens to an army of mercenaries, and those mercenaries are being
                  recruited in our society, as they were in Roman society, from the
                  twenty percent of the population which does not have the internalised
                  controls of the civilization.</p>
              <p>The appearance of stability from 1840 to about 1900 was superficial,
                  temporary and destructive in the long run, because, as I have said, you
                  must have communities, and communities and societies must rest upon
                  cooperation and not on competition. Anyone who says that society can be
                  run on the basis of everyone's trying to maximise his own greed is
                  talking total nonsense. All the history of human society shows that
                  it's nonsense. And to teach it in schools, and to go on television and
                  call it the American way of life still doesn't make it true.
                  Competition and envy cannot become the basis of any society or any
                  community.</p>
              <p>The economic and technological achievements of industrialization in
                  this period were fundamentally mistaken. This could get quite
                  technical; I'll try not to. The economic expansion of industrialization
                  has been based on plundering the natural capital of the globe that was
                  created over millions of years: the plundering of the soils of their
                  fertility; the plundering of the human<br> communities whether they
                  were our own or someone else's, in Africa or anywhere else; the
                  plundering of the forest. In 1776 the wealth of forest in North America
                  was beyond belief; within 150 years, it has been destroyed and more
                  than ninety percent of it wasted. And it had in it three hundred years
                  of accumulated capital savings and investment of sunlight and the
                  fertility of the soil. (And now our that our bread is going to have
                  five times as much fiber by being made out of sawdust, we're going to
                  have to go on plundering the forests to an even larger degree; this, I
                  am sure, is one of the reasons why two days ago President Ford signed
                  the new bill allowing clear cutting in the National Forests. We need
                  that roughage or fiber in our bread, we have taken out all the natural
                  fiber of the wheat, of course, and thrown it away.)</p>
              <p>The energy which gave us the Industrial Revolution--coal, oil,
                  natural gas--represented the accumulated savings of four weeks of
                  sunlight that managed somehow to be saved in the earth out of the three
                  billion years of sunshine. That is what the fossil fuels are. This is
                  not income to be spent; this is capital to be saved and invested. But
                  we have already destroyed into entropy--a form of energy which is no
                  longer able to be utilized-- eleven or twelve days of that accumulated
                  twenty-eight days of sunlight. And we have wasted it.</p>
              <p>The fundamental, all pervasive cause of world instability today is
                  the destruction of communities by the commercialisation of all human
                  relationships and the resulting neuroses and psychoses. The
                  technological acceleration of transportation, communication and weapons
                  systems is now creating power areas wider than existing political
                  structures. We still have at least half a dozen political structures in
                  Europe, but our technology and the power system of Western Civilization
                  today are such that most of Europe should be a single power system.
                  This creates instability.</p>
              <p>Medical science and the population explosion have continued to
                  produce more and more people when the supply of food and the supply of
                  jobs are becoming increasingly precarious, not only in the United
                  States, but everywhere, because the whole purpose of using fossil fuels
                  in the corporate structure is to eliminate jobs. "Labour saving," we
                  call it, as if there were something wrong with working. Working is one
                  of the joys of life. And if we created a society in which working is a
                  pain in the neck, then we have created a society which is not fit for
                  human beings. It will be obvious to you that I have enjoyed my work,
                  although at the end of my career I have no conviction that I did any
                  good. Fortunately, I had a marvellous father and a marvellous mother,
                  and we were taught you don't have to win, but you have to give it all
                  you've got. Then it won't matter.</p>
              <p>To get back to sovereignty and the structure of the state, another
                  cause of today's instability is that we now have a society in America,
                  Europe and much of the world which is totally dominated by the two
                  elements of sovereignty that are not included in the state structure:
                  control of credit and banking and the corporation. These are free of
                  political controls and social responsibility, and they have largely
                  monopolized power in Western Civilization and in American society. They
                  are ruthlessly going forward to eliminate land, labour,
                  entrepreneurial-managerial skills, and everything else the economists
                  once told us were the chief elements of production. The only element of
                  production they are concerned with is the one they can control: capital</p>
              <p>So now everything is capital intensive, including medicine, and it
                  hasn't worked. I'll give you just one example. No one has a more
                  capital intensive medical system than the United States and many of you
                  may be well satisfied with it. I simply want to point out a couple of
                  facts. When a baby boy is born in the United State, his expectation of
                  life is less than in nineteen other countries in the world. And it's
                  that good only because our infant mortality rate is better than our
                  adult mortality rate. In other words, in infant mortality we are about
                  ninth or tenth; these figures date from about 1972, I think. Now let us
                  look at a ten year old boy in the United States today. His expectation
                  of life is less than that in thirty other countries, according to the
                  United Nations statistics. We pay more than the people in any of those
                  thirty countries for a capital intensive medical system devoted to
                  keeping people who are almost dead alive a few more days, instead of
                  making people grow up healthy by teaching them that work is fun, by
                  teaching then that they don't have to be gluttons--in the United
                  States, more than half of our food is wasted, maybe because it isn't
                  that good. Exercise, moderation and so forth-- it's all the old stuff
                  we used to get in Sunday school. It just happens to be correct.</p>
              <p>Our agricultural system is another cause of instability. It used to
                  be a system in which seed was put into the earth to create food by
                  taking sunlight, rain and the wealth of the soil, but we have replaced
                  it with an agricultural system which is entirely capital intensive. We
                  have eliminated labour and have even eliminated land to a considerable
                  extent, so that we now pour out what we call food, but it's really a
                  chemical synthetic. We have done this by putting a larger and larger
                  amount of chemical fertilizers and pesticides made from fossil fuels
                  into a smaller and smaller amount of soil. To give you one figure:
                  Every bushel of corn we send to the Russians represents one gallon of
                  gasoline, and then they tell us that, by selling our grain to the
                  Russians, we're getting the foreign exchange that will allow us to pay
                  for petroleum at fourteen dollars a barrel. No one has stopped to ask
                  how many gallons were used to grow the grain and send it to the
                  Russians.</p>
              <p>In the thirty years from 1940 to 1970, three million American farms
                  were abandoned because the families who worked them could not compete
                  with the corporate farmers using the new chemical methods of producing
                  crops. Thirty million people left these abandoned farms and the rural
                  areas and went into the towns and cities, millions of them to get on
                  relief. In 1970, the last year for which I have reliable figures, two
                  thousand farms a year were going out of production. These are the farms
                  on which we brought up our grandparents, the people who won the civil
                  war, indeed, the people who fought in the First World War, and, in many
                  cases, even in the Second War. Will the tractors be able to fight the
                  next war when there are no farm boys to fight? (Of course, whether
                  there are farm boys or not, they won't want to fight.)</p>
              <p>In a similar way, by urban renewal and other things, we are
                  destroying communities in the cities. Much of the legislation of the
                  last forty years in this country has been aimed at the destruction of
                  families, ghettos, parishes and any other communities.</p>
              <p>All these processes create frustrations on every level of human
                  experience and result in the instability and disorder we see around
                  every day.</p>
              <p>Now I come to a topic of delicacy: the United States constitutional
                  crisis. The three branches of government set up in 1789 do not contain
                  the eight aspects of sovereignty. The Constitution completely ignores,
                  for example, the administrative power. The result is that the three
                  branches of government have been struggling ever since to decide which
                  of them will control the administrative power. The growth of political
                  parties was necessary to establish relationships among the three
                  branches. I used to tell my students that the important thing in any
                  election is the nomination. And when you come to the election, it
                  doesn't matter who votes, what's important is who didn't vote.
                  Elections in the United States are increasingly decided by people who
                  didn't vote because they're turned off for various reasons.</p>
              <p>As a result of the way the three branches were set up, each has
                  tried to go outside the sphere in which it should be restrained. For
                  example, walking over here with Dean Krogh and Professor Brown, I spoke
                  briefly about the Boston Latin School I attended. It is the oldest
                  school in the United States, founded in 1635 as a preparatory school.
                  Harvard was created the next year as a place for Latin School boys to
                  go to college, and in my day, 1929-1930, it was the largest single
                  source of supply for Harvard, although Harvard was doing all it could
                  to cut down on the number of Latin School boys. The chief method they
                  used to keep us out was to raise the entrance requirements, but we
                  could handle that. Today that school is controlled by a Boston judge
                  who has taken it upon himself to tell the school who will be admitted.
                  And he has said they must have so many girls, they must have such a
                  percentage of blacks, they cannot have entrance exams, and if people
                  fail they can't throw them out. And what was once an absolutely
                  incredible preparatory school is now being destroyed. It had many
                  drawbacks--it was murderous. But it could get students through any
                  competitive system of entrance exams in the country.</p>
              <p>Another aspect of our constitutional crisis can be summed up in what
                  young Schlesinger--that's Arthur Schlesinger, Jr.-- called the Imperial
                  Presidency. When I look at the President of the United States, what I
                  see is Caesar Augustus. He is commander-in-chief; that's what
                  Imperator, Emperor, means. He's the head of the executive branch. He's
                  the head of state, which means he is the representative of the United
                  States government in all foreign affairs and all ambassadors are
                  accredited to him. Fourthly, he's the head of his political party.
                  Fifth, he's head of the administrative system, which is increasingly
                  making all the decisions as to what will be spent and who will spend
                  it. Do you know who is making the decisions in our Bureau of Management
                  and Budget as to who will get how much? And the president is also the
                  symbol of national unity, the focus of our emotional feeling regarding
                  our country. This is why it is so difficult to get rid of an incumbent
                  President either by election or impeachment.</p>
              <p>We have today a general paralysis of government in the United
                  States, especially in the administrative power, by the very thing we
                  praise most: the so-called rule of law, which should rather be called
                  the rule of lawyers. Let me give you one example. It is perfectly clear
                  in the Constitution that a President can be impeached by a vote of
                  Congress: indictment by the House, conviction by the Senate. This does
                  not require common law procedures; it does not require judicial
                  process. It is not a judicial action at all. It is a simple political
                  action. If you have the votes, he can be removed, simply by counting
                  them. The horrible thing about the whole Nixon business is that
                  impeachment will never again be used in the history of the United
                  States, because every member of the judiciary Committee has to be a
                  lawyer, and the Judiciary committee has to recommend impeachment. And
                  they require all kinds of procedures you would use in a court of law if
                  you were accused of holding up a bank. The result is that never again
                  will anyone try to impeach a President. It would take years and be
                  indecisive, when you could simply have taken a vote and had the whole
                  thing done in one morning.</p>
              <p>There are a lot of other things in the Constitution which are
                  perfectly obvious, but you can't get any constitutional lawyer to agree
                  with one of them. It's perfectly obvious, for example, that if the
                  three branches of government cannot agree to do something, it shouldn't
                  be done. That was the theory behind the Constitution. No--we have
                  someone supreme: the court will make the ultimate decision.</p>
              <p>I'll just touch on something else: secrecy in government. Secrecy in
                  government exists for only one reason: to prevent the American people
                  from knowing what's going on. It is nonsense to believe that anything
                  our government does is not known to the Russians at about the moment it
                  happens.</p>
              <p>To me, the most ominous flaw in our constitutional set-up is the
                  fact that the federal government does not have control over of money
                  and credit and does not have control of corporations. It is therefore
                  not really sovereign. And it is not really responsible, because it is
                  now controlled by these two groups, corporations, and those who control
                  the flows of money. The new public financing of the Presidential
                  elections is arranged so that they can spend as much as they want:
                  voluntary contributions, not authorized by the candidate, are legal.</p>
              <p>The administrative system and elections are dominated today by the
                  private power of money flows and corporation activities. I want to read
                  you a summary from James Willard Hurst, "The Legitimacy of the Business
                  Corporation in the Law of the United States from 1780 to 1970". He
                  points out that there was powerful anti-corporation feeling in the
                  United States in the 1820's. Therefore, it was established by the
                  states that corporations could not exist by prescription: they had to
                  have charters. They had to have a limited term of life and not be
                  immortal. Corporations today are immortal: if they get charters, they
                  can live forever and bury us all. They had to have a limited purpose.
                  Who is giving us this bread made of sawdust? ITT: International
                  Telephone and Telegraph, the same corporation that drove Ivar Kreuger
                  to suicide in Paris in April 1931, when it actually was an
                  international telegraph corporation, controlled by J P. Morgan.</p>
              <p>I won't take time to read all these things, but certain thin
                  regulations were established in the United States regarding
                  corporations: restricted purpose and activities especially by banks and
                  insurance companies; prohibition on one corporation's holding the stock
                  of another without specific statutory grant; limits on the span of the
                  life of the corporation, requiring recurrent legislative scrutiny;
                  limits on total assets; limits on new issues of capital, so that the
                  proportion of control of existing stockholders could be maintained;
                  limits on the votes allowed to any stockholder, regardless of the size
                  of his holding; and so forth.</p>
              <p>By 1890 all of these had been destroyed by judicial interpretation
                  which extended to corporations---fictitious persons-- those
                  constitutional rights guaranteed, especially by the Fifteenth
                  Amendment, to living persons. This interpretation was made possible by
                  Roscoe Conklin, known as "Turkey Strut Conklin," who told the Supreme
                  Court that there were no records kept by the committee of the Senate
                  that had drawn up the Fifteenth Amendment. But he had kept private
                  notes which showed they had the intended word "person" to include
                  corporations. It was most convenient. The corporation that was hiring
                  him to do this suitably rewarded him.</p>
              <p>Now I come to my last statement. I regret ending on what is, I
                  suppose, such a pessimistic note-- I'm not personally pessimistic. The
                  final result will be that the American people will ultimately prefer
                  communities. They will cop out or opt out of the system. Today
                  everything is a bureaucratic structure, and brainwashed people who are
                  not personalities are trained to fit into this bureaucratic structure
                  and say it is a great life--although I would assume that many on their
                  death beds must feel otherwise. The process of coping out will take a
                  long time, but notice: we are already coping out of military service on
                  a wholesale basis; we are already copping out of voting on a large
                  scale basis. I heard an estimate tonight that the President will
                  probably be chosen by forty percent of the people eligible to vote for
                  the forth time in sixteen years. People are also copping out by
                  refusing to pay any attention to newspapers or to what's going on in
                  the world, and by increasing emphasis on the growth of localism, what
                  is happening in their own neighbourhoods.</p>
              <p>In this pathetic election, I am simply amazed that neither of the
                  candidates has thought about any of the important issues, such as
                  localism, the rights of areas to make their own decisions about those
                  things affecting them. Now I realise that if there's a sulphur mine or
                  a sulphur factory a few miles away, localism isn't much help. But I
                  think you will find one extraordinary thing in this election: a
                  considerable number of people will go to the polls and vote for the
                  local candidates,<br> But will not vote for the President. That is a reverse of  the situation fifty years ago.</p>
              <p>Now I want to say good night. Do not be pessimistic. Life goes on;
                  life is fun. And if a civilization crashes, it deserves to. When Rome
                  fell, the Christian answer was, "Create our own communities."</p>
              <p>Thank you, Ladies and Gentlemen.</p>
