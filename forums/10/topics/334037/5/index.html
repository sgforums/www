              <p>mr. chris88110, if u havent read the news in the past few years, becoz of the foreigners, crime rates are sky rocketing, even juz a day ago, one china woman got jailed for assaulting a cabbie, and on top of that there are so many rape cases in singapore also. for example would be the huang nah case, and the woman who got raped in macritchie reservoir by 9 foreign workers, so what are you gonna say about that??? and one more thing, if ur feeling safe still, im sad to say ur another brainwashed drone. oh yea, sorry to say, u forgot about mat alamak? hmm?? he could escape using toilet paper, out of a high security centre. WOW, our country is soooo safe.</p>

              <p><br>Alot safer than most countries in the world. Do you know why you can list down all these cases for me? BECAUSE THEIR THE ONLY ONES. The crime rate in Singapore is so low that every single case reported to the police gets covered in detail by the media. In the states do you think half the community would rise up and go looking for one missing girl? Because their used to it. I suggest you go do your research before coming here and telling me anything. Oh and LHL is from cambridge</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>yes, i have to apologise for the wrong info, seems i got the wrong lee. But whatever else is mentioned remains, and yea i checked in on the net, we're not even top 10 in the lowest crime rates, so y dun we measure our safeness to countries like denmark and finland? or wait, lets go to a smaller country like the vatican city??? still lesser there. and one more thing, there is a lot of crimes thats going on that is not released to the media, if u decide to turn on the tv and watch crime watch, ull noe. And btw, if u think it carefully, ull noe that crime watch can have soo many episodes because we got alot of crimes to display, its all proportional. One important thing, poh and lionoisy have their own separate reasons and logics for their statements, do not compare me with them. Finally id appreciate if u read thru starsevens report on page 3, i thinks it a dam hard piece of evidence. lastly, if u still dun believe this, i'd suggest u read about the privy council and the queen's council that were barred from singapore to get involved in a political case. Go figure. Its nothing personal, its juz that our ideologies are colliding.</p></div>
