              <p>I read through this post and I found several interesting comments by the people here. I'll list them here and explain why.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff6600;">"Last time CSJ also shout at Kopi tiam at Goh Chok Tong, i was very young then, but even as young as i am, i still find the opposition very barbaric and ungentlemen to call the then PM of Singapore, "Woei, Lau Goh..."</span></p>
              <p>CSJ shout at Goh Chok Tong barbaric and ungentlemen?</p>
              <p>1) Link: http://www.fu-singapore.uni.cc/videos/pm_lee_fix_the_opposition.html</p>
              <p>If the Opposition gets voted in, PM Lee will spend time FIXING them instead of devising the right policies for Singapore.</p>
              <p>Is this what you would call gentlemanly?</p>
              <p>2) Link: http://www.ibanet.org/images/downloads/07_2008_July_Report_Singapore-Prosperity_versus_individual_rights.pdf</p>
              <p>Read the IBA 72-page report on rights in Singapore.</p>
              <p><strong>Defamation laws (Page 29-30)</strong><br><em>"Dissenting political opinion is further deterred by reports that <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">no PAP leader has ever lost a defamation suit against an opposition figure in court</span></strong>.
                      This has raised further questions about the independence of the
                      judiciary in Singapore when considering free expression cases."</em></p>
              <p><strong>Defamation cases in Singapore 1959-1997 (Page 60-61)</strong><br><em>"In the information above, it is evident that in just six cases,
                      PAP officials have been awarded over S$9 million in damages. This
                      excludes those cases, such as the one discussed above regarding the
                      Financial Times, which were settled out of court. Meanwhile, the total
                      for all seven non-PAP litigant cases is just S$307,350. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>This disparity is of serious concern for the independence of the judiciary.</strong></span>"</em></p>
              <p>Is this what you would call unbarbaric and gentlemanly? Your view, your call, your opinion.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff6600;">"DO YOU HAVE A BETTER IDEA HOW TO RUN THIS COUNTRY?"</span></p>
              <p>No I don't. Simply because I'm not paid peanuts like our dear and beloved ministers. However, without a better idea on running this country, do I lose the right to voice my view and opinion or criticise on their policies?</p>
              <p>How many people who can't play soccer for nuts but yet shout at the TV set at the players saying that they should do this, they should do that, etc.</p>
              <p>Besides, this is just me, I've seen articles suggesting solutions/ideas on running this country more efficiently.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff6600;">"Yes there was a poll on that my dear, its called the general elections."</span></p>
              <p>Using the general election as a gauge of how happy/satisfied Singaporeans are is an ineffective measure.</p>
              <p>"I'll vote for PAP this year, boy, because you enlisting into the army, I don't want things to happen to you." - My Mum, a few years back.</p>
              <p>"I'm applying for HDB flat this time round, I better vote for PAP this election."</p>
              <p>One word; FEAR</p>
              <p>Think about it, look around, listen to your neighbours, you'll find out the interesting reasons they have for voting for the PAP.</p>
              <p>Secondly, Carrot dangling is another factor, although it did not work to the extent that the PAP would want it to during the last election.</p>
              <p>MM Lee says there are no money politics in Singapore. I have to agree with him. There are only 1) Progressive Packages, 2) GST Rebates, 3) HDB upgrading, etc</p>
              <p>Third, yes there are anonymous voting in Singapore. Hey, what's this serial number on my ticket?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff6600;">"No, Poh i'm not a PAP supporter, but i don't really think the things you say here about PAP are true."</span></p>

              <p>In February 2007, <em><a title="The Straits Times" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Straits_Times">The Straits Times</a></em> reported that PAP's "new media" committee, chaired by <a title="Ng Eng Hen" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ng_Eng_Hen">Ng Eng Hen</a>,
                      has initiated an effort to counter critics in the Internet. It has
                      members posting anonymously at Internet forums and blogs to rebut
                      anti-establishment views.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Action_Party#cite_note-5">[6]</a>"</sup></p>
              <p>I notice one thing about PAP supporters, they would almost ALWAYS start off with "I'm not a PAP supporter but..."</p>
              <p>Now, I'm not saying you belong to PAP "new media" committee, I just hope you are an ordinary Singaporean with a different view and opinion. It would be totally pointless for me to talk to PAP's loyal best friend, if you understand what I mean.</p>

                      Each was dissolved by the Elections Department with voters
                      redistributed to other constituencies after opposition parties gained
                      ground in elections. <sup id="cite_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrymandering#cite_note-25">[26]</a></sup> Such action was controversial. Critics have speculated about the possibility of the Elections Department's dissolving next the <a title="Aljunied Group Representation Constituency" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aljunied_Group_Representation_Constituency">Aljunied GRC</a> in the next General Elections, likely in 2010 or 2011. The opposition
                      Workers' Party gained ground there in the General Elections in 2006,
                      when it earned approximately 44% of the votes.</p>
              <p>PAP strongholds, such as <a title="Tanjong Pagar Group Representation Constituency" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanjong_Pagar_Group_Representation_Constituency">Tanjong Pagar GRC</a> and <a title="Ang Mo Kio Group Representation Constituency" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ang_Mo_Kio_Group_Representation_Constituency">Ang Mo Kio GRC</a>,
                      where Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew and Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong
                      respectively contest, have seldom been contested by the opposition.
                      When Ang Mo Kio GRC was last contested in 2006, the PAP has <a title="Singaporean general election, 2006" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singaporean_general_election,_2006#Electorate">won</a> 66% of the votes."</p>
              <p>4) High electoral fees<br>5) Other factors</p>
              <p>Of course, other factors would/might include the possibility that the opposition are not up to standard or expectations.</p>
              <p>However, I'm sure all these factors interact with one another to present the current beautiful situation in Singapore.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff6600;">"Cos they knew that Sg Uncles are only good in talking like a cockerel..."</span></p>
              <p>I've seen several arguments challenging oppositions or pro-oppositions to present a better idea to run singapore, to take action and not just talk.</p>
              <p>Have you ever wondered what CAN we do?</p>
              <p>Submit articles to the media? Voice out opinions at Channel news asia forums? Freedom of speech? Sounds good, until you realize that everything is censored. You are reading what they WANT you to read.</p>
              <p>To conclude this, I would strongly encourage all pro-pap Singaporeans to read the IBA-72 page report, it should give you a some insight on the current situation in Singpaore.</p>
              <p>However, if you belong the "new media" commitee of the PAP, I would instead suggest you sue IBA for defamation/slander/libel or whatever to prove them wrong. For years, oppositions have been sued if they said anything deemed wrong by the PAP. Since the PAP said that the IBA is wrong, why not sue them? Else, you would be admitting to the authencity of the 72 page report.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Starseven i notice that you like to drone on and on about free speech. Now thats really being a typical sg uncle. Since you don't have a better idea on how to run this country what are you gonna talk about? Complain more? Now if you'll notice, every political party in the world does everything they can to stay in power. If te republicans could do this kind of thing, I'm very sure they would, but the american system simply does'nt allow them to. But then again, the US is a place where i can sue macdonalds because i'm fat. The solution is very simple, if the majority of people vote against the PAP, they would not be in power. But people still do. And if you know the PAP are using carrot-dangling tactics on you why can't you see through it and vote for the opposition instead? Are you claiming that the majority of Singaporeans are brainwashed? Because in the end brainwashed or not PAP still wins, and frankly they don't give a fuck how they win as long as they win and we're happy. People in Africa are worrying about their next meal and here you are complaining about our government. Now i think this is really dumb. Again i reitarate my stance, if you have a better idea how to run this country, go do it</p></div>

              <p>if the govt is good, they have nothing to worry when the election come. but from the results of past elections, the number of people voting for them are getting lesser and lesser. i believe something is seriously wrong over here.</p>
              <p>for example, your child taking exam. 1st term 90+ marks. then after every terms, the results keep dropping. are you going to do something about it or wait till he start failing?</p>
              <p>i believe that is the same thing for the PAP. started off with very good voting percentage and then started dropping. is there something wrong with the policies that anger the people so much that they decided to vote for the oppositions?</p>

              <p>Starseven i notice that you like to drone on and on about free
              speech. Now thats really being a typical sg uncle. Since you
              don't have a better idea on how to run this country what are you
              gonna talk about? Complain more? Now if you'll notice, every
              political party in the world does everything they can to stay in
              power. If te republicans could do this kind of thing, I'm very sure
              they would, but the american system simply does'nt allow them to.
              But then again, the US is a place where i can sue macdonalds
              because i'm fat. The solution is very simple, if the majority of
              people vote against the PAP, they would not be in power. But people
              still do. And if you know the PAP are using carrot-dangling tactics
              on you why can't you see through it and vote for the opposition
              instead? Are you claiming that the majority of Singaporeans are
              brainwashed? Because in the end brainwashed or not PAP still wins,
              and frankly they don't give a fuck how they win as long as they win
              and we're happy. People in Africa are worrying about their next
              meal and here you are complaining about our government. Now i think
              this is really dumb. Again i reitarate my stance, if you have a
              better idea how to run this country, go do it</p>
