              <p>Opposition open their mouth to what? Complain only. If they open their mouth to contribue CONSTRUCTIVE and FEASIBLE ideas, i won't say anything. But all they do is complain about PAP's salaries, what the PAP is doing wrong etc, etc. Look at Sylvia Lim, Chiam See Tong, Low Tia Kang, they don't get sued, why? Beacause they know what to say, all of them have made comments about ministers salaries but did'nt get sued.

              <p>Starseven i notice that you like to drone on and on about free
              speech. Now thats really being a typical sg uncle. Since you
              don't have a better idea on how to run this country what are you
              gonna talk about? Complain more? Now if you'll notice, every
              political party in the world does everything they can to stay in
              power. If te republicans could do this kind of thing, I'm very sure
              they would, but the american system simply does'nt allow them to.
              But then again, the US is a place where i can sue macdonalds
              because i'm fat. The solution is very simple, if the majority of
              people vote against the PAP, they would not be in power. But people
              still do. And if you know the PAP are using carrot-dangling tactics
              on you why can't you see through it and vote for the opposition
              instead? Are you claiming that the majority of Singaporeans are
              brainwashed? Because in the end brainwashed or not PAP still wins,
              and frankly they don't give a fuck how they win as long as they win
              and we're happy. People in Africa are worrying about their next
              meal and here you are complaining about our government. Now i think
              this is really dumb. Again i reitarate my stance, if you have a

              <p>I would strongly encourage you to read my initial post carefully, word by word, for the answers to your post can be found there. I will re-quote myself so that you understand better.</p>
              <p>Yes I do like to drone on and one about freedom of speech, is that wrong? That's a basic right that's being taken away since birth.</p>
              <p>You call me a typical uncle. Well, that's pretty personal and sterotyping. I'm fine with it, most of the time, people supplment a weak argument with personal attacks.</p>
              <p><strong>Since you
              don't have a better idea on how to run this country what are you
              gonna talk about?</strong></p>
              <p>From initial post:<br><span style="color: #ff0000;">"No I don't. Simply because I'm not paid peanuts like our dear
                                      and beloved ministers. However, without a better idea on running
                                      this country, do I lose the right to voice my view and opinion or
                                      criticise on their policies?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">How many people who can't play soccer for nuts but yet shout at
                                      the TV set at the players saying that they should do this, they
                                      should do that, etc.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Besides, this is just me, I've seen articles suggesting
                                      solutions/ideas on running this country more efficiently."</span></p>
              <p><strong>But people

              <p>From initial post:<br><span style="color: #ff0000;">"Secondly, Carrot dangling is another factor, although it did not
                                      work to the extent that the PAP would want it to during the last
                                      election."</span></p>

              <p>One thing about Singapore is the tendency to compare ourselves with poorer countries.</p>
              <p>Its like a student justifying that he's better than the last student even though he's second last.</p>
              <p>The only way to improve is to compare with better students.</p>

              <p>The lack of freedom of expression/speech/assembly severly reduce the boundaries of what an average citizen can do in Singapore.</p>
              <p>I can only say its the worst for the oppositions, fighting for a cause that is unappreciated and unnoticed by the majority of Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>Cause of both situations? PAP's own definition of democracy.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>mr. chris88110, if u havent read the news in the past few years, becoz of the foreigners, crime rates are sky rocketing, even juz a day ago, one china woman got jailed for assaulting a cabbie, and on top of that there are so many rape cases in singapore also. for example would be the huang nah case, and the woman who got raped in macritchie reservoir by 9 foreign workers, so what are you gonna say about that??? and one more thing, if ur feeling safe still, im sad to say ur another brainwashed drone. oh yea, sorry to say, u forgot about mat alamak? hmm?? he could escape using toilet paper, out of a high security centre. WOW, our country is soooo safe.</p></div>

              <p>i beg to differ that sg uncles vote for PAP. i think aunties like to vote for the PAP. many of my younger friends, especially female tend to vote for the PAP because, they are ignorant about politics or have no interest and tends to vote for the thunderstorm who has brainwash them since theywere stuying the PAP kindergarden.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>SS angel, you job is to educated your auntie group to be more political active and engage before the current generation got disappointed and choose to migrate to land of more freedom.</p>

              <p>SS aunties are our nation babies generating machine, we must really take care of them to produce future hunks and beauti, yet auntie also need to follow our PAP nazism policy of Back to Work. This is to help our lame male who are getting lazier and worthless due to frequent patronise of geyland gals, pros sex and touches. And in such situation, a typical aunty still hv to take care of household, childrens and keep in shape just to compete with pros gals.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Therefore, in term of nation building and progress Singapore aunties have given more than sg Uncles whose only pride is they served NS, conqueror geyland and joo chiat.</p>
