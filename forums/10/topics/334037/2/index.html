              <p>even he was jailed.. the "syndicate" can also pay him a good sum of $$ for doing so.. jus like how those bookie... if u go jail, they pay u a lump sum and take care of ur family.. when u come out.. u will stil work for them.. anyway i jus feel that CSJ is dubious la.. he is not stupid given his academic achievements.. but he constantly put the opposition in the bad lights.. especially during election period..</p>
