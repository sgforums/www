            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><span style="color: red;">This is Chee Soon Juan's message to all Singaporeans.<br><br>25 Apr 06<br><br>The Singapore Democrats have been ordered to remove our podcasts, including<br>the address Dr Chee Soon Juan gave regarding the persecuting of the SDP and<br>its leaders. Below is the text of the speech.<br><br>My fellow Singaporeans,<br><br>This is Chee Soon Juan The elections are upon us again and the Singapore<br>Democrats are busy preparing for the polls on May 6.<br><br>But unlike previous campaigns, this one is a little different in that even<br>before the hustings begin, the PAP is up to its favourite tactic of suing<br>its opponents for defamation. It is certainly whipping up anti-SDP<br>sentiments through the mass media that it controls.<br><br>But that's not all. The PAP is hell-bent on crippling the SDP's election<br>campaign.<br><br>First, it bans podcasting knowing full well that we had set up our podcast<br>last year specifically so that we can better reach out to voters in this<br>election.<br><br>Two, MM Lee Kuan Yew and his son, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong have sued<br>our Party for defamation.<br><br>Three, the PAP has even gone after the SDP's printer, Mr David Sum, who is<br>now so fearful he dares not print our election material.<br><br>Four, everywhere that we go for our walkabouts, undercover police agents are<br>on hand to harass us and issue us warnings.<br><br>Five, the PAP is so desperate that it has even changed the rules to bar both<br>Mr J B Jeyaretnam and I from speaking at the election rallies. It goes to<br>the extent to rule that no one can read my speeches out for me at the<br>rallies.<br><br>Let me ask you one simple question: Does this sound like a Government that<br>is confident of the popular support that it claims to have or does this<br>sound more like an insecure regime determined to prevent the SDP from<br>telling voters its views and competing with the PAP for votes?<br><br>Mr Lee Kuan Yew says that Singapore should have a First World Government and<br>opposition. I couldn't agree more. But I'd like to remind him that First<br>World Governments don't sue their political opponents or their printers,<br>they don't have police officers tailing the opposition wherever they go out<br>to meet voters, or prevent them from speaking at election rallies, or ban<br>podcasting.<br><br>What First World Governments do is to have public debates with their<br>opponents uncensored and unedited so that voters can watch and make up their<br>own minds. To this end, I would like to invite Mr Lee Kuan Yew and/or Mr Lee<br>Hsien Loong to demonstrate the PAP's First World-ness by engaging my<br>colleagues and I in public debate during one of our rallies - telecast live.<br><br>This would be a wonderful opportunity for the PAP to show how much of a<br>First World government it is and if what Mr Lee Kuan Yew says about the SDP<br>being a 'hooligan' party is true or not. The SDP is confident of letting the<br>people of Singapore be the judge. What about the PAP?<br><br>The truth of the matter is that Singaporeans must not let the PAP dictate<br>what kind of an opposition Singapore should have. The state-controlled media<br>will portray the SDP as a party not worthy of the people's support. That's<br>not surprising because the Singapore Democrats are openly calling for reform<br>of our political system and for the Government to truly serve the people and<br>not vice versa. The PAP is terrified of this message and wants to shut the<br>party down.<br><br>An opposition must speak clearly and loudly when the people are being<br>bullied, when ministers are paying themselves millions of dollars in<br>salaries while the people continue to take cuts in their wages and CPF.<br><br>An opposition must spell out its alternative ideas clearly as we have done<br>in our newspaper and various books and reports.<br><br>An opposition must not be intimidated by the ruling party no matter how<br>tough the going gets.<br><br>Because ultimately an opposition exists to keep democracy alive by speaking<br>up for the people.<br><br>Clearly, the Government is going all out to crush the Singapore Democrats.<br>It wants to shut the SDP down. We're not surprised by this because that's<br>what undemocratic regimes do to parties that call for reform - reform so<br>that power can be rightly returned to the citizens.<br><br>Everything I've done, I've done it with our nation at heart. You may not<br>agree with everything I say or do. But you cannot accuse me of not speaking<br>up for the people. I love my country as much as anyone else in Singapore.<br>But loving my country and being loyal to it doesn't mean I have to bow down<br>to the PAP and look the other way when injustice occurs.<br><br>We, the members of the SDP, will continue to speak up and we will tell the<br>PAP when it is wrong no matter how much we are persecuted. We will not<br>kow-tow to bullying and to arrogance.<br><br>We will continue to speak up and to fight for you. Why? Because Singapore<br>belongs to us Singaporeans, not the PAP. Whatever happens in this election,<br>the SDP will always remain true to our beliefs, our people and, most<br>important, our nation.<br><br>Thank you and may God bless all of you and your loved ones.<br><br>Hhm..He certainly doesn't sound like a hooligan.In my opinion I think LKY keep calling him a hooligan not because Chee Soon Juan  is really a hooligan but because LKY is frightened of his message to all Singaporeans .His questions and demands  for transparency and accountability from the Pap seems to really make them shiver .I wonder why the Pap  is so scared if they have nothing to hide..</span></span></div>

The patron has supported him all the way by dismissing Durai's $600 K salary package as peanut. The minister and regulatory authority did not seem to have taken any steps to address public concern over a number of years and have failed to regulate the way public donation was put to use : asking simple question like whether Kidney Patients were benefitting from public donation. To which extent or per dollar donation were the patients benefitting ? Were there accountability and transparency in awards of contracts to directors' connected contractors and suppliers and payments and incremets of salaries and bonuses out of public donations against the background of the government steadfastly refusing to give help to kidney patients deeming it as a risk to welfarism. So if the only way for kidney patients to survive is out of public donations, then a responsible MOH, regulatory authority and patron will have taken active and sufficient actions to address fundamental oversight in NKF admnistration.<br><br><blockquote><strong>Do you know that during the financial crisis, some wealthy individuals made more money than before the crisis? Perhaps you and I suffered a pay-cut. I know I did but not sure if you did. But does that mean we have the right to wish it upon all other people? Including Minister? I believed their pay is pegged to (using a formula that I really do not know) the pay of top few professionals. Much as I like to be one of those professionals, I am not. Thing is, they made more money, unless you say IRAS is collecting more tax from them than allowed and they coughed it up without making a fuss.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Sorry to quote and paraphrase you but "like so few of you, you failed to see Chee for who he is and what he stands for........ Darth Vader!!" <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>I think the moderator better lock this threat.... someone hijacked it for broadcasting DARTH VADER message.... think not allowed hor</strong></blockquote>I hope that Singapore ministers being paid million-dollar above-first-world standard salaries will not compare with third-world practices or conditions to give themselves any excuses for any failures in solving problems including the "20 major policy errors of the government" as posted or the NKF blunder people are now discussing as the microcosm reflecting government's own lack of accountability and transparency.<br><br>NKF clearly reflects deep and serious underlying problems affecting the whole government machinery. It would be irresponsible and third-world standard in trying to deny the larger NKF problem affecting the whole government. This NKF on the surface might look to be its own internal problem but as explained in the foregoing, it is too deeply connected to the government by the patron's support and ministries lack of solutions to its many problems until confronted by the public outcry over the court revelation in the NKF/SPH face-off.<br><br>NKF therefore should be examined more thoroughly and the minister, previous ministers, ministerial regulatory authorities and all ministers speaking in support of NKF denials in the past and presently be brought down to size and reality from their high horse or ivory towers to look into solving real problems.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If we pay attention to the Liang Shang brothers story, recently screened on TV Channel 8, we will no doublt understand many lessons.<br><br>Liang Shan brothers are a group of bandits traditionally despised by society. But they became bandits not because of their own choice or desire. They were originally morally upright and courageous people who were forced to give up their careers and their righteous way to join the bandits in the mountain due to circumstances beyond their control.<br><br>Take the case of Wu Song, he was a courageous and upright person who has helped people in difficulty. However he finally turned violent and took the law into his own hand because he saw no prospect of justice due to corruption of the official in covering up the poisoning of his own brother by the powerful adulterer of his own sister-in-law Pan Jin Lian.<br><br>In the case of Song Jiang, he was a very generous and helpful person who have won over many friends. But despite his original belief and conviction to stay on the right course, he was proven wrong and was forced to join the bandits in Liang Shan because he was framed by the corrupt official who used his drunken behaviour to accuse him wrongly as a rebel to get his own promotion.<br><br>A first-world country surely will treasure talents and not drive them to the extreme with name calling or deprive them of opportunity to live their lives or serve the people in proper occupations and professions.</div>

The other concerns the GovernmentÂ’s handling of the entire saga.<br><br>Despite alarm bells ringing over the matter the Government continued to endorse the NKF and its operations. Minister for Health Mr Khaw Boon Wan, in particular, had said that he Â“took [his] hat off to the NKF.Â”<br><br>He was supported by Mr Lim Hng Kiang, the Second Finance Minister, who assured everyone that the NKF was on Â“quite a sound recordÂ” and that the charity was Â“in full compliance of the regulations.Â”<br><br>These Ministerial assurances were given in response to misgivings that were raised by NKF volunteers as well as the general public. The warnings over NKFÂ’s operations were also brought up in Parliament in 2004.<br><br>What is particularly worrying about the episode is that the National Council of Social Services (NCSS) had tightened the leash on NKF and revoked its Institute of Public Character (IPC) status which the charity needed to exempt itself from paying taxes on the donations collected.<br><br>The Ministry of Health, however, reinstated the IPC status for the NKF. Why did it do this? The Minister for Health needs to give a full account to the Singaporean public why his Ministry did this.<br><br>When the details were exposed the Government claimed that it had been Â“misledÂ” and that it was an Â“oversightÂ” on its part. Given all the warning signals and the fact that the matter was brought to its direct attention, it is hardly credible for the Government to simply say that its actions, or non-action, was an oversight.</span></blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">And you were impressed by the Minister of Health's  performance in salvaging the situation for his reputation and that of his Party ?<br><br>Sure, everyone was impressed by the smooth talk and efficiently calm demeanour that he put up at the many Press Conferences when the NKF bubble burst into the open.<br><br>Did anyone remembered the overbearing confidence in their performance in Parliament during 2004 ? </span><br><br><blockquote><strong><br>Do you know that during the financial crisis, some wealthy individuals made more money than before the crisis?

Sure, the Patron was SM (then PM) wife and ministers attended the shows. To say that these link the health minister to the saga is a bit far fetched. One can say that TT Durai is so good that he hookwink Ministers, blew smoke and played games. I also got con to donate money, mind you, NEVER during the show as I see it as a form of gambling. My donation is small but I meant every cent to help the patients one way or the other.<br><br>The point I tried to make is that during the financial crisis, many many many head of companies made money, more money than before the crisis. As such, with the understanding that we equate Minister's pay to the pay package of these people, we should follow through in good times as well as in bad times. Fair right? At work, we abide by contracts signed, so... while we can cry about it, we still have to agree with contracts right?<br><br>Back to CSJ.

How much is EVERY Singaporean willing to give through taxation? Those who spend time doing charity will tell that resource is never enough. So I am still abit worried that the present NKF is not raising enough funds and not seeking to use shows to raise funds.<br><br>The question is integrity. The chap at the top, Mr Durai, has misappropriate funds for his own benefit. If we had a person with integrity like, say, Gerald Ee, would we have NKF saga? Information transparency and process is the key to preventing this from happening? Please, it helps but THE KEY is the INTEGRITY of PEOPLE.<br><br>If we think that US politics is accountable and transparent, one may find many instances of corruption, money politics and "pork-barrel projects", pay-offs and not to mention all the various "gates" and "I do not recall". The key, for being lor sor, is INTEGRITY of PEOPLE. CSJ, please, not even close. If anything else, he is from the "I do not recall" and "typo error" camp.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
