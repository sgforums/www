            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Should the minimum retirement age be raised from 62 to 65?<br>I don't want to think of retirement now<br>By Low Ching Ling<br><br>July 17, 2007   </strong><br><br>THREE weeks ago, I told a colleague I wanted to buy my own home because I wanted my own living space.<br><br>My colleague, who egged me on, had a different rationale.<br><br>She said: 'Buying a home is perhaps the only way you can enjoy your CPF savings before you retire.'<br><br>Or worse, before I die.<br><br>Our conversation had stemmed from the Government's proposal to raise the CPF minimum sum payout age from 62 to 65.<br><br>Now, workers who turn 55 can withdraw a portion of their CPF savings but have to set aside a minimum sum in their CPF account.<br><br>They then receive a monthly payout from age 62.<br><br>But since people are now living longer and the population is growing older, the Government wants more senior citizens to keep working beyond 62.<br><br>Its target? A 65 per cent employment rate for people aged 55 to 64. The rate was 53.7 per cent last year.<br><br>And to achieve that, it wants a re-employment law within the next five years.<br><br>I have no doubt the Government is serious about raising the minimum-sum withdrawal age.<br><br>A CPF (Amendment) Bill is to be tabled at today's Parliament sitting though it's not clear if it has anything to do with the changes mentioned earlier.<br><br>Faced with the prospect of having to work longer and wait longer for my CPF payouts (my first will come only in 2043 if the minimum-sum payout age is raised), my colleague's advice appeared to make sense.<br><br>To me, 2043 is light years (36 years, to be precise) away.<br><br>Call me a doomsayer, but I'm afraid I may die early before I get to enjoy all my CPF savings.<br><br>Yes, people may live longer these days, but life remains fragile.<br><br>In my job, I see all kinds of tragedies.<br><br>In recent months, there have been reports of seemingly-fit young people collapsing and dying, others never waking from their slumber and active people killed in freak accidents.<br><br>When Mr Lim Boon Heng, the minister-in-charge of ageing issuesproposed raising the CPF minimum-sum withdrawal age, my first thought was: What if I don't live till 65?<br><br>Of course, I could also die before I get to enjoy my home long enough. But I'll take my chances.<br><br>That's just me.<br><br>I understand the Government cannot make policies based on the assumption that people don't live to a ripe old age.<br><br>And looking at the larger picture, it's a good plan for retirement security.<br><br>I don't want the Government to be taking care of me in my silver years.<br><br>But I'm not sure I want it to take care of my CPF savings for so long either.<br><br>Perhaps it has less to do with the Government, more with the people.<br><br>Too often, Singaporeans have whined about their problems, almost always insisting the Government bail them out.<br><br>So, why should we be trusted to spend our hard-earned CPF savings wisely, right?<br><br>But raise the minimum-sum withdrawal age or not, I believe there's one thing all workers making an honest living should never abandon: The idea of retirement.<br><br>While I see the point made by Mr Lim Swee Say, Minister in the Prime Minister's Office, when he called for a 're-tuning' of mindsets and attitudes towards growing old, his remark that 'we must not think about retiring' did not sit well with me.<br><br>Surely, after slogging at their jobs for half their lives, workers deserve to look forward to living their golden years in comfort - whether or not they are faced with an ageing population, longer lifespans and rising medical costs, whether they are poor or rich, young or old.<br><br>No worker should ever give up the dream of an idyllic retirement - even if it's before the grand old age of 65.<br><br>The question is: How hard are we willing to work for it?<br><br>At my age (I will turn 29 in September), it's perhaps premature to think about retirement.<br><br>But I do, because no matter how many years of working life I have left, it's a dream I keep working towards.<br><br>I hope to retire when I'm in my 50s - with my own home and all.<br><br>I consider myself lucky. For now, time is still on my side.<br><br>If I don't stretch myself financially and if I plan well, I may be able to afford an early retirement.<br><br>And if I continue to work then, it will be only because I want to, not because I have to.<br><br>If the law is amended to allow for later retirement, I hope it won't also punish those who choose to retire early.<br><br></div>
