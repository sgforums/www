            <div class='col-md body'>According to The New York Times, when the terrorists took over the Russian elementary school, they shouted "Allahu akbar" ("Allah is the greatest").<br><br>Does this surprise you, dear reader? Does it shock you that the people who deliberately attacked a school and then systematically shot and blew up little children did so in the name of Islam? Unfortunately, the question is rhetorical. Having targeted little children for death, there is no atrocity, no barbarity, no act of evil that the human race cannot imagine fanatical Muslims committing.<br><br>We have already become almost inured to:<br><br>The slaughtering of innocent human beings as if they were animals while chanting Muslim prayers.<br><br>The reintroduction of black slavery and genocide against blacks.<br><br>The murder of daughters and sisters for imagined or real sexual behavior.<br><br>The stoning of women accused of adultery.<br><br>The burning of Hindu temples and Christian churches, and the destruction of among the greatest Buddhist sculptures.<br><br>The ban on women driving cars or learning to read.<br><br>The idolization of young men who blow themselves up while murdering and maiming innocent non-Muslims Â— and the theology of sexual rewards in heaven for doing so.<br><br>These are some of the atrocities being committed by Muslims in different parts of the world today. It is, of course, only a minority of Muslims that engages in such horrors, but it is only Muslims who are doing all these things. Christians aren't Â— even among Palestinians, there are no Christian terrorists. Jews aren't Â— and when one Jew did deliberately kill innocent Palestinians in 1994, the rest of the Jewish world was horrified and demonstrated its revulsion in word and deed. Buddhists aren't Â— despite the destruction of Tibet by the Chinese Communists, no Buddhists have murdered innocent Chinese, let alone non-Chinese who deal with China.<br><br>With the psychopathic cruelty at a Russian elementary school, have we reached the point where people of goodwill can ask serious questions about Muslims and Islam? Or are any challenging questions still to be dismissed as "Muslim bashing" or, even more absurdly, "racist," as if religion were a race? but it is equallycertain, and exceptionally painful, that almost all terrorists are Muslims. The hostage-takers of children in Beslan, North Ossetia, were<br>Muslims. The other hostage-takers and subsequent murderers of the Nepalese<br>chefs and workers in Iraq were also Muslims. Those involved in rape and<br>murder in Darfur, Sudan, are Muslims, with other Muslims chosen to be their<br>victims. Those responsible for the attacks on residential towers in Riyadh<br>and Khobar were Muslims. The two women who crashed two airliners last week<br>were also Muslims.<br><br>Bin Laden is a Muslim. The majority of those who manned the suicide<br>bombings against buses, vehicles, schools, houses and buildings, all over<br>the world, were Muslim.<br><br>What a pathetic record. What an abominable "achievement". Does all this<br>tell us anything about islam, it's society and its  culture? These<br>images, when put together, or taken separately, are shameful and degrading.<br>But let us start with putting an end to a history of denial. Let us<br>acknowledge their reality, instead of denying them and seeking to justify<br>them with sound and fury signifying nothing.<br><br>For it would be easy to cure ourselves if we realise the seriousness of our<br>sickness. Self-cure starts with self-realisation and confession. We should<br>then run after our terrorist sons, in the full knowledge that they are the<br>sour grapes of a deformed culture.<br><br>listen to Yusuf al-Qaradawi, the Sheikh - the Qatar-based radical<br>Egyptian cleric - and hear him recite his "fatwa" about the religious<br>permissibility of killing civilian Americans in Iraq. Let us contemplate<br>the incident of this religious Sheikh allowing, nay even calling for, the<br>murder of civilians.<br><br>This ailing Sheikh, in his last days, with two daughters studying in<br>"infidel" Britain, soliciting children to kill innocent civilians.<br><br>How could this Sheikh face the mother of the youthful Nick Berg, who was<br>slaughtered in Iraq because he wanted to build communication towers in that<br>ravished country? How can we believe islam as a peaceful religion when he tells us that Islam is the<br>religion of mercy and peace while he is turning it into a religion of blood<br>and slaughter?<br><br>In a different era, we used to consider the extremists, with nationalist or<br>Leftist leanings, a menace and a source of corruption because of their<br>adoption of violence as a means of discourse and their involvement in<br>murder as an easy shortcut to their objectives.We can't call those who take schoolchildren as hostages peacuful islam. Peacul and benign islam is a contradiction. We must not tolerate in our midst those who abduct journalists, murder civilians,<br>explode buses; we cannot accept them as related to us, whatever the<br>sufferings they claim to justify their criminal deeds. We cannot clear our names unless we own up to the shameful fact that terrorism has become an Islamic enterprise; an almost exclusive monopoly, implemented by Muslim men and women. We cannot hope to have a peacul universe unless we accecpt the fact that islam is about terror and terror only.To do otherwise is to delude ourselves. One day, just like the passengers in e madrid blast, we might find out loved ones killed just because we happen to support our goverment.<br><br></div>
