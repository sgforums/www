              <div><span>The government then made some checks and found a different story.
                  <br> <br> The man in the video had made a tidy sum of over S$220,000 from the

                  <br> <br> She was also getting financial help from the South West Community Development Council.
                  <br> <br>Dr Balakrishnan said: "Despite these circumstances, the social

              <p> </p>
              <p>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjC_QLvgI6k</p>
              <p>You will note that in the video, Al Jazeera explained that they were
                      refused an interview with the esteemed minister. But do watch the video
                      and listen to the Al Jazeera report line by line. Can someone tell me
                      which part is 'misleading'? All Al Jazeera reported was that there are
                      people in Singapore with difficulty getting housing due to various
                      rules and have resorted to camping at the beach.</p>
              <p><strong>Perhaps
                      Minister Vivian is saying that Al Jazeera is misleading because it left
                      out a few facts ...facts that only the govt can know about and Al
                      Jazeera has no access to because</strong><strong> the esteemed minister refused to be
                      interviewed by them</strong>. But really lets look at the pieces for facts
                      mentioned by Minister Balakrisnan:</p>
              <p>1. "The man in the video has
                      made a tidy sum of over S$220,000 from the sale of three flats". Al
                      Jazeera could never have known that since they have no access to govt
                      records. But is the minister saying because the man had once made
                      money, he should be denied a rental flat? Actually I don't know whether
                      he used the money for drinks, women, business, debts, gambling, medical
                      bills or had it cheated from him. That is not the issue. The real issue
                      is the HDB has a rule that prevents people who have sold a flat from
                      renting one regardless of whether they sold it because their business
                      failed or they had to do it to pay off loan sharks. I like what Ravi
                      Philemon said in the video about giving 2nd chances to people. You can
                      alway examine a person's life to explain how he end up in the state he
                      is in and put the blame on him for his plight (why didn't he do this
                      and that to escape poverty and so on) just like what Minister
                      Balakrisnan did to pull out records to show that the man once had money
                      but giving help is about giving 2nd chances to people so they can
                      better their lives...</p>
              <p>2, "The woman still owns an HDB resale flat
                      with her ex-husband". Isn't it obvious this woman has fallen through a
                      crack in the rules? You cannot get a rental flat when you are a
                      co-owner. The logic being that you can stay in the flat you co-own.
                      However, this woman co-owns a flat with her ex-husband and it is
                      obvious that it is impractical for her to stay in the flat although she
                      co-owns it.</p>
              <p>We see very few homeless people in Singapore not
                      because everyone can afford a home or can rent one - the rental queue
                      is several years long. Have you ever wonder how is it possible that
                      Singapore has the most costly public housing in the world, the biggest
                      income inequality in the developed world and insufficient rental flats
                      yet you don't see many homeless people. So why are there so few
                      homeless people in Singapore? Because it is illegal to be homeless. If
                      you're found camping without permit, you can get jailed[<a href="http://theonlinecitizen.com/2009/08/where%E2%80%99s-the-compassion-in-our-%E2%80%9Cfine-city%E2%80%9D/">Link</a>]
                      or forcibly taken to a shelter so that the problem can be hidden
                      away....so the homeless cannot afford to be visible out of fear of
                      being caught. There is nothing misleading about the Al Jazeera report.
                      The only thing misleading about the whole situation is the false
                      impression created for visitors that everyone in Singapore has a home
                      and that poverty does not exist here.</p>

              <span class="left">Posted by <a title="Posts by theonlinecitizen" href="http://theonlinecitizen.com/author/theonlinecitizen/">theonlinecitizen</a> on April 29, 2010</span> <span class="comment right"><a class="comments-link" title="Comment on Al Jazeera responds to Vivian Balakrishnan’s accusations" href="http://theonlinecitizen.com/2010/04/al-jazeera-responds-to-vivian-balakrishnans-accusations/#comments">17 Comments</a></span></div>

              <p><strong><em>The
              following is Al Jazeera’s response to Dr Vivian Balakrishnan’s remarks
              in Parliament on 27 April 2010. The MCYS minister had accused Al
              Jazeera of “[failing] to ascertain the facts” in its report on the
              homeless issue in Singapore.</em></strong></p>
              <p><strong><em>TOC understands Al Jazeera has also sent its response to the Straits Times.</em></strong></p>
              <p><strong><em>TOC will respond to the minister’s remarks later today.</em></strong></p>
              <p><a href="http://theonlinecitizen.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/aljaz320240.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-22849" title="aljaz320240" src="http://theonlinecitizen.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/aljaz320240.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="240"></a></p>
              <p>I write in response to criticism of Al Jazeera English’s recent story on homelessness in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Al Jazeera stands by the report which we feel is factually correct.</p>
              <p>The homeless couple featured in our report were locked out of the system of state support because of bureaucratic regulation.</p>
              <p>The fact that they were previously successful and had owned and sold
              homes was mentioned in the report, but was not strictly relevant.</p>
              <p>The real point of story was to illustrate how the safety net in
              Singapore sometimes fails to catch those who have fallen on hard times
              – whatever their background – because of the rules governing access to
              assistance.</p>
              <p>The Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports was twice
              invited to respond to the claims made in the report, but declined Al
              Jazeera’s request for an interview.</p>
              <p>Nevertheless, our reporter did include a previous statement from Dr
              Balakrishnan defending the Singaporean government’s approach to the
              problem of homelessness and we would like to renew our invitation to Dr
              Balakrishnan to appear on the channel to discuss this issue.</p>

              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">By Daniel Buenas</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">May 01, 2006</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">PEOPLE'S Action Party leaders - including Senior Minister <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold;">Goh Chok Tong - last night launched a scathing attack on veteran opposition leader Chiam See Tong's idea for economic union between Singapore and Malaysia.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Speaking at a PAP rally in Potong Pasir, Mr Goh - who has been tasked by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong to help the party's candidate Sitoh Yih Pin unseat incumbent Mr Chiam in the coming elections - said the opposition leader was not being a 'realist'.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">He was referring to Mr Chiam's suggestion at a rally in Chua Chu Kang Park on Saturday that <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold;">one way to grow the economy would be for Singapore and Malaysia to strike an economic union.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold;">'Economic union is possible only between two countries of equals, otherwise it is not possible,' Mr Goh said. 'My point for bringing this out is, to show that (while Mr Chiam) has some ideals, some vision, he is not a realist.'</strong></span></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Mr Chiam had also said on Saturday that such a union would allow Singaporeans to travel freely to Malaysia, and that because the Opposition has no history with the Malaysian government, it could 'bargain on a clean slate' on bilateral issues.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">In response, Mr Goh said: 'When it comes to negotiations with the Malaysians, would you rather Lee Kuan Yew negotiate or Chiam See Tong? Just ask yourself . . . would you rather I (or PM Lee) negotiate, or Chiam See Tong?'</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Mr Chiam's comments also came under fire from two other PAP leaders who turned up at the rally - Trade and Industry Minister Lim Hng Kiang and Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports Vivian Balakrishnan - as well as Mr Sitoh himself.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Mr Balakrishnan noted that, while Mr Chiam's plan would allow Singaporeans to 'pack their bags and travel to Malaysia anytime', it would also allow equal access to Singapore.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">'His teammates in the Singapore Democratic Alliance have been saying that <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold;">foreigners have been taking away jobs from Singaporeans,' Mr Balakrishnan said.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold;">'You want union? You want free entry of people, of foreigners . . . are you really talking about making this place so everyone can come here? No work permits, no employment pass no control? Think again. Think very carefully,' he said.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">In his speech, Mr Lim also questioned Mr Chiam's suggestion, and asked Singaporeans to compare the economic strategy of the PAP to that of the Opposition in order to judge who would better serve their interests.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">'Mr Chiam says, we join Malaysia, we have a market of 27 million straightaway. Therefore, we can have double-digit growth every year,' Mr Lim said. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold;">'Wah lau, so easy ah . . . so why just join Malaysia?

              <h2 class="posttitle">TOC’s response (Part Two) – A “tidy sum”?</h2>
              <p>taken from the article</p>
              <p><strong>Eddie’s “tidy sum”</strong></p>
              <p>Eddie was first married in the 1980s, and bought a three-room flat
                  direct from the HDB for approximately S$12,000. However, he was
                  divorced ten years later. The 3-room flat was sold for about S$30,000;
                  after CPF deductions, he walked away with a profit of approximately <strong>S$6,000</strong>.
                  He then bought a five-room flat from the HDB upon his second marriage
                  for S$129,000, using both his CPF and the money he had gained from the
                  sale of the three-room flat.</p>
              <p>In 1999/2000, financial problems forced him to sell his five-room
                  flat and downgrade to a four-room. The five-room flat was sold for
                  approximately S$290,000; after CPF deductions, the profit gained was <strong>S$112,000</strong>.
                  However, there were debts to pay: his brother had applied for a
                  personal loan with him as a guarantor. When his brother defaulted on
                  the loan, Eddie was left to pay it off (with interest). Other costs
                  included the renovation and furnishing of his new four-room flat, his
                  children’s education and the wedding of a daughter.</p>
              <p>Eddie was again divorced in 2007, and the four-room flat, bought at
                  S$140,000, was sold for S$170,000. As he was already over 55 years old
                  by then, after retaining about $70,000 in his CPF Retirement Account,
                  from the flat sale proceeds to meet his CPF Minimum Sum requirement, he
                  and his ex-wife were left with <strong>S$100,000</strong> from his CPF
                  withdrawal after 55, which was divided between them. He used the money
                  to open a food stall in Jurong West. Unfortunately, the business
                  eventually folded, exhausting his $50,000 from his after-55 CPF
                  withdrawal and saddling him with new debts.</p>
              <p><strong>So how did MCYS arrive at the “tidy sum of over S$220,000”? W<span style="color: #3366ff;"><em>e could
                  only surmise this was done by totalling up the profits from the sale of
                  the three flats: S$18,000 from the three-room, S$161,000 from the
                  five-room and S$30,000 from the four-room, which adds up to S$209,000</em></span>.
                  As Eddie gave TOC approximate figures, it is possible this is how the
                  S$220,000 sum was arrived at.</strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">However the sum may have been derived,<strong> the point is the way it was
                  presented by the minister in Parliament, which may have given the
                  impression that Eddie was sitting on a large sum of money.</strong></span><strong><span style="color: #3366ff;"> </span></strong><span style="color: #3366ff;">The fact is
                  that this is a simplistic view and rather misleading.</span></p>

              <p>Yes, beggars are there in every counties except whether they are allowed to be visible in public.</p>
              <p>I travelled around the world and many countries provide half way home or charity domitaries that these poor ppl can seek shelter. In Japan, the beggars camp in the gardens outside the palace and my Japanese colleagues told me this is an honest act to admit the baggar problem.</p>
