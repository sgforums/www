            <div class='col-md body'><br>Monday, October 02, 2006<br>When I read the Straits Times article (dated 24 Sep) on PM Lee calling the young to be committed and make a difference to Singapore, I have so much thought about the issue.<br><br>I am 35 years old, graduated from University and gainfully employed in a multinational company. But I cannot help but feel insecure over the future of Singapore. Lets face it, itÂ’s not uncommon to hear, Â“when you are above 40, you are over the hillÂ”. The government has been stressing on re-training, skills upgrading and re-adapt. The fact is, no matter how well qualified or adaptable one is, once you hit the magical 40, employers will say, Â“you are simply too oldÂ”.<br><br>We have been focusing our resources and problem solving on low unskilled labour. But in reality, our managerial positions and skilled labour force are actually fast losing its competitiveness. I travel around the region frequently for the past 10 years. It didnÂ’t take me long to realise how far our neighbours have come over the past decade. They have quality skilled workers, and are less expensive. When I work with them, their analytical skills are equally good, if not better than us.<br><br>ItÂ’s not new anymore. Taxi drivers are fast becoming Â“too early to retire, too old to workÂ” segment of the society. I like to talk to taxi drivers whenever I am heading for the airport. There was this driver. Eloquent and well read. He was an export manager for 12 years with an MNC. Retrenched at 40 years old. He had been searching for a job since his retrenchment. Although he was willing to lower his pay expectations, employers were not willing to lower their prejudice. He was deem too old. I wouldnÂ’t be surprised if we have another No. 1; having the most highly educated taxi drivers in the world.<br><br>On PM Lee calling the young to be committed and make a difference. Look around us. How dedicated can we be to Singapore when we can visualise whatÂ’s in store for us after we turned 40? Then again, how committed are employers to us? But we canÂ’t blame them. They have bottom lines &amp; shareholdersÂ’ gain to answer to. Onus is really on the government to revamp the society. A society that is not a pressure cooker. A society that does not mirror so perfectly, what survival of the fittest is. But a society, where itÂ’s people can be committed, do their best and not having to fear whether they will still wake up employed tomorrow. Sadly, Singapore does not offer such luxuries and security anymore.<br><br>On the issue of babies. The government encourage us to pro-create. The next generation is essential in sustaining our competitive edge. Then again, the current market condition is such that our future has become uncertain. There is no more joy in having babies anymore; they have become more of a liability. ItÂ’s really a chicken and egg issue.<br><br>Many of my peers, bright and well educated have packed up and left. ItÂ’s what MM Goh called Â“quittersÂ”. ItÂ’s sad but true, Singapore no longer is a place where one can hope to work hard their lives and retire graciously. ItÂ’s really the push factor. A future is something we sweat it out, build and call our own. Unfortunately, people like me, mid 30Â’s going on 40Â’s, staying put by choice or otherwise, we canÂ’t help but feel what lies ahead is really a gamble.<br><br>To PM Lee and the Ministers, we are on a different platform. Until you truly understand our insecurity, the future of Singapore to me remains a question mark.<br>posted by Derek at 10:51 PM 32 comments<br>About Me<br>Name<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">erek<br>View my complete profile<br><br>Links<br>Google News<br>Edit-Me<br>Edit-Me<br>Previous Posts<br>When I read the Straits Times article (dated 24 Se...<br>Archives<br>October 2006<br><br><strong></strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>Hey bro.,<br><br>It's a good article, it addresses issues that are current &amp; outstanding; "old" and un-wanted, &amp; the low birth rate. Both of these, are contributed by ONE singular factor - HIGH LIVING/OPERATING COSTS.<br><br>So it is CORRECT, that our gov should buck the hell up, and get things rectified before a motherlode CRAP, hits the giant fan!!!<br><br>Why DO THEY, always have to wait till CRAP hits the fan???<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"></div>
