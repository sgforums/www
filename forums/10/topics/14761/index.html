            <div class='col-md body'>I remember while I was in hospital, there was this big sized chinese recruit, he has a lot to say, one thing is when he knows that i am a sergeant, he kept addressing me as sergeant, I could even sit on his bed...lie on his bed.<br><br>After he was discharged, this time another big sized indian came in, we introduced ourselves, we even shook hands. He too was in stress from his training. After some time, he found that he had alot to talk about especially to the patient besides me, so he came over to sit on my bed.<br><br>Maybe its because I felt that he and I werent close enough so i didnt like it when he sat on my bed as if its public property. I wanted to tell him not to sit on my bed,, but I showed him the rank on my uniform instead, and politely gestured him to move away, he then brought a chair and sat on it, continuing his chat.<br><br>Are there any absolute rules on territory? Are these rules flexible and ingrained into our culture? Do people have access to something because they thought they are already familiar with it, or is it because cohabiting requires that each of us give up a part of our territorial claim? I ask these questions because if i know better, I can handle situations well enough..Maybe its because I outrank HIM, so I have the right to tell him to do things, just like I was outranked by my instructors in BMT(but that was their role) if I am a sergeant, does that give me the right to use the resources of those of a lower rank? I have to use common sense. Maybe rank is just an excuse for something else, and that each of us have our own preferences and sometimes, because we have the luxury to have an option, we chose to use this option of voicing out our preferences..(it is a luxury because in times of dire need eg war,famine, we have little choice).<br><br>Perhaps I should be apologetic to HIM who sat on my wardbed, perhaps I should have tolerated that, and it would have made me a better person?<br><br>Later that evening, the patient's parents came to visit him, they brought gifts of food and drinks for their son, and because of their amount, they wanted to have them shared among the patients in the ward.<br><br>I took a drink from their gifts: orange juice and I regretted it, I ask the uncle if i can pay for the drink, he said no, the auntie said she treated us all like her own children. When the parents left, the ward patients help themselves with the biscuits,,,<br>the next day I had a stomach upset, and I told myself never to eat any of the food or drink again.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>sometimes you have to use rank to seperate the various rank and file as if not,later you may find yourself in a situation where they will climb on top of your head,by then,it is harder to tell them to stop as they are used to this sort of behavior,so it's better to nip the problem in the bud  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">))</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Apologies for using the explicit f*** word in any of my posts. I believe all any posts with explicit f word here should be censored.<br><br>Rank, awards, grades are indicators of a person's morale, if not something else. We give someone rank for the depth that he has to go through, we give someone rank also for the lack of morale in certain situations that we anticipate in him.<br><br>Awards if given by others are morale boosters. They are called morale boosters for the depreciation in morale due to hard work. When people give hampers, gifts especially after a person has sufferred an injury, what the organisation really wants is asking the person not to cry and go out and sue the organisation. Gifts are morale boosters, they tell people to forget their grief for a while and let them know someone out there knows about their grief. Ranks, I say again, anticipate the lack of morale any one has during his term of service. It is given to boost morale and justify the effort that he has to go through. Sometimes even food is offered etc, or music. We even buy consumer items, eg. CDs, watch Movies, all of these are morale boosters, experiences that entertains the crying soul.<br><br>Here are the things that I am most afraid of:<br><br>1. Watching/Reading Pornography<br>2. Downloading/Buying/Exchanging Pornography<br>2. Masturbation<br>3. Yelling/Anger<br>4. Physical Injuries<br>5. Electrocution<br>6. Bad eating habits<br>7. Lack of exercise<br>8. Not being able to make at least 3 other people happy.<br><br>@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@<br>morale booster for you<br><br></div>
