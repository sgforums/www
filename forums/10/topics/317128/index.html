              <p>We are being told of danger of welfarism so often by the government ministers.<br> <br> We are also being told of openness and intention to listen to views and opinions of people.</p>
              <p>Are such statements sincere or honest?</p>
              <p>People can no doubt remember many times such promises were made but have these promises been kept or put into actions so far?</p>
              <p>It seems clear from what we see so far that power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely. What we see are not changes made or promises fulfilled but the same old arrogant condescending attitude: "Take us
              on if you can".</p>
              <p>What we see are hypocrites who do things to continue to
              deny problems or carry on their own selfish intent and agenda to serve
              their own interest. <br> <br> PM might have relented on the ministerial salary increment when caught
              in the bind but as soon as public anger subsided he goes on giving yet
              another round of increments to himself and his ministers - even to
              ministers who have caused so many hiccups in various ministries as
              reported in the auditor general 2007 reports.<br> <br> So see for yourself the fact about human nature - greed for monies and power will not change.<br> <br> They will continue to say one thing and do another and pay lip-service
              to openness but in actual fact they don't really give a damn what
              people think of their policies or doings.<br> <br> If they are that responsive as assumed by you they would have known of
              many good and truthful feedbacks from this and other forums or some
              newspapers without such pretension. <br> <br> Look at SM's recent warning to people and cautious advice to PM Lee
              about the danger of creating a welfare state just because of laterst
              CPF top-up. <br> <br> He conveniently forgets that in the first place if the government is to
              relent on its merciless hoarding monies by upping taxes and charges
              while holding back spending of taxes for essential services paid for by
              the people under taxes they would not be facing such plight as seen in
              thousands of ZAEMITEs as posted by you in other posts.<br> <br> For the past 40 plus years through such hoarding and profiteering
              schemes of all sorts the government has been hoarding monies on the
              quiet at the rate of some S$2-4 billion per year from land sale and
              capital gains from property belonging to the people while lying to the
              people that government is facing deficit in its annual budget <br> <br> It is not welfarism that is the danger today. The reverse of hoarding
              of tax monies and denying problems like the NKF and mas selamat
              complacency is the greater danger of them all. <br> <br> Who in the first place created such a situation. It is the government
              who has been sucking of monies non-stop from its long suffering people
              that we are encountering such a ZAENITE crisis today.<br> <br> So is SM Goh being honest with the people or himself by giving such
              pretentious caution to the people or PM or is he only trying to stay in
              the good book of the power that be himself of whom he was truly afraid.<br> <br> If government is honest with the people do not keep over-taxing and
              profiteering so much from lands already owned and paid for by taxes by
              the people for public housing or medical care long long ago we would
              have done better instead of in a doldrum for years.<br> <br> So it is abundantly clear that the so-called handing out after jacking
              the GST to 7% is not a hand-out and will for a fact not result in any
              welfarism.<br> <br> They have already made up their mind not to listen or react to views
              and opinions which they cannot reply but would nevertheless bite the
              bullet and carry on doing things that benefit them.<br> <br> So it is for show they put up such a forum which basically is a
              mechanism for ventilating the frustrations by the aggrieved citizens.<br> <br> Nothing will change because of the selfish nature of men. Even after
              talking to the arabs government is getting complacent when the
              negligence of the ministry of home affair was found by the inquiry MM
              Lee just looks the other way and pretend never mentioning those words
              at all.<br> <br> It is not that open as you have put it so I don't see results in the opening up to people yet. <br> <br> Reach or Feedback Unit will be for show and for justification only. I
              bet if MM Lee and ministers can guess what are being written here and
              various forums are the truths but it looks like he is pretending not to
              know the emperor may be naked.<br> <br> Nature of men is such that MM Lee and ministers after finding security
              in legalistic tweaking of laws and parliament have concluded there is
              no need for change and are deliberately refraining to study the truths
              or views and opinions on the NKF malpractices or the WKS fumbling in
              the Selamat case.</p>

              <p>Danger of welfarism?   It is of course dangerous to have welfare as it may affect the earnings of the greedy PAP.   Now with limited, very minimal welfare from PAP they can be assured they will continue to draw obscene undeserved super high world class salary. </p>
              <p>Goh choke tong and cold blooded lee hsien loong don't give a damn to provide more deserved welfare to the people because they are not the common people who find it tough to make a living in Singapore.   What they have now is power to control the people and lots of money - millions dollar paid ministers who don't need any welfare at all from anyone.   They have the money and power so they choose to close a blind eye to people who deserve and need welfare from the govt.</p>
              <p>Goh choke tong should learn to shut his mouth if it is unnecessary for him to speak.   The more he speaks the more he reveals the ugly side of him.</p>
              <p>PAP is not a responsible gahmen where providing welfare for the people is concerned.</p>

              <p>Hi Robert,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>               MM Lee seemed to be concern about the brain drain such as</p>
              <p>150000 local studying or working in other countries plus 1000 locals</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>migrating to other countries each year. It seemed some of the foreign professional merely using this country as a stepping stone to other countries. How come the  govt is still having a liberalized immigration policy? England already tightened its immigration policy after having allowed many of the Polish professional to work in Britain.</p>

              <p>True.Although i also talk rubbish on the forum sometimes,but everytime i will realise it n try to avoid making the same mistake again.And i dont talk rubbish just to boot-lick someone.</p>
              <p>But this Goh Chok Tong is different,everytime he talk rubbish,he doesnt seem to realise it.And he make such speech just to make his "master" Lee Kuan Yew n his son happy,so that he can continue get high pay,live bunglow and eat his cheap "peanuts".He has really no backbone or dignity for himself.Many Singaporeans n foreigners really despise him.</p>
              <p>If i has a son like him,earn alot of money n get high ministerial post,but must sell his soul n boot-lick a dictator and do alot of harmful thing to his own countrymen.I would rather my son live a more simple life and be able to face his conscious.</p>

              <p>I have no opinion against Goh Chok Tong since he does not wield real power in Singapore.</p>
              <p>I don't want Goh Chok Tong to die.</p>
              <p>I want Lee Kuan Yew to die.</p>
              <p>These people in power in Singapore, they are all handpicked by the ringleader.</p>
              <p><em><br></em></p>
              <p><em><strong><span style="font-family: Arial;">It seems that often they did not
              like it, but let's go back: How did you first get into politics?</span></strong></em></p>
              <p><em><span style="font-family: Arial;">In the early 1970s, <strong>Lee Kuan Yew asked
              me for an interview to get me involved to stand for election</strong>. I stood in
              1972 and I won and became a PAP backbencher. A year later, Lee asked me
              to take up ministerial office but I turned it down because my younger brother
              was dying of cancer. I had to assist him and to settle his affairs after
              he died at the age of 25. Then Lee Kuan Yew approached me again and this
              time I agreed to take up office. Lee is very persuasive. </span></em></p>
              <p><em><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong>He must have been impressed to make
              you a minister so quickly -- you were a young architect with no experience
              of</strong> <strong>politics.</strong></span></em></p>
              <p><em><span style="font-family: Arial;">Yes, I was not trained to become a
              minister or a politician, but you learn on the job.</span></em></p>
              <p><em><strong><span style="font-family: Arial;">Around this time you were discussing
              the succession to PM Lee?</span></strong></em></p>
              <p><em><span style="font-family: Arial;">Lee Kuan Yew had been discussing this
              since about 1983. At that time, the second echelon was Tony Tan, S. Dhanabalan,
              Goh Chok Tong and myself. </span></em></p>
              <p><em><strong><span style="font-family: Arial;">Were you a candidate for the top
              job?</span></strong></em></p>
              <p><em><span style="font-family: Arial;">I was considered as a member of the
              group. At that time, we did not know who would be the successor to Lee.
              We finally made the decision to pick Goh Chok Tong. He agreed on condition
              that I agreed to be his number two. So I was the second DPM; he was the
              first DPM. In 1988, Lee asked Goh to take over, but he was not ready. He
              said: two more years. So two years later, he took the job. </span></em></p>
              <p><em><strong><span style="font-family: Arial;">Lee did not agree with your decision
              to pick Goh.</span></strong></em></p>
              <p><em><span style="font-family: Arial;">No, he did not disagree. He said he
              would leave it to us. His own first choice was Tony Tan. Goh Chok Tong
              was his second choice. I was his third choice because he said my English
              was not good enough. He said Dhanabalan was not right because Singapore
              was not ready for an Indian prime minister. That upset the Indian community.
              There was quite a bit of adverse reaction to what he said. But he speaks
              his mind. He is the only one who can get away with it...</span></em></p>

              <p>Nah,Goh Chok Tong dont have the power or quality to start anything,it is Lou Lee who started all the chaos.SM Goh is just a boot-licking eunuch who work under Lee family control.</p>
              <p>But,sometimes,a boot-licker is more hated n despised by the public than a dictator himself.In world war 2,there is a fat general who boot-lick Hitler all the times,although i have forgotton his name.....Anyway,this arrogant !diot general keep giving wrong advice to Hitler n mess up some important military strategy planned by other capable German general.</p>
              <p>For example,when the German defeated the allied of French n British troops,the allied retreated to a bay,waiting for their ships from Britain to rescue them.At this point,the German troops can easily attack the encircled allied armies n catch all the allied troops.But this big fat stupid boot-licking general told Hitler that his air force can takecare of the allied armies n force them to surrender.</p>
              <p>In the end,it only give allied armies enough time to get on their ships n escape from German encirclement.This prove to be one of the fatal mistakes make by Hitler n his boot-licking general,cause it provide the allied enough manpower to counter-attack Germany on Normandy later on.</p>

              <p>That would be the "Dunkirk" episode.</p>
              <p>Here is an interpretation of that event by William Engdahl:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>...Guderian's tank forces were pulling tight a fatal net around the core
              of French and British troops, driving them towards the port of Dunkirk
              on the sea, when one of the most extraordinary events of the war
              occurred.</em></p>
              <p class="Lauftext" style="text-align: left;"><em>General Guderian had
              advanced an astonishing 250 miles across enemy terrain in only 11 days.
              <strong>Then, with his Panzer forces at Gravelines, only ten miles from
              Dunkirk, orders came down on May 24, that his tanks were to halt.</strong> </em></p>
              <p class="Lauftext" style="text-align: left;"><em>Guderian's
              forces had been within hours of capturing more than 300,000 of the
              best-trained professional soldiers of the British Expeditionary Force,
              along with some 100,000 of France's best -trained and equipped men.
              Guderian at first read the order with disbelief. <strong>His commander, General
              von Kleist, stated that, on receiving the order, "I decided to ignore
              it, and to push on across the canal. But then came a more emphatic
              order that I was to withdraw behind the canal. My tanks were kept
              halted there for three days."</strong></em></p>
              <p class="Lauftext" style="text-align: left;"><em>The
              order had come directly from Hitler. The three days pause was intended,
              though Hitler did not tell his generals at the time, to allow Britain's
              best fighting force escape by ship across the Channel to England. He
              intended it as a clear gesture of good will towards his British
              adversary.</em></p>
              <p class="Lauftext" style="text-align: left;"><em>That
              was the "miracle of Dunkirk," which Churchill's strictly censored
              wartime press propaganda in England portrayed as divine providence
              smiling down on the chosen British people. The British population would
              have been no doubt quite surprised, had they been allowed to learn the
              truth, that the one who had smiled on their army at Dunkirk had in fact
              been Hitler. </em></p>
              <p class="Lauftext" style="text-align: left;"><em>A
              week later, referring to this "miracle of Dunkirk," Churchill told the
              House of Commons and the entire nation over the BBC radio, "We shall
              defend our island, whatever the cost may be; we shall fight on the
              beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the
              fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never
              surrender..." </em></p>
              <p class="Lauftext" style="text-align: left;"><em>It wasn't exactly the response Hitler had in mind...</em></p>

              <p>Hmmm....i think i got my history wrong.Nevertheless,there is really such a boot-licking incompetent big fat general in World War 2.I have found his name through internet,his name is Hermann Goering.</p>
              <p>I remember some years ago,i have read a book about another German general Von Manstein.And in this book,he described Goering as an incompetent boot-licking general,only know how to boot-lick Hitler all the times n know nothing.In the battle of Stalingrad in 1942,the Soviet armies surrounded German troops.Many German generals request Hitler to pull out his troops from the city while still can,but Goering advice Hitler to defend Stalingrad instead of retreating from it.</p>
              <p>The incompetent boot-licking big fat general promise Hitler that his air force is able to sent 500 tons of military supplies to the encircled German troops,so that they will be able to withstand Soviets assault n waiting for rescue troops.</p>
              <p>In the end,only around 100 tons or less military supplies were sent to the encircled German troops n in the end,the whole German armies was captured by the Soviet soldiers.</p>
              <p>You guys type in Hermann Goering in Yahoo website,and you will read about his "accomplishment".This big fat incompetant boot-licking general remind me of our dear Goh Chok Tong^^</p>
