              <p>Perharps in the past but i think that is changing.....i just don't see that will continue. In France you have alot of North African french of the colonial past, and Eastern Europeans have migrated there, Vietnames...as well.  </p>
              <p>Japan and Korea while the country is very much monolitics but their citizens have move out so diversity is only a matter of time to ensure vitality of the countries....of course you have remote regime Inner mogol, North Korea, Bhutan.....</p>
              <p>Maturity does not come by forcing but certainly not thru social engineering of importing a particular group of people to influence nation direction either.</p>
              <p>It has to be borned out from being in a "GROUP that derived the same conclusion of the same destiny".... than you have a Nation....</p>
              <p>There is not necessary to look outside and say that is who we are.....but look inward and said this is who we are.</p>

              <p>i also dunno what you are saying, but as an immigrant here, i would say Singaporeans need to look at themselve before taking on immigrants who are here to help your society and economy.

              <p><br>The north african in France were probably still keen to serve their colonial master, same as the vietnamese, but how much are they prepared to give up their own culture, it is yet to be seen. Question is whether the Frenchie were prepared to accept the vietnamese culture as part of the French culture. many asian origin speaking french and eat baguette don't make french a multi cultural society. Will muslim women be allowed to wear what they like in schools?</p>
              <p>In France, Korea, Japan....many people have international outlook, but their culture, tradition, is part of their society, their country, they are not multi cultural society like singapore.</p>
              <p>Chinese, Malay and Indian will continue to retain our cultures, tradition, heritage for many years to come. If there is a pre concieved idea on what singaporean is, Singaporean should know.</p>
