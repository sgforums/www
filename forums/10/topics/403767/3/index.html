              <p>I believe that this is a topic that is not only brought up by me but also by many fellow Singaporeans. Somehow I felt that this topic has been avoided.</p>
              <p>Our government puts strong emphasis on bringing in foreign talents to make up for our declining birth rates over the years. I support this effort. But it seems the government has portrayed such a movement to be the high influx of Bengali workers. What sort of culture is our government promoting? </p>
              <p>A culture where we have 'peaceful' weekend of staring at people altogether?</p>
              <p>I remember there was this 'staring' incident about a decade ago that resulted in gang fights. And thus, from there, the government actually discouraged such 'staring' incidents.</p>
              <p>Maybe the 'staring' from the Bengalis are a in a different form. But there doesn't seem to be anyone discouraging them. And such group of people gathered in groups near shopping centres, MRT stations, wandering about, and of course, staring.</p>
              <p>What about the term 'illegal gathering'? It somehow seems to be not there anymore?</p>
              <p>The government also encourages more people to get married to establish families, to have kids. Weekends and public holidays are supposed to be family days. With so many Bengalis gathering at these public places where families used to gather, will the government be still be able to promote more birth rates?</p>
              <p>Why is the government somehow promoting the presence of Bengalis instead? Why are we encouraging their disturbingly cheeky behaviour? Why are we having such foreigners squeezing up in supermarkets, purchasing just 1or 2 items in their baskets? Why are we having television programs telling us to understand these Bengali workers and their behaviours? Why must such education be brought to us and not to them, if the government intend to avoid their increasing presence? Isn't the government concerned about social imbalance?</p>

              <p>true: they are here to do jobs that we shun</p>
              <p>but i would advise those who are side with the bengalis to think again, while it is als true that most of them work in condtruction side, many do not know this, compare to the workman ship of some older buildings , the facilities of the newer ones are in some aspect shoddy, i have witness firsthand some flaws where they will just "cover up" and leave it there like nothing happen, sometimes the supervisor come also act stupid and behave like nothing happen when there is a crack  in the wall or something broken in the doors.</p>
              <p>in the beginning i assumed this was mainly based on the low budget,lousy supervisor issues, but somehow nowadays they seem to auto do this bad habit even when it is wrong.</p>
              <p>go check on any buildings now that is done by them, go see if you can and compare to the older buildings how shoddy the workmanship can get in the newer ones.</p>

              <p>These workers are here to earn a living to feed their families back home, and they are doing the all the hard labour we would not want to do. It is because of them that we have the schools, hospitals, shopping malls, and even houses which we live in now. They left their home to build a home for all of us, shouldn't we be more appreciative and grateful?</p>
              <p>They work here day and night with no complains and they have to take discrimination as well? Yes, they may stare, but they mean no harm at all. They stare because they have never seen the way of life and people outside of their country before. Not because they want to start a fight or do anything harmful.</p>
              <p>Its also not the case where a worker stares at u all the way from the point he saw u until a point u disappear from his sight right. He'll look away after a while eventually after a min or so.</p>

              <p>Yea i know what u mean, those workers doing shoddy work and dirtying the place and all.</p>
              <p>i just wanna say that some of them, not all, behave that way. So we shouldn't judge them as a whole based on some of them. But at the end of the day, what i want to convey is that just try not to discriminate them so much and just leave them be unless they did us wrong.</p>

              <p>true: they are here to do jobs that we shun</p>
              <p>but i would advise those who are side with the bengalis to think again, while it is als true that most of them work in condtruction side, many do not know this, compare to the workman ship of some older buildings , the facilities of the newer ones are in some aspect shoddy, i have witness firsthand some flaws where they will just "cover up" and leave it there like nothing happen, sometimes the supervisor come also act stupid and behave like nothing happen when there is a crack  in the wall or something broken in the doors.</p>
              <p>in the beginning i assumed this was mainly based on the low budget,lousy supervisor issues, but somehow nowadays they seem to auto do this bad habit even when it is wrong.</p>
              <p>go check on any buildings now that is done by them, go see if you can and compare to the older buildings how shoddy the workmanship can get in the newer ones.</p>

              <p>I believe that this is a topic that is not only brought up by me
              but also by many fellow Singaporeans. Somehow I felt that this
              topic has been avoided.</p>
              <p>Our government puts strong emphasis on bringing in foreign
              talents to make up for our declining birth rates over the years. I
              support this effort. But it seems the government has portrayed
              such a movement to be the high influx of Bengali workers.
              What sort of culture is our government promoting? </p>
              <p>A culture where we have 'peaceful' weekend of staring at people
              altogether?</p>
              <p>I remember there was this 'staring' incident about a decade ago
              that resulted in gang fights. And thus, from there, the government
              actually discouraged such 'staring' incidents.</p>
              <p>Maybe the 'staring' from the Bengalis are a in a different form.
              But there doesn't seem to be anyone discouraging them. And such
              group of people gathered in groups near shopping centres, MRT
              stations, wandering about, and of course, staring.</p>
              <p>What about the term 'illegal gathering'? It somehow seems to be
              not there anymore?</p>
              <p>The government also encourages more people to get married to
              establish families, to have kids. Weekends and public holidays are
              supposed to be family days. With so many Bengalis gathering at
              these public places where families used to gather, will the
              government be still be able to promote more birth rates?</p>
              <p>Why is the government somehow promoting the presence of Bengalis
              instead? Why are we encouraging their disturbingly cheeky
              behaviour? Why are we having such foreigners squeezing up in
              supermarkets, purchasing just 1or 2 items in their baskets? Why are
              we having television programs telling us to understand these
              Bengali workers and their behaviours? Why must such education be
              brought to us and not to them, if the government intend to avoid
              their increasing presence? Isn't the government concerned
              about social imbalance?</p>
