              <p>Who is liable for such Social problems? Anwser is here,</p>
              <p><em>LAW and Second Home Affairs Minister K. Shanmugam reiterated yesterday that the security of places like MRT depots should be a partnership between the Government, private corporations and the public.</em></p>
              <p><em><strong>It is not the sole responsibility of the Government, for if it were so, taxpayers would end up paying the bill for the security of private sector companies.</strong></em></p>
              <p><em>'You ask yourself: Is it fair? When you say Government, ultimately the people pay for it,' he said.</em></p>
              <p><em><strong>'We have thousands of private organisations which are profit-oriented and make money for their shareholders. It is impossible, and unacceptable, to require the taxpayer to pay for the security of all these profit-making companies, both in terms of the manpower required and the sheer cost</strong>,' he added.</em></p>
              <p><em>Speaking on the sidelines of a community event in Sembawang GRC, he was replying to reporters' questions about the role of the Government in preventing security breaches at MRT depots.</em></p>
              <p><em>Some netizens have recently charged that the Government should take responsibility for the security lapse at the Changi depot and not shift the blame on to SMRT.</em></p>
              <p><em>They based their argument on the fact that Temasek Holdings, which is owned by the Ministry of Finance, has a majority stake in SMRT.</em></p>
              <p><em>Mr Shanmugam rejected these charges as based on a 'misconception' of SMRT.</em></p>
              <p><em>'It is not a government entity. It declares dividends which go to the shareholders. You and I, if we are not shareholders, we won't get the dividends,' he said.</em></p>
              <p><em>Since SMRT 'deals with the transport of millions of people', its security awareness 'has to be very high', he stressed.</em></p>
              <p><em>He also disputed the assertion that SMRT is not a private sector company simply because it is majority-owned by Temasek, saying that Temasek owns stakes in many companies in and outside Singapore.</em></p>
              <p>So Companies that brings in these Bengalis should make sure they are well behaved!</p>

              <p>TS and some posts here say very badly about Singaporean (if you are) as a people, and singapore as a multi racial society.</p>
              <p>I do not differentiate people by their skin colour, "dark skin", "yellow skin", or "white skin", I differentiate them by how polite, courteous, ....they are. You are not anywhere near what I would call civilized human being.</p>
              <p> Whether one appear "unsightly" or not is individual opinion. They may be unsightly to you but believe me or not, you are unsightly to all the rest of the people in singapore!</p>
              <p>Where they come from, bangala, india, china, myanmar...does not matter, they are in Singapore for a purpose, recognized by their boss, and the government. do you have a reason for your existance?</p>

              <p>isn't Temasek a GLC?? so why should SMRT be alone to bear the cost??, besides i think he does have dividends, just that he fail to see it in his account lol.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>btw wrong message here, what i know of SMRT, they don't have these type of workers, mostly these are sub contract from them or somewhere else.</p>

              <p>All these are the characteristics of a nation. But it will take the population to mature and bond together and unmistakenly called themselved Singaporean.</p>

              <p>What make you proud of as a singaporean?</p>
              <p>how can anyone take away that pride?</p>
              <p>I am proud of Singapore because I can show my foreign visitors that you can feel like India when you are in serangoon, china when in china town, or may be geylang, a malaysian kampung when in geylang serai, and like in any cospomolitan city when you are in orchard road.</p>
              <p>I am proud to show people the many different places of worships, especially a chinese temple, a church, and an indian temple side by side.</p>
              <p>why are you so concerned about the bangladeshi in Singapore? why are you worried about being killed? </p>
