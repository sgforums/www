              <p>The same could be said about Philippines right now. I see them greatly outnumbering locals over at Orchard Station and Far East on weekends. </p>
              <p>But to call other races unsightly is downright racism. </p>
              <p>Besides, I think most foreigners who work in the service line serves better than most locals do. At least thats the impression I've been getting. Most times, locals serve like shit is becoz customers can be irritatingly dumb and arrogant.</p>

              <p>This is the problem in that human beings need to find a balance between being polite and politically correct, and suppressing or expressing, his own inner instincts.</p>
              <p>The fact of the matter is,</p>
              <p>Human beings are racist creatures.</p>
              <p>In sociology,</p>
              <p>We prefer people who look like us, and we want to associate and hang around people who look like us.</p>
              <p>So when such negative sentiments arise, when someone is discomforted with the presence of people from racially very opposite group........I believe we need to look at it more objectively and understandingly, and not just dismiss it outright.</p>
              <p>This is a problem and a dilemma because there is also a discomfort and worry if an idea or discussion go to too far to the right (extreme right). And I believe the majority of people, of all groups, do not like far-right thumpings and rhetorics. However I see a little bit of too much PC attitude here (politically correct) and this discomfort is quickly shoved to under the carpet.</p>
              <p>This reminds me of Gordon Brown calling an old lady "bigoted" but actually many people feel like that old lady.</p>
              <p>Then Gordon Brown lost the election.</p>
              <p>In Singapore situation is almost the same.</p>
              <p>The area of race is sensitive and I dont know whether what a person says on the surface is really what he is feeling on the inside.</p>

              <p>Then you condemn the <em>behaviour</em>, not the <em>people</em>!</p>
              <p>You should be comdemning things like how you find their leering of women and their copious spitting on the ground to be unsightly, not <em>the people themselves</em>!</p>
              <p>The standard of your English is not 'not good'. Rather, it is <em>pathetic</em>. Do you know what is the meaning of 'pathetic'? It means that it is so beyond all hope of salvage that it is just so sad. </p>
              <p>Because of your extremely-poor command of English, instead of condemning the behaviour, you end up condemning the people. You can protest all you want, but what matters is not the message that you intended, but the message <em>you send out</em>. I seriously hope you have enough of an intelligence to understand that.</p>
              <p>Now, moderators, please close this utterly pathetic thread.</p>

              <p>It is uncomfortable to see so many dark skin guys (includes the indian, thai, bengalis... ) gathering. And it is a fact that they have nothing to do during weekends. </p>
              <p>Basically they like to gather together in their own area, it just mean then there is no good places for them to hang out, they also cannot blend with the local community well. Perhaps, the government should start to think about providing leisure activities or shopping centres for our foreign workers. </p>
              <p>You cannot blame them for the behaviors, as if they are really well-educated and well-cultured, then they will not be doing the odd jobs in Singapore. But FYI, some of the dark skin people that you see gathering is educated and white-collared. It is just that they have no place to hang out during the weekend.  </p>

              <p>Oh, and as a corollary, I don't see what's so wrong about the Bangla workers congregating.</p>
              <p>If that is so wrong, then by extension, we should ban families from congregating at parks, and teens from holding BBQ cookouts and mass cycling events.</p>
              <p>What really irks me is when those Banglas spit on the ground and all. I am all for enforcement against such behaviour. But then again, I am also against having teenagers engaging in anti-social behaviour like spitting at cars from overhead bridges.</p>
              <p>Congregation by itself is not a bad thing; it is negative behaviour during such congregation that is bad. </p>
              <p>For failing to distinguish between the two, this thread is a total FAIL.</p>

              <p>Why you Yellow Skin people like to eat pork and dig your nose in publics?.......Could you kindly elaborate what do you means by "Dark Skin people" </p>
              <p>They are different ethnicities they are different race. Most of them are Parents themselves and have kids in their home countries. And they also expressed love and affection to another human relationship.</p>
              <p>what does education got to do with being "cultured"  Singapore has none our history can't even compared with many south asian.</p>
