              <p>I believe that this is a topic that is not only brought up by me but also by many fellow Singaporeans. Somehow I felt that this topic has been avoided.</p>
              <p>Our government puts strong emphasis on bringing in foreign talents to make up for our declining birth rates over the years. I support this effort. But it seems the government has portrayed such a movement to be the high influx of Bengali workers. What sort of culture is our government promoting? </p>
              <p>A culture where we have 'peaceful' weekend of staring at people altogether?</p>
              <p>I remember there was this 'staring' incident about a decade ago that resulted in gang fights. And thus, from there, the government actually discouraged such 'staring' incidents.</p>
              <p>Maybe the 'staring' from the Bengalis are a in a different form. But there doesn't seem to be anyone discouraging them. And such group of people gathered in groups near shopping centres, MRT stations, wandering about, and of course, staring.</p>
              <p>What about the term 'illegal gathering'? It somehow seems to be not there anymore?</p>
              <p>The government also encourages more people to get married to establish families, to have kids. Weekends and public holidays are supposed to be family days. With so many Bengalis gathering at these public places where families used to gather, will the government be still be able to promote more birth rates?</p>
              <p>Why is the government somehow promoting the presence of Bengalis instead? Why are we encouraging their disturbingly cheeky behaviour? Why are we having such foreigners squeezing up in supermarkets, purchasing just 1or 2 items in their baskets? Why are we having television programs telling us to understand these Bengali workers and their behaviours? Why must such education be brought to us and not to them, if the government intend to avoid their increasing presence? Isn't the government concerned about social imbalance?</p>

              <p>i dun think its good to use the word "unsightly"...it will be the same remark made by ang mohs in other country when they see "chinks"...some even spit on the same yellow skin we are wearing....</p>
              <p>i understand the concern for safety and it should be addressed for it is our ground (and if there is any cause for such alarm) ...but "unsightly" - no....its not the right word...thats too much..</p>
              <p>its a matter of perception we see them...position them with all human features they have like us...that may minimize one's biasness...</p>

              <p>the concept of "neighbourhood watch" is in place but needs to strengthen and enhancement with efficient police forces...thats the best alternative to date...are we concerned with each other safety? </p>
