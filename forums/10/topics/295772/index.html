            <div class='col-md body'><br>It is such incidences that makes it hard to argue for the cause of locals...<br><br>For ANYTHING to change, first the PEOPLE must change.... !!<br><br>=====================================<br><strong>Freeloaders flock to 'Pay what you want' charity buffet lunch at Shenton Way<br>HE TAKES 5 SERVINGS, GIVES $2<br>By Chong Shin Yen<br><br>December 07, 2007       </strong><br><br>THEY came in droves, ate their fill - and more than half left without giving generously.<br><br>Mr Tan Teck Boon dropped $2 into the donation box before heading for the buffet line for a hearty lunch. -- Pictures: CHOO CHWEE HUA<br>Instead of being charged a flat amount for the buffet lunch, diners were told to pay as they wished - with the proceeds going to charity.<br><br>While some gave generously, more than half of the 400 or so customers, including well-dressed office workers, seemed to take the donation drive's slogan - 'Who says there's no such thing as a free lunch?' - literally.<br><br>Some walked out without digging into their pockets while others, like Mr Tan Teck Boon, gave only $2.<br><br>This, for a buffet lunch that would normally have cost $16.<br><br>The 51-year-old retiree was at the Geek Terminal restaurant at Market Street yesterday.<br><br>Mr Tan dropped a $2 note into the donation box at the entrance before going in.<br><br>He visited the buffet line at least five times, with plates piled high. Just before leaving, he had one more go. He piled his paper plate with fruits and then walked out of the restaurant hurriedly.<br><br>He was still eating his fruits when The New Paper approached him outside the restaurant.<br><br>Before we could ask any questions, he said in Mandarin: 'I did put in $2!'<br><br>He then said that it was his second go at the charity buffet since the five-day charity drive began on Monday.<br><br>He was on the way to the bank on Tuesday when he walked past the restaurant and saw a banner advertising the 'free lunch'.<br><br>'I saw that it was free, so I went in. The food was good and it was really worth it,' said Mr Tan.<br><br>He then gave $3 and decided to return again yesterday.<br><br>As to why he gave $1 less on his second visit, he said: 'I give as I like lor.'<br><br>Would he return again? Mr Tan, who lives in Ang Mo Kio, replied: 'Of course! Why not?'<br><br>The restaurant can seat around 60 diners but it was filled to more than capacity at times.<br><br>Those who could not get a seat would stand while they tucked into their food.<br><br>One of Geek Terminal's owners, MrDanny Pang, 38, said that freeloaders had been turning up since the charity drive began.<br><br>Said Mr Pang: 'There were many who came and left without donating.<br><br>'I was helping to make coffee on Monday and many came in for a cup of cappucino or latte but left without leaving a cent.'<br><br>He said a cup of coffee is normally sold at $3.50. However, his staff would not approach diners who do not donate.<br><br>One such diner was Mr Ron Quan, 39, a marketing executive who was dressed in a short-sleeved shirt and pants.<br><br>When we approached him, he sheepishly admitted that he had eaten for free.<br><br>'I will make my donations directly to the charity some other time,' he said, before rushing off to take the train back to his office in Suntec City.<br><br>The restaurant was hoping its donation drive would raise $100,000.<br><br>Other than the buffet lunch, from 11.30am to 2.30pm, the restaurant is also holding auctions daily for sponsored electronic products like bluetooth headsets and webcams.<br><br>Proceeds from the auctions and the lunch donations will go to the charity organisation Mainly I Love Kids (Milk), which reaches out to chronically-ill, disabled or disadvantaged children and youths.<br><br>The restaurant is six months old, and provides the same menu during the charity drive as it does on regular days - Asian cuisine on Monday and Tuesday, Western on Wednesday and Thursday, and International on Friday.<br><br>Yesterday's buffet had 10 dishes which included salad, soup, butter rice, teriyaki chicken, assam fish and fruits.<br><br>Mr Pang said that on regular days, the restaurant takes in an average of $4,000.<br><br>He said: 'Monday's auction raised $3,000 and we got $2,000 on Tuesday. We have not counted the money in the donation box yet but I estimate it to be around $1,000 so far.'<br><br>Mr Pang said that Milk will only open the donation box at the end of Friday.<br><br>Although the amount collected so far is way off their target, Mr Pang said that it was okay because it is all in the name of charity.<br><br>Mr Pang said that while more than half of the diners were freeloaders or 'cheapskates', there were others who were generous too.<br><br>In general, he said that expatriates were more willing to give and share.<br><br>'On Tuesday, six of them came in for a cup of cappuccino. When they learnt that we were running a donation drive, they each gave $20,' said Mr Pang.<br><br>'We also had locals who gave amounts ranging from $10 to $50, and that was heart-warming.'<br><br>Mr Aaron Desange, an expatriate from Australia, has been having his lunch at Geek Terminal since Monday and gives $15 each time.<br><br>Together with a fellow expatriate, they spent $210 bidding for three electronic items yesterday.<br><br>Mr Desange even offered to give a bluetooth headset to this reporter, saying that he and his friend did not really need the products.<br><br>'It's all for charity, doesn't matter how much. Now I have so many Christmas gifts to give away,' he said.<br><br></div>

You're lucky people don't drop in a button or a paperclip!<br><br>-- Picture: CHOO CHWEE HUA<br>A restaurant in Shenton Way thinks it has hit on a novel way to be charitable.<br><br>This week only, eat all you want from its normal-priced $16 buffet lunch, and pay what you will into a box, proceeds to be donated to a charity.<br><br>Spare me the 'but you know lah typical Singaporean sure eat $20 worth and then put in $2 yadda-yadda'.<br><br>Why should you expect any different from the stereotypical?<br><br>There are eating joints which have dedicated a day's takings (eat what you will, donate what you want) to some home. No two people gave the same amount, no two appetites and wallets being identical.<br><br>Most recently, Radiohead made their latest album, In Rainbows, available via download and you pay what you feel it's worth, whether $10, $1, 10 cents, whatever.<br><br>In Radiohead's case, it can be written off as a publicity stunt - they have generated hype enough for fans to buy the later-released CD of In Rainbows.<br><br>Back to Shenton Way and its office crowd.<br><br>Many of us - whether in collar, shirt and tie or in flip-flops - do give to charity in our own small way.<br><br>Now, if some good-hearted, well-meaning establishment wants to take that a step further by returning something to society, like feeding 5,000 on a donation basis, it should not then beat its chest because the collection does not reflect the consumption.<br><br>You asked for it.<br><br>Kind, but dumb business model lah!<br><br>I know there are days when one does not have the impression this city is Singapore.<br><br>But it is, and mati mati, die die, we love discounts and sales, sometimes more than we like our mothers.<br><br>And this was seen as one such offer too good to pass up.<br><br>So if you stick a sign that invites me to eat all I want and then pay what I want for that pleasure, buddy, don't be shocked when all I will spare is a dime.<br><br>What part of your own signage do you not understand?<br><br>You say eat what, I eat lor, then you say give how much, I give $2; wrong meh?<br><br>It's the Singaporean following the law to a cursive T.<br><br>He would have followed it to an M if the restaurant had suggested a minimum sum of $7 or $12. (He would then have also made sure to eat at least $25 worth of nosh.)<br><br>Singaporeans are generous to charities through official channels. So we saw this as a bargain.<br><br>Come, I buy you all lunch.<br><br>Buffet for five, only $10.<br><br>What is this restaurant's intention?<br><br>To collect for charity?<br><br>Then it was not quite well-thought through, because it did not get a lot, did it?<br><br></div>
