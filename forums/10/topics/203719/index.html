Poor people like me would end up with no job and no income.<br><br>At the end of the sanction, after many sg citizens starve, our ministars will fly back and give themselves generous raises for lifting the sanction and for "weathering" through the hardship and we'll be back to square one.</div></blockquote>u might see it this way but in the long run...<br>look at this pic,after the trade sanction,if the govt continue their bad ways,they would have failed to deliver wat they promsied and lose out in the next elections<br><br>when sg is under a better govt which is more transparent,there wuld b a more better future</div>

Are u staying in a major city?<br><br>What about a car in germany? how much does it cost to own one? and wat taxes involved wif owning a car? How does it compare wif SG?<br><br>From my own experiences overseas, it is common (esp in more rural areas) that bus rides are expensive and very infrequent, reason is of coz the service covers *much* more distance and also most people own a private vehicle anyway. cars are much cheaper when compared to SG right?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>So if u're staying there for some time, it makes more sense to drive a car.<br></div>

I do not rent but my house hold bills easily exceeds $500 regularly. MRT rides cost way less than $4 so its still affordable. I would like to cycle to work but the distance (bedok to novena), inherent hatred against cyclists and culture prevents me from cycling to work. And my employers frown upon usage of the executive bathroom by entry level staff. Long story short, I'd get fired within the first month I start cycling.<br><br>No one cooks at home so I usually eat instant noodles at home or eat out.<br><br>As long as I take the 5 year bribe, I'd get my upgrading so no worries about the void decks etc.<br><br>The garbage is collected everyday but every chinese new year, non chinese road sweepers, garbage collectors and other miscellanous workers will approach me for "ang pow" despite the fact that I do not see them the rest of the year. The one year I did not give them "ang pow" was the year I found my trash strewn all over my lawn and broken glass at my door.<br><br>! neighbour has shifted out because his place was repossessed by the bank and he was declared a bankrupt. Another neighbour has had his car repossessed. An ex gf of mine was molested at her void deck, another friend had her chest grabbed during a new year celebration. My mom was robbed off SGD$2k before. I had my car rammed into by an errand driver and had to be verbally abused by the middle aged woman driver for a full half hour before 3 police turned up to tell us to claim from our insurance and the police left immeadiately. That meant another 2 hours of verbal abuse by the woman before she was willing to even provide an NRIC number.<br><br>What are you talking about.<br><br>Sg is as safe as any other country, as good as any other country, not better or worse. You delibrately chose to focus on the good side of sg and the bad side of germany for your comparison.</div>

I know where I am. Do you? Have you seen the world to appreciate it? Wake up buddy and stop watching Miami CSI, it "clouds" your brains!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>olala : I agree with you on having a more transparent gov but a sanction is going to hurt the lower citizens in SG than to help them. Look at Burma or read sites of "sanctioned countries". The rich gets mightily Richer!<br><br>SG could use a change but a better way to approach it without hurting the mid and lower class would be the solution and not a sanction.<br><br>Do I have any solutions : Nope! SilverPal has correctly defined the end results.<br><br>ShutterBug : I totally agree that SG is heading the wrong way and not taking care of its people who ARE the ones that made SG what it is today. Hardworking individuals who raised the status of SG, law abiding, educating and re-educating themselves to keep ahead,...and more achievements which will fill up this forum.<br><br>The world is changing for more of Capitalism and not only in SG. We, SG, do not have a "social net". We do not have un-employment benefits. We do not have anything to fall back on but at least we have the CPF. Lets see if they put "their" fingers into it or as you say, our medical insurance.<br><br>sgquitter : The salary might sound high but the living costs are high too.<br><br>I am living in Duesseldorf, Germany.<br><br>To know more about prices :<br><br>For Cars : www.autoscout.de<br>For Housing : www.ImmobilienScout24.de<br><br>Both gives you an oversight of pricings. Cars are not expensive. I drive a 1993 Honda, bought at $2500 SGD. Insurance at $1600 SGD. Tax is at $550 SGD. Gas is at $2.70 SGD per liter.<br><br>SilverPal : For your transportation idea, the mentality of cycling has not set into SG minds yet. Hopefully, in the near future, it might become a trend.<br><br>I eat instant noodles too and also deep frozen pizza, which is cheaper than the noodles!<br><br>"Ang Pow" is solely on your discretion. Nobody is twisting your arm.<br><br>I know of many people here who are bankrupted or in financial ruins. Its happens world-wide and sad to say, it's not relevent.<br><br>For the car incident, it happens everywhere. Maybe, if this happened in Japan, you might get the same abuses. Try a different DEO, might help!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised"><br><br>I am not making it look as though SG is rosy, cushy etc... Just look at the other countries before you state. Yes, SG is a workaholic place, no recreational activities because it's all packed up, the rat-race society where a larger LCD makes me better etc. But all you have to do is choose what you want to make out of it.<br><br>Tell me where and what is the good side of etc. USA, UK, Germany or somewhere where you think is Heavenly! Reply and I will point out to you the actual facts.<br><br>______________________________________________________________<br><br>History of Myself : I am a Singaporean. Served 6 freaking years as a Regular in SAF. Been through all the shit as all of you have.<br><br>Do I like the present system/polictics? : No, and I do not have any viable/sensible solution till someone else who is willing to place his entire career and future prospect to lead us.<br><br>Where have I resided? : Malaysia 3 years. NZ 1 year. Croatia 3 years. USA 2 years. Germany 3 years. UK 1 year.<br><br>I have been there and done that. The only reason I left was because I did not find a suitable job with my educational background.<br><br>Cheers Guys and lets see who responses!<br><br>**************************************************************<br><blockquote><br><br>In life, it's not who you know that's important, it's how your wife found out. </blockquote></div>
