            <div class='col-md body'>(Oop sorry title of post should read: Will post 65 MPs be better than their predecessors like Tan Soo Koon?)<br><br><blockquote>elitejudger1 wrote:<br>Friday November 10, 10:17 AM - chnanel newsasia<br>MPs decry whinging Singaporeans, call for soul searching<br><br>SINGAPORE: Instead of harping on what the Government can do to bridge the social divide, the spotlight in Parliament on Thursday fell on Singaporeans. And there were some home truths told, too.<br>"A nation of complainers" and "a society increasing reliant on the Government for help" were among the sadder - and harsher - labels mentioned. Member of Parliament for Sembawang Group Representation Constituency (GRC) Dr Mohamad Maliki Osman started the ball rolling when he called for "reflection and soul searching" among Singaporeans. Dr Maliki noted Singaporeans had become increasing reliant on an "efficient system" that handles issues on the municipal and national level. He said: "When the lift landing of our flat is not clean Â… we call the town council; when there are mosquitoes in the neighbourhood, we call the NEA (National Environment Agency) Â… if things don't improve, we go to our MPs or tell the media."<br><br>While not advocating that the Government be taken out of the "equation", Dr Maliki hopes to see that the "responsibility to make the society work rests not only on those in the chamber", but also on "the collective interlocking hands of four million Singaporeans". For example, he wanted Singaporeans to reflect on what they, and not the Government, had done to strengthen resilience within their own families.<br><br>MP for Marine Parade GRC Lim Biow Chuan called on Singaporeans to be more gracious and compassionate and said Singapore is fast becoming a nation of complainers. While the Government can set the tone, he urged Singaporeans to be "encouragers" - not only in encouraging fellow citizens, but also pushing the society to be an inclusive and cohesive one.<br><br>"What makes a country great? It is not just the laws Â… the efficiency or the beautiful buildings but the people that make it great," Mr Lim said.<br><br>East Coast GRC MP Ms Jessica Tan urged Singaporeans and the Government to also provide an environment where "people can run their own race". Using the example of a weekend running club, which she is a member of, Ms Tan said the encouragement from each other helps members to complete their runs. Likewise, she hoped that such encouragement would make "the journey much better" for all Singaporeans.<br><br>SO WHATS NEW ? </blockquote>Party in powers for years by means of GRCs and electoral boundary re-drawing and use of estate upgrading and monies to buy votes during election.<br><br>Use of defamation suit to shut out dissent or alternative voices.<br><br>Press under licensing control, editor got sacked for not toeing the line.<br><br>MPs who spoke up were sidelined whereas those who toed the line were given promotions or at least retained.<br><br>Years of meritocracy, corporatization of essential public services through creative accounting, double-charging on lands and infrastructures already paid for by taxpayers resulting in pushing up costs of living of citizens so much so that transport, utilities are forming 40-60% of lower-income families.<br><br>Problems were not solved because of hypocrisy and selective comparison with worse-off countries when we could have done better by upgrading the skills and mass participation of people in all areas of practical knowledge applications which were denied for years due to over-reliance on elitism and meritocracy which could not solve problems discovered during last two recessions.<br><br>Does Maliki understand the above-stated problems which were actually caused by wrong elitist top-down assumptions in all the past government policies posted in various threats and "20 major government policy errors to feedback unit".<br><br>If government MPs like him cannot understand the root cause of all the disaffective divide and the rising gap between the rich the elites and the poor then how could he have the basic quality of a MP and how could he communicate with his constituents and expect them to listen to his advice to cooperate with the government. He as a MP who has been given higher profile position should belong to the category who will be inclusive in overall views and perspectives and not seeing problems from the elites' point of view as as happened in Wee Shu Min episode.<br><br>It is to be noticed that MPs are not assured that when they speak up on the truths they will not be penalised on their advancements. This fear among the MPs need to be addressed by the whole government first if there is sincerity in asking them to speak up for the younger populations.<br><br></div>
