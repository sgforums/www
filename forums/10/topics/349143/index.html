              <h1>Countering PM Lee’s erroneous perception of the New Media</h1>
              <p><strong>By Eugene Yeo, Chief Editor</strong></p>
              <p>It appears that the state media has started its propaganda machinery
              ahead of the imminent general elections to nullify the threat of the
              New Media and utilize it to the benefit of the PAP.</p>
              <p>In an interview with CNA, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said the
              Singapore government is set to actively engage and leverage on the new
              media at the next General Election due in 2012. (read full article <a href="http://singaporeenquirer.sg/?p=2222">here</a>)</p>
              <p>This means that a smear campaign is on its way to discredit
              outspoken blogs like ours which dare to challenge the political status
              quo in order to diminish our influence on undecided voters sitting on
              the fence.</p>
              <p>What PM Lee said in <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>this interview is nothing more than
              plain hogwash fit only to deceive nursery kids and an outright insult
              to the intelligence of well-read netizens.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Allow me to decipher, dissect and dismantle the three inherent flaws in PM Lee’s argument for you individually on its own:</p>
              <p>1. PM Lee claimed that the <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Singapore government has announced initiatives to relax rules governing new media such as trying to engage citizens online</strong> </span>through portals such as REACH, the government’s feedback arm, as well as new media outlets such as Facebook.</p>
              <p>These are merely pathetic attempts to engage netizens through
              official approved channels in cyberspace and does not represent a more
              liberal stance adopted by the regime with regards to freedom of online
              speech.</p>
              <p>On the contrary, netizens have been threatened publicly by a police
              inspector and a minister of prosecution should they cross the OB marker
              in their online postings.</p>
              <p>A Hitler spoof on Ho Ching was taken down by Youtube mysteriously
              though replicas of other non-related topics are still circulating
              around. An ex-Singapore citizen Gopalan Nair was jailed for three
              months last year for making a comment on his post which would not have
              raised any eyebrows in other first world countries.</p>
              <p>Let us stop kidding ourselves -<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> the PAP has not and will not relax
              its grip on the New Media and the only reason why it is not doing so is
              because it is impossible for it to control the internet.</strong></span></p>
              <p>2. PM Lee noted there will always be a <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">role for traditional media to present trusted, unbiased and informed opinions</span> </strong>- even if some may feel that information generated by traditional media is rather tame compared to what is out there online.</p>
              <p>Either PM Lee is living in his own delusions or he is still not
              aware of the contempt many Singaporeans bear towards the traditional
              media. “Trusted, unbiased and informed opinons” perhaps only from the
              PAP’s perspective, but not according to internationally accepted
              standards and norms.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Singapore’s mainstream media churns out the most untrustworthy,
              biased and misinformed propaganda to hoodwink, mislead and brainwash
              its citizens with the aim of keeping the PAP perpetually in power.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>It constantly languishes in the lower rungs of the Press Freedom
              Index published annually by the internationally respected Reporters
              Without Borders, a media watchdog and its rank last year was 141st,
              below the likes of Sudan, Algeria, Gambia and Nigeria.</strong></span></p>
              <p>This is what RSF said about Singapore media in its latest report in 2008:</p>
              <p class="spip"><strong>“A “worthy” successor to his
              father, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has done nothing to loosen state
              control over the media. Journalists have a great deal more freedom to
              cover international news than local affairs. And a political
              documentary was hit by censorship.”</strong> (read full report <a href="http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=25653">here</a>)</p>
              <p class="spip">As the Temasek and GIC fiascoes have
              more than adequately demonstrated, Singapore’s traditional media has
              failed miserably in its purported role as a pillar of our nation to be
              guardian for the people rather than a tool of the PAP to be used to
              save its own skin, time again and again. Despite of the widespread
              ramblings on the ground demanding for answers from the government, the
              state media has maintained a deafening silence as if nothing has
              happened.</p>
              <p class="spip">3. Mr Lee said: “Well, there is a place
              called the Wild West and there are other places which are not so wild.
              And the new media - <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">some of it are Wild West and anything goes and people can say anything they want</span></strong>…..But even in the Internet, there are <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">places
              which are more considered, more moderated where people put their names
              down and identify themselves. And there is a debate which goes on and a
              give and take, which is not so rambunctious but perhaps more thoughtful</span></strong>.”</p>
              <p class="spip"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>What’s wrong with allowing people to
              say anything they want? </strong></span>The best form of community moderation is to
              allow unfettered access to information and complete freedom of speech
              to allow the most sound and robust argument to win the debate through
              competition in a free market of ideas.</p>
              <p class="spip"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>As ordinary citizens, we  are forever
              handicapped </strong></span>in what we know because we do not have access to
              information privy only to government officials and as such it is
              unreasonable to expect us to verify whatever bits and pieces we know
              first before we post.</p>
              <p class="spip">PM Lee should attend the Parliamentary
              sittings of the United Kingdom one day to witness for himself how
              “rambunctious, unthoughtful and unmoderated” their proceedings are.
              When British Prime MinisterTony Blair was grilled by both Labor and
              Conservative MPs over the Iraq War, he stood umoved in his position for
              hours to defend himself and rebuke all the allegations levelled at him
              one by one.</p>
              <p class="spip"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The lack of any meaningful debate and
              challenge to PM Lee’s iron-fisted rule in Parliament for years had made
              him complacent and perhaps short of courage to take on a political
              opponent in a one to one debate without any give and take. </strong></span>Only sissies
              expect their opponents to give way to them and the kitchen will be a
              more suitable place for them than in the Parliament. That kind of
              explains why we don’t see live debates between political leaders here
              unlike in other countries.</p>
              <p class="spip">If what a netizen say is reasonable,
              meaningful and insightful, does it matter if we know his or her
              identity in real life ? What additional value does it add to the debate
              ? <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Only media sluts who crave for attention to inflate their egos and
              self-worth prostitute their blogs to the PAP’s mouthpiece !</strong></span></p>
              <p class="spip">The PAP has always dismissed bloggers
              who hide behind the cloak of annonymity as lacking credibility. We have
              proven them beyond doubt that the message is more important than the
              originator. Why do our readers keeping coming back to our blog in spite
              nobody knowing our identities in real life ? Because what we wrote
              strike a chord in their hearts and they know we have been speaking the
              truth and nothing but the truth.</p>
              <p class="spip">Last November, Zhi Yuan wrote an
              excellent article to demolish the myth that bloggers must made
              themselves known in life to gain some cheap credibility points and to
              argue for the absolute necessity of annonymity:</p>
              <p>While I agree that the credibility of a blogger will undoubtedly be
              enhanced if he or she is known in real life, this is only feasible in a
              free and democratic society which Singapore is not.</p>
              <p>“According to the <a href="http://www.rsf.org/IMG/pdf/Bloggers_Handbook2.pdf"><span style="color: #a91b33;">Reporters Without Borders Handbook for Bloggers and Cyber-dissidents</span></a> ,</p>
              <p><strong>“Bloggers are often only the real journalists in countries
              where the mainstream media is censored or under pressure. Only they
              provide independent news, at the risk of displeasing the government and
              sometimes courting arrest. Plenty of bloggers have been hounded and
              thrown into prison…..</strong></p>
              <p><strong>…..Bloggers need to be annonymous when they are putting out
              information that risks their safety. The cyber-police are watching and
              have become expert at “tracking down” trouble-makers”</strong></p>
              <p>Given the fact the Singapore government has all kinds of draconian laws in place such as the <strong>Internal Security Act</strong> and the <strong>Sedition Act</strong> to detain and arrest bloggers at will and the mainstream media has been
              subverted to become a propaganda tool of the PAP, being annonymous is
              for us the best form of defence and offence.” (Read Zhi Yuan’s article
              ‘How to wage and fight a cyber-guerilla war’ <a href="http://wayangparty.com/?p=976">here</a>)</p>
              <p>Let us not fall into this ploy employed by the PAP to lure its
              cyber-critics out into the open so that they can better manage and fix
              them if the need arises. Once your identity is blown, you will
              naturally self-censor your blog postings which will lead to a lack of
              bite.</p>
              <p>If you dare to cross the OB marker and offend the authorities, you
              can be assured that the secret police will be digging up your past and
              the state media on permanent standby mode to smear your character,
              reputation and all you got with its psycho-psychiatrist Dr Chua ever
              ready to pounce on you and declare you as having a XXX or YYY
              personality disorder. And if you work in the civil
              service, government-linked companies and quasi-government
              organizations, you can effectively kiss goodbye to your career and
              ricebowl forever.</p>
              <p>So what makes those bloggers who “dare” to make themselves known to
              the PAP ? Will they still dare to confront them heads on ? Or will they
              shut up and act blur when the crunch comes ?</p>
              <p>Now, I am sure most of you will not notice this cheap psychological tactic used by CNA. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><strong>After
              they were finished with PM Lee’s interview, they showed a 5 second clip
              of The Online Citizen with its URL above to send a hidden message to
              viewers that TOC is a “moderate” blog which PM Lee finds agreeable.</strong></strong></span> (Watch the video on the right sidebar of The Singapore Enquirer <a href="http://www.singaporeenquirer.sg/">here</a>)</p>
              <p>This is one of the many subtle, indirect messages the media can send
              to entrap unsuspecting viewers and readers to generate the intended
              perception they want in their minds and in this case CNA seems
              desperate to give its viewers the impression that TOC is a PAP-approved
              blog. (I will write more about some other well-versed tricks used by
              the media to hoodwink its viewers another time)</p>
              <p>I sincerely urge all netizens <strong>to stay viligant in the face
              of the anticipated media onslaught by the traditional media together
              with its accomplices in cyberspace to brainwash unsuspecting netizens
              and to counter their spin and lies immediately as they arise. </strong>A lie not countered, rebuked and debunked in time will proliferate and become the new distorted truth eventually.</p>
              <p>In such extraordinary times, we must stay together and draw strength
              from one another. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The true bulwark against the horrendous, despicable
              and shameless lies propagated and perpetuated ad nauseum by the PAP
              media to enslave our minds</strong></span> is not the alternative media, but a
              well-informed and politically mature citizenry which can differentiate
              the truth from the lies themselves. It is not the government’s business
              to be the arbiter of truth when they have the power to withold and even
              distort it in pursuit of its own interests</p>
              <p>Every individual netizen or socio-political blogger has an important
              to role to play in informing and educating their less knowledgable
              fellow citizen to prevent them from falling pray to the PAP’s
              omnipresent and overwhelming propaganda machinery.</p>

              <h1>The internet and positioning Wayang Party Club</h1>
              <p><strong>By Kelvin Tan, Guest Columnist</strong></p>
              <p>When Minister of State for MICA Mr Lui Tuck Yew lamented in parliament that netizens<strong> </strong>scantly
                  ‘rebutted’ some of the unhelpful comments made by fellow netizens over
                  the Seng Han Thong incident, he betrayed his lack of understanding of
                  the Internet. If the Internet were a channel for, as well as a
                  repository of, every individual’s innermost feelings and opinions, then
                  Mr Lui’s comments are akin to chastizing individuals for expressing
                  their truest opinions. Perhaps in his universe, only opinions he finds
                  agreeable are allowed.</p>
              <p>This therefore not only betrays a lack of understanding, but also an
                  undemocratic impulse.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> It is a symptom of having lived too long in an
                  authoritarian system, and in a position of power at that. As has become
                  a cliché: absolute power corrupts absolutely.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>But the Internet is a democratic platform. Anyone who has a say in
                  anything, has the means to express it. And in a free society, they
                  should. By its logical extension, one will find a plethora of
                  statements and opinions on the Internet. Some will be downright
                  ludicrous, and some others utterly brilliant, and in between, a whole
                  mix of viewpoints all correct and wrong depending on who is reading
                  them.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Who determines what is right or wrong, brilliant or ridiculous, is
                  subjective. This is why democratic processes and democracy itself are
                  such critical institutions for a society to mature and become more
                  intelligent (or, ideally, intellectual).</p>
              <p>What one utters, especially in
                  public, can be proof of one’s upbringing, education, social background.
                  And netizens’ true opinions can only be a true reflection of themselves
                  as well as their society.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> If their words and thinking are to be blamed,
                  so should their society, their education system, and the government
                  that wrought about such an outcome. If their words and thinking are
                  deemed infantile, then it is not only themselves to be blamed, for they
                  have been deliberately kept infantile. After all, a submissive and
                  self-censoring populace is always a dream come true for tyrannical
                  regimes.</strong></span></p>
              <p>In a way, the collective diversity and ‘quality’ of perspectives in
                  a given society can provide an indication of how mature a society is.
                  For example, how the governments and citizens of the US, the UK, and
                  Australia deal with outrageous claims and perspectives that are abound
                  in their society may be different from how the Singaporean people react
                  to and handle these very situations.</p>
              <p>The difference might not lie so
                  much as a difference between cultural norms (which in Singapore are
                  usually dubious justifications for government control) as their
                  respective social and intellectual maturity. In any case, the US, the
                  UK, and Australia etc., <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>are far more diverse and complex societies than
                  Singapore will ever pretend to be.</strong></span></p>
              <p>This is why socio-political websites like The Online Citizen and the
                  Wayang Party Club inhabit important spaces and fulfil critical roles,
                  not only in cyberspace, but also in Singapore’s society. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>These websites
                  are foremost a result of the monopoly and restriction of communication
                  channels in mainstream society by the government. </strong></span>They offer
                  alternative, less oft-heard opinions, and they hold out the promise for
                  a freer and more mature society, encouraging frank discussions and the
                  airing of a variety of viewpoints.</p>
              <p>I personally do not see a difference between a reader of the
                  mainstream press as well as one who visits socio-political websites.
                  Readers can access both resources easily, and more so given that access
                  is free. What will compel them to access them in the first place is
                  more important – that there is something different and something new to
                  be gotten.</p>
              <p>This is where Wayang Party Club can carve out a niche in cyberspace,
                  and establish itself alongside The Online Citizen as Singapore’s
                  premier sociopolitical website. TOC rests itself on a more conservative
                  alternative platform, and Wayang Party Club positions itself more
                  radically. Just as important as the content it provides would be how
                  Wayang Party Club creates a distinct brand and product that deliver
                  something that TOC (or any other website) cannot. This way, it would
                  also find it easier to recruit like-minded readers to become its
                  regular contributors.</p>
              <p>Practically speaking, there’ll be few readers who would visit only
                  one website at the exclusion of the other, unless they have personal or
                  ideological objections. But these die-hard oppositionists would number
                  in the minority. The more likely scenario would be that general readers
                  surf between these two sites, resulting in what I hope would be a
                  positive competition between the two. And perhaps, the competition
                  should not just be over readers, but over contributors too.</p>
              <p>Isn’t this the same logic in the free market? If there is a number
                  one brand, say Coke, there’ll inevitably emerge a number two: Pepsi. If
                  there is Macdonald’s, there’ll appear a Burger King, and so on, to give
                  the forerunner a run for its money. Number ones don’t always remain
                  number ones. Sometimes they take turns with the number twos, sometimes
                  they disappear altogether. And the executives and employees of the
                  respective organizations are frequently former executives and employees
                  of their other competitor.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>This is the same argument, after all, for a democratic society –
                  that no one institution or political party holds monopoly, and that
                  there is free flow of information and the freedom to debate. This
                  competition can only benefit the end-consumer, or reader, or citizen
                  ultimately.</strong></span></p>

                  am really amused at the way PAP throwing out threats after threats
                  against Singaporeans on the net. Singapore may be a small country but
                  it seems that the amount of FEARFUL threats thrown at the relatively
                  small number of Singaporean netizens has really gone out of
                  proportions. <br><br>Even communist countries like China do not throw
                  such threats around. PAP has claimed that they want to "evolve" in this
                  new era of New Media but inherently, it is apparent to all of us that
                  such "paternalistic" nature of the way it threw out threats after
                  threats has demonstrated that PAP is very much outdated and backward.
                  Even the Chinese Communist Party has evolved and they actually made use
                  of their netizens to effect a close check on their ranks and files!<br><br>I
                  have not heard any constant nagging threats thrown by the Chinese
                  Communist Party over the various attacks thrown at CCP and its leaders.
                  Well, yes, they may have formed a huge internet brigade to counter some
                  of the bad mouthing but in a more general sense, Chinese netizens have
                  not stopped nagging at their government. <br><br>Why? It has been
                  proven that such nagging noise from the ground by these netizens could
                  be very powerful when it comes to Nationalistic aim of defending that
                  Nation's interests against foreign countries. It seems that the Chinese
                  people is both capable to critic their own government as well as
                  defending their Nationlistic rights when they face foreign threats.<br><br>What
                  is more intriguing in the following CNA report is that it mentions that
                  nobody is interested to give feedback even with the PAP government
                  whole effort to solicit them from Singaporeans on the net! What does
                  that really mean? <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>It means that they young Singaporean netizens are
                  either apathetic towards the country under PAP or that they would
                  rather nag at the PAP government at their own will instead of helping
                  them in any ways they can!</strong></span><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br> What does that really mean? PAP's
                  paternalistic style of National education plus threats have failed
                  miserably in lecturing the young Singaporeans into patriotic citizens!
                  The more threats they throw at young Singaporean netizens, the more
                  defiant we will be!</strong></span><br><br>Fear and patriotism <span style="font-weight: bold;">DO NOT MIX </span>at
                  all. You may try to maintain your total grip on power by using all
                  means of fearful methods but in the long run, you will definitely lose
                  trust of your people and your power totally. These have happened
                  repeatedly over the centuries whereby Ancient dynasties boom and died. <br><br>There is one common saying, <span style="font-weight: bold;">it is all in the mind.</span> True in this instance that no matter how PAP has claimed that they are
                  "open" or "light touch" or "engaging the New Media", the fundamental
                  mindset of being rigid, outdated and paternalistic in them are really
                  showing and taken over their deeds. It is no wonder nobody on the Net
                  take them seriously in what they say or claim to do for the good of the
                  Nation. This is explicitly shown by the lack of participation of their
                  so call "feedback" process executed on the Net. <br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Sincerity of
                  this regime is being graded near ZERO after many years of observations
                  of how PAP government just WAYANG away on the NET by paying lip service
                  on feedback collection.</strong></span></div>
              <div class="post-body entry-content"><br></div>
              <div class="post-body entry-content">And how could they try to build up their
                  credibility on the Net when the tightly controlled media keeps pounding
                  on the credibility of the Netizens? It is just like calling out names
                  at a group of people but in the end, you try to "engage" them for
                  views! Since you have already labeled them as "not credible" and worse,
                  ministers keep throwing threats at them, why would anyone believes you
                  and your sincerity in "engaging" them for their view? Couldn't the
                  multi-million dollars annual salaried ministers understand such simple
                  logic?<br><br>Goh Meng Seng</div>
