              Hong Kong-Singapore
              A study of differences
              The same mini-bonds problem, but a different way of handling it - and Hong Kong emerges with the accolade. By Lucky Singaporean. 
              July 9, 2009
              
              Two financial institutions, Sun Hung Kai and KGI Asia, have compensated their customers in full and 16 banks have offered to repay between 60-70% of the principal invested. 
              
              The securities watchdog, SFC, is likely to reject the proposal by the 16 banks as they are demanding the banks pay investors in full. 
              
              The Hong Kong authorities have found misconduct among the banks in the selling of these products. I believe Hong Kong banks will eventually compensate investors in full.
              
              Singapore
              In Singapore, 5,350 out of 10,000 investors filed complaints. Of the 5,350, 66% or roughly 3,500 received offers of compensation on a no-admission-of-liability-basis, 25% or roughly 1,300 received full compensation. 
              From what I heard, many were offered about 10% in compensation. MAS (Monetary Authority of Singapore) response when these structured products imploded was to send investors back to the banks to file complaints as individuals. This shifted the burden of proof to individuals and allowed banks to choose who they want to compensate. 
              
              Hong Kong
              The Hong Kong authorities chose to handle the issue differently conducting thorough investigations and helping investors to get a collective settlement. 
              In the initial part of the saga, Hong Kong authorities met up with representatives of investors to decide on an approach to will result in the best outcome for investors. 
              
              Singapore
              In Singapore, MAS met up with the banks and came up with the complaints resolution process that sent individuals back to the banks to seek compensation. Banks decided who they want to compensate. 
              
              This divide and conquer approach means that those who feel they were not offered fair compensation are unlikely to succeed in a class action lawsuit because those who can offer the strongest evidence of systemic mis-selling will not participate in such a suit because they have already been compensated.
              
              Catastrophic events such as the mini-bond saga that occurs in Singapore and somewhere else at the same time are rare but they allow us to compare the behaviour of our leaders and the authorities with those of other countries.
              
              The type of outcome they aim for says a lot about where their interests lie. â€“ Lucky Singaporean

              <p><br>If after being promised a full refund, and they do not get it, the Hongkongers will have the opportunity to demonstrate their frustrations and disappointments.</p>
              <p>Can Singaporeans do the same ?</p>
              <p>The reason for the difference in "official intervention" is that the Singapore Government hands are tied - through the GLCs, who are involved in one form or another with those foreign financial institutions that produced these mini-bonds.</p>
              <p>Similarly, the local financial institutions are also the pillars of political support to the Singapore Government, who in turn has interests in the viability of local banks too.</p>
              <p>The famous Singapore style "<em>symbiotic relationship</em>" between Government and all other form of Singapore institutions will prevent the Government having a free hand to help Singaporeans without burning the other hand.</p>

              is that our govt make less accidental mistakes than those
              countries, and most of these regional countries around us tend to
              make geniune pre planned mistakes.</p>

              <p>Hi guys and Uncles,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Can i said something?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Well, first of all, Good morning, cool Sunday morning..</p>
              <p>In this world, nothing is perfect, in no doubt, all of us make mistakes here and there, just a matter of how serious or if it is a planned mistake. Be it planned or accidental, Our Govt do make mistakes and opposition supporters are ever really to jump on it, but our Govt mistakes are not that big and usually they are able to control it. This alone make the opposition digging for past mistakes or errors, and yet it is still a mistake beyong anyone control.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The differences with out govt and the govts in around our region is that our govt make less accidental mistakes than those countries, and most of these regional countries around us tend to make geniune pre planned mistakes.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Are you certain that the government of the regional countries around SG have a tendency <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">to make geniune pre planned mistakes </span></span></em>?</p>
              <p>Singapore Government continued its failure to make corrections to the weaknesses in the Singapore economy after the 1987 and the 1997 recessions, even as the various sub-committees in the Economic Review Committee had made studies and dozens of recommendations for structural changes to strengthen Singapore's resillience towards future economic downturn.</p>
              <p>Did Singapore performed in any remarkable ways when the economy was hit again with Osama's attack on the NY-WTC in 9/11 - and when the Bird Flu and SARS hit this region in 2003 and 2004 ?</p>
              <p>This time around, Singapore was hit worse in this current prolonged downturn that started in 2007 when the retrenchments of 2004 and 2005 was not even over.</p>
              <p>How did the Super Talents in the PAP Government managed SG during the last 20 years that Singapore can succumb to the US financial meltdown ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Are these the same rare super talents that LKY claimed that only the PAP has been able to filter from the SG talent pool ?</p>
              <p>How did the efforts of these Super Talents led by LHL result in the current state of affairs in Singapore ?</p>
              <p>Only the noisy pussy have such an orgasmic time to praise <em>angel7030</em>, and wilfully overlook the erroneous statement, to blindly praise the PAP government with unreserved enthusiasm.</p>
