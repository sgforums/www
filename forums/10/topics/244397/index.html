More often than not, this happens with spam that has viruses or other malicious code.<br><br>In the Philippines, spam made up 88% of all email traffic, while 37% of all spam detected from the Asia-Pacific region originated in China. This is likely due to the high number of broadband users and the high percentage of bot-infected computers there.<br><br>The home user sector remains, by far, the most highly targeted sector in the Asia Pacific, making up 98% of all targeted attacks. Threats targeting online games and gamers are also emerging as a new focus of malicious activity, as gamers are known to turn off security features to improve gaming performance.<br><br>Symantec said hackers are more aggressively using flaws in Microsoft's Internet Explorer Web browser and Office applications to plant Trojan's in PCs because these applications allow them to bypass firewall and antivirus defences.<br><br>IE was the most targeted browser with 77% of all targeted attacks, and also had the highest number of documented vulnerabilities at 54. This was followed by Mozilla with 40, followed by Opera and Safari with four documented vulnerabilities.<br><br>In terms of exposure window - or the time it takes for the company to fix the vulnerability Â– Mozilla had the shortest window of exposure, just 2 days, followed by IE with 10 days. Apple had the longest window of exposure at 61 days.<br><br>Â“Regardless of the operating system, users need to make sure the system gets regular update patches for the new vulnerabilities that are coming around,Â” said Gavin Lowth, Director, Online Channels, Asia-Pacific and Japan, Symantec.<br><br>Â“Users should also have an internet security suite with technologies like anti-virus, firewalls, anti-phishing, etc that get continually updated.Â”<br><br>Being one of the world's largest security-software makers, Symantec has a comprehensive view into malicious code trends. Its semi-annual study draws on the work of its experts and on data from more than 40,000 network sensors in 180 countries, more than 120 million PCs that use its security software, some two million decoy email accounts and a popular forum it operates where security experts disclose security vulnerabilities.<br><br></div>
