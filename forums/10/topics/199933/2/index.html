We just don't have the personnel to fully utilise the equipment to persecute a war against those who seek to undermine our national sovereignity. Another well-known meaning for SAF is Serve And F**k off. Most of our NSmen do not have the correct training nor mindset to win any wars that will happen in the future.<br><br>In any case, civilians will always be the ones to suffer whenever any instrument of the goverment become political tools.</div></blockquote>Don't know how you get the impression that "we just don't have the personnel to fully utilise the equipment...". What equipment are you talking about? our pilots are trained in the US or France for years before the returning with the planes, our submariners also spent years before returning with the submarines, .... do you know how much preparations, how many thoroughly our people were trained before the unit become operational? From what I have seen, by the time we put the equipment into service, we have the right people to use them.<br><br>It is sad that there are still poor attitude such as that of "serve and f**k off", and i guess that is inevitable, given the great number of people serving the SAF, active and in reserve. But we can hardly say it is "most of our NSmen". I am glad I am in a company of NSmen who have the right and positive attitude towards NS and defense of our country, for we know that the civillians who would suffer in time of war would be our families, and ourselves included if we do not put on our uniform.<br><br>the question remains, what is your attitude? if you do not adopt the "serve and f**k off" attitude, then we have one less rotton apple in the SAF.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Israel has a long history way way back even before I was born. All I wanna clear my doubt is is Israel officially recognised as a soverign country like Spore? How abt Palestine? It seem Israel is occupying Palestine territory land they grab when they sort of won the Middle East War in the 60s rite? Golan heights belong to Syria? Gaza strip? In fact a lot of land Israel so called occupy are conquered lands and this may explain the displeasure of all those nations surrounding them. Instead of risking a full frontal war between nations, they secretly support the Hizbolla, Hamas and other like minded guerillas to create domestic problem for Israel<br><br>Hmmm...... who suffers in this tit for tat game? Civilians of cuz and I believe when I died, this conflict will not cease cuz their offpspring will juz pick up the arms their fallen fathers left behind to continue on the struggle.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by sohguanh:</div><div class="quote_body">Israel has a long history way way back even before I was born. All I wanna clear my doubt is is Israel officially recognised as a soverign country like Spore? How abt Palestine? It seem Israel is occupying Palestine territory land they grab when they sort of won the Middle East War in the 60s rite? Golan heights belong to Syria? Gaza strip? In fact a lot of land Israel so called occupy are conquered lands and this may explain the displeasure of all those nations surrounding them. Instead of risking a full frontal war between nations, they secretly support the Hizbolla, Hamas and other like minded guerillas to create domestic problem for Israel<br><br>Hmmm...... who suffers in this tit for tat game? Civilians of cuz and I believe when I died, this conflict will not cease cuz their offpspring will juz pick up the arms their fallen fathers left behind to continue on the struggle. Peace in middle east? Hahhah.... wait hard hard think long long  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> </div></blockquote>That section of the middle east has been claimed many times by muslims, christians and jews dating back to over a thousand years.<br><br>Of the muslim nations, only a handful including Egypt, Jordan and Saudi Arabia recognize their sovereignity. Syria, like south korea and the north, are technically still at war, since they only agreed to a ceasefire at the end of the Yom Kipper War, and then only because of Russian and international  pressure.<br><br>Some may argue that they accepted the ceasefire because Israel was merely 50km from the Syrian capital towards the end and were in danger of becoming forcefully annexed by Israel. Even today, they still claim ownership of the disputed Golan Heights.<br><br>Israelis are no angels either, when during the post 1946 era, they practiced the same 'terrorist bombings' against their British colonists. The difference being was at the formation of the state of Israel, save US, there was little or no recognization from the international community. The fight for lifelong survival was on.<br><br>Which is why it is commonly termed that: Israel was born in war.<br><br>Yes much of what Israel owns may be argued as 'conquered lands' and therefore 'to the victor goes the spoils'. But it can also be reasonably argued that the threat of a united front by then Egypt, Syria, Jordan, Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and others were such that the pre-emptive strike against their arab neighbours was capably justified as self-defence.<br><br>The 'tit-for-tat' spat will continue so long as there is religion, and (dare i say it) misguided fanatics of such religions (on both sides) to fuel the anger and hatred that has existed since they were born.<br><br>Someone once said that homicide bombers don't fight fair; they play by different rules, going into a battle mentally and physically prepared to be sacrificed, whereas the enemy they are fighting against are not emotionally ready to die. Therefore no matter how many times you kill them, they always win. To them, dying is just a release to martyrdom.<br><br>That is what the state of Israel is going through presently.</div>

Why is that? Evidently, the irratic and inconsistent behaviour of its neighbour has clearly thrown China into a quagmire: they are truly unsure of the North's intentions.<br><br>And no one will condone a wild and uncontrollable neighbour at their doorstep, especially one whose 'toys' are potential nuclear weapons. Even an ally as strong as China.<br><br>There has to be some limit as to how much support China can provide the North, and it looks like the North has breached it.</div>
