All States in the region should enjoy the same rights which should be respected. Any attacks against civilian targets were unwarranted. The world deplored terrorist acts and military attacks against civilian populations. The deaths of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) peace keepers was also a cause for concern. The United Nations force should not be obstructed and the safety of its personnel and the civilians it protected ensured.<br><br>He welcomed Security Council resolution 1052 (1996) adopted on 18 April, expressing the hope that it would be implemented immediately. The Assembly should also strongly and directly reaffirm the importance of a comprehensive, just and lasting settlement of the Middle East conflict as a significant contribution to international peace and security, as set out in General Assembly resolution 50/21 of 4 December 1995<br><br><a href="http://www.scienceblog.com/community/older/archives/L/1996/A/un960815.html" rel="nofollow"><strong>General Assembly Plenary - 4 - Press Release GA/9069 116th Meeting (AM) 25 April 1996</strong></a></span></blockquote></div>

A threat can come from anywhere, and the most volatile geo-political threats are in North Asia.<br><br>The RSAF and RSN doctrine is changing to meet a more expeditionary and bluewater threat beyond our little shores and into the South China Sea. SLOCs are our lifeblood, and we need to show we can defend the Straits of Malacca or at least present a formidable deterrent.<br><br>Not to be arrogant, but which Armed Forces in SEA has the ability to defend the South China Sea or have AWACs coverage up to the Spratlys? I'm not talking about equipment alone, but a cohesive system in place?<br><br>Bionix and other new armour/anti-armour vehicles will serve the SAF in good stead as we seem to be moving towards more peacekeeping roles.The trend is there, and defence spending is still decent and not over the top in my opinion.</div>

highly complimented from those whom we exercise with; and our equipment and training levels are the envy of our neighbors.<br><br>Our pilots have the highest flight hours compared to the training hours available to some of our neighboring countries due to their tight budget constraints dictated by a poor economy.<br><br>Are we prepared to commit atrocities when the crunch comes ?<br><br>It depends on the cause and motivation that push our mind and body to do the impossible.<br><br>Part of the SAF training is to help us to toughen and condition our bodies and minds, to discover those part of ourselves that is left in the dark and never seen the light of day.<br><br>Did you know that you had the stamina to last out the 5km run within the set time limit, or the torturous route marches with full battle packs ?<br><br>You probably did not know that you had the fear of height, and that you can overcome that fear by trusting your instinct, your training, and your buddies ?<br><br>Did you feel the power of the 5.56mm bullet each time you pull the trigger ?<br><br>What were the thoughts in your mind each time you look down the target range and pull the trigger ?<br><br>Surely you must have felt the agressive anger when pushed to the limit by unreasonable commanders giving <span style="font-style: italic;">"truly stooooopid"</span> orders ?<br><br>The darkside of your mind will automatically show up when you feel yourself being threatened, pushed to a corner, fearful for your safety and that of your loved ones, and the loyalty and camaradie with your NSF buddies will get you to do the next impossible thing in self-defense so as to survive - and what constitute atrocities will no longer seem so during war.<br><br>There will be situation when your moral judgment will be demanded - as can be seen in the current case when a platoon or section of US soldiers had suffered war fatigue, with their moral judgment and values being lost when they gang raped an Iraqi girl, and shooting her family members to death.<br><br>Everyone has a dark side in our personality and character, moderated by the better side with our values, our upbringing, our education, and our family ties.<br><br>The depth of these values will determine how each and everyone of us will respond and be ready to make sacrifice for the <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>real values</strong></span> that we placed in those close to our lives, and for the <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>abstract values</strong></span> of defending our country, our way of life, our home.<br><br>For our sake, when in a military uniform, you should hone your animal instinct to survive, to be constantly alert for danger, to be keen in your senses - sight, hearing, smell and taste, be cunning and swift in the process of the mind.<br><br>The animal instinct is vital for your survival to be available at the beginning of each day.<br><br>Like in the computer game, your extermination will be useless to the group and can only handicap the advance to the next level.<br><br></span><br><br>[/b]</blockquote>The bestial nature of humans is not always wanted in a war, as it doesn't help the war effort.

Does any soldier in the SAF know how to use any Biological or Chemical weapon? Does anyone here know how to preserve human meat for consumption in the South East Asian climate. If it's not possible to get intel or MP personnel to extract information to return to one's own lines, do you know how to extract information?

The decision to pull-out of Gaza was probably the most difficult, as many analysts feared giving up Gaza would allow Palestinian zealots greater access to Israel's borders and the added threat of rocket attacks on their cities, a fact that is now fast becoming reality.<br><br>The killing of 2 soldiers and snatching of one by an armed faction of Hamas has resulted in outrage by the Knesset, an effront despite Israel's earlier concessions. This truly complicates matters and is now testing Hamas, Abbas and Israel's resolve to seek diplomatic solutions, of which recent events seem to have caused a steep spiral downwards.<br><br>Hezbollah's brazen cross-border move is likely to be a joint Syrian-Iranian backed move to add weight to their presence in the area. In this effect, the Hezbollah are effective 'dogs of war' for these two openly hostile countries, political tools manoeuvred to maximise govt interests. How else can one explain Hezbollah's sudden emergence in the armed conflict after a long and uneventful ceasefire without provocation?<br><br>Lebanon's meek position was exposed when their Prime Minister tearfully begged for UN support into his now war-torn country, and despite his pledge to send army troops to secure the southern border to Israel, he is unlikely to act on them, a weakness Hezbollah is fully aware of.<br><br>This turn of events is likely to stretch into another 'intifada-style' stand-off, with all sides now looking hawkish at the negotiating table and the death toll is going to rise sharply before tapering off.<br><br>Of primary concern is the secure release or rescue of the 3 Israeli soldiers which started this chain of events, but all this is likely to end in tragedy. Why Hamas and Hezbollah continue in their efforts to disrupt peace leads to only one single reason - they have no such intention in the first place.<br><br>Neither do their financial backers - Iran or Syria.</div>
