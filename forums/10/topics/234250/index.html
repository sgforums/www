            <div class='col-md body'>Rules important, and so is good sense<br>By Santokh Singh<br><br>January 28, 2007<br><br>YOU can say that it is splitting hairs, but that is precisely what some school rules do, almost literally.<br><br>When I was discipline head in a school some 15 years ago, a principal I worked with had a personal bias against the 'centre-parting' hairstyle.<br><br>It was associated with 'Ah Bengs' and did not fit the image of a good school.<br><br>I pointed out that it would be one of the most difficult rules to implement.<br><br>No problems with boys whose hair is long. But what about boys with shorter hair that is parted right down the middle?<br><br>Well, the principal had his way and students, rightfully so, found it ridiculous.<br><br>As discipline master, I was forced to deal with even the Head Boy when he turned up with short, neat hair that naturally split down the middle.<br><br>Do we need school rules at all, as some liberal-minded parents might ask?<br><br>Of course, we do. A free-for-all school would be an impossible environment for education to take place.<br><br>It's like living in a community with no laws. Survival of the fittest. No recognition of different needs.<br><br>School rules play a crucial role in preparing a child for the adult world.<br><br>But just like the application of the laws of the land - where a fair trial is a must and punishment must fit the crime - a school must be fair to its pupils.<br><br>So it's not wrong to ask if the school rules are logical, reasonable and workable.<br><br>For example, there was an insistence on only white canvas shoes as part of the uniform of the school I taught in.<br><br>For a boys' school with a bunch of active sportsmen, a very strong and demanding Physical Education programme and some really heavy kids going through the Trim and Fit (TAF) programme, it was illogical to wear shoes that could damage their joints and arches.<br><br>Track or cross-trainer shoes, which the majority in this school could easily afford, were more reasonable.<br><br>Mercifully, an enlightened principal changed this rule.<br><br>So let's not be hard and fast about rules.<br><br>Yes, we need them to foster a conducive learning environment.<br><br>But let's exercise flexibility when a case truly merits it.<br><br>And review the rules when they serve only to enforce mindless conformity.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>honestly, i believe school rules have a SMALL part to play in how a student behaves in school (and out of school) and his/her grades.<br><br>esp in sec school. at this age, it is normal for the students to wanna be rebellious etc.<br>its more of how the teachers/principals treat the students that matter.<br><br>i mean...its a school rule to greet teachers when you meet them and treat them with respect.<br>HOWEVER, most teachers only just nod when a student greets them. some dont even care (but when you dont greet them, they make a hell lot of noise).<br>HEY! IF YOU WANT US TO RESPECT YOU, YOU RESPECT US TOO OK! NOTHING GOES ONE WAY! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>im not surprised students in singapore behave this way.<br>if the teachers wanna treat the students like shit, of course the students will behave like shit.</div>
