After so many years, MOM only managed to convince 22 small companies to hire them. How many workers can they absorb? This seems like a half hearted effort !<br>Older workers possess something which is prized by employers: knowledge and experience.<br>They understand what it takes to get the job done.<br>The younger workers may not have the right skills to replace them. Talking about salaries base on performance. It is precisely the maturing workers that have this advantage  but yet they are biased because of their age.<br>Those above forty has another reason which the employer will welcome: they are no longer liable for NS and thus ensure that operations are not disrupted.<br>But their futile search for jogs have made many to become discouraged and dropped out of the labor force, which they canÂ’t afford to. They have to take care of their aging parents and worry about how to take care of themselves when the time comes.<br>Why canÂ’t the govt take the lead to tap into the older but mature workforce for the public sector first in order to spur the private sector to follow instead of just talking the talk,<br>Is the govt afraid that the maturing workforce will outperform the elites and thus overturn itÂ’s elitism theory?<br></div></blockquote>dont say 40 -- had a friend age above 30 experienced with one sme when told them their age..dont even bother to ask anything about his experience during<br>interview ..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I am in favour of legislation, although I feel the one proposed by Ms Eunice Olsen in Parliament is too restrictive against employers.<br><br>When the Monthly Variable Component (MVC) was introduced, the tripartite partners tried to promote it but was not for legislation. At a meeting with representatives of SNEF (in May 2001), I proposed legislation which without will not be welcomed by employers who may find they need to pay more. They did not comment, perhaps considering, to give them benefit of doubt.<br><br>6 years on, MVC has not been heard in the local newspaper. If it was successful, I am sure it would. Economic downturns are a cyclical trend and we may dread the next one will once again see a cut in our CPF employer contributions.<br><br>Similarly, I believe the problem of employing older workers will not be solved without some form of legislation.<br><br>Regards</div>
