              <p>No.. not exactly. I just checked online and Tote Board is the primary sponsor but under it's Social Service Fund programme. The Tote Board is setup to manage Singapore Pools (another separate entity) but the Social Service Fund is like a charity of some sort and receives funding from the government... standard left poket-right pocket game play.</p>

              <p>Yup.</p>
              <p>So don't wonder why all the Chinese athletes come to Singapore. It's because of the better pay, not because they like our country. Ever heard of the saying: money makes the world go round? Classic example, I tell you.</p>
              <p>I wonder what the athletes from China will say when they see their own countrymen serving another country just for the money... After all, opportunities are aplenty for people to meet in the Olympiq Village.</p>
