            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>1) Land prices are ever rising. With a 4 room HDB flat at $400,000 now,
                  interest rates and a 20-30 years loan, there is probably nothing left in the
                  CPF come retirement. What kind of price will your children pay for their HDBs
                  30 years down the road? If you stay in landed properties, you will be sure you
                  can afford a few big bungalows overseas with swimming pools.</p>
              <p>2) CPF retirement is set to rise from age 62 as the years go by. The board
                  will not be able to support a mass withdrawal of monies from citizens and hence
                  schemes like CPF Life have come up. Come 2013, unless one meets the minimum
                  sum, he would have to wait till retirement age before the monery trickles to
                  him in the hundreds monthly.</p>
              <p>3) This place will hit a population of 6.5 million population soon. With
                  thousands of PMETs unemployed, jobs are still going to so called "global
                  talents", what's next? Even fresh grads out of the local universities have
                  to compete with their foreign peers who have their tuition fees sponsored;
                  while they have to slog for years before they repay their tuition loans.</p>
              <p>4) The land is too small for weekend recreation. Those who have stayed in
                  other countries will tell you that their weekends are trips to the mountains,
                  fishing lakes, historical places, scenic train rides etc. Here in Singapore, we
                  have the neighbourhood malls to jalan jalan.</p>
              <p>5) The education system is too stressful and breeds the kiasu / kiasee
                  mentality. Just take a look at the teacher's workload. If these educators are
                  so stressed up, what more down the line to the students? Performance bonuses
                  are paid to teachers if their students do well, what kind of stress do these
                  teachers (especially from the top schools) put on the children? And as if
                  school isn’t enough, they still have to go for tuition after school to ensure
                  they score the As.</p>
              <p>6) As long as the government does not change, so will our economic strategy.
                  Attracting foreign MNCs to set up shop, no doubt will provide jobs but we are
                  forever a hunting ground for cheap (albeit skilled) labour. And with the influx
                  of foreigners, the lower and middle income class can expect their salaries to
                  stagnate (with relativity to inflation) for a long time. The environment is
                  such that it is pro MNCs. One good example is the GST: it was raised primarily
                  because the corporate tax was reduced in order to continue making Singapore a
                  competitive place for businesses. The era where passing of skills to locals is
                  now bygone. It's long overdue that an entrepreneurial culture has not been set
                  in place. Children only study and aspire to be ministers, doctors or lawyers.</p>
              <p>7) A fresh poly grad can earn up to $1500 a month on average 10 years ago,
                  today it is still the same. A fresh university grad can command on average
                  about $2500 a month 10 years ago, today it is about $3000; not much of a change
                  considering that HDB prices have gone up 3 folds.</p>
              <p>8) A car here easily costs 2 or 3 times those in other countries. While you
                  slog it off and be a slave to your car for the next few years servicing the
                  installments, in other countries it can be paid up in the blink of an eye.</p>

              <p>Nowadays ppl dont mind migrating from 1 place to another,due to the fact that ppl from different races or countries are looking more n more alike.And thats why racism cant work well anymore.</p>
              <p>Yesterday,i saw a Chinese women who appearance look like Westerner.I also met some Chinese or other races ppl who look like Malay or Caucasian.Perhaps this is called "Evolution".The chemical like shampoo,bodywash lotion etc,n the food we eat,makes us look more n more alike.Thats why no one minds migrating this day.</p>
              <p>Besides,when comes to work,it doesnt mean that if ur boss or supervisor is ur same race,they wont screw u or make things difficult for u if u have problem or they dont like u.Infact,most of the time,u will find that most boss who screw u are of the same race,depending on who is ur boss.This is another reason why racism cant work nowadays.</p>
              <p>For me,i will choose those place i can afford to live in.And if the political situation wont change in Singapore,i wont hesitate to say "bye bye" to this goddamn place.</p>

              <p>Well, looking at the more same same but different kind of country to compare singapore will be much accurate in our assessement of Singapore living condition, i take HongKong, Taiwan and S Korea, including Singapore, a total of 4 old tigers. In term of people, Singaporean are in a way more individualistic, less exposed and yet like to complain and whine more. In term of work, all 4 countries are hardworking peoples. In term of security, Singapore is much much peaceful, S Korea are facing N korea, HK has a high crime rate, Taiwan is both high in illegal activity and national security due to china pressure across the strait. In term gender, koreans and taiwanese are still very much a country where man are above woman in a social aspect, in HK and Singapore, the gender equality is in a way on the same par.</p>
              <p>In term of freedom, S korea and taiwan got more freedom as they take on the US kind of democracy, HK which is under adminstration with big brother china looking over them, are quite strict in their freedom to express and others, same goes to Singapore, freedom is still very much restricted in certain areas.</p>
              <p>In term taxation, Taiwan n S korea, being attached to US kind of taxation, taxed their citizens alot so as to build their military and guard their lands, HK  total taxation is also higher in term of less rebates for them.  </p>
              <p>In of political scenerios, Singapore is the most stable, peace and harmony, followed by HK, then korea, and then taiwan, which for every change of govt, there will be corruption, riot, protest and so on. However, in term of innovation and technology with own industrials, singapore are far behind, for countries like korea and taiwan, they can be self dependent with their own industrial such as Acer or bubble tea, and for korea samsung LG...etc, Singapore still very much need Foreign investment and also foreign workers and talents to run the show, and that is very fragile.</p>

              (with relativity to inflation) for a long time. The environment is
              such that it is pro MNCs. One good example is the GST: it was
              raised primarily because the corporate tax was reduced in order to
              continue making Singapore a competitive place for businesses. The
              era where passing of skills to locals is now bygone. It's long
              overdue that an entrepreneurial culture has not been set in place.
              Children only study and aspire to be ministers, doctors or
              lawyers.</p>
              <p>7) A fresh poly grad can earn up to $1500 a month on average 10
              years ago, today it is still the same. A fresh university grad can
              command on average about $2500 a month 10 years ago, today it is
              about $3000; not much of a change considering that HDB prices have
              gone up 3 folds.</p>
              <p>8) A car here easily costs 2 or 3 times those in other
              countries. While you slog it off and be a slave to your car for the
              next few years servicing the installments, in other countries it
              can be paid up in the blink of an eye.</p>

              though the big ticket why we are here is because of political stability...unlike red Thai now....on the other side of stability, we are also taxed heavily.
              
              Our only thing left is we own stability...we dun our hard earned money.....plus giving one good half upon divorce.....Sing Singapore!
