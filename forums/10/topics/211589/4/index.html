            <div class='col-md body'>yeah, as a singaporean, i agree singapore is a small little cute smiling country.<br>we singapore is clean and green, we can stroll outside in the middle of the night without having to worry for robbers, without having to worry for my hand to get cut off. We have investors investing here, if singapore sux, why u r investing here, why big countries is investing here. I rather have one nice delicious peanut than to have a big packet of rotten peanuts.<br><br>No, we cannot win them in fighting the maylaysia forces, we can defend<br>but not long perhaps 1 month, but by the time the USA start farting at them and they can fly long long away, in malaysian eyes, we sux like peanut oil, in USA eye , malaysian is like a pitiful fly starving for food and is getting ready to get killed.<br><br>Mahathir too peaceful? Nothing to do? O cmon learn some manners, malaysian must be regretting to vote for u as political member before, they didnt noe that u have such a poor bring up of ur family, no manners, and in chinese we call u mei feng du, how can a shiit like u do good to country, o man do a plastic surgery before coming to singapore and USA, good luck mahathir!</div>
