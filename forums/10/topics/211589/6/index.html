They "want Singapore, to put it simply, to be like their Chinese - compliant", he claimed.<br><br>IsnÂ’t it a shame that the Chinese partners in Barisan Nasional fold their arms to watch the racial discrimination against their own race for decades? They do not have the balls to make any noise. However, they are now making Lee the bogeyman to hearten the hearts of Umno leaders for their own selfish gains.<br><br>It took non-Chinese like Anwar and a foreigner like Lee to do their job. The Chinese leaders in the Barisan Nasional coalition have no shame for their own failures even when the facts are bared for them to see. They should stop the call for Lee to apologise. Instead, they should resign in shame and not continue to live off the minorities to enrich themselves.<br><br>Malaysiakini: Some believe that Mahathir is winning the battle so far. Do you think this is a fair assessment?<br><br>Anwar: [...] Also, there is the fact of (Mahathir) using subtle racist innuendos. Not only (he raised the issue of) nationalism but (he) also (spoke) against the Chinese and Singapore (whom he claimed are) trying to act tough against the Malay leadership and that they (the Chinese leadership in Singapore) should be taught a lesson.Â”<br><br>So you think there is a tinge of racism in how Mahathir dealt with the bridge issue?<br><br>Yes, clearly. That is why you have some nationalists reacting very strongly (to the bridge issue). This is Singapore, our neighbour - setting aside that it is a difficult neighbour - but still the subtle racist undertones to my mind is very irresponsible on his (Mahathir's) part. On the project itself, I don't know how anyone in his right mind in this modern times, can even consider of unilaterally proceeding with a project which involves another country, short of going to war.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hello people down under...<br><br>firstly let me introduced myself...im a Malay and Malaysian citizen....very new to this forum as u can see this will be my first reply....i find your people views and ideas are very interesting but lack only one thing.....views from true malaysians...<br><br>hopefully i can fill that gap and tried to answer any question which you dont quite understand about your big brother up noth (joking bout the big brother thinggy)....<br><br>there is some point where what MM LKY adressed which i agreed.....tho' personally i feel is not that rite for him to address bout ur neighbour internal affairs (unless the consequences involves you directly). I give an example like if ur neighbour....husband and wife quarelling bout their relationships.....basically is none of my concern rite (tho' it will be interesting to know what they are quarelling about) but still is not my rite to intervene.....but if every night they quarell loudly, with all the screaming, sound of broken things, crying, etc. etc effects your sleep and the rest of your family.....then u have the rite to intervene but not to go an act like a judge or law enforcer....but enough to just ask for lil' bit of tone down volume....then u go and lead ur normal life.......hope u understand what i meen....and this is not just on LKY or anybody that represent singapore, but to malaysian government as well....its just not rite.....the issues should be brought up by Malaysian own chinese community and the whole community should support the cause if they acknowledge that the system is wrong.....there is few chinesse opposition which does stand up (mainly opposition from DAP which is offshoot of ur own PAP) but generally the malaysian chinesse dosnt quite agreed with their vision (its afacts because Barisan Nasional keep on winning and winning for all many general elections that we malaysian have been through....).

Even if they win all of their seats....in parliment their voice will still be only whispers.....But i can assure u.....by way things going.....it not gonna change for near future.....why? because UMNO strenght lies in it.....and UMNO have not one...but two yes man Chinese party leash to its side.....as long these two party is with UMNO no reformation will be seen.....tho' dont blame this two party......they understand that in order for them to serve their communities....they need to be part of a stable government (corrupt that we are...but seriously we are still stable). looking at options that they have....i think they choos a lesser evil....</div>
