              <p>Then war broke out and the North take over the South, Americans and the west withdrew with their butts burning. Then my vision will be this place become a province of China called NanYang.</p>

              <p>My understanding, from reading the Chinese papers, is that these people protested because they were short changed on their salaries, or the companies that employed them went bust.</p>
              <p>If there is no company employing them, or apply to renew the visas for them, their visa will not be renewed.</p>
              <p>these people are here on contract for 2 years, once the contract or work permit is out, they go home. It is only those who come here on their own, or able to change employment, then will they apply for PR. This government acts totally depends on the ability of the foreigners to find job here. So far none of the people in this category have protested.</p>

              <p>Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner is in China today, doing whatever it
                  takes–no matter how shameless and sordid–<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> to make sure that the Chinese
                  don’t pull out of American bonds</strong></span>, which are tanking in value thanks to
                  Geithner’s multi-trillion-dollar gift to Wall Street. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The Chinese are
                  not happy</strong></span>, and since the Chinese loaned America all the money it’s now
                  blowing, they call the shots...</p>

              <p><span><span>Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang made
                  the remarks at a regular press conference when asked to comment on
                  Taiwan leader Ma Ying-jeou's recent Central America tour and scheduled
                  stopover in the United States. <br><br> "We noticed relevant reports,
                  and hope the U.S. side handles the Taiwan issue carefully and properly
                  so as to avoid creating a scenario of 'two Chinas' or 'one China and

              <p> </p>
              <p>Thanks for your kind suggestions and feedback, my organisation will take into consideration and improve on our service, however, we got our own KPI, objectives and policy statement to adhere to, and one of our motto is to provide customer a total satisfaction service. Even to the extend of conning customer's wife (using our male staff in the back room) that he is having a top business meeting or an urgent oversea assignment. That's what we call delighting the customer.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There are many kind of men from different walks of life visiting our organisation, win or lose, depress or happy, failure or successful, young or old, rich or poor etc etc are our normal customers. Therefore it is unlike to name our organisation as what you CALLED "Elder care giver or what SENIOR shit", might as well, i open a "Eldercare Casket and funneral arrangement Co"</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Tho most wifeys will come dashing in looking for us, we are able to make them understand that it is their husbands willingness to come here and not that we forced him. We also provide driver to fetch the husband home if he is drunk, usually i put them outside the gate and quickly run away and take taxi back.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And for your info, i never trust and like insurance, if things is to happen, let it happen, nothing to insure about, just that some legal stuff like car, house, shop, medical and company etc etc need insurance by laws, i got no choice, otherwise i believe insurance is nothing but a financial woe to trick laymen and lay women like me.</p>
