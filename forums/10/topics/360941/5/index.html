              <p>There will always be blacksheeps, not denying that.</p>
              <p>I just have issues with people thinking that Singaporeans are all civilized and well behaved while PRCs are not.</p>
              <p>I have colleagues from PRC and often talk to them on many topics. They definitely are quite articulated in their understanding of the world and certainly not the uncivilized savages that some here have tried to portray them as.</p>

              <p>That will be a short sighted way to stay in power.</p>
              <p>1. Unless they enable PR to vote. Not many foreign workers will
              want to convert to SG citizenship. To enjoy the best of both
              worlds.. it's best to keep PR status for now.</p>
              <p>2. The policies that affects current Singaporeans are what makes
              us resentful towards the current ruling party. By converting their
              PR to Singaporeans.. it just means that they will ALSO be affected
              by the policy as much as native SGreans.So in turn.. they will
              gripe about the same thing.. and end up just like us too. Unless
              born again Sgreans are classified differently.</p>
              <p>3. Born again Sgreans..are not domesticated like the native
              ones. They may be MORE vocal and daring to show their displeasure,
              much like our forefathers who participated in riots and street
              demonstrations.</p>
              <p>Are we setting up little red dot for political unrest all over
              again ?</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt 9pt; text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Born To Serve Foreigners</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt 9pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt 9pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">The year was beginning of the 21<sup>st</sup> century, we saw the influx of foreigners into our society and in a real moment, for the very first time, we begin to feel the impact of it. Unlike the 90’s where we still were tolerable about it, something like an intrusion of privacy, as in human instinct, we are bound to territorial protectionism, there should be no intervention from people of a different culture and countries. This is true and proved in history where tribes fight against tribes and in modern time, occupation of land and wars. Therefore it is not surprising that many were in shell shock when they feel that their jobs were at stake and life getting disarrayed from the norm. We are talking and seeing peoples unlike us, they are youthful, can be ill mannered, lack of gracefulness and more importantly, renewable. Therefore they always look youthful, always talking loud and always different from us. Unlike our own, we are aging, falling health and getting less and less both in population and opportunities. From here, the outcry and outpouring is going to be a daily process from our very own aging population. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt 9pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt 9pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">For who can blame us, your land is invaded by the so call economical foreigners (with doubts), your jobs and pay check is getting from code green to red and your physical strength is getting weaker and weaker to match them. The pleadings, the complaints, the non satisfying feeling and the ultimatum of some getting into mental disorder are gaining it momentum. No country has ever allow foreigners to flow into it land like tap water free flowing, massive amount of them causing further crime rates and some society instability. So why are they here? To helps us or to help themselves? It goes both ways, it was claimed that when they are here, we get the jobs, so that mean to say that when they are not here, we get no jobs? Weren’t we survived and built this nation from swarm lands to industrialisation with our bare hands and intelligent brains without any of these peoples? Oops, yes, we are getting old and we are not producing to generate the next batch of wage earners, and when there is insufficient peoples, we simply cannot operate this nation that link it economic to the global arena. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt 9pt;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt 9pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">All right! Fair enough, we need peoples, we may go automation, but we still need peoples otherwise we will have to go down from the first world to the third or maybe even the fourth world again. Is it that bad to be in the third and fourth world? Well, if one wanted a blissful life with a slow pace of living and less stress to take care of, why not? Back to kampong and fishing village life, some don’t mind, we just have to be thrifty, lower the cost of goods and slowly build our population again, just like before, each couple producing 5 to 10 children at ease. But how about the rich and the middle class citizens, that bulk of them is not going to agree because they are going to loose all their luxuries materialism, and there are about 80% of them leaving the 20% keep on cursing and complaining. So what is the option? Well just by looking at the 80%, you can forgo the other 20% poor, old and less educated. And that is how and why the foreigners are still flowing in to tap the sweet juices that we and our fathers and mothers laboured hard to give them. Aren’t we the servant of the foreigners?? In the end, we can only conclude that we are not united and never face a problem with the same frequency of mind. And that goes well with the policy makers who had planned not for us to get united. After all, class differentiation and multi racial can be a blessing in disguise for our govt as the best choice of ruling this place.</span></p>
