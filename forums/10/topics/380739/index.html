              <blockquote>
              <p>SINGAPORE: The Housing and Development Board (HDB) has reported a S$2 billion deficit before government grants in its latest annual report. The figure is more than double the loss reported in the previous financial year.</p>
              <p>HDB said the huge deficit for the financial year ending March was due mainly to more flats being sold. <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">These flats are highly <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff00ff;">subsidised</span></span> by the government.</span></strong></p>
              <p>Higher construction costs also led to the large deficit. Other reasons that contributed to HDB’s loss included upgrading works for lifts and rental flats.</p>
              <p>Between April last year and March this year, HDB pushed out 8,000 flats under its Build—To—Order Scheme. That was 2,000 more than what it supplied the <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><span style="color: #000000;">yea</span>r</span> before.</p>
              <p>At a media briefing on its latest annual report, HDB also gave an update on the Lease Buyback Scheme which allows low—income elderly Singaporeans to get a portion of cash upfront while HDB buys back the tail—end of the lease of their flat.</p>
              <p>HDB has received more than 400 applications since the scheme was launched earlier this year. Some 25,000 households are eligible for the scheme, but the elderly have other options to monetise their flats.</p>
              <p>HDB’s CEO, Tay Kim Poh, said: "Some of them will sublet their entire flat, and the rental for even a three—room flat is very good nowadays. They can easily get S$1,500 per month from the rental and they (then) move in to stay with their children."</p>
              <p>Despite the global downturn, HDB said the mortgage arrears rate has dropped 0.4 percentage point to 7.5 per cent.</p>
              <p>Market watchers said this may be due to the high resale prices of HDB flats.</p>
              <p>Eugene Lim, associate director of ERA Asia Pacific, said: "There was an upswing in the market since the beginning of this year. And what happens is that those households in arrears probably made use of this opportunity to sell their flat and downgrade to a flat that they can afford."</p>
              <p>Moving forward, HDB said it will focus on improving community relations. A new department has been set up within the housing board to look at strengthening social cohesion and integrating newcomers.</p>

              <p>    I believe most of their losses are paper loss!</p>
              <p>  Government sells them the land below market rate,therefore they can sell us flats below market rate,and they said our  flats are  subsidised.</p>
              <p>   To break even or avoid losses,they need to sell us at market price.</p>
              <p>   So think about it,if they sell us flat at market price,that is called "Break even" only.</p>
              <p>   We have to wonder,at market rate,private developers can make profit but HDB is just "break even" only.</p>

              <p>Go on. Gloat over the loss given to citizens. Buy that flat and rent it out to foreigners at a premium while staying with parents or in a condo. Complain that the units are lousy, no good facing or low floor or whatever, and to build more. Don't have to feel any tinge of guilt.</p>
              <p>It's only our next generation's accomodation that we are robbing today. Every block built today means a few hundred sqft of land is used up on our tiny small red dot, depriving the child you see in school today a home of his/her own tomorrow.</p>
              <p>Go ahead, ask more subsidize. Build more flats, with more of our public funds used to beautify our homes in features and surroundings. Make the next generation pay thru their noses when it their time is due, or tell them to rent or those who less priveledge, the gardens are airy and cosy.</p>
              <p>Enjoy the loss. Smile. Your complains had been heard. No authoritarian to put his foot today anymore.  And tell it honestly why it was lost, no need to twist the truth,  to your children, your kid brother, your kid relatives, and their friends in their naive and trusting eyes.</p>

              <p>so that maybe explains why the price of hdb flats still being so high despite the economy downturn. Many had expected the price of hdb flats to fall during this time, but instead they still remain as high as ever, if its only the heartlanders r complaining about this, then its understandable. But even the experts like financial analysts r highlighting this issue. WHY ARE HDB PRICES STILL SO HIGH? Trying to recoup the "losses?" (they claim) no one knows how much becos they are not transparent to us.</p>
              <p>Beware of the election. Maybe after the election, "they" will try to recoup the losses made by temasek, HDB, by increasing this or that. We had experienced in the past. Will Sillyporeans fall for that again?</p>

              <p>In fact, they make billions and just manipulate the data to appear losses and release this crap of news. The media belongs to them, data and calculation are all not transparent. The more I see this kind of news, the more convince they are making profit.</p>

              <p>In accounting, there is two terms which you need to understand, first is the so call Going Conern. As HDB built flats and surrounding precint facilities such as park, shelters etc etc...in accounting term of going conern, all costs are calculated as present concern. However, in layman term, all these flats and facilities are potential profits for HBD in a long run, the so called selling thru loan and interest (which now settle thru third party).</p>
              <p>Therefore you will hardly believe that HDB is at a lost. And you absolutely right, but this is because the profits has not been realised, it cannot be put into the account. The term is call accrue profit. Accrue meaning to come to one as gain in near future. But in the moment HDB is building it, and when buyers paid up thru third financial party, they will reflect a gain..maybe by 2 billions.</p>
              <p>On the hindsight, as a public civil organisation by protraying a deficit can better seek sympathy from the public rather than protraying a gain, which may anger the public, especially the ordinary Singaporeans like most uncles and aunties here.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>when i asked my MP for Joo Chiat why HDB flats is so expensive, he replied that beside the flats, HDB also have to build surrounding shelters, parks, gardens, walkways, courts, etc etc, all these are cost to the leasers (not owner,  only 99 years), therefore when one paid a 1/4 million for a HDB flat, one also paid for the public places surrounding it. No wonder it cost so expensive, everything also one paid, but then i asked him again, then can we ask HDB not to build all these gardens and parks or unneccessary chairs, courts and walkway?? this may lower the cost of HDB. He said he will check with HDB and  reply me privately. But up to now, no reply. Like this also can.</p></div>
