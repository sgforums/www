GST 5% kill you even more than tax. when you earn less, there not much govt could reap from those lower income, but through GST they could end up getting more from the poor. As for the filthy %^&amp;%^ rich one, they should pay more for the social benefit for the less fortunate. my thinking is naive, not feasible. could be. does fighting for the less fortunate arent a good reason to ask the rich pay more.<br><br>anyway we just here talk cock sing song for the govt to listen.<br>singaporean, arent dare enough to challenge the system.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>No tax for Gov ?? No tax means no police, no army, no MOE thus no teachers and no one to build the road etc. If we do not have such services, do u think there is any security or progression for our society ? BTW schools r largely subsidised from primary to JC.<br><br>GST is designed to tax the rich more since the rich is more likely to buy more things than the poor. This is suppose to be a fair way to tax since business like frying Kway Teow may be millionaires but can declare they r earning peanuts.<br><br>There r several social benefits for the needy as well... I believe one may not die of hunger nor be homeless nor be uneducated in singapore... though u may not have enough cash for the best medical care... although I must admit it may be lesser than western countries.... but of course western countries r inherited to be rich which is different from asian economies.</div>
