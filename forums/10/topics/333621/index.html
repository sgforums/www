              <p class="first">SINGAPORE:
                  The High Court has awarded six—figure sums to both Prime Minister Lee
                  Hsien Loong and Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew in their libel case
                  against the Singapore Democratic Party and its leaders.</p>
              <p>Justice
                  Belinda Ang said she came to the conclusion that a fair and reasonable
                  figure for damages was <strong>S$500,000 </strong>for Mr Lee Hsien Loong and <strong>S$450,000 </strong>to Mr Lee Kuan Yew for defamatory remarks which appeared in an SDP
                  publication during the 2006 General Election.</p>
              <p>After taking into
                  account the S$170,000 which each plaintiff had earlier received in
                  settlement from six other defendants, she awarded damages of S$330,000
                  to be paid to Prime Minister Lee and S$280,000 to Minister Mentor Lee.</p>
              <p>Justice
                  Ang said the amount was commensurate with and proportionate to the
                  gravity of the libel and the "egregious behaviour" of the defendants
                  Chee Soon Juan and Chee Siok Chin.</p>
              <p>Justice Ang said defendants Chee Soon Juan and Chee Siok Chin had played to the gallery.</p>
              <p>She
                  ordered them to pay aggravated damages, saying they had attempted to
                  establish the truth of the libel under the pretext of cross—examining
                  the plaintiffs.</p>
              <p>She added the plaintiffs had been "subjected to
                  insulting behaviour and more than unpleasant cross—examination, which
                  increased their sense of having been ridiculed and humiliated".</p>
              <p>— CNA/ir</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Monday, 13 October 2008<em><br><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Singapore Democrats</span></span></em><br> <br> High Court Judge Belinda Ang has ordered the Singapore Democrats to pay
                  Mr Lee Kuan Yew $280,000 and Mr Lee Hsien Loong $330,000 in damages.<br> <br> The Lees sued the SDP and its executive members in 2006 over an article published in the party's newspaper <em>The New Democrat</em> which discussed the NKF scandal and the Government's handling of the matter.</p>
              <p>Ministers Khaw Boon Wan and Lim Hng
                  Kiang had praised NKF despite warning flags being repeatedly raised
                  about the operations handled by Mr T T Durai and his staff members. Mr
                  Durai and his Chariman, Mr Richard Yong, were subsequently convicted of
                  various criminal offences.<br><br>Judge Ang had awarded the case to the
                  Lees in a summary judgment that meant that the defendants could not
                  bring the matter to an open trial. This left the Lees to proceed to
                  assessing the amount of damages to be paid to them.<br> <br> At this
                  hearing, the defendants comprising of the party, Dr Chee Soon Juan, and
                  Ms Chee Siok Chin (the rest of the executive members apologised and did
                  not contest the case) pressed the point that the Lees were not worth
                  the damages they claimed because their reputations were forced upon
                  society through dictatorial means. <br> <br> During the hearing, the Lees wanted the cross-examination to be limited
                  to two hours each even though three days had been set aside. Judge Ang
                  agreed.<br> <br> Mr Lee Kuan Yew also wanted the hearing to go on
                  through the lunch hour. Again Judge Ang agreed. Mr Lee also had an
                  entourage of bodyguards who accompanied him into the courtroom which
                  Judge Ang allowed.<br> <br> The defendants protested against these
                  decisions. Judge Ang held the defendants in contempt of court and sent
                  Dr Chee and Ms Chee to prison for 12 and 10 days respectively.<br><br>Incidentally,
                  Mr Gopalan Nair is currently serving a three-month prison sentence when
                  he was found guilty by another High Court Judge , Mr Kan Ting Chiu, for
                  insulting Judge Ang.<br><br> In a letter to the defendants sent today,
                  the Supreme Court informed the defendants that they could collect the
                  judgment at a cost of $385. The SDP has not collected the judgment but
                  has learnt that the amounts awarded total $610,000. <br> <br> Dr Chee
                  has already been made a bankrupt from a previous lawsuit taken by
                  Messrs Lee Kuan Yew and Goh Chok Tong. He was also sued in 1993 by PAP
                  MP Dr S Vasoo and two other university officials after he was dismissed
                  from the National University of Singapore where he lectured.<br> <br> Ms Chee Siok Chin was also made bankrupt after she was unable to meet
                  payments demanded by the AG's Chambers over a case which she and other
                  activists took against the Minister for Home Affairs and Police
                  Commissioner over a protest in 2005.<br> <br> The police threatened to
                  arrest the protesters even though there were only four of them. The law
                  says that only five or more persons constituted an illegal assembly.<br> <br> The Lees will now have to apply for a bankruptcy petition against the
                  defendants and can then make SDP bankrupt and de-register the party.<br> <br> The Singapore Democrats stand firm in our conviction to continue to
                  speak up for Singaporeans no matter what happens. The punitive actions
                  taken by the PAP cannot deter us from our cause to bring democracy and
                  justice to our nation.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>The two versions, both CNA and SDP's, are copied above for your reference.</p>
              <p>By the way, I think this is quite absurd. I don't think the Bush administration sues every single American for telling others that George W. Bush is a corrupt president. This is the prohibition of freedom of speech in it's simplest term.</p>
              <p>Besides, what is a mere $600k to them anyway?</p>
              <p>The main purpose of this is to completely eradicate Chee Soon Juan and his gang of friends, simply put.</p>
              <p>If you read the TODAY newspaper, you would've noticed that this paragraph was not even featured in the first few pages. In fact, it was squeezed off into one small corner and details were little.</p>

              <p>Since it is a defamation suit against the Lees, which is also our govt and our country at stake, we should also get a fair share of the award. More so when we voted PAP as the ruling party.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Yo, PAP, give me my share leh!! award is about $1,000,000, so divide by 3 millions people exculding the PR,  FT and FW, I should get 0.30Cents,  or everyone of us, so to speak. How can the  Lees take  it all, daylight robbery lor</p>
