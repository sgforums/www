              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><em>Singapore Democrats<br><br></em><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17qhGIwyGj0"><img src="http://www.yoursdp.org/images/stories/people/Seelan%20Palay.jpg" border="1" alt="" width="120" align="left"><em>One Nation Under Lee</em></a> is going places in Malaysia and its screening is attracting large audiences.<br> <br> After its successful showing in the Malaysian capital Kuala Lumpur at the <a href="http://freedomfilmfest.komas.org/">Freedom Film Fest 2008</a> last week, the organizers KOMAS, Malay acronym for Malaysian Human Rights Communication Centre, moved the venue to Johor Baru.</p>
              <p>So when the 45-minute English documentary, banned by the Singaporean
              authorities, was shown yesterday at a local hotel across the causeway
              it understandably attracted many Singaporeans.<br><br>The film was warmly received by the audience and Mr Seelan Palay was on hand to take questions from the floor.<br><br>A
              foreigner in the audience who had lived in Singapore for seven months
              said that from her experience in Singapore, the country is a good place
              to live in contrary to what the movie portrays. She also noted that the
              protests and demonstrations that were shown in the film are not
              spontaneous like in Malaysia. This shows the people in general are
              contented.<br><br>Mr Michael Fernandez, a former trade unionist
              imprisoned without trial by the PAP government, said that the outward
              appearance of tranquility is a façade, a situation that has been
              brought about through years of ruthless state repression of an entire
              generation.<br><br>Mr Fernandez said that he was glad to see youngsters
              like Seelan, Martyn See and others who are taking an interest in what
              is happening around them.<br><br><img src="http://www.yoursdp.org/images/stories/media/onenationunderlee_DVD.jpg" border="0" alt="" width="180" align="right">He
              said the youth in Singapore, especially the students in tertiary
              institutions in the 1950s, 60s and 70s were actively engaged in
              society. Their language backgrounds were never a barrier as students
              from the Singapore University, the Nantah, and the Singapore
              Polytechnic came together to speak up on issues not only affecting
              youths but also the general public. <br><br>He said he could still
              remember the time when university students protested against the
              Suitability Certificate that the PAP introduced. The student exuberance
              and vibrancy were, however, bullied into silence. This has led to
              entire generations of students growing up in a state of apathy.<br><br>Mr
              Fernandez also pointed out it was wrong to compare tiny Singapore with
              Malaysia which is so much bigger and where there is much more room for
              dissent and alternative views to flourish.<br><br>Singapore playwright Robert Yeo and blogger Alex Au were also present and contributed to the discussion.  <br><br>There
              was a suggestion from an appreciative Singaporean that more such films
              were needed to bring about greater awareness, especially among the
              youths and the workers who have forgotten the role of trades unions and
              what the word "strike" meant, the ultimate weapon that employees have
              against unscrupulous employers for whose interest the PAP government
              exists.<br><br>Mr Seelan took the questions and comments in his usual relaxed and jovial demeanour.<br><br>Malaysian reviewer, <a href="http://www.star-ecentral.com/news/story.asp?file=/2008/9/14/movies/2013015&amp;sec=movies">Mr Andrew Sia</a>,
              had this to say about the film: "Even though part of it seems like a
              Powerpoint presentation, it manages to engage – a lesson here for
              shoestring budget film makers." <br><br> Also, at the end of the
              second day of the three-day film festival, filmmakers from Singapore
              and Johor held a brainstorming session to coordinate their work to
              achieve greater synergy.<br> <br> The next place the organizers planning to screen <em>One Nation Under Lee</em> is Kuching, Sarawak on Saturday, 20 Sept. And finally, the documentary
              on Lee Kuan Yew's Singapore will be shown to audiences in Penang on
              Saturday, 27 Sep 08.</p>

              <div class="post-body">
              <p>The interview below was conducted some two months ago, before the
              recent announcement by PM Lee on relaxing the ban on political films.
              What was Straits Times' hidden agenda? Perhaps it's a way to profile us
              for the Internal Security Department dossiers. Perhaps ST has vested
              interest to see political films relaxed for their own RazorTV. Perhaps
              they want to score some brownies in international press freedom
              rankings. Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps. Oh, whatever.</p>

              the PM announced recently that the ban on political films was likely to
              be eased, they were already documenting scenes of S'pore politics and
              producing controversial films that flirted with the law. Meet the
              intrepid trio who believe they are rebels with a cause. -ST<br><br><em><span style="font-size: 85%;">Sun, Sep 07, 2008<br>The Straits Times<br><br><strong>By Sue-Ann Chia, political correspondent</strong></span><br></em><br>WHEN
              the death knell sounded on a 10-year-old law that imposes a total ban
              on political films two weeks ago, film-maker Martyn See cheered.<br><br>The
              move marked the biggest effort in 20 years by the Government to loosen
              its hold on political expression here, declared the 39-year-old.<br><br>As
              a mischievous tribute, he pulled together 100 films on local politics,
              compiling them on his blog a week after Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong
              said in his Aug 17 National Day Rally speech that an outright ban on
              political films was no longer sensible.<br><br>The 100 short clips -
              'films' is too formal a term to describe them - are the work of
              assorted groups and individuals, most with a decidedly
              anti-establishment stance.<br><br>They include two by Mr See which did
              not make the censor's cut. One is on Singapore Democratic Party (SDP)
              chief Chee Soon Juan and the other on former political detainee Said
              Zahari.<br><br>He plans to re-submit them to the Board of Film Censors
              once the ban on political films is formally eased - likely early next
              year - just to test the new system.<br><br>He wants to do so because
              the prospective change comes with caveats: Films which are partisan or
              give a distorted and slanted impression will still be off-limits.<br><br>His
              own view is that there should be no caveats. 'If it is not sheer
              stupidity to continue enforcing bans on these films when they can be
              viewed at a click of a mouse, I don't know what is,' he wrote on his
              blog.<br><br>How did he come to be such a fighter against Section 33 of the Films Act, which bans party political films?<br><br><strong>Political awakening</strong><br><br>ATTRIBUTE it to a second political awakening that came in the wake of the 2001 general election.<br><br>He had had a first awakening back in the mid-1990s, when a photocopy of a banned book came his way.<br><br>The
              book was To Catch A Tartar, written by former solicitor-general Francis
              Seow, describing his detention under the Internal Security Act in the
              late 1980s.<br><br>'My eyes were opened to the darker side of the PAP's history,' he says.<br><br>'I read it from cover to cover. I felt...frightened, depressed and angry at the same time.'<br><br>His
              hitherto placid political outlook changed then, but it was only later -
              after the November 2001 election - that he was really roused into
              action.<br><br>What caught his attention was Dr Chee Soon Juan heckling
              then prime minister Goh Chok Tong about an alleged loan to former
              Indonesian president Suharto.<br><br>'Chee Soon Juan got hammered very
              badly. I wondered, is this guy as bad as the media made him out to be?
              So I decided to check him out myself,' he says.<br><br>A few months later, in 2002, he asked to meet Dr Chee.<br><br>For
              the next two years, he 'interviewed' the SDP leader regularly, visited
              him at his home and his office, and observed him when he staged public
              protests - filming all the while.<br><br>He had reams of footage but no film, until Mr Lee Hsien Loong was sworn in as Prime Minister in 2004.<br><br>Mr
              Lee's inauguration speech, promising the opening up of civil society,
              inspired him to compile his shots into a 28-minute film which he titled
              Singapore Rebel.<br><br>He submitted it for screening at a film festival. But the film never made it past the censors.<br><br>It was deemed 'party political', and banned under Section 33 of the Films Act.<br><br>He was questioned four times over 15 months by the police and even had his video camera seized.<br><br>'They
              dropped the investigation a couple of months after the 2006 general
              election. I guess they wanted to watch if I would participate in the
              election,' he says.<br><br>He never did. But he continued to produce politically incorrect films.<br><br><strong>Singapore Rebel<br></strong><br>MR
              SEE titled his directorial debut Singapore Rebel. Although about Dr
              Chee, it sums up Mr See himself - someone bent on capturing alternative
              politics on celluloid.<br><br>He began his film-making career nearly 20
              years ago, right after national service, learning the ropes of video
              editing in production houses. Along the way, he became a freelance
              video editor, working for renowned local directors such as Mr Eric Khoo
              and Mr Jack Neo.<br><br>He spends 90 per cent of his time doing such
              work to 'pay the bills', but the remaining 10 per cent is now consumed
              by his passion - making films on local political issues.<br><br>While
              being questioned by the police over Singapore Rebel, he produced
              another film, on former political detainee Said Zahari. This was also
              banned.<br><br>His latest, on Dr Chee and the protests he staged during
              the IMF-World Bank meetings in 2006, however made the cut. Speakers'
              Cornered was given an NC-16 rating and screened at the Substation on
              July 26 this year.<br><br>Despite the overwhelmingly pro-opposition -
              especially pro-SDP - angles in his films, he insists he is not an
              opposition supporter or sympathiser.<br><br>He says: 'I fill a vacuum
              created by the media when they don't cover opposition politicians or
              political dissidents. I consider myself a citizen journalist, not a
              Michael Moore type of film-maker.'<br><br>Asked why he bothers to
              submit his films for classification when he can upload them on YouTube,
              he deadpans that the law requires it.<br><br>The more compelling reason is that he wants to push the envelope in the area of political expression.<br><br>'Who
              better to do that than me,' he says, 'since I'm already over the OB
              markers. I want more film-makers who want to document the political
              scenes to emerge.'<br><br>In this, he has found a following of sorts.<br><br>Mr Ho Choon Hiong, 33, first heard about Mr See when Singapore Rebel was banned three years ago.<br><br>He
              was among a group of 12 film-makers who wrote to the Government then,
              asking for greater clarity as to what constituted a party political
              film.<br><br>The incident led to him meeting Mr See.<br><br>Their subsequent exchanges emboldened him to capture on celluloid assorted scenes of political activism in Singapore.<br><br>Unlike
              Mr See, he was introduced to politics early by his father, who used to
              be a student activist at Chinese High School in the 1960s.<br><br>Like Mr See, however, his political interest was stoked by the 2001 polls and Dr Chee.<br><br>After
              meeting Mr See, he produced a plethora of very short films, on topics
              ranging from the 2006 election to protests by Myanmar nationals in
              Singapore. He sent six to the film censors for classification in May.<br><br>'I have to take a few steps and hope to be undeterred more and more,' says the film studies graduate from Ngee Ann Polytechnic.<br><br>'I want to put my own perception of truth out.'<br><br>So far, his 'films' have been ignored by the authorities.<br><br><strong>A prolific activist</strong><br><br>NOT so for Mr Seelan Palay, 24, another amateur film-maker.<br><br>He
              had his film, One Nation Under Lee, seized by officials from the Board
              of Film Censors as it was being screened in a hotel recently.<br><br>The reason: It had not been passed by the censors.<br><br>His
              first effort - detractors panned it as a slide show rather than a film
              - it portrayed Singapore as lacking in press and political freedom, and
              tightly controlled by Mr Lee Kuan Yew.<br><br>Point out that One Nation
              Under Lee is decidedly one-sided - it takes potshots at the Government
              while hailing Dr Chee as a hero - and he insists he has no political
              agenda.<br><br>He isn't politicised by anyone either, he insists.<br><br>'I learnt everything from reading, out of personal interest,' says the activist.<br><br><strong>CITIZEN JOURNALIST<br></strong></p>
              <blockquote>'I

              politicians or political dissidents. I consider myself a citizen
              journalist, not a Michael Moore type of film-maker.'<br>-- Film-maker Martyn See </blockquote></div>
              <div class="post-body"><br><br>He
              has been involved at various times with the Vegetarian Society, the
              Animal Concerns Research &amp; Education Society, and the now defunct
              SG Human Rights Group.<br><br>Earlier this year he attended rallies by
              Hindu protesters in Kuala Lumpur, and upon his return to Singapore,
              decided to mount a one-man protest fast outside the Malaysian High
              Commission.<br><br>He also takes part in protest actions organised by the SDP occasionally.<br><br>He is not a troublemaker, he insists. He is just doing what he believes in.<br><br><strong>Nothing to fear<br></strong><br>WHAT keeps the trio going?<br><br>'Our
              conscience pricks us,' says Mr Ho. He sees it as his duty to document
              what he believes gets sidelined by the mainstream media.<br><br>The
              trio use the same counter when you point out that their version of
              'truth' sometimes takes an extreme slant. Others have noted that it was
              the publicity over the banning of some of their films, rather than the
              quality of the films themselves, that made the public more keen to view
              them.<br><br>But they are not perturbed.<br><br>For Mr See, his mission is simple.<br><br>'I
              live by the Singapore Pledge. I live by the Constitution that
              guarantees freedom of expression, association and assembly,' he says.<br><br>And he aims to guard these freedoms by showing that there is nothing to fear.<br><br>The
              other two, less articulate about their aims, appear to go with the flow
              as acolytes of Mr See, enjoying the thrill of defiance every once in a
              while.<br><br>They are all drawn to Dr Chee, whom they see as
              championing freedom of expression and provoking the Government with his
              illegal public protests.<br><br>Still, they say, they have no intention
              of joining the SDP or any political party. Ironically, they fear being
              hemmed in by party discipline.<br><br>Mr Palay, for instance, will tell you that he supports the SDP's cause but has no wish to sign on as a member.<br><br>Have
              they made an impact on the political scene? They believe so, pointing
              to more local film-makers who remain anonymous but, like them, upload
              political-type films on YouTube.<br><br>They also claim some credit for the Government's decision to consider lifting the ban on political films.<br><br>It was, they say, the banning of Mr See's Singapore Rebel that sparked a debate on the relevance of the Films Act.<br><br><strong>Future films</strong><br><br>FOR now, the three men have film ideas that they hope will see the light of day.<br><br>Mr Palay wants to do a film on the unspoken rule limiting use of dialects in films.<br><br>Mr
              Ho is aiming to do documentaries on two women: Dr Chee's wife, and his
              own long-lost Malaysian nanny whom he is still trying to locate.<br><br>As
              for Mr See, he has two targets too. One is the reclusive former

              <h1 class="title">Rejected ST letter: MORE PAP DOUBLE STANDARDS</h1>
              <p><span style="font-family: tahoma,new york,times,serif;"><strong>MORE PAP DOUBLE  STANDARDS</strong></span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: tahoma,new york,times,serif;">Written by See Leong Kit </span></strong><br> <strong><span style="font-family: tahoma,new york,times,serif;">4  September 2008</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: tahoma,new york,times,serif;">Status: rejected for publication</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">I refer to your</span><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"> article   <strong>“A Happy Ending” </strong>(Aug
              31) on the pathetic ping-pong hoo-haa initiated by the Singapore Table
              Tennis Association (STTA) President-cum-PAP MP Lee Bee Wah and her
              belated half-baked apology.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">As a 60-year old tertiary-educated Senior Citizen,  I am outraged, flabbergasted and  disillusioned by its wider  implications.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong>&gt; </strong> <strong>“Outraged”</strong> at the thought of not just one but two female PAP MPs being paid the
              generous $13,000 monthly part-time MP allowance out of public funds to
              do what?  To raise the blood pressure of members of the public to
              unhealthy levels?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"> Remember how, in the 2006
              General Elections, PAP MP Irene Ng had caused a similar tsunami wave of
              public anger for her dim-witted  “trouble-maker” description of
              opposition politicians?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"> Can you really blame justifiably
              angry Singaporeans for telling these two Malaysian-born imported
              political talent to  “balek kampong” way ahead of the next 2011 GE?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong>&gt; </strong> <strong>“Flabbergasted”</strong> at the following glaring disparity and double standards.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"> On the STTA table-tennis
              hullabaloo, both Senior Sports Minister Vivian Balakrishnan and Junior
              Sports Minister Teo Ser Luck had devoted nearly one whole week each on
              damage control and getting the STTA President to say the three simple
              words of “I Am Sorry”.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"> Last year, five young national
              dragon-boaters (age range from 21 to 31) drowned in Cambodia while
              representing Singapore at an international sports meet.  They were our
              own home-grown sports talent and truly Sons of Singapore who have
              completed National Service.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"> Serving in the Management
              Committee of the Singapore Dragon Boat Association (SDBA) are Defence
              Minister Teo Chee Hean (as Advisor),  President Kwek Siew Jin , Deputy
              President Chng Hee Kok (a former PAP MP) and two current PAP MPs, Dr
              Lam Pin Min and Dr Fatimah Lateef.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"> But when the inconsolable
              grieving parents of the drowned victims sought a simple apology as a
              form of closure to help them move on, they encountered a deafening dead
              silence from SDBA officials and the two sports ministers. </span><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">As a former Navy Chief, surely SDBA  President Kwek Siew Jin should know what <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000bf;">leadership</span></span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000bf;">accountability</span></span> are all about?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong>&gt;</strong> <strong>“Disillusioned”</strong> that, in supposedly First-World Singapore, it seem so difficult for our
              handsomely-paid public officials to say a simple sorry to the people
              for fiascos and debacles under their watch.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"> And this on top of their
              inability to produce million-dollar solutions to our various national
              problems to match their million-dollar remunerations.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"> Instead of addressing the <span style="color: #0000bf;">underlying root cause of a national problem</span>, see how they  often adopt quick-fix solutions by  <span style="color: #0000bf;">“throwing taxpayers’  monies to the problem”.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"> As in “buying” Olympic medals
              through handsome rewards for imported sports talent; “buying”
              voter-support through public-funded HDB upgrading carrots and ”buying”
              babies by dishing out monetary rewards for young couples to indulge in
              the natural act of procreation.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"> <span style="color: #c00000;">Are
              our public officials really aware such approaches will only breed 
              unthinking  “yes-man” citizens with the crutch mentality of  “me first”
              and “show me the money”?    Is this good for the long-term future of
              Singapore (the nation) and Singaporeans (the people)?</span></span></p>

              <p>Making multiple secret movies does not creates any victory for their childish rebellions. And watching political movies does not stir up a riot or rebellion within the country.

              <p>Harmless rebels such as these filmmakers are not even worth to be locked up together with the other real rebels of the country, as they were never a threat to begin with. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
