But on the other hand, a bank needs professionals with experiences to get the profits. In addition, they might not be willing to hire a new guy who would required precious manpower and time to train. They would rather go to hunt for overseas foreign talents, and hired them on contact basis. If their performance no good, or when the external demands weaken, they could be easily taken care of.</div>

Now I wonder what he does in clubs and did he get to exercise his social skills in there or just to boast and do all that useless guy talk. I for one avoid those waste money places like a plague. Anyways, the interviewer already hinted at the kind of personality he has to take to fit into the org and he stil didn't get it... maybe another year of unemployment and let him get hungry enough... then he might get the message... And he also never take note of the dressing and investigate the kind of company he is going into..<br>No EQ. No sales. No understanding of customer. No job.<br>Seriously I've been an interviewer over 20 times. Interviewed locals, UK, US, India  and Aus.  There are still many people who don't get it. The number one hate of an interviewer is for the interviewed to not answer a question directly or to blabber on and on. Anyways. I sense the threadstarter posted this with the intention to blame interviewers and job search process. So better not talk too much.
