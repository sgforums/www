            <div class='col-md body'>Evidently the threadstarter lacks social skills. Now I wonder what he does in clubs and did he get to exercise his social skills in there or just to boast and do all that useless guy talk. I for one avoid those waste money places like a plague. Anyways, the interviewer already hinted at the kind of personality he has to take to fit into the org and he stil didn't get it... maybe another year of unemployment and let him get hungry enough... then he might get the message... And he also never take note of the dressing and investigate the kind of company he is going into..<br>No EQ. No sales. No understanding of customer. No job.<br>Seriously I've been an interviewer over 20 times. Interviewed locals, UK, US, India  and Aus.  There are still many people who don't get it. The number one hate of an interviewer is for the interviewed to not answer a question directly or to blabber on and on. Anyways. I sense the threadstarter posted this with the intention to blame interviewers and job search process. So better not talk too much. Besides, I get nothing out of dishing good advice here in this site.</div>

(I don't know hor..just saying)<br>2) Your interview sucks?<br>3) Who the hell will say ur hobbies are clubbing and playing piano? Say something like reading novels when you are free, playing tennis or jogging to clear you mind...etc<br>4) You have been out of job too long?<br><br>Try:<br>- Working from a contract position?<br>- Try other sectors while trying to apply in the bank?<br>- Re-format ur resume or review how u answer questions during the interview (since you have been to so many...u shld realise something is wrong?)<br><br>Maybe that will help you better?</div>

Now I wonder what he does in clubs and did he get to exercise his social skills in there or just to boast and do all that useless guy talk. I for one avoid those waste money places like a plague. Anyways, the interviewer already hinted at the kind of personality he has to take to fit into the org and he stil didn't get it... maybe another year of unemployment and let him get hungry enough... then he might get the message... And he also never take note of the dressing and investigate the kind of company he is going into..<br>No EQ. No sales. No understanding of customer. No job.<br>Seriously I've been an interviewer over 20 times. Interviewed locals, UK, US, India  and Aus.  There are still many people who don't get it. The number one hate of an interviewer is for the interviewed to not answer a question directly or to blabber on and on. Anyways. I sense the threadstarter posted this with the intention to blame interviewers and job search process. So better not talk too much. Besides, I get nothing out of dishing good advice here in this site.  </div></blockquote>I can't agree more than what mistyblue says. I have been sitting in my company's interview board for the past 3 years and i really do think people need to brush up, a lot, on their social skills.<br><br>For a start, please don't slouch. Sit up and stand up straight. Your posture tells alot about you.<br><br></div>
