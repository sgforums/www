Govt controlled media are the most bias(I knew you that already), I'm saying I don't trust them AND "ST and zaobao". But I can take info from both sides and check them out. When i saw the clips, I didn't dispute them straight away because they were anti-PAP nor did I believe them straight away because they were anti-PAP. First thing I did was to check out type of show it was, whether it's credible and if there are underlying motives for them to say such things. Same thing when I come across a report in local media, I check out who wrote it, and if they were meant to be read between the lines. If you read Zaobao carefully, a lot of their articles can be read between the lines and you would start to think that they are not so bias actually. Reason? The ISD personel were mainly English ed and they couldn't read between the lines in chinese media to take any actions. How I know? My uncle works in the censorship department (last time), my other uncles were being watched and my Aunty works in Zaobao.<br><br>Don't believe whatever the local media says, that is a true statement, but it doesn't mean you have to believe whatever the overseas media says.
