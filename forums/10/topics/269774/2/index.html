            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by googoomuck:</div><div class="quote_body">They joked about SingaporeÂ’s election system. Ruling party already knew it won more than half the parliamentary seats just after registration of candidates, before the elections was held.<br>Ma has said that Singapore is not democratic but is corruption free, efficient, professionally governed!?<br>Singaporeans have essentially gave up happiness(liberty) for efficiency(security).<br>Taiwanese initially do not disclaim that Singapore has an almost corruption free government.<br>But now SingaporeÂ’s PM is also FM; PMÂ’s wife controls Temasek ; Father is MM; PMÂ’s brother LHY is currently a director in Islamic bank of Asia.<br>Taiwan has never had a family that control the stateÂ’s wealth like the Lee family in Singapore does.<br>Singapore has no transparency in the management of the stateÂ’s wealth.<br>TW is now suspicious of SingaporeÂ’s method of government. Is the government really corruption free?<br>TW wants an an open society, to pursue economic progress and fight corruption. Integrity, credibility and efficiency are important to TW but these must not be achieved at the expense of democracy..<br>The Taiwanese also do not wish to take a regressive step back to Jiang JinquoÂ’s  KMT single party rule, where unfair laws or practices prevent the opposition from legally getting power.<br></div></blockquote>Thanks for the above, very clear, good summary of what they said.<br><br>Whether the present gahmen is corruption free or not, the gahmen know themselves.   Any Singaporean who volunteer to check on them on this sensitive issue will definitely get it from them.  All I ask for is - there are enough Lees involved in the politics and government business, don't wish there will be any more from the same family holding the same high positions, please be fair to give other singaporeans a chance!!!   If not, others will say it is nepotism!!   REmember Singapore belongs to all of us, Singapore does not belong to only one group of people!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Taiwan will do what they can to differentiate themselves from China. And having been a sucker for americans fire arms for so many years I am not surprise that Taiwan will have to adopt American style democracy plus a little too much of hollywood, such as fake gun shot wounds to make Chen look like JFK, and WWF in the parliment house.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Not saying taiwan is bad or Singapore is good, but I think their politician there are just like actors and actresses in taiwan movie.
