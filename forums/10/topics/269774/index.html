Singapore is Lee's world.  They are amazed that the Lees are in the prominant positions in Singapore (from MM Lee, LHL, Lee hsien yang, to Ho Ching).  They don't see the same happening in Taiwan.  Said that the former late President dared not do the same.  Talked about Temasek as a govt owned organisation have not been publishing the annual / financial report (someone correct me if I interpret wrongly on this).  Sue oppositions when oppositions talked about their weaknesses.  Sue Far East Economic Review and ban them in Singapore.  They mentioned about the super high salary of the ministers, four times of Bush's salary.   Singapore has no democracy.  Press is under control of gahmen.<br><br>They asked if the people of Singapore are happy living in Singapore.<br><br>the DPP are not happy that Mr Ma wanna take Singapore as an example to lead Taiwan.   As Mr Ma stated both Singapore and Taiwan are different. Taiwan is democratic. He is not adopting the same approach as Singapore in the way he will run Taiwan.  Personally, I don't really think well of DPP, they are not credible.  But what they said about our "good" govt are all facts and reality.  The more other countries know about our govt, the better it is.</div>

The taiwanese have done a good job doing their homework to find out about the PAP.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">   WE need more foreigners talk about it to bring the attention to the ruling govt.<br><br>The more countries of the world know about it the better.  We are made living within the fence and can't seem to walk out.   One question that the Taiwanese politician in the show raised really worth thinking - are the people of Singapore happy?  Will seriously consider to leave when I am given the chance.</div>
