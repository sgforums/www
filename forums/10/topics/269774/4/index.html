He can barely run right now. Nevertheless, it would be interesting to see old man Lee attacking Low under more evenly distributed power in parliament. I think he will suffer a myocardinal infarction.</div>

He was trying to be funny to Mr Low by crowing "cock cock kay, cock cock kay".  This is really extremely uncalled for and I was for a while shocked by this sort of behaviour.  It was so humiliating!  Too bad, I can't remember his name.  He is the specky guy, another idiotic shorty man!!  If the opposition were to treat the PAP member the same way, ha ha, the next moment the opposition will get it from them!  Tyranny rules where MIWs are concerned!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

By the way, I am not doing name calling but rather I find he really looks c0cky and talks c0cky!  When I saw him doing that to Mr Low, I felt like slapping him and tell him to behave himself.   Even some kids are better behaved than him.</div>
