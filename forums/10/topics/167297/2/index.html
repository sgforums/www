Please read it for yourself as given below:-<br><br>"QUOTE: The past policies are causing too many problems:-<br><br>(1) Meritocracy - over-produces academicians, breeds elitism and class divisions, hyping the government civil service wage costs, neglect of practical knowledge application and developing entrepreneurship.<br><br>(2) Pro-foreign investment and jobs policy - foreign companies are gradually proving to be our nemesis. They have been pulling out from our economy for quite some time now and are still doing so because of our high costs of doing business (not necessarily due to workers' wages, but overpaid higher echelons)<br><br>The above-stated policies are not likely to change for a while. Government is still pushing for foreign investments as the main pillar of our economy.<br><br>Sad to say, we do not have that much time to wait for another ten years to upgrade our economic structure to VALUE-ADDING TECHNOLOGY-ORIENTED MODEL LIKE THAT OF Finland, Denmark, Switzerland, Korea and Japan.<br><br>Yet the above-stated major problems are unlikely to be solved by the present ministers very soon. They have been trying to do so since the last two recessions with no news about implementing their VALUE-ADDING economic model. There is no news of consistent applications of knowledge and innovations at the workers' level.<br><br>What is for certain is that the ministers have totally neglected maximizing the returns on our available assets e.g. hundreds of thousands of middle-aged and older unemployed, new graduates who cannot find jobs for prolonged period of up to 6 months, and over-supply of scholars who are under-used.<br><br>My suggestion is to set up a NEW MINISTRY - Ministry of Internal Resources to create investments and jobs ...making use of all our unemployed available at lower costs than even FTs...making use of empty lands and factories which need not be charged at full rentals etc." UNQUOTE</div>

To do that your people need skills that requires some form of knowledge system to be in place, the country needs raw materials that requires money and sometimes in the form of foreign investments.<br><br>We were then part of british then part of malaya and then our status after independence we became backwater outpost and we started out with nothing. We were a bit fortunate, after WWII, there was the conflict in vietnam and korea which provided us some work but even then these opportunities require skills and investments, pray tell where did all these knowledge systems and investments come from?</div>

To do that your people need skills that requires some form of knowledge system to be in place, the country needs raw materials that requires money and sometimes in the form of foreign investments.<br><br>We were then part of british then part of malaya and then our status after independence we became backwater outpost and we started out with nothing. We were a bit fortunate, after WWII, there was the conflict in vietnam and korea which provided us some work but even then these opportunities require skills and investments, pray tell where did all these knowledge systems and investments come from?</div></blockquote>Double wrong ace.<br><br>In the past, it was not a knowledge-based economy. It was a plain labour economy. The world needed labour for manufacturing and construction to rebuild. It was not hard then to invite investors to come in as long as you were willing to give cheap land and labour (look at China now, are its leaders exceptionally bright or capable?).<br><br>Besides, singapore itself has a deep natural harbour which is a natural resource that is the merit of NO ONE. A deep harbour, located in a busy shipping lane = ships berthing by DEFAULT.<br><br>Cheap land + Cheap labour + natural deep harbour + good geographical location = good post war growth<br><br>Can you account any of the above growth-contributing factors to our beloved leaders? Basically, our beloved leaders would just need to be excellent administrators to enjoy the easy post-war default growth.<br><br>Luxembourg, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan, etc were all salvaged by the war and like singapore had minimum natural resources and yet they are what they are today.
