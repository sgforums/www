And very often but not always, the people with guns win in the end. Another fact of life you see the world over maybe even on CNN.<br><br>So if you go around spouting your ideas which they determine will influence others to be like you and undermine that stability .... trouble, in countries like Libya or iraq I dunno ... you be shot and whole family carried off to jail.<br><br>But here in singapore we say we are democratic society but as you just found out for yourself in a very small lesson... are we?</div>
