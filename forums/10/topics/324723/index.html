              Singapore to sell off state electricity provider   
              Nesa Subrahmaniyan and Dinakar Sethuraman
              
              Bloomberg
              
              Posted to the web on: 08 July 2008 
              
              SINGAPORE â€” Singaporeâ€™s government-owned investment company, Temasek, has put the city-stateâ€™s largest utility up for sale, further opening the electricity sector to competition after selling Tuas Power earlier this year. 
              
              The sale of Senoko Power would be completed by the end of next year, Temasek said yesterday .
              
              Built at a cost of S$2,6bn ($1,9bn), Senokoâ€™s 3300MW of capacity supplies 30% of the island stateâ€™s electricity needs last year. The company earned S$245m before interest, taxes and depreciation on revenue of S$2,49b n for the year to March 31 .
              
              The sale of Senoko Power comes at a time when mergers and acquisitions have slumped as the collapse of the US subprime mortgage market restricts banks from lending and curbs corporate purchases.
              
              Transactions in Asiaâ€™s power industry have totalled $12,9bn this year, less than a fifth of those last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
              
              â€œOf course thereâ€™s the market downturn and rising fuel costs, but Temasek has got more traction going from the sale of Tuas,â€� said Simon Powell, head of power research at CLSA in Hong Kong. â€œThe price matters, but there were parties, including banks, that were eager for Tuas and lost out, and Senoko offers a chance to get into a stable cash-flow business.â€�
              
              Sembcorp Industries, whose electricity unit accounts for about half of profit, would bid for Temasekâ€™s two power generators after losing out to China Huaneng Group for Tuas Power, company president Tang Kin Fei said last month.
              
              In March, Beijing-based China Huaneng agreed to pay S$4,24bn for Tuas, the smallest of Temasekâ€™s three power generators, which supply 90% of the island stateâ€™s electricity.
              
              Temasek, which manages more than $100bn in assets, last year revived a plan abandoned six years ago to sell the Singapore companies in order to tap rising demand for power assets. It has said it plans to sell its utilities, which also include Power Seraya , by early next year .
              
              Senoko Power and Power Seraya were transferred in 2001 to Temasek from Singapore Power, the main electricity supplier, after the government separated ownership of generators from transmission and distribution. Temasek had owned Tuas Power since 1995.
              
              The three generators are barred from holding each otherâ€™s shares, according to rules set by the governmentâ€™s Energy Market Authority.
              
              The MSCI index of regional utilities declined 20% this year, compared with a 22% fall in the broader MSCI Asia Pacific index, excluding Japan.
              
              The Singapore government has been gradually introducing competition in parts of the economy, including banking, utilities and telecommunications.
              
              Deregulation of the electricity industry started in 1995 and in the gas market in 2000.
              
              After completing the second phase of liberalisation in 2006, 75% of total electricity demand was open to retail competition, and the total number of so-called contestable consumers rose to 10000, according to the Energy Market Authority.

              <h3 class="post-title entry-title">July 19, 2008, Singapore</h3>
              <p>Ladies and Gentlemen,<br><br>The latest position is like this.<br><br>On 2.15 pm, Monday 21, 2008, at Subordinate Court No. 6, my lawyer Mr. <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_0" class="blsp-spelling-error">Chia</span> Ti <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_1" class="blsp-spelling-error">Lik</span> will apply to withdraw from further representing me in the July 4, 2008
              disorderly behaviour case. I will represent myself. Mr. <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_2" class="blsp-spelling-error">Chia</span> is a good man and an excellent lawyer. Unfortunately his work load is
              too heavy at present to deal with this. This withdrawal application has
              my full approval. Thanks Mr. <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_3" class="blsp-spelling-error">Chia</span>.<br><br>Mr. <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_4" class="blsp-spelling-error">Chia</span> had earlier applied in Court 3 Subordinate Court on July 16, 2008 during the <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_5" class="blsp-spelling-error">Pre</span> Trial Conference for the disorderly matter for my passport to be
              released to me to attend to my matters in the US pending trial. This
              application was refused. I will be making a renewed application for
              this in Court 6, Subordinate Court on July 21, 2008. My application is
              supported by the US Embassy who have given a letter to the Court
              supporting my application.<br><br>I understand from the US Embassy that US Secretary of State <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_6" class="blsp-spelling-error">Condoleezza</span> Rice will be in Singapore on July 24, 2008. I also understand that the
              US State Department at the highest levels is being briefed daily daily
              on my matter. I have asked the US Embassy to put my case to the
              Secretary of State while she is here.<br><br>I have received dates for
              the disorderly behaviour trial. They are in the Subordinate Court as
              follows. The dates includes many half dates and intervals between
              dates. This is because Mr. <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_7" class="blsp-spelling-error">Chia</span> had other matters to attend and therefore dates were unavailable. Since
              I will be conducting my own trial, I will ask for earlier uninterrupted
              dates to speed up the matter.<br><br>Dates as follows: All hearings in
              Court 6, Subordinate Court. July 24 full day, July 28, 9am to 1 pm,
              July 29 2.30 to 5 pm, July 30, 2.30 to 5 pm, July 31 9 am to 5 pm whole
              day, August 6, 9 am to 5 pm whole day.<br><br>High Court Blogging trial, Sept 8<span id="SPELLING_ERROR_8" class="blsp-spelling-error">th</span> to the 19<span id="SPELLING_ERROR_9" class="blsp-spelling-error">th</span>, High Court.<br><br>I
              will be disputing the disorderly charge and the charge that I insulted
              police officers. My stand will be that I was neither disorderly or
              insulted anyone on 4<span id="SPELLING_ERROR_10" class="blsp-spelling-error">th</span> July 2008, American Independence Day.<br><br>As for the the blogging trial that I insulted Judge Belinda <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_11" class="blsp-spelling-error">Ang</span> in my blog (the blogging case) , my stand will be that I insulted no
              one. I wrote a blog and I am entitled under my right to freedom of
              speech to say what I say during the 3 day trial of May 26 to May 28,
              2008 in the High Court. The words that I used in the blog clearly meant
              in the English language that judge Belinda <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_12" class="blsp-spelling-error">Ang</span> had abused her authority, and it was not meant to be understood in any
              other sense. If in fact the selection of my words, although proper in
              the English language, was harsh I apologize to Judge Belinda <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_13" class="blsp-spelling-error">Ang</span> for it. However my stand will continue to be that in the English
              language, it was a proper use of the words to describe her actions.<br><br>As to her conduct of the case, I intend to stand by what I have said. She did not appear to be impartial at all, and Dr. <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_14" class="blsp-spelling-error">Chee</span> Soon Juan and his sister and the <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_15" class="blsp-spelling-error">SDP</span> was not given any real opportunity to put their case forward. That will continue to be my stand.<br><br>I
              cannot understand the Singapore Government in pursuing these matters
              against me. If indeed it is to punish me, it would be indeed a useless
              exercise. After all I am an American citizen. I will be returning to
              the the US after all, despite my punishment. And any amount of
              punishment cannot change the way I think. Any punishment meted out to
              me will not change my impression of the Singapore authoritarian
              government and Singapore's using the courts to silence Singaporeans
              yearning for democracy and freedom.<br><br>On the other hand, if it is
              an attempt to intimidate any other Singaporean from speaking up against
              injustices, it is clearly a failure. As you know, 19 Singaporean
              protesters have stood up against this government to voice their
              disaffection, during the Ta <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_16" class="blsp-spelling-error">Boleh</span> <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_17" class="blsp-spelling-error">Tahan</span> March 15, 2008 <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_18" class="blsp-spelling-error">Parliment</span> House protest, for which all of them have been charged in court. I was in Court 24 on July 18, 2008 in Court 24 for their <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_19" class="blsp-spelling-error">pre</span> trial conferences. Far from being intimidated, they have all been seen
              to be in very high spirits and look as if they are all ready to take on
              these unjust laws yet again. And what is more, all signs indicate that
              more and more young people are coming forward to stand up to repression
              and intimidation, their hearts emboldened and strengthened by this
              outrage against them.<br><br>All this is happening with the backdrop of
              the 72 page scathing report of the International Bar Association which
              clearly spells out the fact that the Singapore judiciary is an
              instrument of political repression against Singaporeans in order to
              perpetuate the Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_20" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew Regime. The Guardian newspaper of London has only yesterday come up
              with an article stating the government of Singapore uses its so called
              economic success as an excuse to deny their people their human rights.
              Of course Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_21" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew and the Mr. <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_22" class="blsp-spelling-error">Teo</span>,
              the Singapore High Commissioner to London have come up with the same
              old lame excuse that Singapore is unique, being Asian, small and multi
              racial, and therefore not suited to Western norms of human rights.<br><br>I
              will tell this to Mr. Lee and the High Commissioner. Human beings are
              human beings whether Asian, Australian or Eskimo. And being humans they
              are all entitled to human rights. And by the way human rights is
              universal. It is not particularly only for Europeans or Americans.<br><br>So stop trying to pull wool over our eyes. We are not babies.<br><br><span id="SPELLING_ERROR_23" class="blsp-spelling-error">Gopalan</span> Nair<br>Singapore</p>
