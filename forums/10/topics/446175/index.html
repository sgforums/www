              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>DAVOS, Switzerland: 
              Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has said that the Singapore 
              Budget, which will be announced in three weeks' time, will emphasise on 
              sustaining the country's long-term competitiveness.<br><br>Speaking to 
              reporters at the end of a 24-hour working trip in Davos, Switzerland, Mr
               Lee said the Budget will be about how Singapore responds to and deals 
              with the transition from rapid growth in the past, to slower expansion 
              now.<br><br>Slowing growth and rising business costs are among the major challenges companies face this year.<br><br>But it appears unlikely the upcoming Budget will provide any quick fixes.<br><br>Mr
               Lee said: "(The emphasis) should be (on) sustaining our long-term 
              competitiveness, how to build on that, how to make sure that we can make
               this navigate this change of course, from quite rapid expansion in the 
              last 10 years, to a much slower expansion, but much more qualitative 
              transformation in terms of skills we have, in terms of the capabilities 
              we build up, in terms of productivity which we are going to have to 
              deliver and improve productivity year by year, and therefore, to be able
               to improve incomes of Singaporeans." <br><br>PM Lee was in Davos at the
               invitation of Mexico's President, Felipe Calderon, to attend a G20 
              dinner meeting, where he presented his observations about the debt 
              problems in Europe and how Asia could contribute to a global solution.<br><br>In
               Davos, there is a lot of talk among European leaders about a crisis in 
              confidence. But Mr Lee said the issue for Singapore is really about how 
              the country can remain nimble and responsive to changing external 
              environment, in order to keep jobs and make sure companies are viable. <br><br>He
               said: "As the economy goes down, we make adjustments, as the economy 
              picks up, we withdraw the stimuli. Part of the confidence comes from the
               long-term consistency which we have, that you are able to offer 
              investors a competitive environment and investors know if something 
              happens and they need help, which is legitimate, we will be there to 
              help them."<br><br>During his visit, Mr Lee also met business leaders 
              from German electronics firm Siemens and Japan's Takeda Pharmaceutical, 
              both of which have operations in Singapore.<br><br>Mr Lee said Yasuchika
               Hasegawa, CEO of Takeda Pharmaceutical, has heaped praises on Singapore
               as one of the best places to do business for drug firms.<br> <br>Mr Lee added that this vote of confidence is powerful.<br><br>- CNA</span></span></p>

              <p><strong>2012 Budget to focus on S'pore's long-term future: PM Lee</strong><br> <span class="update">By Claire Huang | </span> <span class="update">Posted: 28 January 2012 2030 hrs </span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>SINGAPORE: Singapore's Budget for 2012 will focus on investing in the country's longer-term future.<br><br>Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said this at the Teck Ghee Lunar New Year dinner on Saturday evening.<br><br>In
               his speech, Mr Lee said the government is already seeing signs of a 
              slowdown, with Singapore expected to grow by one to three per cent this 
              year.<br><br>Despite the slow growth, Mr Lee said it would not be a 
              repeat of the 2008 financial crisis. He said the government will take 
              the current economic climate into consideration when preparing the 
              Budget.<br><br>He said: "We project growth (to be around) one to three 
              per cent. It's significantly less than what we got last year, when we 
              had nearly five per cent growth. But I think if we get that, we will not
               be doing badly.<br><br>"The government is monitoring the situation very
               closely. Overall, I think that this year will not be as bad as 2008, 
              when we had a very big crisis, and everybody was quite worried and 
              scared. But nevertheless, we will look carefully at the outlook and we 
              will take into account when we prepare the budget this year."<br><br>One area that the Budget will focus on is to help companies upgrade and help Singaporeans protect jobs.<br><br>The government will also do more in areas like housing and education.<br><br>Safety nets, including ComCare schemes and childcare subsidies, will be strengthened.<br><br>With
               about 15 per cent of the population expected to be 65 years and older, 
              Mr Lee said the government will also help the elderly in terms of 
              medical expenses. In terms of housing, more studio apartments will be 
              built for them.<br><br>While Singapore is in a strong position to 
              overcome the challenging year ahead, Mr Lee said it cannot do so alone, 
              and called on Singaporeans to work together with the government to 
              achieve a brighter future for all.<br><br>More than a thousand residents joined Mr Lee in celebrating the festive season with song and dance and Lunar New Year goodies.<br><br>-CNA</span></span></p>

But beyond that, as spending - especially on the elderly, the poor and broken families - goes up, it would need to think of ways to boost revenue.</p>
