The cost of the businesses do not justify the cost invloved for high tech Robotic machineries and skilled engineers or technicians to service the hardware.<br><br>However some industries relating to hazardous chemicals agents or conditions where a human worker is not practical to carry out the tasks/ duties, a robot will be in place to take up the role. Some industries that involves testing or manufacturing of highly precision products may use a robot for pick and place, measurement or assembly purposes.<br><br>Seagate is one plant that heavily invested on Robotics applications. Anyway with more products (both industrial and consumer related) requiring storage and memory, the hard disk industry is going to make good for the years ahead. Just like the silicon industries (e.g Intel and AMD), the remainding giants of the hard disk drive industry (e.g Seagate and HGST) should rule for now.</div>

They keep the singapore HQ for the reason that they started here, and it's more easier to get business deals in singapore. Gap used to have buying office only in SG and HK, but there will be one in China soon. So they can placed order directly in china, dont have to go thru SG/HK anymore.<br><br>If you happen to go to Wuxi, China, drive around the industrial park, take a look at those major names in electronics, look at how big their factories are. Those factories means jobs!! Jobs for chinese, not singaporean, why? not bcos they work better, it's bcos they are cheaper.<br><br>If SG govt tells ppl there will be more factories coming, why dont they tell the ppl how many factories have already moved overseas? Tell us the reason why these factories choose Singapore instead of other countries. What makes them put side the labor cost factor?</div>

Just because you disagree with certain policies enacted by the government doesn't make you less patriotic or someone who hates his country. In fact, government critics criticize in order to bring about change in what they see as wrongs, as it pains them to see that mistakes are being made in the governance of their country.Of course, there are exceptions to that as there are exceptions to some 'self-proclaimed patriots' whose embrace of the ruling party is to serve their own personal interests. Even they love Singapore as they are still successful under the Singapore system. Let me tell you who hates Singapore - individuals that detests our existence. To find that, you would have to look across the causeway. So next time u plan to simply apply the logic to equate anyone who disagree with the governmental stand point as someone who hates Singapore, please think again.</div>
