Once she is trained and accredited plus registered ,  her earning power is secured plus she can also chose her employer. Am I not wrong?<br><br>That is called internship. People work for UN and WHO free for 3-6 months to make the connections to go up. Those networks are highly political and once you have that connection - your mobility to move is there plus employment benefits. Plus you get invited to sit on consultancies etc in the future if you know the who's who.  And it is easy to get into anywhere if your referees are big names in the same specialty area you are going for. I know that from experience.<br><br>Gain for the above people : monetary profit and connections<br><br>Now let's talk about a Wafer Fab plant - the gain is only a salary which has no profit as it is only used for survival purposes . It does not give you connections or a future to look forward to . Furthermore it comes with a higher risk of retrenchment and unemployment than for someone with the connections to move up further.<br><br>Quintessentially you are comparing a durian to a jackfruit.
