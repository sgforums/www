            <div class='col-md body'>SMALL businesses are poised to hit the first big jackpot at Genting International's casino resort on Sentosa.<br>The Malaysian company yesterday promised to set aside up to $200 million worth of deals every year for Singapore's small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), from the time it starts building its $5.2 billion integrated resort next year, to opening the doors in 2010, and beyond.<br><br>Topping that, it said it would also rope in banks and General Electric (GE) - parent company of its partner Universal Studios - to help SMEs obtain loans to take on resort contracts.<br><br>The $200 million worth of contracts represents a 'significant' part of the 49ha resort's annual running expenses and the sum is expected to grow, the company said.<br><br>Sanitation, security, landscaping and maintenance are where SMEs can get a piece of the action, Genting said at a post-victory media conference at which top executives' wives also turned up to lend support.<br><br>Genting and its sister company Star Cruises beat Kerzner International and Eighth Wonder to clinch the project last Friday.<br><br>Genting's chief financial officer, Mr Tan Hee Teck, explained how it would help SMEs. For instance, if a small business were to land a laundry contract but had difficulty obtaining the financing for equipment, Genting could link the company to GE, which could provide a loan, and perhaps at better interest rates.<br><br>This initiative is Genting's way of 'supporting local SMEs and nurturing entrepreneurship', said chairman Lim Kok Thay.<br><br>The financial aid will alleviate the small business operator's cash flow woes, said Mr Lim. 'It removes a distraction for the SME and allows it to focus on delivering quality goods and services.'<br><br>Nine in 10 businesses here are SMEs, and they employ half of Singapore's workforce.<br><br>In the three years it will take to build and open Resorts World at Sentosa, Genting said it expects to create 22,000 jobs and add $3.9 billion to the economy.<br><br>Its first hirings will likely be engineers and construction personnel. Recruitment will pick up midway through the project, in 2008, and again six months before the resort's opening, said Mr Lim.<br><br>Genting said it expects to draw 15 million visitors a year, both tourists and locals, in 2010.<br><br>By 2015, it expects that half of the $30 billion national target for tourism receipts will have been made.<br><br>It has already sketched out plans to court its first visitors. For holidaymakers, it will offer cruise and land packages through its Star Cruises network. For European high rollers, it will exploit its recently acquired Stanley Leisure network in Britain, a chain with 45 casinos.<br><br>The Genting team is in a hurry to start construction so it can 'catch up' with Las Vegas Sands, which won the Marina Bay IR site six months ago.<br><br>Said Mr Lim: 'We are behind Marina Bay by a couple of months. Obviously, the Government would like to see the two projects finished on time, and to be not that far apart.'<br><br>Though the two resorts will inevitably compete for gamblers, Mr Lim is not ruling out a collaboration with Sands on other aspects. Sands is eyeing convention and exhibition visitors, while Genting hopes to lure 'incentive travel' groups, such as employees rewarded for work performance.<br><br>Genting's gesture was warmly received by the Association of SMEs (Asmes), which said the Malaysian company was the first among foreign investors to have made such a pledge.<br><br>Asmes president Lawrence Leow said: 'It's a good $200 million. They are not just giving you business, they are helping you with the financing. It's a very welcome gesture.'<br><br>Mr Leow added that the deals it has pledged could have been given to Malaysian companies, but by setting them aside for Singapore companies, Genting has signalled that it will be a 'responsible investor'.<br><br>Its move has earned it new fans, he said. 'I spoke to a few companies. Everybody feels that we have made a good choice.'<br><br>(Dec 12, Straits Times)<br><br></div>
