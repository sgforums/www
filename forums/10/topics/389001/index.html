              <p>Education Minister Dr Ng Eng Hen is now singing a different tune from his foreigner-obsessed colleagues in the government. Instead of aiming to increase Singapore’s population to 6.5 million people, Dr Ng now says “Singapore does not need to keep growing as fast in the coming decade.”</p>
              <p>“Rather, it must be the quality, and not the quantity of the population that will drive economic growth. Singapore has high averages, he said, but we need ‘high peaks’, or strokes of genius,” he said during a dialogue session organized by the National University of Singapore Society (NUSS) on Friday night.</p>
              <p>He said: ‘We need the same people who launched eBay, Google, and Facebook. It is not high averages that got you these innovations. If you couple episodic peaks with a high base rate, then you can move.”</p>
              <p>Dr Ng does not seem to appreciate the fact that free minds require a free society to nurture them and geniuses will not thrive under a repressive regime like ours nor will they be attracted to come here.</p>
              <p>Singapore students generally excel in their academic studies and regularly triumph over their U.S. counterparts in Mathematics and Science competitions, however we produced far less innovators, scientists and entrepreneurs per 1,000 population than them.</p>
              <p>Neither has Singapore produced a Nobel Prize laureate after so much money is invested in education, research and development.</p>
              <p>The Singapore education system which emphasizes on rote learning and academic grades stifle the creativity of developing young minds which need to be constantly challenged.</p>
              <p>Freedom of information is critical to foster a thinking citizenry – the nursery for geniuses to grow, develop and fulfil their potential to the fullest.</p>
              <p>In Singapore, the flow of information is strictly controlled by the ruling party – only news which are favorable to them are allowed to be published while those who portray them negatively is censored completely.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, the heavy involvement of the state in the economy via the two gigantic sovereign wealth funds and a host of state-linked companies kills off innovation at the level of the SMEs which are struggling to compete with them.</p>
              <p>Google will never be able to survive in Singapore, let alone take off because it will have to be subjected to a whole range of regulations by Media Development Authority (MDA)</p>
              <p>Is it a surprise that Singapore’s only internationally recognized brand name, Creative Technologies was founded in the United States, and not in Singapore itself?</p>
              <p>The “tops-down” approach adopted by the ruling party is reminiscent to the central-planned economies of the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe which all crumbled eventually in the face of market forces and globalization.</p>
              <p>This archaic, monopolistic and anti-competitive economic model serves only one purpose: to control the lifeline of the nation to prevent the emergence of an alternative center of power to challenge its political hegemony like former Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra.</p>
              <p>Dr Ng should realize that the ruling party is a huge part of the problem we are facing now. Without political autonomy, the people will remain enfeebled and subjugated or in the words of Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong – a flock of hapless sheep which have to depend forever on “lions” for guidance.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, Singapore does not have any “lions” leading the sheep now, but a pack of hungry jackals which are merely there to milk the system for their own selfish interests.</p>

              <p>I notice your long feuding with angel7030 has gone from bad to worse. And I also notice your previous, long ventetta with many forumites.</p>
              <p>As much as a person disagrees with Angel7030 or is cursed by forumites or is threathened to a bitter end from some deranged forumites, we have to recognised that this an open forum for anyone and everyone, after all.</p>
              <p>Going deeper, this forum has never been pro-govt or anti-govt platform as some people may wish or hope for. I admire Ah Chia for saying this -"I may not agreed with what you said but I defend your right to say it". This attitude is very important for all forumites if we all want to come here to enjoy, reward ourselves in Sgfroums.</p>
              <p>All of us, human, have problems in our lifes - whether it is direct or indirect result of our govt. Or the result of our own self action. It is important to recognise the latter too - not just the former.  </p>

              <p><br>yesh, and may be more to it.    We have a self serving ruling party.   What we all want is a ruling party that places serving the public with sincerity and commitment as their top priority.    Looks like this is lacking in our current ruling party.</p>

              Geniuses cannot live under tyranny  . . . . . . .people thrive when given personal freedom Right now Singaporean cannot even criticize their government whom they supposeldy elected through election.
              
              <br><br>
              The election has been reduced to legitimize a dictatorship regime. . . . . ..
              And since the lee kuan yew and familee have been enjoying privilege before the law now they extend those privileges to their cronies to further protect their regime interests.
              A corrupt man cannot survive in an environment of integrity so he must corrupt as many people as he could.
