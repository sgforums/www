Now pregnant again...<br>SHE FEARS BOSS' INSULTS<br>By Maureen Koh<br><br>December 15, 2007   </strong><br><br>HER boss made life hell when he found out that she was pregnant for the first time.<br><br>File picture: ST<br>Now she's pregnant again, and he's making her life so miserable that she is now seeing a counsellor.<br><br>Said the 29-year-old financial planner with a 10-month-old baby: 'He kept reminding me, 'Wah, this year you worked only nine months'.'<br><br>Ms Florence (not her real name), who works in a foreign financial institution, said she had taken her 3-month maternity leave for her first pregnancy this year.<br><br>She declined to be named or photographed as she did not want to risk losing her job.<br><br>He also told her that 'if every woman in the office decided to happily get pregnant, we might as well close down'.<br><br>Madam Halimah Yacob, co-chairman of Tripartite Alliance for Fair Employment Practices, urged employees like Ms Florence to refer their cases to the Centre for Fair Employment.<br><br>Launched last month, the Centre aims to weed out unfair and unhealthy practices at workplaces.<br><br>Madam Halimah, who is also NTUC deputy secretary-general, said there has been an increase in the number of complaints filed by pregnant mothers since the maternity benefit period was extended by another four weeks to 12, in 2004.<br><br>'Even though the Government is picking up the tab for the extension, some employers can still be sticky about it,' she said.<br><br>Ms Florence, who earns $5,300 a month including commissions, said she and her teacher-husband, 30, had started planning for a family right after their wedding in March 2005.<br><br>At the job interview, Ms Florence said, she was forthcoming with details of her then-approaching wedding.<br><br>The problems surfaced when she became pregnant for the first time last year.<br><br>She claimed: 'He showed me a black face each time I had to take leave for my checkup. It was especially bad towards the last term of my pregnancy.'<br><br>NOT THE FIRST TIME<br><br>The New Paper contacted two of Ms Florence's colleagues, both of whom verified her account.<br><br>One of them, who wanted to be known as Mr Wong, claimed the treatment that Ms Florence received was 'a watered-down version of what happened to another former colleague'.<br><br>Mr Wong added: 'He kept insinuating that she was a resource waste, and when she forgot some tasks, he'd say, 'Yah, but can remember to get pregnant'.'<br><br>That colleague resigned when she was seven months' pregnant.<br><br>While Ms Florence's husband has suggested she quit her job, she is reluctant to do so for two reasons.<br><br>She explained: 'It took me some time before I found this job, and my colleagues are wonderful people to work with, except for, of course, my boss.'<br><br>The other reason? She felt that she 'should not be mentally coerced into resigning'.<br><br>Madam Halimah said the Centre for Fair Employment can help.<br><br>She said: 'The Centre can help to intervene and mediate so that it can be a win-win situation for both parties.'<br><br>On the apprehension that the Centre carries no bite because it is not a regulatory board, she said: 'Every company worth its salt knows that workplace conflict is unhealthy and has to be dealt with effectively.<br><br>'It'll not do good for the company to ignore it. To contain the conflict is in the interest of all.'<br><br></div>
