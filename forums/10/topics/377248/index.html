              </span></p><p id="articlecontent"><span>SINGAPORE: The Economic Development Board (EDB) is spearheading a new outfit called Singapore Leadership Initiative for building Networks and Knowledge (LINK). This is part of an initiative to ramp up efforts to make Singapore a "Home for Talent". <br><br>Speaking at the opening of the Singapore Human Capital Summit on Tuesday, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said Singapore has been building up its infrastructure for research and training by creating programmes of value for companies and their talent. <br><br>"For example, through its Global Schoolhouse initiative, the Economic Development Board has attracted premier international universities like Insead, University of Chicago Booth Graduate School of Business and New York University's Tisch School of the Arts to set up here. <br><br>"To be a Home for Talent, we must provide exciting job opportunities and a high quality of life. We must also be at the forefront of human capital development, so that people see this as a place to stretch and achieve their potential. <br><br>"And we should develop human capital not just for Singapore, but for the whole of Asia. After all, Singapore is at the crossroads of Asia. If we can help Asian economies to gain talent and grow, we ourselves will in turn grow with them," he said. <br><br>The new Singapore LINK will bring together business schools, universities and firms offering professional services in a single campus devoted to leadership and talent development. <br><br>This clustering will strengthen the links between research, management and training, encouraging corporations and academia to work together and adopt new best practices. <br><br>"This is a very powerful concept to synergise the best ideas in research, teaching and executive education, as well as in the application of new ideas in human capital development and leadership development," said Leo Yip, chairman of EDB. <br><br>For example, Towers Perrin will soon launch a study of cross-cultural leadership in Asia, while Watson Wyatt intends to develop human capital risk management tools for Asian companies. Both projects are expected to involve academic researchers. <br><br>Moreover, within Singapore LINK at One-North, which is in the Buona Vista area in the western part of Singapore, the Manpower Ministry and the Singapore Management University will set up a Human Capital Leadership Institute. <br><br>The new establishment aims to be the premier institution for raising strategic human capital capabilities in Asia. It will conduct pan-Asian research on important human resource challenges, and offer training and development programmes on leadership and management to global participants. <br><br>One such course will be the Singapore Business Leaders' Programme, catering to senior executives who are expecting to take on regional or global responsibilities. <br><br>The programme will provide leadership development, networking opportunities, as well as exposure to leading human resource and talent management practices in Asia. <br><br>Mr Lee noted that the future of Asian economies will depend on nations making full use of talent, which is why human capital and leadership development is critical. <br><br><br>- CNA/so <br></span></p>

              I think it doesn't involve Singaporeans / locals much. I think it involves talented foreigners from the region more. Seems like another hub is being added to our list of hubs, "The talent hub".

              <p>I can answer that easily. The ultimate goal is to get local wog Singaporeans to be talented people in charge of their own regional companies, so that they can set up shop abroad in the lesser developed economies close to us; rather than leaving it to foreign MNCs. Meaning that we in Asia/Singapore are trying to build up our own firms,
              our own technology, our own human resources, our own local talents
              rather than relying on others (i.e. the big players; japan, eu, america etc and other foreign investors)</p>
              <p>It is good to look at things with a bit of historical perspective. Development in Asia is good, we all hear that, but it is still backward by definition; in the past after world war 2. All development in Asia was spear headed by western investors setting up shop in asian countries, like Singapore. And they sent their own people; their own directors to manage these firms. This has been going on for ages; so much so I am greeted with surprise by you Singaporeans when they find out i am not a head of any such MNC ha ha, it goes to show that foreign-investor-rich-angmoh mindset is so deeply engrained in you.</p>
              <p> With globalization, any state can take advantage of increased business; setting up firms; entrepreneurship; re-training etc.</p>
              <p>What this institute and many other govt-linked initiatives like it are trying to do; is simply to get locals to take initiative to set up good businesses, get them staffed by good locals upper and lower manage (but with emphasis on upper); so that they don't need foreign talents to come in; which drive up costs and i think it is also a matter of PRIDE as well.</p>
              <p><br>i mean; it was not that long ago that Temasek had some foreign white expat as their CEO yes? I was like WTF? In Britain, you would definitely have a BRIT in a CEO position, especially a government linked one (regardless of race ofcourse), but definitely not some foreigner who is not local.</p>

              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'><span style="font-size: small;">Our Govt has been competing for local resources for decades that ministry itself are in denial of the impact it does to society greater goods. It is crowding out Talent resources from the private sectors and cannibalized entrepreneurship thru their outrages high pay wages. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;"><strong><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Examples 1....</span></strong></span></p>
              <p><strong><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'><span style="font-size: small;">Next few weeks Singapore Govt ministries will host networking session in states side to recruit Singaporean students back to Singapore to work for them....</span></span></strong></p>
              <p><a href="http://www.contactsingapore.sg/careers@home_us/"><strong></strong></a></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'><span style="font-size: small;">This is a classics example of how Government crowd out Talent pool from private sector in Singapore. Have you seemed any IE to bring their SG organizations to overseas such as UK, Aus, n US Nope...why the Govt Pick the candidate first?  And what organization in Spore can compete with that kind of Salary for a Starter? </span></span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'><span style="font-size: small;"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'><span style="font-size: small;">One might say... At time of Recession it is good policies to take in university students where it would be difficult for them to get a job in private sectors. But at the same time they are scrapping the cream of the crop from the private sectors. </span></span></span></span></p>

              <p>Well after all is said and done. I believe this institute is being set up to train Singaporeans for high leadership positions. And it might very well be a success if it draws international students as well as overseas Singaporean talent to groom talented students and future leaders in the private sector; just as the LKY school is doing. <br></p>

              <p>Avaliable human resources are finite in SG. -- a fact. Talent flow downward thats the food chain...its economics.</p>
              <p>Residents choice of employment comes in 2 areas...Civil or Private.For private (MNC or Local = (state owned or local big companies or SME )).</p>
              <p>With the changing economics time. Trade off for job seekers becomes wage comparative vs future security.  The best to match that requirement? Civil, State Owned, MNC. lastly SME.  </p>
              <p>Private SME are all for the function of Potential Returns. f (pr) = Risk + low wage.</p>
              <p>It become a Choice and ultra motive to go into SME. all for potential return. Why would the top talent walked into SME if they can achieve decent lifestyle in civil.     </p>
              <p>I am not referring to Service entreprenuer. I am referring to product development entreprenuer.   </p>
              <p>Product Development entreprenuer required Knowledge, Skills, global experience perspective to commericalized product development, multi discipline human resources and capital investment where do you get that from SME with the left over Talent pool ?  </p>
              <p> Also importing FT (scientist) are only temporary to head off new research field or skills set. At the end of the day we still need residents research to invest long term research without guarrantee result.</p>
