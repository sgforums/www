              <h1>Transport fare changes</h1>
              <p>Public transport fares will fall by 4.6 per cent, said the Public Transport Council (PTC) yesterday (19 Feb). <strong>This is the first cut in the council’s 22-year history.</strong></p>
              <p>The fare cuts come from transport operators SBS Transit and SMRT
              deciding to pass on savings from the Budget to commuters, as well as
              the ongoing transition to distance-based fares.</p>
              <p><span>All adult EZ-Link fares for buses and trains will enjoy a
              reduction of 2 cents per trip, across all fare bands. As for
              child/student concession EZ-Link fares, these will be reduced by 1 cent
              per trip, across all fare bands. </span></p>
              <p><span>The transfer rebate for all adult and senior citizen
              concession EZ-Link journeys will be increased by 10 cents, to 50 cents,
              from 1 April 2009. </span>It will go up to about 60 cents next year. <span>The existing 10-cent transfer rebate for child/student concession EZ-Link fares will remain unchanged.</span> Commuters who make transfers will save 14 cents for journeys with one
              transfer, up to a maximum of 38 cents for three transfers.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span>In addition to the fare adjustments, the pricing on all
              monthly concession passes will be reduced by between S$1 and S$4.  The
              monthly primary and secondary student bus and train concession passes
              will drop by S$1, while the student hybrid concession passes will be
              reduced by S$2. For tertiary students and National Service-men, their
              monthly bus and train concession passes will be lowered by S$2, while
              the hybrid concession passes will see a S$4 reduction.</span></p>
              <p>There is no change to all cash fares for buses and single-trip ticket fares for trains.</p>
              <p><span>The PTC said the 4.6 per cent fare reduction package, which
              stretches over a 15-month period (from 1 April 2009 to 30 June 2010),
              will cost public transport operators about S$80 million. It comprises a
              fare rebate of S$52 million, of which about S$37 million are the
              savings from the Government Budget measures that the transport
              operators are passing on to commuters. Another S$28 million is the
              amount over a 15-month period to fund the transfer rebate increase. </span></p>
              <p><span>The PTC said the public transport operators decided to bear a
              larger share (two-thirds) of the cost of this year’s 10-cent increase
              in transfer rebate to benefit commuters. The move translates into a
              permanent revenue loss of S$22 million per year for transport
              operators. </span></p>
              <p>Traditionally, the companies apply for fare changes by August and
              the new fares start in October. But the PTC brought forward this year’s
              exercise.</p>
              <p>From next year, the deadline to apply for fare changes will be moved to May and new fares will take effect in July.</p>
              <p>As fares are being lowered earlier this year, <strong>the Government will not give public transport vouchers to the needy</strong>, unlike in previous fare revision exercises.</p>
              <p><span>A day after announcements that bus and train fares will go down by 2 cents, </span><span>SBS
              Transit and SMRT said they would also be cutting fares for their
              non-basic bus services by up to 20 cents. The reduced fares will last
              for 15 months from April 1 this year to June 30 next year. </span><span>SMRT
              said its measures, including a S$300,000 donation to help needy
              consumers with their transport costs, will cost the company S$37.3
              million. </span></p>
