              <p>Hi Friends,</p>
              <p>I want to say how fortunate singapore is to have the chance to use a western technology like the new lower-cost water-producing membrane developed or invented by a ang more scientist or researcher.</p>
              <p>At the same time, I worry what would singapore do if the west had not invented the many many things that enable our economy, medical services and education to prosper and allowed us to live in an environment with good facilities and amenities.</p>
              <p>The same water technology  invented by the Dr can be used by any country that purchases it.  Thus, I do not think its a singapore-only water machine.</p>
              <p>singapore, you are so lucky. The people's hardwork contributed to the economy and made it grow and wealthy. The nation's wealth can then be used to purchase such highend technologies and make singapore less-reliant on foreign water.</p>
              <p>So, thanks Western world, for presenting singapore the water-maker!!</p>
              <p>Thanks to the People also for the economy. You made it happen. Well, as for me, I contributed not much. I just talk talk only. But like this I also appear like I contributed to this effort. ha ha ha .</p>

              <p>I quite agree with you that for all the claims our leaders are always making about their exceptional world-class leadership etc, actually they do not understand much about competitiveness through inventions or technologices that are critical to progress.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Even the water-membrane technology they are trying to boast to the world are not their inventions but of westerners' inventions.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Our leaders are only lawyers who can only be good in passing laws or using laws to control or tax people. They do not know enough how to promote or encourage people to apply or harness new technologies or create a knowledge-based economy.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We need truly good engineers and technologists to run the whole country to compete globally. For our lack of leadership in this area, today we are lagging in such areas which will truly determine the ultimate success or failures</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Just be humble and allow more people of real knowledge in harnessing technologies to provide the needed solutions. Do not over-emphasise on accountants or lawyers as leadership style has to change.</p>

              <p>I think the economy relies heavily on skilled professionals and surely not just politicians make things possible. Without able manpower, everything stops. No plans, no matter how bad or good, will get executed.</p>
              <p>Thus, the economy is heavily dependent on the skilled professionals like engineers, specialists, researchers and technicians.</p>
              <p>Kudos to singapore professionals.</p>

              <p><br>The Chinese actually developed their science to a very great extent in the Ming dynasty, but they lacked a scientific method to link all of their theories together like the Europeans. Also, the closed-door policy following Zheng He's voyages caused the sciences in China to staganate and eventually decay.</p>
              <p>You're right, wisdom or knowledge does not belong to any one group or race.</p>
