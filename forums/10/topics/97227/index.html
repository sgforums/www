            <div class='col-md body'><br>http://www.wp.org.sg/news/press_releases/20041007_govt_managed_assets.htm<br><br>We refer to the report printed in The Straits Times on Wednesday, 6 October 2004.<br><br>Standard &amp; Poor's (S&amp;P) had in an earlier report claimed that "the Singapore Government's annual returns have averaged between 1.7% and 4% from 1999 to last year. This was markedly inferior to Hong Kong Government's investment returns, which averaged 6% each year during the same period".<br><br>The Ministry of Finance had to come to the rescue of the Singapore Government saying that "the Singapore Government makes good long-term returns on its assets and its investments continue to perform creditably when compared to international benchmarks".<br><br>Just what is the definition of "good", and what is the definition of "long-term", and what is the definition of "creditable" and which appropriate international benchmarks are used?<br><br>The Government of Singapore Investment Corp manages about US$100 billion of our hard earned reserves. This money is accumulated from taxpayers, of which Singapore Citizens and Singapore Companies are amongst them. This mindset of saving for a rainy day, extended to saving for a drizzling day, saving for a cloudy day, and perhaps saving for a sunny day. Huge budget surpluses lowers Singapore's standard of living. Many Singaporeans are suffering today in anticipation for an uncertain tomorrow.<br><br>Huge budget surpluses benefit the ruling party. The ruling party is in a good position to pay their Ministers and Civil Servants some the world's highest public-sector wages. To argue that these Ministers manage an economy similar in size to the largest public-listed companies, and that their pay should be equivalent to the executive officers of these companies leave much to be desired. There exists a corporate governance issue of which a recent incident at the New York Stock Exchange serves to remind us.<br><br>Good Corporate Governance begins with transparency. Full disclosure of the average Singaporean's hard-earned reserves can at times be detrimental to the Singapore's currency and its credit rating. However, if the returns are as good as what the Ministry of Finance makes it out to be, the "outperform the market" performance can do no harm but only good.<br><br>The Workers' Party calls for the Government of Singapore to be more transparent with the dealings of the hard-earned savings of the average Singaporean, and that an appropriate benchmark be used consistently to report the performance of our investments.<br><br>Tan Wui-Hua<br>Treasurer, The Workers' Party<br>Vice-Chairman, Policy &amp; Communications Committee<br>7 October 2004<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A suitable model of accountable and transparent corporate governance as a follow-up on my earlier post:-<br><br>COMMON MANAGEMENT PRACTICES<br><br>Very often, people tend to manage tasks on concepts or assumptions emphasising on Leadership, talents, Focus and Consistency, Positive Work Attitude, Foresight &amp; Insight, or other abstract which cannot be applied by workers to actual works?<br><br>On the other hand, many tasks today in the advent of computers are already managed more efficiently in accountable and transparent logical doable component processes defined in quality-time-cost parameters as in on-line banking, e-trading, travel-ticketing, CAD-CAM designing, transportation, logistics, stock-trading, accounting, telecommunications etc.<br><br>TRANSPARENT WORK PROCESSES<br><br>Hence, company performance will be reported accurately and reliably from objectively planned work processes to avoid intuitive or ad hoc justifications.<br><br>It is clear that tasks are interlinked in logical internal relationships. When suitably divided in smaller tasks, they can be followed through in sequence such as: (1) Study of Ideas, (2) Enquiry, (3) Securing Contracts and (4) Contract Administration (Operations).<br><br>Operations (routines) can be divided in ten departments, namely: 1.(General) 2.(Human Resource) 3.(Revenue) 4.(Accounts) 5.(Marketing) 6.(Services-all outsourced activities) 7.(Facility) 8.(Enforcement) 9. (Production) 10.(Compliance) with each department set up consisting of simple core activities (primary tasks) captured in one-page department report supported by detailed work forms as follows:-<br><br>1. Identify 3-4 Core Activities in department.<br>2. Define core activity in 2-3 quality-time-cost parameters.<br>3. Perform Core Activities to attain parameters.<br><br>Hence once tasks are set up as doable component work processes they can be performed and assessed in quantitative data of Â“1Â”, Â“2Â” or Â“3Â” (or percentages) being Â“non-attainmentÂ”, Â“attainmentÂ” and Â“excellent attainmentÂ” of parameters.<br><br>These variances can be submitted weekly (say Friday 1630 hour) with corrections of "1" in a two-way communication task-line.<br><br>SEQUENTIAL WORK FORMS<br><br>A production department can now be managed transparently in core activities consisting of: (1) manpower, (2) programs, (3) equipment and (4) schedules each governed by quality-time-cost parameters (attendance/costs/needs).<br><br>Detailed works and services can now be performed by workers in logical sequential workflows in Work Forms to attain efficiency and quality of performance.<br><br>Similarly, government can perform its tasks with transparency to keep tab on : (1) investment strategies, (2) industries and (3) schedules/jobs creation in production department supported by detailed work forms for mass participation and knowledge application (by civil servants).<br><br>There will then be coordination and knowledge applications by all instead of too much controls, and bureaucracy that only stifle growth, creativity and entrepreneurship.<br><br>TOTAL MANAGEMENT Â– COORDINATION AND KNOWLEDGE-BASED MANAGEMENT<br><br>In summary, tasks can be managed in logical work processes contained in: (1) administrative forms, - head office (2) department reports - operations (3) work forms - detailed works with openness, equity, accountability and transparency to produce results and good governance.<br><br>Note: copyright of Robert Teh Kok Hua. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I am surprised that nobody really bothers about the type of transparency our PAP govt is practicing.<br><br>The Finance Ministry's reply has not touched on whether it is a fact as reported by S&amp;P that our investment return is bad relative to HK's govt's management of reserves. Most likely it is true but they try to justify it by saying we have good "long term" investment strategy/plan.<br><br>You will find similar argument when they explain why PAP GRCs and SMCs town council have to raise fees as compared to opposition wards....they claim they have "prudent long term" financial planning!  Everything could be explained away using the magic word "long term" but let's remind them what Keynsian said, in the long run, we all die.<br><br>Goh Meng Seng<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Temasek reports impressive returns </strong><br><br>For the first time, holding firm details its performance over 30 years; for the year ended March 31, net profits were $7.4b<br>By Lee Su Shyan<br><br>SINGAPORE investment company Temasek Holdings has lifted its veil of secrecy by providing detailed figures on its financial performance to the public for the first time in its 30-year history.<br><br>In an eagerly-awaited 72-page annual report issued yesterday, it disclosed, among other things, that for the year to March 31 this year, net profits shot up to $7.4 billion from just $241 million a year earlier as the economic recovery kicked in.<br><br>The low figure for the year to March 31, 2003, was also partly caused by a $2.5 billion cut in the value of telecoms and power plant assets in its accounts that year.<br><br>Temasek, with controlling stakes in seven of Singapore's biggest companies including SingTel, DBS Group Holdings and Singapore Airlines, also gave figures stretching back 30 years to show the returns from its vast investment portfolio.<br><br>As at March 31 this year, Temasek's investments were worth $90 billion. Just over half were in Singapore, with the rest spread across Australia, India, Malaysia, Indonesia and the United States, among others, reflecting its recent push overseas.<br><br>Earlier this year, Temasek, set up in 1974, said that it would open its books to the public as 'part of our efforts to demystify Temasek and to be more transparent'.<br><br>It wanted to become more transparent given that it may sell bonds to the public for the first time to raise funds. Bonds offer investors a fixed rate of return.<br><br>Temasek's unprecedented disclosure reaped immediate rewards. Both the world's leading ratings agencies, Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody's, yesterday gave it top ratings in terms of financial stability, AAA and Aaa.<br><br>In the report, Temasek stated the rate of return on its investments for the past 30 years, using a measure known as total shareholder return. This refers to how much the share price of Temasek's various companies have gone up, plus any dividends paid.<br><br>Over the past year, Temasek achieved a spectacular return of 46 per cent. And over the full 30 years since it was set up, its annual return was an impressive 18 per cent.<br><br>But in the intervening years, the return was weaker. Over the last 10 years, it was only 3 per cent, explained by events such as Sars and the 1997-98 Asian financial crisis.<br><br>Earlier this year, Temasek's executive director and chief executive, Ms Ho Ching, gave a hint of the strong performance when she said Temasek had posted annual returns of more than 16 per cent over the past 30 years, though using a slightly different measure.<br><br>While the report included details of its profits for the past three financial years, it also went beyond the numbers to give a picture of the company, detailing Temasek's strategy, profiling its senior management, and describing how it manages its risk.<br><br>In his chairman's statement, Mr S. Dhanabalan said: 'With a diversified industry portfolio of $90 billion today, Temasek is poised as an Asia investment company committed to delivering shareholder value as an active investor and shareholder.'<br><br>Temasek is interested in five areas: transportation and logistics; services such as banking and education; resources such as power, energy and water; pharmaceuticals and information technology; and lastly, small and promising companies.<br><br>Ang Mo Kio GRC MP Inderjit Singh said of the report: 'It's impressive and there is a lot of information. It's a good start as it gives Singaporeans visibility as to how well Temasek is doing.'<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>WHAT YOU DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT TEMASEK:<br><br>TEMASEK manages a portfolio worth $90 billion.<br><br>Senior management includes 21 managing directors, each focusing on different areas such as strategic investments, private equity funds and strategic development.<br><br>Its 200 in-house staff are mostly young and fairly new to Temasek. Only 4 per cent are over 50 while 55 per cent are 35 and under. Nearly two-thirds have worked at Temasek for three years or less. Only 8 per cent have been with it for 10 years or more.<br><br>Across the 34 major Temasek-linked companies, 71 per cent of its directors are independent, that is, with no other ties to the companies they serve. And 15 per cent are non-Singaporean. Only 8 per cent are female and 7 per cent are from Temasek management.<br><br>Over the past two years, Temasek has invested $3.3 billion in 35 companies in Singapore, India, Indonesia, South Korea and Malaysia. In the same period, it sold off 36 investments for $1.6 billion at a profit of $765 million.<br><br>Half of its investments are in Singapore, the rest are in Australia, the US, Europe, Japan, India and Pakistan, China, Taiwan, South Korea and the Asean countries.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Barracuda,<br><br>Stop your spinning lah! That's amateurish! S&amp;P and Moody's give Temasek triple A ratings not because it is a "great" company that could perform extraordinary well. It is simply because they see the amount of assets Temasek has. They are only interested in whether Temasek could repay loans or bonds. period. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>I pick this article up from discuss Singapore. To me, what is more relevant is the not so distance past of performance by Temasek; the performance of past 10 years only manage to give returns of 3%? You could that "Top scores"? Hahahaha. This is especially so in contrast when remuneration &amp; perks packages for those directors in the GLCs increase tremendously for the 10 years! Such mediocre performance, ST dares to boast about "Top Score"?<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>There is one comparison made against Govt owned companies in India; Temasek performed poorly in comparison. In fact, the 30 fold in profits for last year has nothing to boast about; selling assets away to boost revenue, what so difficult about that? What is more important are the dividends generated by those GLCs; are they delivering the goods?
