              <p><span>
              </span></p><p class="first">SINGAPORE: The Migrant Workers Centre (MWC) — a joint effort between the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC) and the Singapore National Employers Federation (SNEF) — now has a permanent office at Rangoon Road.</p>
              <p>The centre, which aims to improve the welfare of migrant workers in Singapore, has helped over 350 foreign workers integrate into society through various activities since its inception some four months ago.</p>
              <p>Speaking at the official opening of the facility on Wednesday, Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Manpower and Health, Mr Hawazi Daipi, said: "We would like to see foreign workers enjoy working in Singapore better.</p>
              <p>"Through integration activities with Singaporeans and other foreign workers here, we want to make sure they get better facilities and also the training they need to adjust to the working conditions in Singapore."</p>
              <p>MWC has also tied up with NTUC Learning Hub to develop basic conversational English enrichment course for workers seeking to achieve necessary English proficiency.</p>
              <p>The centre aims to have at least 1,000 migrant workers participate in this initiative by March next year.</p>

              <p>Well i think this is a YES....BUT issue.</p>
              <p>I need to highlight the other aspect of foreign workers, their living condition do really need to be taken care of. A lot of contractors bring in foreign workers but short of understanding they are bringing in another human being so all aspect of feeding, lodging and clean sanitations need to be taken care off or else it becomes a human right issued.</p>
              <p>I spend few months writing Human rights policy for factories to meet UN NGOs requirement so i understand some of the issued being address globally. But it is up to Singapore government to focus and channel proper resources for local to fill certain jobs.</p>
              <p>But I think the proper Labor Economics Treatment to address employment of residents vs foreign workers that SG govt completely absent/ZERO from the policy of  Minimum Wage particularly for certain area of construction industries. So to ensure SG residents are motivated to take up certain construction jobs. This is a entire sectors of domestics employments opportunities for Singaporean especially building HDB.  </p>
              <p>Minimum wage treatment totally missing from fiscal policies, as such you see the rise in property value did not spill over to wage gain. The spill over benefit goes into developers, banks lenders, and speculators and URD. (another crowding out effect)</p>
              <p>I think it would be a healthy approach for SG GDP if part of gain in construction spill over to wage gain for Singaporean workers. Rather than bottleneck on soly depend on gain from  speculators and lenders and CPF. Also the wage gain for singaporean worker would means that the velocity of money get turns over faster. (After all there is no way Singapore were to compete with Chinese wages. and our HDB price are overwhelmingly expensive)   </p>

              <p>I doubt anyone from the govt is looking into the correlation.    The govt seems to be the least interested to take care of the local workers.   If they really care, they would set a minimum wage for the local employers to pay the local workers.    Just wonder how a food court cleaner who is paid $4 an hour is able to survive in Singapore.    Guess the govt does not earn any levy from our local workers that is why they cannot be bothered. </p>

              <p><br>Let me put this clearly to all of you, in 10 years time, when LKY PAP is still in control, no singapore will be working as cleaners or workers, the old will be dead, the lazy one will be sent to upgrade to supervisory and leadership position thru training and longlife learning. All menial works will be taken over by foreign workers, therefore there is a need to train these foreign workers, not FT hor, to adopt our culture, our system and our way of life.

              <p><br>Let me put this clearly to all of you, in 10 years time, when LKY PAP is still in control, no singapore will be working as cleaners or workers, the old will be dead, the lazy one will be sent to upgrade to supervisory and leadership position thru training and longlife learning. All menial works will be taken over by foreign workers, therefore there is a need to train these foreign workers, not FT hor, to adopt our culture, our system and our way of life. Also there is a need to help them from getting cheated by dirty agents from their country and our con men here.</p>

              <p><br>Probably this harlot has promised the grassroot leaders to be on mission to fight those who are not agreeable where PAP is concerned.     Dare said she is half Taiwanese when she does not even know that the President does not have any son and yet dare argue her ass to try to win.   Shake my head!   Think the only topic she is good at is how to lure chee ko pek to patronize her dirty pub.</p>

              <p>I doubt anyone from the govt is looking into the correlation.    The govt seems to be the least interested to take care of the local workers.   If they really care, they would set a minimum wage for the local employers to pay the local workers.    Just wonder how a food court cleaner who is paid $4 an hour is able to survive in Singapore.    Guess the govt does not earn any levy from our local workers that is why they cannot be bothered. </p>

Rather than bottleneck on soly depend on gain from  speculators and lenders and CPF. Also the wage gain for singaporean worker would means that the velocity of money get turns over faster. (After all there is no way Singapore were to compete with Chinese wages. and our HDB price are overwhelmingly expensive)   </p>

You must be from Africa hor...In the 1st world condition, Singapore post the lowest personnal taxation with so much relief and our education system is one of the top best in the world if not in asia, that is why we are able to attract talents and Foreign Childrens to come here and study, but our own old uncles and aunties are so stubborn to go back to the classroom and keep grumbling here and there.

              <p><br>Hello, Are u taking assumption or rubbish? or maybe dreaming...those figures only exist in zimbalwe. You must be from Africa hor...In the 1st world condition, Singapore post the lowest personnal taxation with so much relief and our education system is one of the top best in the world if not in asia, that is why we are able to attract talents and Foreign Childrens to come here and study, but our own old uncles and aunties are so stubborn to go back to the classroom and keep grumbling here and there. The bus is moving, if you dun want to tack along, you will be left behind.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You may dislike the ruling party, but you must take care of yourself if you want to carry on living here, go upgrade or training, as Singaporeans you training is almost free...just a matter of your time, mentality and hardworking attitude.</p>
