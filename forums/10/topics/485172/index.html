'I strongly support families living close to one another,' said Mr Khaw. 'We must do more to help families stay close to one another.'"</em></span><br>Me thinks that by giving additional housing priviledges/ $grants to couples just because property (resale/ BTO) is more expensive in city/ suburb HDB is more expensive is only fuelling the wealth divide. If any subsidy is given, this cannot exceed 5% of the price of the BTO HDB flat AND<strong> without the need for further queue priority measures</strong>.<br><br>Better solutions include building bigger HDB flats to accommodate 3 generation families (along with raised property taxes with rebates per Sinkie occupant to dissuade hording/ using HDB for rental returns), <strong>cheaper, subsidised and better public transport </strong>to outskirt areas so that property prices all over Singapore are not so decided by closeness to city, evenly spread out amenities so that new towns have as good amenities (school, recreation, libraries etc) as established towns etc so that entire families can stay at different parts of Singapore and still enjoy as equally good a quality of life. <br>Special subsidies for young couple ignores the fact that some HDB towns (ToaPayoh, city areas etc) remain more desirable than others and that such priority schemes extinguish the hopes of others who aspire to afford an HDB flat in such established city/ fringe HDB town.<br><br><strong>Such priority/ subsidy schemes also distort the market price of HDB flats: if any, to make the desirable excessively expensive, if not all HDB more expensive.</strong><br><br>Mr Khaw should stop kidding himself that HDB is public housing. With such a vibrant resale market, PR's being allowed to buy HDB flats, Sinkies using their HDB as income sideline whilst living it up in private housing, HDB market prices are indeed approaching the price of leasehold 99yr private property as time goes by.<br><br><strong>Orphaned individuals should also not be discriminated against</strong> just to satisfy some territorial/ dynastic aspirations amongst larger family groups.<br><br>Minister Khaw should<strong> avoid knee jerk solutions</strong> to Singapore's population/ talent problems since that will only make the problem worse in the long term and diminish Sinkie's overall support for the PAP.<br><br>
