[B]</blockquote>I agree with the part that the govt has done enuff to educate us but there are times where laws need not be passed. Like u said this is a poor example of a law that shd be enforced.<br><br>I find it difficult to accept that after so many years of driving without a backseat rule (the law has been ard for 10 years), they finally crack the whip only ten years into the ruling. Cars have been ard decades b4 and there has not been such a rule. I believe that statistics brought together from past and present years will show that accidents INVOLVING backseat belts being ignored are pretty much identical.<br><br>Most accidents involve the usual drink-driving, impatience, beating the lights etc etc. Then there is the occasional knocking down of a jaywalking pedestrian and multiple car pile-ups. But the number of passengers who have been killed becoz they refused to use the backseat belts is definitely not rising.<br><br>Education demands that we take precedance  with our lives and hence safety. I think certain things shd be left to the general public to decide whether it's worth doing. Putting up billboards and having advertisements promoting backseat belts is the next best thing but ultimately, it's ur own safety, your own onus.<br><br>If we continue to "enforce" unnecessary laws such as this, we will only turn s'poreans into ppl who belt up becoz they "have to" , not becoz they're matured to realise it's their lives they're gambling with. In short they only go through the motion becoz there is a LAW governing it, not becoz they personally deem it appropriate.<br><br>[This message has been edited by controversay (edited 09 May 2002).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Both sides have their merits i guess, the govt "pampering" us with such laws to ensure our safety (notice the irony?) and the ppl who disregard them or consider it safe enuff for the passengers to be unbuckled.<br><br>Frankly, i would prefer only the front two to be fastened and leave the rear seaters with the option to stay unbuckled or buckled up.<br><br>If something happens, then it's just too bad....but that's me.</div>

What choice do i have? When my poor old parents are stuck here with just their pathetic CPF for retirement unmatched by a higher HDB housing loan to be paid? Do you think i can leave them alone when they can go nowhere and migrate? Do you think your poor retired parent with more than half their life time saving stuck in CPF and HDB flat, high cost of living and prices that keep raising sky high, can survive in this country where the old and the sick are look upon as a burden? My parents is the only reason that keep me staying here. And like the thinking of my foreign colleague, I worry for my own retirement. Singapore is just another good enuff place to work, full stop. And since we had our PR status in australia approved based on IT skill criteria recently, migration to australia to join my relatives whose thriving over there might be my future's plan.<br><br>Why waste $$$ settling down here raising kids esp boy in such a blood sucking environment when he can be raised elsewhere and come back here 2 and a half year ahead of the local to be valued as foreign talent? Why waste $$$ settling down here when for a price of a 90 square metre 4 Room HDB flat, i can get a big house with courtyards and garden over there in melbourne like my relative? Why waste $$$ buying a car here when you can get 3 new branded cars with the same price over there? Why pay COE when you can have the freedom to drive car till it die over there? Why worry about retirement and your kid's education when you had worked all your life to pump in CPF, COE, Taxes, GST, High HDB pricing and serve cheap labour in NS for the government here? Why worry about too high a taxes over there when you are getting a much higher salary too to offset the difference than here? And hence, the current move of mine would be to earn hard, enjoy and spent only in other countries e.g malaysia, indonesia etc and ultimately save up for my next move.<br><br>Well, migration will be my next move only when i have no need to worry for my parents here and when i find it totally unbearable to work here even as a PR anymore.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>back to my original point to you: provide proper reasoning for your arguments. the way you are going in this post, as well as countless other posts, you are not here to debate, this forum to you is merely an avenue for you to vent your frustations on your unseen ghosts within the government. you snub all those who disagree with you as if they are a bunch of disillusioned puppets, when in fact by the way you carry yourself in this forum, it is clear that you are the one who is blindly thrashing about; like a drowning man who does not know how to swim, your arms and legs wildly flailing about yet not knowing how to float and all you know is you want to break the surface and breathe.</strong></blockquote>Guess you can say so if you like, luckily there's no law to stop one from doing so cos internet is the only avenue that's still at least untouchable to some extent by the government unlike local media. So much for tok of transparency in singapore.<br><br>Each to his own. When 75% of the apathetic lots can actually support the government to meet its own end, what can the minority do? No hope i guess. We will just have to wait and see the results b4 we make the move for the sake of our next generation and hope for the best for this country for the sake of our poor parents.<br><br><a href="http://forums.delphiforums.com/sintercom/messages/?msg=463.1" rel="nofollow">The New Poors in Singapore</a><br><br>[This message has been edited by Kyo23 (edited 14 May 2002).]</div>

But i wonder why is he still here making so much noise, venting his anger at the forum?<br><br>Says so much of his character for being a person that only goes for material gain and to the extent of even giving up his citizenship JUST because he wants a so call 'better life'. If he thinks Australia is a better place, wait till the refugees floods in and they are forced to take everyone! Then he will complain about THAT govt being foolish and all, and all the $$ that he had saved would go into the pockets of the refugees...hahahhaha...thanks to the society security!!!!<br><br>Kyo23, sad to say but you won't be able to find anyone to sympathise or support you on your situation. Quite oppositely, you will only find criticisms for your thoughts and comments.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>If I recall correctly, PM Goh once remarked that Singaporeans are moaners...we like to complain. We are never satisified.<br><br>The root of our dissatisfaction is mainly due to the individual selfish point of view, we only want the good, but not the bad. But running a country, they have to think of the long term picture, and the good of the society as a whole. Thus some unpopular changes/rules (5% GST) have to be implemented.<br><br>For example, just imagine you are the boss of a company, and you are making a loss. To ensure the long time survivability of the business, you have to cut the workers pay. Sure...you can keep the workers happy, by not making any pay reductions. But very soon your company will go bust. Singapore is managed much in the same manner.<br><br>True, in countries like Austrilia, you might have cheap houses, cheap cars, wide open spaces. But do you know how expensive it is to eat out? Do you know how expensive the health  cost here? It can easily cost you up *OVER* $50 to see a GP, and that is just for the consultation. You have to pay another sum for your medication at the pharmacy. Income tax high, and you see homeless old pple on the streets. Racial problems.<br><br>In this world, nothing is perfect. There is always a balance. For every good thing, there is bound to be flaws. No system is perfect.<br><br>You are blasting away, without giving any constructive solutions. Kyo23, you think other countries are better, and offer a better life. But have you ever spent some extended period of your life living overseas? On what grounds did you base your comments on? Cause you views so far had been very shallow. (no offense meant)<br><br>It's a common human flaw, we always think that the grass is greener on the other side. But the result is usually disappointing, as we did not preceive the full picture. It's no better than a horse wearing blinkers, can only see straight.<br><br>If you are unhappy with your present situation, do something to improve it! Complaining won't change a thing. If you not happy with a goverment policy, there are channels to voice your views. Eg. Strait Times Forum. If are sure you can run this country better, form a party and run for goverment....but pls kindly don't the sad example set by Dr Ch**. If not, sell your assets, migrate....I wish you all the best in your future.<br><br>But if Singapore is your home only when it suits your needs, then I will like to enquire what's the differance between you and the foreign talent you so dispise? Aren't you like a mercenary?

            <div class='col-md body'>You really think that your perceived higher pay in Australia will offset the *minimum* 30% income tax that will be stamped on you(I'm working part time in Melbourne and I get taxed 22% so as an IT professional I'll assume 30% will be the minimum for you), ON TOP of the 10% GST AS WELL as the higher standards of living here($4 ham and egg sandwich on 2 slices of bread mean anything?)? You're either wildly optimistic or terminally naive.<br><br>Hey maybe you can supplement that higher income by claiming disability pension for the latter and use your posts here as evidence of your claims. *snigger*<br><br>Of course your relatives will paint a rosy picture for you here. No matter what they're Singaporeans born and bred, face will most likely still matter to them. After spending a small fortune uprooting themselves and their families from their land of birth (and probably slagging off Singapore no end like you when they were in SG) you'll hardly expect them to tell you that they found out Australia, like Singapore has its pros and cons and is not exactly heaven on earth?<br><br>Maybe the next time you speak to them you might like to ask them about<br><br>- how Australia's car theft rate is second only to Britain in the OECD<br>- the general quality of Melbournes roads and how good they are for the suspension of that dear BMW which you'll buy in Australia<br>- dare them to walk alone unescorted in Melbourne suburbs called Footscray or Richmond in the middle of the night(and try asking yourself if you dare to do the same in say, AMK or Clementi at the same time)<br>- what are the odds of getting the window of that BMW of yours smashed in the middle of the city and that expensive CD changer you've just bought stolen?<br>- whats with a justice system which sentences 2 yobs who rob rape and kill a 80+ year old granny get 18 months jail each?<br><br>I can go on and on. Don't get me wrong, Australia is not hell on earth, but neither is Singapore and neither is Australia the heaven on earth you seem to believe. I've been here studying for 3+ years(and working part time), like it tremendously, met lots of great people here(but met my share of assholes too). But after trying out both lifestyles, I know where I'll settle, and its not where I am now.<br><br>Of course cars and houses will cost more in Singapore, and houses are smaller. In case you haven't noticed, Singapore is an island 40 miles at its longest and 25 miles widest, while Australia is a huge continent with more land than it knows what to do with. Simple supply and demand economics. Or is that even beyond your understanding for an IT professional?<br><br>Do you think that we can fit our entire population in huge bugalows at affordable prices and still have space to work etc etc? Or do you just want it for yourself at the expense of others?<br><br>On the other hand, you'll be able to join your anti-globalization protester mates outside the Nike Superstore in Melbourne every Friday. Oh wait, you'll become a poster boy for globalization when you become an Australian PR and work as a "foriegn talent" won't you? Better not go then...     <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>[This message has been edited by Viper52 (edited 17 May 2002).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">By Kyo 23:</div><div class="quote_body">When did i mentioned that at the rate the government is producing the laws, that laws SHOULD be made to ensure that our singaporeans show courtesy to each other, and also that laws SHOULD make it compulsory to set up families and ensure we reach our optimum growth, in other words implying that it should be made illegal for families to have less than two children?</div></blockquote>right here:<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">By Kyo23:</div><div class="quote_body">After years of educating the pple on importance of courtesy, few follows, Should law be passed to enforce it? After letting the pple know the importance of raising a family and having more children io curb a greying populations, and the number of singles still going up and we still face a serious baby crisis, should law be passed to stop the trend to curb a national crisis then?</div></blockquote>to compare with my reply:<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">By me:</div><div class="quote_body">Then by your reasoning too, since everybody knows stealing, rape, drugs and murder are wrong, we should remove the laws that prohibit such acts?</div></blockquote>is my reply not similar to yours? and you said i was making a poor joke? so isn't yours too? i phrased my post deliberately to show that yours was a joke, you saw it in mine but ignored yours.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">By Kyo23:</div><div class="quote_body">Well, criticizing individual is not my main aim but to let everyone see some facts and logics instead of following blindly.</div></blockquote>where are the facts? i've been asking for you to give me facts, examples at least, but you have not been forthcoming.<br>following blindly? criticizing blindly is no less undesirable.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">By Kyo23:</div><div class="quote_body">Can you explain the characteristic lack of creativity in singaporean then? It's mainly becos of our educational system and partly due to the lawful system that cultivate typical singaporean's Kiaxi mentality to kill off creativity in singapore.</div></blockquote>i have not yet attempted to discuss the level of creativity in s'pore. i am merely debating the effect of laws in s'pore on our level of creativity.<br>this is getting ridiculous. this is the third time you have claimed that our laws stifle our creativity, without the slightest elaboration how, yet you claim to have intention only to provide people with facts. where, then, are the facts? the examples? where?<br>and now, since maybe you too sense that it is getting tiresome for you to throw this accusation without elaboration, you throw in the educational system as well. and, again, this too lacks elaboration.<br>lets take this one at a time. my question still stands:<br>WHICH OF OUR LAWS STIFLE CREATIVITY IN OUR PEOPLE?IN WHAT WAY?<br>if possible, please also touch on what type of creativity, ie, in the workplace? in our schools?<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">By Kyo23:</div><div class="quote_body">You mean for a child borned in singapore at young age, he got plenty of choice to migrate? It is only after gaining independence and working to be able to support himself that he got plenty of choice.<br>[/quote]<br><br>well you agree then that there for people who are able to fend for themselves, they have plenty of choice? are you still of a young age? have you not yet gained independance? have you not yet begun working and able to support yourself?<br>if the answers to these questions are yes, from your post, you agree then that you have plenty of choice?<br><br>[quote]By Kyo23:<br><strong>Just curious and some guessing, so you working for government maybe in SAF as a regular then?</strong></div></blockquote><strong>no. i am merely a student. a student who is grateful for his subsidised university fees. a student who is glad that at times he can go out till the middle of the night and walk home along the streets with no fear of harm.<br>but even if i were a civil servant, or an SAF regular, will you dismiss my posts as ramblings from a blind follower? does a person's vocation discredit his arguments in a debate?<br><br>my questions are still awaiting your answer.</strong></div>
