              <p><strong>Lee Kwan Yew: a ratbag to the end</strong></p>
              <p>Saturday, Apr 14, 2007,</p>
              <p>It seems the Australian
              government-academic establishment is running out of Asian autocrats to
              fete. Chancellor Allan Hawke and Vice Chancellor Ian Chubb of the
              Australian National University (ANU) are the latest to join the
              Australian movers and shakers who laud distasteful people -- in their
              case, former Singaporean prime minister Lee Kwan Yew, who now holds an
              ANU honorary doctorate.</p>
              <p>That the ANU could impugn its reputation for excellence in Asian
              studies and human rights law to further the ambitions of its top two
              officers is surprising enough. That these men should ram through the
              award by shelving university processes of review and then praise Lee's
              "integrity," "commitment to advancing the causes of peace and
              prosperity" and "international statesmanship [sic]" is downright
              contemptible. But credit where credit's due: Lee would applaud their
              methods.</p>
              <p>Hawke and Chubb, no doubt, will be unmoved to hear of Lee's most recent
              slur against a head of state -- hardly proper protocol, one might
              think, for the recipient of a gong for statesmanship. Nonetheless, on
              April 4, Lee trotted out an attack on President Chen Shui-bian (é™³æ°´æ‰�),
              saying that he was duping Taiwanese into believing that independence
              from China is possible because war would result and the US would not
              intervene.</p>
              <p>The problem with this salvo was that it wasn't just
              personal; it was a bouquet to China and a put-down directed at millions
              of Taiwanese people who believe in democracy and liberty. So a personal
              attack on Lee for his cardigan despotism and hubris is perfectly in
              order -- because so much of Singapore and its neuroses are linked to
              Lee's person.</p>
              <p>Lee's record on human rights is poor. He, like other autocrats in the
              region, demeans his people by labeling liberties of press and academic
              freedom as Western conceits that are not conducive to "Asian"
              societies. This mentality -- culturalist bordering on racist -- set up
              one of the more enduring intellectual hoaxes of the 1990s, namely that
              there exist "Asian values" (as opposed to Western or Judeo-Christian
              values, presumably, though his argument was never coherent). And these
              values, funnily enough, seem to absolve people such as Lee for
              oppressive behavior -- as long as an economic return is delivered.</p>
              <p>Lee's legacy of authoritarianism lives on. This week saw the banning of
              a documentary about a long-time political prisoner in Singapore, Said
              Zahari. Suffice it to say that Singapore's credibility is shaky if it
              can't face up to events of 30 years ago and cites social order as a
              pretext for shutting down debate.</p>
              <p>And if it wasn't clear before, it should be now: With the latest pay
              rise that lawmakers have awarded themselves (justification: lavishing
              millions of dollars on the "most talented" legislators and executive
              officials beats corruption), the Singaporean state can now be dubbed
              the world's most lucrative -- and sanitized -- protection racket. Lee,
              who these days goes under the risible title of "minister mentor," will
              himself pocket another small fortune. But even by Singaporean
              standards, this self-aggrandizement is so brazen that Prime Minister
              Lee Hsien Loong has promised to donate his new riches to charity.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> Lee Kwan Yew, his son and their supporters can keep their city-state
              kleptocracy and their largely pliant people. And long may he be courted
              by foreign academic powerbrokers and governments dazzled by his
              connections.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> But Lee Kwan Yew is no friend of Taiwan. Until Singapore learns to deal
              with domestic political opponents other than by intimidating,
              bankrupting, arresting and torturing them, there is little to learn
              from Lee's fiefdom or his lectures. Taiwan has seen it all before --
              and left it behind. </strong></span></span></p>
