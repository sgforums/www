            <div class='col-md body'>Singapore per capita ranking dropped from 8th to 22nd over a matter of a few years because of wrong high-cost anti-business and anti-entrepreneur elitist policies.<br><br>So far apart from piecemeal efforts on education, CL2 and medishield the 20 major policy errors as posted in this forum (page 11: Definition of True Democracy) are still not solved. (read below)<br><br>1) Bureaucracy in civil service.<br>(2) High costs of essential government services e.g. medical, utilities, housing, transportation, education, etc, etc<br>(3) Growth Triangles<br>(4) Affective divide due to lack of understanding of people's views and aspirations.<br>(5) Work site safety problems (Hotel New World Collapse's blue paper was not effectively implemented)<br>(6) Deliver a Swiss standard of living<br>(7) Asset enhancement scheme fiasco<br>(8 ) Unit trust investment fiasco<br>(9) Foreign relation fiascos<br>(10) Non-formulation of a value-adding investment strategy<br>(11) Double-charging on lands (paid by taxpayers yet charged back to them at full market prices) and triple charges on vehicles.<br>(12) Meritocratic education policy that backfired - brain drains of thousands<br>(13) Mother tongue - CL1 admission fiasco<br>(14) Reaching World Cup soccer league by 2010 - no sign of getting near.<br>(15) Investment losses by thousands of citizens from CPF funds.<br>(16) Spiraling of government ministers' and civil servants' salaries.<br>(17) Failure to implement accountability and transparency in respect of investments of citizens' monies in overseas investments.<br>(18 ) Loss of economic competitiveness due to high costs.<br>(19) Neglect in promoting entrepreneurship<br>(20) Neglect in nurturing the domestic sector of economy.<br><br>Despite NKF revelations of many problems caused by past erroneous policy assumptions, there was no "thinking out of the box" or willingness to correct past errors due to face or egotism. (Koizumi would simply call for an election and refer such 20 issues to the people as election issues; Thaksin would place his head on voters' chopping block to decide on his leadership in dealing with unrest in the south)<br><br>So given such a egotistic nature of governance there will be no corporate governance to expect. There will be little change to its economic competitiveness in the next few years but of course the state-licensed newspapers and televisions will show the economy is doing well.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I notice that despite all the denials by ministers over the years, people have finally found that the government has been slow in tackling its high costs due to various reasons within their control, the unreasonably high charges levied on lands being one.<br><br>In the same way, it has been refusing to admit similar high costs at SIA, HDB, Town Council, LTA, and its GLCs. Just imagine we a small country have employed the expensive services of 4 mayors while bigger country was only having one for the whole capital city. Many of these officers were morever paid three times of equivalent in private sector.<br><br>Despite all the claims about leadership and talents, all the mayors and the whole NEA (paid half-million salaries pa) have sadly been unable to prove their worth and failed miserably to solve simple problem with effective preventative control of dengue epidemic. It is a matter of preventative measures which if regularly taken should have prevented the spread sometime back.<br><br>Sadly despite all of them being paid the  highest salaries none of the officers and ministers and mayors have solved simple problems.<br><br>It is not until the NKF matter came to a head at the court case between NKF and SPH when NKF CEO was finally caught for excessive spending of donation monies while he was paid salaries - higher than prime ministers in other land and unheard of 12-month bonuses.<br><br>With such frequent denials of problems, making comparison selectively with problems of other countries, no wonder today, we are contending with the 20 major policy errors which despite citizens's suggestions are not tackled at all.<br><br>Bill Gates, Sim Wong Hoo and some other lesser leaders or talents outside our leaders' definition of talents would have solved them in some ways and not to leave the matter to protracted contentions with customers or the people.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>our country is young, no doubt, therefore we have no culture and good history because there is not major upheavel like natural diasters, things like that.<br><br>up till now we only have one racial riot (over 40 years ago but LKY is still talking so passionately about it.. he sure love that old times.) and the rest is only news about murders, gang killings, rapes, business related that people don't really matter and remember after some time.<br><br>in this period of time, our nation cannot survive just by Changing a little here and little there. this kinda idea does not work now.<br><br>they keep telling us not to remind in one spot because we will get outdated. and yet, we are still told that being number 1 in everything is the thing/policy to stay. how can a small country being first in every aspect?<br><br>this carries on, we will not only cripple ourselves, and realize that the dream is over, a long time ago.</div>
