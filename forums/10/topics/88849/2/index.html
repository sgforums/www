            <div class='col-md body'>Eating out in Singapore has got to be one of the best.  Its cheap, you got variety and you can find at least one place running 24/7.  Try living elsewhere, other than some branches of Maccas running 24/7, its a ghost town.  Price wise, if you find $8.00 for a decent meal eating out ridiculous, you'll be glad to know such things rarely occur in Singapore.  By the way, some restaurants charge 15% on top of their service and GST charges on public holidays if they are open.  I made the above references with regards to the state of Queensland, Australia.</div>

Coupled 2 these r the various price hikes, which worsen the situation.<br><br>2)Of cos there r a couple of items which seem ridiculously highly priced like HDB flats n cars. Reasons r given in the case of car to prevent congestion, but does it really works? New cars r still seen on the road n ppl, frens ard us at least 4 me r still buying cars w/o batting an eyelid regarding the prices n long term cost. Well if ppl can afford cars with exorbitantly priced COE, why not HDB flats which r lying unoccupied all over the place?<br><br>Of cos when we talked abt HDB flats, this issue bring up the marriage issue and the ridiculous rule of only singles aged 35 can own a flat.<br><br></div>

(well...the flat will eat up your cpf, and you'll feel the pain when its time to retire and there's very little left in your cpf, maybe not even enough to make up the ever increasing minimum sum.

It is undeniable that cars are very expensive in SG. But it is a luxury, if you cant afford, dun drive, you have a choice.<br><br>But how about basic transport like buses and MRT ? Ppl dun have a choice, you cant expect everybody to walk or cycle to work or get around. I think an increase in price of public transport is unjustifiable when the operators are making healthy profits.

Are these cost justified, reasonable and inevitable?<br><br>Foodwise, I think it seems okay to me. I do not have the breakdown in the cost of food but judging from the already low cost, I can believe that it may not be possible to bring it down further without subsidizes. And if it is subsidizes, then I guess it shuld be targeted at the truly poor people and not generla public. So, a different approach is better.<br><br>Transport, I agree with you that it is not justified since they are profitable even before the price hike.</div>
