            <div class='col-md body'>Well.... a motivation from the other thread about poverty.<br><br>Questions here are<br><br>(1) Is it true that the cost of living is very high in Singapore?<br><br>(2) If it is, then what are the exact items where the cost is very high? Examples of items and actual cost will be much appreciated when making claims of high cost.<br><br>(3) Are the high cost justified, necessary and inevitable?<br><br>I would appreciate actual figures to be given to justify claims of high cost as indicated in question (2).</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Personally, I find that the cost of living in Singapore is quite reasonable given the standard of living here except for a few items.<br><br>Things that I find reasonably priced in Singapore<br><br>(1) Food - $2-4 dollars a meal is reasonable I think<br>(2) General Education - Never remember paying much for school until University.<br>(3) Clothing - Can be as cheap as $3 a piece if you really don't mind brand/quality.<br><br>Things I find unreasonable<br>(1) Housing - I am fine with Condo price subjected to market forces. But it seems ridiculous for me to have direct HDB flat purchase to be subjected to market forces. It should be based on cost.<br><br>Things which I am unsure<br>(1) Healthcare - expensive I think, but am not too sure since I try not to see doctors in general<br>(2) Transport - Taxi is cheap, Car is expensive, Train/Bus is slightly towards the expensive side I think.<br>(3) University education is expensive. Am unsure if I agree with government arguement that they can charge more since graduates gets to earn it back eventually.<br><br>Above is just my personal perception.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My main grouse is with public transportation - buses and mrt. Even a slight increase has a  multiplier effect. Eg no. of trips each day x no of days in a month. I dun understand why PTC allow a fare increase when there is a recession when the operators are still making million dollar profits.</div>

If you are refering to the pasar malam popping up all over the island in recent years. Then the figures goes like this.<br><br>SLA charge event organizer $0.65-$1.80 psm per day. Then event organizer charge rental to stall holder. Example, if the pasar malam goes on for 1 month in sub-urban area with an area of 5000 square metres, SLA charge the organizer $0.90*5000*30=$135,000. The organizer then sets everything up and charge the stall holder rentals. If the event organizer charge $7,500 per stall and assuming he can accomodate 100 stalls (average 50 square metres - i.e. half your HDB size), then he will get $750,000!!!!
