Not juz some US colleges who calls themselves XXX State University or some UK/Aust polytechnics that call themselves WYSIWYG University of Technology.<br><br>In eastern companies, they recog many part-time deg, but so as long as you are worth that higher post then you can climb. Even if you ITE/Poly, you still can climb as long as you achieve something which management appreciates.<br>Tips: Karaoke with the Japs, work OT with the Japs, smoke with the Japs, shag with the Japs!<br><br>But not in western MNCs, if you want that Snr title, you better get a degree!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Not just the government but all employers need to be wary about recognition of degrees.<br><br>NUS, NTU, SMU, SIM and other local degrees are generally recognised because of their familiarity, as they are all homegrown. Some are government supported and work with the MOE. So it is only natural that recognition is taken for granted.<br><br>But there are many, many other universities in the world. In some cases, degrees are conferred without even having to attend any courses. You can even gain doctorate degrees thataway!! Pay your money, and buy that degree!<br><br>So what's to be recognised or not is a fairly complicated matter. If one is worried about recognition, one should make sure that the institution one selects is reputable.  The US Ivy League unis are universally recognised, as are the top uni degrees from England and Australia. As for the rest....<br><br>At the bottomline of course, what counts is job-performance. Degrees are supposed to give a rough gauge of what a person is supposed to be able to do, or to achieve, with some experience.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i think robertteh wanted to post this but click on the private msg instead.<br><br>It is very tough act to ask government to recognize open uni degree for two reasons. (1) Major government policy of old guard - talents or meritocracy remain in place and unchanged (2) Existing system is deeply entrenched to prove the point that the old guards are right.<br><br>Pride, pride and pride cannot be hurt.<br><br>Changes : Old economy cannot work. Two recessions cannot be altered by talents who were helplessly at a loss. Talents policy were proven mistaken.<br><br>If talent policy was found misplaced, the proof is clear closed uni system does not guarantee results. Let open degree holders be the new generation to lead Singapore from position of underdog.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi everyone <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  I am a diploma holder fresh out of the army and can understand the situation. Its not just even about degree holders actually. For govt jobs that are suitable for diploma holders, they actually prefer to give to degree holders. I went for a quite a lot so I sort of get the idea. As for degree posts, go do a check and you will notice most of those employed are honours students.<br><br>To address the issue of why they don't openly admit it is simple. Not moral and ethical to do it openly. Simple as that. You can't expect the govt to "declare" they only want to accept NTU and NUS top honours students cause they are interested in papers can't you?<br><br>Another point someone mentioned about studying full time vs studying part time is quite shallow. Not everyone can afford to study full time for three years. I often suspect that most of the people who make this kind of statements are the types who have their parents paying for everything.
