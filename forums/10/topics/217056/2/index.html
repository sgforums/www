            <div class='col-md body'>Most people have pointed out many attractive reasons. Me too, is now away from Singapore for a year. Currently in Israel. Why Israel? Straight answer money &amp; overseas living experiance. I have been looking forward to go Overseas many years ago. Between '04 &amp; '05 I was in China 6 times, Indonesia 2 times all on my own, alone. Once was as long as 2 months in China. That's way fun. This month going over to Jordan to see. Next month visiting Thailand to investigate life there.<br><br>Proberly by end of next year will know which country I would like to stay. Hope it's a permante one &amp; semi-retire when I reach 40~45, much earlier then in SG. I don't ask much in life. Simple life, low expectantion but loads of fun. I would consider a country that can provide <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation">  freedom, opportunity for easy life &amp; proper income.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation">  My age? 32 now &amp;  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  Am no come from rich family.<br><br>My second Brother is in Thailand. He is there for 3 years already. Now owns a factory, house, .....<br><br>I would tell people, go try overseas life for short period of time. 1 or 2 months. Then would understand what's great difference between the country.<br><br>Most will be driven by money &amp; easy life reasons. It's pretty attractive I can tell you.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>I have even told my parents if I move to China. I would like them to come, cause just liquidate their HDB flat is enough for them to retried today.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Are you ready &amp; brave enough to step outside of Singapore?? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
