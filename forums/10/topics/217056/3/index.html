            <div class='col-md body'>Well, if you're going to bring up the quitters issue along with a lack of job opportunities, you've opened the door to what the government has had to say about opportunities for Singaporeans at home and overseas.  All I've done is extrapolate.  Why complain when I take you up on points that you raised?<br><br>You've misunderstood the nature of empathy - if someone doesn't know enough about what you're talking about, you've got no business asking for empathy if you don't make an effort to show what you mean.  Look, if you want to explain how you've gotten yourself stranded in a place for six years, I'm happy to take your perspective on it.  If all you're to carry on about is how miserable your conditions are without justifying why you're continuing to stay there, what do you expect me to make of it?<br><br>As far as what you've said goes, you're somewhere overseas and you hate it, and you make some vague reference about work commitments keeping you there.  There's little, if anything, to say that your misery is not self-inflicted, and I stand by my point that it doesn't make any sense to stay in such a situation without substantial reason.<br><br>If you want to take that as judgement, it's coming from your warped interpretation of what I'm saying.  All I'm doing is pointing out the lack of logic, but if you <span style="text-decoration: underline;">want </span>to feel persecuted, well, that just goes to support my point about people being second-class in their own minds.  I'm not judging you - you seem to be judging yourself.<br><br>It's very simple.  You've put forward no clear reason why you can't go somewhere else instead of being miserable where you are.  Now if you said that you specialised in studying quarks and you're stuck in horrible Switzlerland because CERN is the only place where you can do your work, you'd have all my sympathy.  However, you've prevented no compelling reason for your staying where you are, and if you're going to continue to do so, the commonsense conclusion is that you want to stay there, even though (or maybe because) you feel miserable there.  No sympathy or empathy in that case - the angst is self-inflicted.<br><br>On a side note, how does pointing out my personal experience with a break-in in Singapore, which was in response to your point about break-ins elsewhere, constitute " jumping up and down like an enraged monkey"?  Care to explain that one, in light of your claim to be non-judgemental?<br><br>If anything, you're the one who seems to have an interest in escalating things here.  I suggest you take a deep breath and regain control of your emotions - it'll help you think more clearly.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In NZ for three years now, miss Sg lotz and will be back soon. Got an interesting story to share however.<br><br>I met an ex-Singaporean in NZ who happens to be PM Lee's uncle, MM Lee's bro-in law. He is currently living in Wellington sub-urb but has a number of properties lying around the country and also runs a backpacker in Wellington City. I was spending a night at his backpacker once and had a chat with him.<br><br>He's an established musician, pretty much travelled and toured the world and lived for quite sometime in UK b4 migrating to NZ. Despite being closely related to the Lee family, he absolutely dispise them, about half the time I was listening to him F***ing the Lees unside down, inside out, left right center. But anyway, while he chose not to reside in Sg because he refuses to be in the same country with his relatives and other reasons, he does however, concurred that the safety of other countries are much worse compared to Singapore. Although he do not reside in Sg, he does travel back to visit other more loved relatives.<br><br>I think coming from a guy like him, there's certainly some credits to the low crime rate and security of Sg.</div>

Next to what I get out of living in Australia, the statistics are effectively meaningless.</div></blockquote>In contrast, I never had any problem with eye staring incidents in Singapore, not even when I'm walking in Geyland area in middle of night. But I do get occassional provocations along the streets of New Zealand, certainly more than Singapore. I can honestly say I feel much safer in Singapore than in New Zealand.<br><br>So we have contrasting opinions due to our individual different experiences. Individually, these experiences are hardly conclusive, just because you alone felt safe in the states does not mean  the school children who just got involved in a school shooting incident felt safe. Similarly, just because I felt safe in Singapore doesn't mean that a poor lady who got mugged twice along the streets will feel the same.<br><br>What matters therefore is the collective experience of all of us. Given enough data, it is possible to estimate the possiblility of encountering an undesirable security incident. The crime rate provides <strong>to a certain degree</strong> such estimation. Provided that all or at least most of us who got mugged and such report our cases, the crime rate can at least indicate and compare what are the chances of becoming a victim. Certainly the statistic is an estimation and is constrain by geographical and generalisation of data, but if statistics are not used as an objective indicator, what can we use?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Good question, wisefool.  For lack of a better measure for comparison, we do have statistics on hand, but as you've observed, we do need to be careful about what we take away from those statistics.<br><br>In my line of work, I have to deal with statistical interpretation on a daily basis, and more often than not I've got to explain to my clients how they cannot extrapolate their results to the nth degree, and instead to focus specifically upon applying the results to themselves and their own situations.<br><br>This brings me back to my question - how safe is safe?  Do the statistics really provide so much proof that we can definitely say, "Look at the crime rate there - we can't possibly live there"?
