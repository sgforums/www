              <p><strong>Today’s more knowledgeable, diversified new generation which is tech-savvy and better informed demands more, and expects more from society.</strong></p>
              <p>BY THE day, Singapore – in seemingly perpetual transformation – is full of surprises. Hardly a year of being hit by one of its worst ever crises, the economy has surprisingly turned red hot.</p>
              <p>In fact, it looks set to make Singapore the world’s fastest-growing country this year, overtaking even China. So why is public reaction so muted?</p>
              <p>The solid performance plus several other superlative achievements have stirred more public concerns than euphoria, as it would have in the past.</p>
              <p>It also stirred a debate on Singa­pore’s four-decade strategy of economic growth allegedly taking precedence over the welfare of citizens.</p>
              <p>The boom has created a huge manpower demand, which prompted Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong to announce he may have to bring in another 100,000 foreign workers.</p>
              <p>This comes in the wake of a Ministry of Trade and Industry forecast of a sizzling 13%-15% GDP growth for 2010, higher than any other country, developed or not.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans have been reassured by the recovery from a severe economic crisis during the past two years.</p>
              <p>However, people are broadly sceptical about how much the boom will benefit the masses in terms of jobs and wages, or in reducing the gap between rich and poor.</p>
              <p>Their doubts seem justified.</p>
              <p>Only four days after the PM said prospects were so hot that “if we don’t allow the (100,000) foreign workers in, you are going to have overheating” his finance minister appeared to have poured cold water on it.</p>
              <p>Tharman Shanmugaratnam called the rebound short-term and natural after two years of near-zero growth.</p>
              <p>And a week later, Dr Tony Tan, deputy chairman of the Government of Singapore Investment Corp (GIC) sounded a more dismal note for Singapore.</p>
              <p>The fragile recovery could see the world tip back into recession “sooner than expected”, he warned.</p>
              <p>Few people believe it will greatly improve their lives and may in fact raise the cost of living.</p>
              <p>Some revived the old criticism that “the government becomes rich, but the people remain poor”, which doesn’t describe today’s middle class in Singapore.</p>
              <p>In addition, people’s expectations have also risen. This is because of rising affluence and the investment on education during the past few decades now paying off.</p>
              <p>It has produced a knowledgeable, diversified new generation which is tech-savvy and better informed. The consequence is they demand more and expect more from society.</p>
              <p>Tens of thousands are beginning to question or challenge government policies.</p>
              <p>Take the issue of GDP.</p>
              <p>When I was a wet-behind-the-ear reporter, few Singaporeans knew what the term (defined as “the total income of a country”) meant. That was 45 years ago.</p>
              <p>At the time, Singapore’s 1.9 million people – largely poor and not literate – had just been given independence.</p>
              <p>As time passed, people began to learn not only what GDP was, but also its importance to Singapore’s survival, given its high dependency on the outside world.</p>
              <p>At the outset, the economy was top priority, the <em>raison d’etre</em> of the republic’s existence, over-riding almost everything else.</p>
              <p>Explaining why it was so, the then Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, briefing a group of editors about the historic accumulation of state assets, explained: “When we became the government in 1965, we found an empty cupboard; there was no money, no reserves. Brick by brick we had to build it up.”</p>
              <p>Today with the new generation becoming more aware about issues like GDP, state reserves and foreign investment, people are demanding more information and a greater role in their decisions.</p>
              <p>Today, the new generation – instead of accepting what the leaders say based on trust as their parents did – wants to play a role in debating and forming decisions.</p>
              <p>Generally, people have become more cynical about the media use of superlatives when reporting the country’s achievements.</p>
              <p>Of late – as the general election draws nearer – there are more of such eye-popping headlines, including:</p>
              <p>&gt; Singapore has just become the earth’s most over-populated country, a world top albeit of dubious quality.</p>
              <p>&gt; The republic has overtaken Hong Kong to become the world’s frothiest housing market, according to <em>The Economist</em> – good for most property owners, but terrible if the bubble bursts.</p>
              <p>&gt; The number of visitor arrivals rose by a whooping 26.7% in June – very encouraging.</p>
              <p>&gt; Singapore has surpassed rival Hong Kong as most competitive economy - at least until next time – positive news.</p>
              <p>&gt; Wealthy Singapore was ranked the 81st happiest country in the world below countries like Thailand, Taiwan and South Korea, <em>Gallop</em> reported – a poor measure.</p>
              <p>&gt; Only 19% of Singaporeans told <em>Gallop</em> they were “thriving,” 75% said they were “struggling” and 6% claimed to be “suffering” – poor quality of life.</p>
              <p>Critics are pressing for change. Oppositionist Gerald Giam asked: “Why does the PAP government have such an obsession for GDP growth?</p>
              <p>“Don’t they realise that it does not necessarily indicate a healthy economy?” Giam said.</p>
              <p>Newspaper letter writer Seah Su Chen says that gross domestic product growth is not an accurate reflection of the standard of living.</p>
              <p>“It puts no value on leisure. A society that works longer hours will have a higher GDP, but it may not score in human measurements like education and health,” she adds.</p>
              <p>And Nominated Member of Parliament Viswa Sadasivan wants the government to reduce its economic focus to measure progress with socio-economic indicators.</p>
              <p>The governing party has rebutted the charges, denying it had ever pursued a “GDP growth at all cost” strategy.</p>
              <p>“Even in the early days, we have turned down investment opportunities we felt could cause pollution.”</p>
