            <div class='col-md body'>Sad: PAP is Paid top dollar, but creates unfair election rulesÂ…<br><br>Is PAP setting a bad example--- that Â‘cheatingÂ’ is OK in Â“the business of leadership?Â”<br><br>And where do we go from hereÂ… our kids will in future have low moralsÂ…, the rich poor divide will increaseÂ… kids learn- tyranny is OK, some dishonesty is OKÂ…<br><br>So why must we pay top dollar if they are just like any other politicianÂ… Â‘Imperfect, dishonestÂ…Â’?<br><br>Without an opposition voiceÂ… how do we prevent Â‘honest mistakes from happening?Â’<br>Why was Durai Â‘overlookedÂ’ for so long?<br><br>I think that opposition deserves a charity vote to balance out the unfair playing field created by the PAP.<br><br>------------------------------------------<br><br>Election tactics perceived as unjust could alienate voters<br>ST- April 15, 2006<br>When responding to a complaint that the opposition constituencies are disadvantaged in getting better facilities, Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew was absolutely right in saying that the government would always favour its supporters first.<br>It is also true that not all constituencies benefit equally. However, these statements warrant some clarifications.<br>In first-world democracies such as Britain, the government favours its supporters by pushing through policies that they like. The government does not often target geographical areas specifically to reward, or even more rarely, penalise the constituents depending on whom they voted for, as is done in Singapore.<br>In fact, it would be foolish to do this because the governing party often needs every vote that it can garner when the winning margin is usually much narrower than in Singapore.<br>Tactics that are perceived to be unjust could alienate some of its original supporters, causing them to turn against the government and voting it out.<br>Constituencies suffer neglect simply because the government does not see their concerns as a priority, not because of their political persuasion.<br>In a mature democracy, how often does one see a cabinet minister appearing in an opposition constituency and lamenting at the conditions of the residential area, and hinting that the constituency is relegated to the back of the queue for funds because it did not vote for the ruling party?<br>Making things difficult for the opposition parties is one thing, but ultimately the government must remember that the constituents, regardless of whom they voted for, pay taxes and fulfill their obligations to society like everyone else.<br>Xiao Fuchun<br>Richmond, British Columbia<br>Canada<br></div>
