              Like many other Singaporeans, I did not participate in the protest last Saturday. Donâ€™t get me wrong. I do feel strongly about the issues. But on the day itself, I did not don my red shirt and join the ranks of brave protesters.
              
              Yes I feel guilty. And no, telling myself that I am not alone in playing truant from exercising our constitutional rights does not make me feel better. Here I feel the need to quote a â€˜greatâ€™ leeder: â€˜What to do?â€™ Should I just move on?
              
              The answer is NO.
              
              I understand, and others do too, that not everyone has the rare courage to stand up to an oppressive regime. BUT, that doesnâ€™t mean cowards like me canâ€™t do anything to help the cause. There are plenty of things we could do to help advance democracy in Singapore.
              
              Yes, without going into the streets to protest if you are too afraid to. Here are a list of things â€˜passive protestersâ€™ like us could do:
              
              1) Support SDP and other activists through donations. SDP has listed their bank account number on their website (www.singaporedemocrat.org). You can just go to the bank and deposit money into the account. Without revealing your identity too, if you are uncomfortable with the idea.
              
              The SDP and other activists sometimes hold indoor forums (which are 100% legit by the way). You may approach them during such forums and make your donation then.
              
              2) Buy Chee Soon Juanâ€™s books. You can find a list of his books on the SDP website. Currently, Kinokuniya and Select bookshop carry his books. Sometimes, during those indoor forums, they have a little stand selling the books too.
              
              Buying his books not only help them financially, it is also a good way to help spread the message of democracy. After you are done reading them, pass the books around to friends and family members. And if you are feeling generous, buy several copies of each title. Wrap them up and give them away as presents. There are too many Singaporeans out there whose minds are poisoned by the Straits Times. They deserve to hear the message of democracy too!
              
              If you are too afraid to march in the streets, surely you can support the cause by buying his books. That is the least we can do. I would also like to add that JBJâ€™s â€˜Hatchet Man of Singaporeâ€™ reveals the travesty of justice in Singapore and provides insight into the workings of a PAP controlled judiciary.
              
              3) Spread the message within the heartlands. You may have friends, neighbours and family members who believe the PAPâ€™s anti-democracy message and still have not heard the SDPâ€™s message of democracy. Talk to them! Answer their queries as best as you can.
              
              If they have questions too difficult for you to answer, show them the world of the World Wide Web. The SDP website, various forums and blogs are good sources of information not available through the PAP controlled media.
              
              4) Exercise your votes in a responsible manner. Vote Opposition! I know there are fears that votes could be traced. My answer to that is: So What? Thousands of voters voted for the SDP. Was there ever a mass arrest of thousands after the election? It has been nearly 2 years since the last election. If any individual voter was threatened or discriminated against, the forums would be rife with stories already.
              
              I can understand fears about protesting openly in defiance of police orders, but if you do not even dare to vote according to your conscience, there is no hope. No hope for you, your loved ones and democracy.

              Were you guys even there? If not, please shut up. Only the brave 20 or so protesters who were there themselves have the right to criticise me.
              
              If you were not there, let me ask you if you two are even Singaporeans? If not, then just shut up.
              
              If you are indeed Singaporeans (who were not at the protest), and who are now attacking my ideas to help the pro-democracy movement in Singapore, then you are utterly shameless.

              Someone is laughing at my idea to buy books to support Chee Soon Juan. Well, before anyone else dismiss my idea or yell 'cheap marketing stunt', let me present my case.
              
              Lately, I have taken to buying up Chee Soon Juan's books at Kinokuniya whenever he gets harassed by the authorities. I don't have the guts to go out there in public to criticise the powers that be, but I can damn well go down to kinokuniya and snap up copies of Chee Soon Juan's books to show support.
              
              I don't know if any of u would agree with me, but it seems like a good way to start a Support Democracy movement in Singapore without breaking any laws. Here's a list of reasons why...
              
              1) Chee Soon Juan's books are all about democracy and human rights in our region. If you buy surplus copies, you can give them away as presents and help spread the message.
              
              2) I am sure buying his books would help him in his campaign for democracy. Financially and good for his morale too I am sure.
              
              3) It is a form of protest that does not require any group of people to meet in public. You can go to Kinokuniya at your own time and just buy a copy or two. This way, many of his supporters who are afraid to go public can participate too! There is nothing illegal about going to Kinokuniya and buying books I am sure. Come on, I am sure even the most paranoid amongst us can walk up to Kinokuniya and buy a book. Pay by cash if you are afraid of being traced.
              
              4) This is a PR campaign for Dr Chee too. This may sound like a wild scheme, but what do you guys think of a Democracy Day or Week? During this time period, every supporter will go to Kinokuniya and buy a copy of Dr Chee's books. If it is out of stock, pester the manager to order more. If this happen within a one day or one week time frame, Dr Chee's books could become bestseller of the month at Kino! I hope his books sell more copies than Lee Kuan Yew's memoirs.
              
              Just floating this idea around. Comments and constructive criticisms welcomed.

              And this is a post I made last year some months before Christmas...
              
              There's this other bookshop at Tanglin Shopping Ctr that carries his books too, but since this is a PR campaign, I thought a big (and mainstream?) shop carrying his books in bulk would better help the cause. One of my ideas is to make his books mainstream; remove the stigma associated with his name. I mean even now I still get idiots asking me fearfully if Dr Chee's books are 'banned'... That means there are lots of people out there who never heard the message of democracy.
              
              The long term goal is for his books to become popular enough for him to be able to do a book signing (not a forum) at Kino.
              
              Many posters suggested donating money. Yes I agree with that totally! I never said I was against that idea. But let me sell my idea ...
              
              1) My idea is not just to help the SDP financially. But also to help spread the message before the next election. One word... ok, two words. Vote Swinging. You can't spread the message by donating money. I want more people to know the meaning of 'democracy'; and that it is not a dirty word. If you ever read Dr Chee's books, you will be convinced too. And I am sure others will too.
              
              2)If I am not wrong, there is a law in place that puts a cap on how much donations a political party can receive anonymously. And there are too many folks too afraid to use their real names to support the SDP. On the other hand, there's no limit to how much a person (political entity or private citizen) can make from the sales of his book! And the government would never pass such a bill. Because Lee Kuan Yew's books are doing so well in bookshops. Such a bill would affect the Man himself too!
              
              3) Christmas is coming up. The season of good will and all that. Buy Chee Soon Juan's books and give them to friends or relatives who are not 'on our side'! By 2011, we would have a batch of converts ready to vote SDP! You can't convince people simply by donating money to SDP.
              
              By all means, donate money to SDP. But I hope I made my case clear about buying Dr Chee's books to support democracy in Singapore.
              
              Some wet blanket yawned at me. hmm... If it is turnout you are worried about... Then don't have a Democracy Day. Stretch it to one week or even one month instead. Actually this is perfect. We are one month away from Christmas. What better timing could I have? Come on you fellows! Go out there and buy Dr Chee's books! Perfect gifts for Christmas! I don't care what the wet blankets on this forums think. I think the books tie in with the Christmas theme of hope (for Singaporeans at least).
              
              Another dude said the books do not appeal to Singaporeans, and if so, only the English educated ones? omg! I am a Singaporean and a Chinese educated one at that. Yes. I was in fact President of the Jing Yong fanclub during my secondary school days. I just happen to be good in English too. And I am telling you it appeals to me. Have you even read his books? They are not Anglophile in nature! It is all about the plight of Singaporeans. Home and Hearth issues you know.
              
              And so what if the press catches on and starts reporting on how a forum poster kept promoting Chee Soon Juan's books? Is that illegal? Is that illegal? Is that defamation? Is it morally wrong for a fan to promote Dr Chee's books?? eh? You tell me that!
              
              OK. Those in favour of my plan go out own time own target. Snap the books off the shelves. Democracy Month starts from now till Christmas! If they are out of stock, now would be a good time to pester the store manager to bring in fresh stock to meet the season demand. Wrap up those books pretty and hand them around come Christmas. It is sad to see only a few copies of his books on the shelves while stacks of Mr Lee Senior's memoirs are placed prominently.

              Well, the thing about freedom of speech is this: I too have the right to say 'Shut Up' to you if I don't like what I hear. Just exercising MY right to free speech. :-)
              
              The difference between me and the PAP is this: I am telling you to shut up as a private citizen. If it were the PAP doing that, you would find yourself slapped with a defamation law suit as well. Not to mention the invitations to 'coffee breaks' at the police station. And the spinning done by the mainstream media to make you look really really bad. 
              
              That's the difference between me and the PAP.
