              Thanks hloc for keeping my thread on the front page! Without your contributions, it would have become 'old news' and end up on page 2 or even 3.
              
              The silence is deafening indeed. Well... not entirely true because you have been contributing while the thread starter (yours truly) is away. 
              
              That is good news though. Because this thread is about passive protest. And the 4 ways I listed:
              
              1) Donating to SDP.
              
              2) Buying Chee Soon Juan's and JBJ's books.
              
              3) Spreading awareness within the heartlands.
              
              4) Voting for opposition
              
              Do Not include or require online activities of any kind. The 'silence' is probably due to readers going out buying books, making donations or 'missionary' work amongst their friends and family members. 
              
              Good! Get out there to Kino or Select and snap some books off the shelves! Get out there and donate money to SDP! Get out there and talk to relatives and friends!
              
              Crew
              
              PS: I have to thank hloc for posting regularly to this thread while I am away. Just imagine. If he hadn't done all that, this thread would be buried on page 2 and new visitors to the site wouldn't have seen it!

              Book Review #1
              
              "It is ... as if ... Jeyaretnam ... hurled the molotov cocktail in my direction."
              
              Goh Chok Tong
              
              Why the little terror! Hurled a molotov cocktail at our leader? But wait! Why take his words or mine for granted? Get a copy of 'The Hatchet Man of Singapore', read it and have the following questions answered!
              
              - Was there even a 'molotov cocktail' in the first place?
              
              - What IS the PAP's definition of a 'molotov cocktail'?
              
              - Can you mix a political 'molotov cocktail' of your own, using everyday Singlish?
              
              - Did opposition members bankrupt themselves through defamation law suits? Or was the ball in the PAP's kangaroo courts all along?
              
              - Did the PAP even have a case against JBJ and Tang Liang Hong in the first place?
              
              Find the answers to these questions and more in 'The Hatchet Man of Singapore'!
              
              The court transcript in the book provides hours of laughter to anyone who wants to see the PAP's 'watertight' argument shredded in court! A once in a lifetime opportunity for many of us. 
              
              *After that embarrassing episode in court, the PAP no longer allow foreign QCs to represent opposition members in court.

              Book Review #2
              
              - Is democracy an essential feature for the survival of Singapore or a luxury we cannot afford?
              
              - What IS democracy? Western concept, Asian value or the name of a theme park in USA?
              
              - How can democracy better the lives of Singaporeans? Yes, the question many Singaporeans have been asking. What has democracy and human rights got to do with 'bread and butter' issues?
              
              - Why is the CPF system in such a mess?
              
              - Why do we not have enough for retirement? Despite setting aside approximately 40% of our monthly income for the whole of our working life!
              
              - Why are we facing an invasion of 'foreign talents'? And what needs to be done?
              
              The PAP have been attacking opposition members for not focusing on 'local issues'. This blatant lie will be blown away once Singaporeans read for themselves Chee Soon Juan's insightful analysis of the 'bread and butter' issues, and the solutions he offers.
              
              In the 'Power of Courage', Chee Soon Juan explains the rationale behind his street protests in defiance of police orders.
              
              See for yourself the difference between Rule of Law and Rule by Law. And why one is essential for the survival of Singapore as a country and the other detrimental to her welfare.
              
              Is Chee Soon Juan:
              
              Right or Wrong?
              
              Reckless or Courageous?
              
              Justifiable or Unreasonable?
              
              Read 'Your Future, My Faith, Our Freedom' and 'The Power of Courage' and come to your own conclusion.
