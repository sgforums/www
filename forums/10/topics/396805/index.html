              <p>Is that they are "over-concern" about "money"...</p>
              <p>Yes,money is important,thats something undeniable.</p>
              <p>But for a person,"Health" is more important than money.Becoz without health,we cannot work,we cannot enjoy life,we even cannot enjoy sex.So,for a person,health is more important than money.</p>
              <p>But for a country,what does "Health" represent?The answer is:"Human"</p>
              <p>For a country,health represent "human".Thus,for a country leader or ministers,"human factor", "human resources",or "human itself" always come first before money.</p>
              <p>Whether your countrymen or women like the country u manage or not?Does your countrymen n women migrate at a "shocking rate"?Does ur country have enough new generation to replace the old n retire citizens?All these,represent the "Health conditions" of the country u manage!!!</p>
              <p>So,like individual human,for a country,money is important.But,"Human"(Health)is more important than money.</p>
              <p>But look at what PAP ministers behave,they treat money more important than human(health).This is where it all goes wrong!!!They laugh at Americans n Western countries or other democracy countries that they are losing money or "dont know how to manage their money".But,those countries got "Human resources" n their countrymen n women love their countries.What do our PAP have?Our countrymen n women are leaving this country at a shocking rate,n that our birth rate is low n not enough to replace the older generation?These are the "Bad health" sign for a country.</p>
              <p>In the end,our PAP government may be "rich".But like a person without "health",rich but waiting to die n left with an empty shell.</p>

              <p>The difference Jiang or Mao is that they forget to throw away the ppl who dun like them and replace with new immigrants.</p>
              <p>Yes, Singapore peoples are getting fed up with PAP, LKY and Son Co Ltd knows about it, that is why they are starting to do the renewal exericise, get rid of those old poor good for nothing singaporeans and replace by young foreigners who will listen to them and vote for them again. In another words, LKY is much more cleverer than Jiang or Mao..he studied china history too.</p>

              <p><br>no, you r wrong again, singapore peoples are nurtured in a way they feel hunger for wealth and material stuffs, and to reach it, they have to go thru a tough system of education which occupied most of their youth life, a stressful worklife of struggling to go up will takes off their concentration in politics and finally, to build a family while maintaining a high cost of living, will make them more focus on work and making money to meed end needs will completely sway them from politics.</p>
              <p>"It is only the stagnant brain that will think of revolt and start planing for a change in politics" LKY to Archibishop Yong in 1987 marxism uprising in catholic church....bishop must be too free.</p>
