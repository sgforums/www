              <p><span lang="EN-GB"><em>During the end of
                  the 1970’s into the 1980’s British Conservative Prime Minister Margaret
                  Thatcher and the City of London financial interests who backed her,
                  introduced wholesale measures of privatization, state budget cuts,
                  moves against labor and deregulation of the financial markets. </em></span></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB"><em>She did
                  so in parallel with similar moves in the USA
                  initiated by advisers around President Ronald Reagan. The claim was
                  that hard medicine was needed to curb inflation and that the bloated
                  state bureaucracy was a central problem. </em></span></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB"><em>For almost three decades,
                  Anglo-American university economic faculties have turned to Thatcherite
                  deregulation of financial markets as ‘the efficient way,’ in the
                  process, undoing many of the hard-fought gains secured for personal
                  social security, public health care and pension security of the
                  population. </em></span></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB"><em>Now the ‘poster child’ economy of the Thatcher Revolution,
                  Great Britain, is sinking like the proverbial Titanic, a testimony to
                  the incompetence of what is generally called Neo-liberalism or free
                  market ideology.</em> <span> </span></span></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB">As the Neo-liberal
                  revolution began in the economies of the USA and UK, it should not be
                  not surprising that the epi-center of catastrophe in the global crisis
                  now unfolding also lies with the economies of the USA and UK, as well
                  as a handful of economies, including Ireland Canada, Australia, New
                  Zealand and Iceland, all of which embraced the free market Thatcherite
                  agenda most strongly in recent years. </span></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB">Notably, the man who personally
                  implemented Thatcherite financial market reforms and deregulation
                  during the era of Tony Blair in Britain was Gordon Brown, then Treasury
                  Secretary. </span></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB">A sample of most recent British developments is instructive. Britain's
                  economy is about to suffer its most vicious slump since 1946, shrinking
                  by a drastic 2.8 per cent this year, according to EU latest estimates.
                  The UK is predicted to suffer the worst recession of any large European economy.</span></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB">The consequences for the UK
                  will include soaring unemployment, while the economy also teeters on
                  the brink of full-blown deflation. Unemployment will rise by more than
                  900,000 people over the next 12 months, driving the jobless total to
                  2.55 million by the end of the year, or 8.2 per cent of the workforce,
                  from 5.3 per cent at present.</span></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB">In parallel, the
                  currency, the Pound, which is not part of the Eurozone currencies, has
                  fallen dramatically against the Euro and even the US dollar in recent
                  weeks over growing fears of the collapsing UK economy and banking system. Sterling has fallen below $1.40 to its lowest point in seven and a half years because of concerns about the depth of Britain's
                  banking crisis and the Government's rising debt levels. This coming
                  year the UK Government's borrowing levels may exceed £118 billion,
                  equal to 8 per cent of GDP. </span></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB">Britain</span><span lang="EN-GB"> will not be able to reap much benefit from a lower pound for exports
                  because, as part of the Thatcher Revolution, the national economy has
                  out-sourced, de-industrialized and turned to a service economy where,
                  as in the USA, finance and banking became the motor of economic growth the past two decades. That motor has now broken. </span></p>
              <p><strong><span lang="EN-GB">Public debt soaring</span></strong></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB">Fuelled by the cost of state bank bailouts, the UK's
                  national debt is set to rise to £1.06 trillion, or 72 per cent of GDP,
                  by 2010, a sharp rise of more than 70% from present levels.</span></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB">Yesterday, the Gordon
                  Brown Government, only three months ago hailed as the place which was
                  taking effective action to control the global financial meltdown, was
                  forced to introduce yet another new bank bailout package of measures
                  designed to rescue the country's banking sector. He refused to put any
                  ceiling on the amount that he might ultimately need, creating great
                  distrust in the Brussels and across the EU.</span></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB">Combined, British banks have some $4.4 trillion of foreign liabilities. That is twice the size of the British economy. UK
                  foreign reserves are virtually nothing at $60.6 billion. Little wonder
                  that savvy currency traders and hedge funds have decided the British
                  Pound can go only one way, down. Swap markets for CDS now price in an
                  alarming 10% probability of Britain having to default on state debt obligations in the next few years as public debt explodes. </span></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB">The last time England had a default on state debt in the early 14<sup>th</sup> Century when King Edward III decided to declare default on his then
                  huge debts to the large Italian banking house of Bardi &amp; Peruzzi,
                  taking the large bank down with it and spreading ruin across Europe. </span></p>

                  Brown Government admits it does not know whether the second bank rescue
                  package it just launched will work, senior ministers admit. One
                  minister is quoted anonymously in the British press, ‘The truth is that
                  we can't be sure whether it will be effective. We have to look calm to
                  try to instil some confidence in the system. But we don't know what
                  will happen next. No one can be sure that this is the end of it. We are
                  in completely uncharted waters. The position is changing all the time.’
                  In brief, the authorities have lost control in the UK. </span></p>

                  Brown and Treasury Secretary Alistair Darling claim the second bailout
                  did not mean the first package they unveiled last October had failed.
                  That deal, they insist, was about preventing banks from going bust;
                  this one was about ensuring they had the confidence to lend to
                  businesses and the public. </span></p>

                  Government refuses to reveal how much it would cost taxpayers.
                  Officials dismissed talk of a £200bn bailout, saying some measures had
                  a low risk and figures were still being calculated. Labour backbenchers
                  conceded it would be difficult to "sell" the rescue plan to an
                  increasingly hostile public. Not surprisingly, polls have turned
                  dramatically against Labour and Brown, now showing that were elections
                  held today, the Conservative Party would win a gain over Labour of 9%
                  to 13 %. An astonishing 49% of all Brotins fear losing their job this
                  year as well.</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span lang="EN-GB">A
                  major impediment to swift and consequent Government action to contain
                  the impact of the banking crisis has been the dominance of Thatcherite
                  ideology as an almost religious dogma that permeates even Labour, where
                  Tony Blair was portrayed as a Labour version of Thatcher. The
                  ideological absurdity of the situation was underscored recently when
                  the Conservative opposition offered broad support for yesterday's
                  measures, even though their concern over soaring borrowing led them to
                  oppose the Government's £20bn fiscal stimulus designed to keep the
                  economy moving. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span lang="EN-GB"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span lang="EN-GB">As
                  well, it is clear, following the nationalization last year of Northern
                  Rock and the forced state share of 70% in the large Royal Bank of Scotland,
                  that a type of approach as that used in the early 1990’s Swedish
                  banking crisis, in which the State nationalized banks that were
                  insolvent and unable to raise private capital. Sweden
                  then split the banks into ‘good bank’ and ‘bad bank.’ In the good bank,
                  business of lending to the real economy continued unabated. The assets
                  in the bad bank, largely illiquid Swedish real estate holdings, were
                  held by the state until economic growth again allowed the government to
                  sell the assets in a healthy market. The ultimate taxpayer cost of the
                  Securum model were estimated to have been zero or even a tiny profit
                  when all costs were factored. </span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span lang="EN-GB">The
                  ideological Labour government is stubbornly refusing to admit the logic
                  of the situation, and ends up ‘cutting the dog’s tail off by inches.’
                  As certain Labour MPs call for the full nationalisation of the banks
                  the Government says that is not its goal. Chancellor Darling stated,
                  ‘We have a clear view that British banks are best managed and owned
                  commercially and not by the Government. That remains our policy.’</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span lang="EN-GB">John
                  McFall, Labour chairman of the Treasury Select Committee, who believes
                  full nationalisation of the banks is inevitable, asked Darling in
                  recent House of Commons debate <span> </span>if the
                  Government would take a 100 per cent stake in the banks if the new
                  package did not restart lending. Vince Cable, Treasury spokesman for
                  the Liberal Democrats, said, ‘The Government increasingly resembles
                  somebody who is trying to give the kiss of life to a corpse. The
                  Government now effectively controls one of the largest banks in the
                  world. It will almost certainly have to put more money in; it may well
                  acquire other banks.’ Cable had also predicted the bursting of the
                  house price and personal debt bubbles – and the nationalisation of
                  Northern Rock. </span></p>

              <p><span lang="EN-GB">The so-called
                  neo-liberal finance model which was espoused by the Thatcher government
                  after 1979 had its origins in a decision by leading Anglo-American
                  financial powers and their circle that it was time to begin a wholesale
                  clawing back of the concessions which they had granted under, as they
                  saw it, duress, during the great depression of the 1930’s and in the
                  case of Britain the postwar economic difficulties. </span></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB">The origins of the effort in the United States
                  go back to a seminal little known book by a scion of the vastly wealthy
                  Rockefeller family, the late John D. Rockefeller III, titled The Second
                  American Revolution. There, amid soporific rhetoric about creation of a
                  ‘humanistic capitalism’ he calls for drastic reduction in the role and
                  size of government in the economy. That theme was then propagated
                  through the efficient propaganda apparatus of the Rockefeller imperium,
                  aided by the economist guru of the Rockefellers’ University of Chicago, Milton Friedman. </span></p>

                  pivotal role of the manipulated oil shocks, shocks incidentally
                  manipulated and brought about by the same Rockefeller family, as I
                  detail in <em>A Century of War: Anglo-American Oil Politics</em>,
                  blamed all ills on ‘big government.’ Rockefeller protégé, Paul Volcker
