              <p>Who seriously thinks that protests and demonstrations work in the 21st Century which is beginning to flourish with "non-lethal" pain compliance weapons? Even before their development, real change that actually benefits the people was almost non-existent.</p>
              <p>If the people want to take back power, its not going to be through peaceful means. There has to be mass violence, though not fueled by murderous rage, but aimed at government (and corporate) property. Property destruction doesnt hurt people but it'll get the attention of the government as well as the rest of the country. It has to be drastic otherwise it'll just get ignored.</p>

              <p>There isn't going to be "controlled" mass violence, once it hits the mass violence stage nothing is sacred.</p>
              <p>The lines between government corporate property and private property is going to vanish. Everything's going to be free pickings in the path of the mob.</p>
              <p>The scale either tips completely to one side or stay balanced. If it reachs this point, i don't care whether the PAP or the anti PAP wins, because once the lines are crossed and things escalate it's not going to go back the way that it was.</p>
              <p>Thailand has already demostrated that.</p>

              <p>Again, because of mass ignorance. The public has no idea what should be done to achieve change. There has to be a shift away from the harmless protests to effective violence, not on the scale of the Thailand riots.</p>
              <p>Otherwise, the status quo will continue. Would you prefer that? Not shaking the boat?</p>
