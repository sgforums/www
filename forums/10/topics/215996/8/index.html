How we view the poor, the less talented, the less successful Singaporean is coloured by this misguided understanding of meritocracy.<br><br>A few years ago, during the recession, some students from an elite JC participated in a dialogue with union leaders and caused a furore with his remarks. Apparently, the student said something to the effect that workers who lost their jobs and were unemployed were simply too lazy or unwilling to upgrade their skills. A union leader took umbrage at these remarks. Some observers later pointed out that the student had misunderstood what it meant for Singapore to call itself a meritocratic society.</div></blockquote>Personally i dun think Singapore is practicing meritocracy at all. One of the first criteria for meritocracy is a fair playing field. Just look at the educational system. The materials the good school like RI, RJ, HCJC received are often better than schools like IJ PJ of YJ. U dont even have equal exposure so how can one say its a level playing field?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>At the age of 18, I think she should be mature enough not to write in such a rude, condescending and arrogant manner. An argument is made so that both parties would gain a better understanding of the issue. It's purpose is NOT for parties to insult each other or to make themselves feel intellectually or morally superior than the other. It's hard to have a rational and civil discussion when the argument is written in a way that provokes alot of hatred and anger. It will detract the focus on the issue itself and place more focus on the messenger and the way it was presented instead. With that said, however, when I do a self-analysis of myself, I find it hypocritical of me if I were to criticize Miss Wee's views when I share more of her views than that of Mr Derek's.<br><br>*puts on flame retardant suit*<br><br>When I bought my Creative mp3 player, I didn't buy it because it was made from a local company. I bought it because it was cheaper and had more features that I liked. So if a foreign company produced a better product, I would choose that one. And if Ms Wee's personality is a reflection of the behavior of local highly-educated females, then I think it is ok for Singaporean males to marry down or to marry foreign women. You can't force people to choose local women or women of a certain age. Even if you think it is wrong, the one that is criticized should the person or society not the government.<br><br>Most importantly of course, is that I am a huge EPL fan. I don't support local soccer. My favorite club is Arsenal, a team that is made up of players from all over the world and whose management only offers a 1-year contract to players above 30. As a result talented players like Robert Pires and Patrick Viera has left. But on the other hand, it allowed younger talent like Cesc Fabregas, Van Persie and Theo Walcott to blossom. However, I do think that a right mix of experience and youth is vital to the team. Young Walcott can learn alot from Captain Henry even though Henry is not English. I think it is ok to discriminate against age depending on what job it is. You don't really want a coach that is too young or player that is too old.<br><br>Wenger has changed Arsenal's football from the traditional English long ball to a more attacking minded,  attractive passing football. He has also instilled practices that are non-English. No more improper diets or heavy drinking. The foreign players has also learnt from the English player's physical, never-give-up attitude. Wenger has been criticized for not fielding more English players but the local English players are overpriced. Carrick for 18.6m pounds? That's crazy. Furthermore, if you look at Ashley Cole, just because they are English does not mean that they are more loyal.<br><br>So how do you solve the problem of English players not being able to get into the 1st team? Do you blame the foreign players or do you look at the youth system to see why the English players are not as technically gifted as their foreign counterparts? Why are very few English players playing overseas? Sure, the FA can make it a requirement for teams to field lots more English players. But that would make EPL less of a success and make it hard for English clubs to compete in the Champions League. So, really, a more appropriate title for Mr Derek's argument would be the Future of Singaporeans because the Future of Singapore will be bright.</div>

Like taking public transport, you will never feel the pinch of a 'minor' price hike unless you are a regular. How could high-paying ministers possibly comprehend the dissent of the people by driving to work daily?<br><br>That is basically the downside of her argument. Coming from a well-to-do home, having food on the table and going to elite schools, she hasn't yet endured the hardships of fighting for a rice bowl, nor humbly writing in for job interviews and not getting picked.<br><br>To her credit, she did admit to that; so really the question is why she would suddenly go on a tirade of lambasting Derek Wee over a couple of general comments that have been the earful of every govt minister on a daily basis?<br><br>Complaints to level the playing field, more opportunities for the people and changing the presiding 'elitist' mindset is not new, and Derek Wee is hardly the first person to enlighten us on this fact.<br><br>With such a blossoming start to her teritiary education, she is likely to have that 'red carpet' treatment for her future career. Thus before actually interacting with 'middle class whiners', she shouldn't take it upon herself to pass sweeping remarks that do nothing other than to serve their own ego. True, in any society, democracy and communism, there will also be a certain proportion of dissenters; communism works for the poor masses, true democracy champions capitalism and meritocracy.<br><br>While each has its merits, the trick is to manoeuvre so that you can find that niche for yourself. Complaining because others have done better than yourself will only serve to ignore your own weaknesses and eventually compound your own self-inflicted misery.<br><br>Put it simply, if we as a people spend less time complaining about the things to which we already have the answers, then the focus on REAL problems can be adequately addressed. </div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by kheldorin:<br>[b]At the age of 18, I think she should be mature enough not to write in such a rude, condescending and arrogant manner. An argument is made so that both parties would gain a better understanding of the issue. It's purpose is NOT for parties to insult each other or to make themselves feel intellectually or morally superior than the other. It's hard to have a rational and civil discussion when the argument is written in a way that provokes alot of hatred and anger. It will detract the focus on the issue itself and place more focus on the messenger and the way it was presented instead. With that said, however, when I do a self-analysis of myself, I find it hypocritical of me if I were to criticize Miss Wee's views when I share more of her views than that of Mr Derek's.<br><br></blockquote>She wrote that piece in her blog (i.e. diary). Of course the blog is opened for everyone to read.However, there are quite many ppl speak like her in the internet.</div>
