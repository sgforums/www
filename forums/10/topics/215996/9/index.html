Best is to sue.<br><br>Ms Wee Shu Min said, "i am inclined - too much, perhaps - to dismiss such people as crackpots. <strong>stupid crackpots</strong>. <strong>the sadder class</strong>. too often singaporeans - both the neighborhood poor and the red-taloned socialites - kid themselves into believing that our society, like most others, is compartmentalized by breeding. ridiculous. we are a tyranny of the capable and the clever, and the only other class is the complement.<br><br>dear derek is one of many <strong>wretched</strong>, <strong>undermotivated</strong>, <strong>overassuming leeches</strong> in our country, and in this world. <strong>one of those who would prefer to be unemployed</strong> and wax lyrical about how his myriad talents are being abandoned for the foreigner's, instead of earning a decent, stable living as a sales assistant. it's not even about being a road sweeper. these <strong>&amp;$$!bags </strong>don't want anything without "manager" and a name card."<br><br>As a good citizen, Mr Wee must sue. If he doesn't sue, it means that must be some truth in that he is a crackpot, undermotivated and will prefer to be unemployed and will prefer to "<strong>be friggin communist</strong>".<br><br>You think this is the US of A ah, suka suka insult people?
