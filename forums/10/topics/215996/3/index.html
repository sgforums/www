            <div class='col-md body'>The Wee girl is too young to know what Derek described in his blog. Afterall, she hasn't entered the workforce and don't understand the corporate life. It's not something that RJC or her father can teach her now. Time will be her teacher. Maybe she'll do well in school and be mediocre in her working life.<br><br>Sometimes, when you're successful, as Wee is, you get deluded by your moment of glory and you'd think it's all due to talent or hard work. Actually, luck plays a part. If English and Chinese weren't the criteria to win the PM Book Prize but it's soccer skills and cooking skills, Wee won't be an "elite". There's no reason why an academic elite will do better than a sports elite or culinary elite. Success skills in life are not clear cut.<br><br>Derek correctly points out that life is gamble. However, we are a nation of gamblers and we also fancy our chances. There's nothing to be afraid and I won't want to always turn to the PAP to solve our problems. PAP is not as omnipotent as some believe. They can't solve all our problems.</div>

That would actually be a good thing (writing with a purpose) if not for the fact that you chose not to stick to your words. Prithee, it did not seem that obvious that you did not think it had some cogency and that you intended it to be a scathing criticism of the blog you attacked. I would think a good rhetorical analysis of your post would reveal otherwise.<br><br>Shall I break down your mistakes, comrade?<br><br>Firstly, "distress" is terribly euphemistic and impertinent to the matter at hand. We are not distressed as much as we are incensed.<br><br>Secondly, you contrasted a noun abstraction with a verb "to vent frustrations" versus "public denouncement" - this is a rhetorical error. A more effective writer would continue the use of the infinitive.<br><br>Thirdly, a gross mistake was your misuse (and misconjugation) of the preterite for the verb "arise". "Arise" is a class I strong Germanic verb, do pay attention to the use of Indo-European ablaut. "arose" is a preterite; "arisen" is the past participle you are looking for.<br><br>Fourthly, "in irony" is awkward; "ironically" is the word you are looking for. But that is not surprising, considering that you like to hide yourself behind noun abstractions, and also omit grammatical articles to try to achieve this effect. I suggest you read George Orwell's "Politics and the English Language". You desperately need it.<br><br>You think you're superior because you think you may have (that's modal subjunctive to you) a superior command of English than most Singaporeans. You think you're a language genius and have the edge - but you can't even distinguish between the preterite and particple Germanic ablauts of English, because you think the preterite "-oh" vowel will give you the strong past tense you are looking for. How can you survive lah?<br><br>You talk about irony, but oh the irony! </blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Why do so many people say that the education system is fair? I think it's not.<br><br>If a student is from a good primary school, it is most likely that the student will go to a good secondary school, then a good JC, and finally a good Uni. Am I right?<br><br>Therefore, a student's life is <span style="font-style: italic;">generally </span>determined by his or her primary school.<br><br>Our education system is such that admission into a good primary school is as follows:<br><br><blockquote>Phase 1: For a child who has a sibling studying in the school of choice.<br><br>Phase 2A1: For a child whose parent is a former student of the school and who has joined the alumni association as a member not later than 30 Jun 2005; or whose parent is a member of the School Advisory/Management Committee.<br><br>Phase 2A2: For a child whose parent or sibling has studied in the school of choice; or whose parent is a staff member of the school of choice.<br><br>Phase 2B: For a child whose parent has joined the school as a parent volunteer not later than 1 July 2005 and has given at least 40 hours of voluntary service to the school by 30 June 2006; or whose parent is a member of the church/clan directly connected with the school; or whose parent is endorsed as an active community leader.<br><br>Phase 2C: For a child who is ineligible for or unsuccessful in earlier phases.<br><br>(This is taken from MOE's website - http://www.moe.gov.sg/esp/schadm/p1/phases.htm)<br></blockquote>In this case, isn't it easier for children with rich parents / parents from some elite group to enter a good primary school (e.g. RGS), and therefore end up with an even better life?<br></div>
