            <div class='col-md body'>Some of us have read the commentary, Future of Singapore, by Derek Wee, a 35 year old Singaporean. The commentary has made its rounds in cyberspace and is reproduced below for those who might not have come across it yet.<br><br>The purpose of this thread is to highlight a response to Derek Wee's commentary from a very bright RJC girl. The response is taken from her blog. She shares the same surname as Derek. Her academic achievements are impressive. She was from the elite gifted program at RGS who went on to top Singapore in the GCE 'O'-levels in 2004. She also won the Prime Minister's Book Prize for purportedly being effectively bilingual in Chinese and English (even though she often expresses her disdain for the Chinese language). And she is fluent in French. Her dad is one of the men-in-white. Naturally, hers is a highly affluent and privileged background. And without doubt too, hers is the perfect pedigree for joining the ranks of the highest echelons of the government.<br><br>Reproduced below are firstly, Ms Wee's response to Derek Wee's commentary and secondly, the original commentary by Derek Wee.<br><br>*************************<br>From Ms Wee's blog:<br><br>http://www.suchvividnothing.blogspot.com/<br><br>Thursday, October 19, 2006<br><br>mom's friend sent her some blog post by some bleeding stupid 40-year old singaporean called derek wee (WHY do all the idiots have my surname why?!) whining about how singapore is such an insecure place, how old ppl (ie, 40 and above) fear for their jobs, how the pool of foreign "talent" (dismissively chucked between inverted commas) is really a tsunami that will consume us all (no actually he didn't say that, he probably said Fouren Talern Bery Bad.), how the reason why no one wants kids is that they're a liability in this world of fragile ricebowls, how the government really needs to save us from inevitable doom but they aren't because they are stick-shoved-up-ass elites who have no idea how the world works, yadayadayadayada.<br><br>i am inclined - too much, perhaps - to dismiss such people as crackpots. stupid crackpots. the sadder class. too often singaporeans - both the neighborhood poor and the red-taloned socialites - kid themselves into believing that our society, like most others, is compartmentalized by breeding. ridiculous. we are a tyranny of the capable and the clever, and the only other class is the complement.<br><br>sad derek attracted more than 50 comments praising him for his poignant views, joining him in a chorus of complaints that climax at the accusation of lack of press freedom because his all-too-true views had been rejected by the straits times forum. while i tend to gripe about how we only have one functioning newspaper too, i think the main reason for its lack of publication was that his incensed diatribe was written in pathetic little scraps that passed off as sentences, with poor spelling and no grammar.<br><br>derek, derek, derek darling, how can you expect to have an iron ricebowl or a solid future if you cannot spell?<br><br>if you're not good enough, life will kick you in the balls. that's just how things go. there's no point in lambasting the government for making our society one that is, i quote, "far too survival of fittest". it's the same everywhere. yes discrimination exists, and it is sad, but most of the time if people would prefer hiring other people over you, it's because they're better. it's so sad when people like old derek lament the kind of world that singapore will be if we make it so uncertain. go be friggin communist, if uncertainty of success offends you so much - you will certainly be poor and miserable. unless you are an arm-twisting commie bully, which, given your whiny middle-class undereducated penchant, i doubt.<br><br>then again, it's easy for me to say. my future isn't certain but i guess right now it's a lot brighter than most people's. derek will read this and brand me as an 18-year old elite, one of the sinners who will inherit the country and run his stock to the gutter. go ahead. the world is about winners and losers. it's only sad when people who could be winners are marginalised and oppressed. is dear derek starving? has dear derek been denied an education? has dear derek been forced into child prostitution? has dear derek had his clan massacred by the government?<br><br>i should think not. dear derek is one of many wretched, undermotivated, overassuming leeches in our country, and in this world. one of those who would prefer to be unemployed and wax lyrical about how his myriad talents are being abandoned for the foreigner's, instead of earning a decent, stable living as a sales assistant. it's not even about being a road sweeper. these shitbags don't want anything without "manager" and a name card.<br><br>please, get out of my elite uncaring face.<br><br>posted at 12:08 PM<br><br>*******************************<br><br>Derek Wee's original commentary which prompted Ms Wee's response above.<br><br>By Derek Wee<br>Oct 12, 2006<br><br>When I read the Straits Times article (dated 24 Sep) on PM Lee calling the young to be committed and make a difference to Singapore, I have so much thought about the issue.<br><br>I am 35 years old, graduated from University and gainfully employed in a multinational company. But I cannot help but feel insecure over the future of Singapore. Lets face it, it's not uncommon to hear, "when you are above 40, you are over the hill".<br><br>The government has been stressing on re-training, skills upgrading and re-adapt. The fact is, no matter how well qualified or adaptable one is, once you hit the magical 40, employers will say, "you are simply too old".<br><br>We have been focusing our resources and problem solving on low unskilled labour. But in reality, our managerial positions and skilled labour force are actually fast losing its competitiveness.<br><br>I travel around the region frequently for the past 10 years. It didn't take me long to realise how far our neighbours have come over the past decade.<br><br>They have quality skilled workers, and are less expensive. When I work with them, their analytical skills are equally good, if not better than us.<br><br>It's not new anymore. Taxi drivers are fast becoming "too early to retire, too old to work" segment of the society. I like to talk to taxi drivers whenever I am heading for the airport.<br><br>There was this driver. Eloquent and well read. He was an export manager for 12 years with an MNC. Retrenched at 40 years old. He had been searching for a job since his retrenchment.<br><br>Although he was willing to lower his pay expectations, employers were not willing to lower their prejudice. He was deemed too old. I wouldn't be surprised if we have another No. 1; having the most highly educated taxi drivers in the world.<br><br>On PM Lee calling the young to be committed and make a difference. Look around us. How dedicated can we be to Singapore when we can visualise what's in store for us after we turned 40? Then again, how committed are employers to us? But we can't blame them. They have bottom lines &amp; shareholders' gain to answer to.<br><br>Onus is really on the government to revamp the society. A society that is not a pressure cooker. A society that does not mirror so perfectly, what survival of the fittest is.<br><br>But a society, where it's people can be committed, do their best and not having to fear whether they will still wake up employed tomorrow. Sadly, Singapore does not offer such luxuries and security anymore.<br><br>On the issue of babies. The government encourages us to pro-create. The next generation is essential in sustaining our competitive edge. Then again, the current market condition is such that our future has become uncertain. There is no more joy in having babies anymore; they have become more of a liability. It's really a chicken and egg issue.<br><br>Many of my peers, bright and well educated have packed up and left. It's what MM Goh called "quitters". It's sad but true, Singapore no longer is a place where one can hope to work hard their lives and retire graciously. It's really the push factor.<br><br>A future is something we sweat it out, build and call our own. Unfortunately, people like me, mid 30's going on 40's, staying put by choice or otherwise, we can't help but feel what lies ahead is really a gamble.<br><br>To PM Lee and the Ministers, we are on a different platform. Until you truly understand our insecurity, the future of Singapore to me remains a question mark.<br><br>Note: the blog had been been closed</div>

Not mad at you but frustrated at how this world works.<br><br>The Rich gets richer and the Poor gets screwed.</div></blockquote>What is the definition of success my friend? Financial well-being?<br><br>"The rich get richer and the poor gets screwed" - this statement gives rise to two plausible suggestions - both of which bear reference and have direct connection to time (period).<br><br>1) The man who is rich, gets richer, and the man who is poor, gets poorer.<br><br>With this definition, you have to ask, why? Is it because the rich man is just more capable, luckier or etc. etc. - This can't be helped, and yes indeed, the world should not work this way, but still ..<br><br>2) The son of the rich man, gets richer, and the son of the poor man, gets poorer.<br><br>With this definition, you have to ask again, why? The answer becomes apparent. This has nothing to do with luck, capability or such.<br><br>This has purely got to do with effort. The poor man's son HAS NOT, and NEVER WILL BE, deprived of a chance and opportunity to receive an education in Singapore. Considering that he is already at the bottom, the poor man's son has only one way to go, and that is up. If he does well in school, there is no reason why he should be deprived of work.<br><br>Sure, nobody is born equal - but I sure don't buy that argument that somebody is stupid simply because he is born that way. Everyone receives the same education - depending on the amount of effort put in, results will vary. Intellectual capability can be cultivated. Nobody is stupid simply because their "brian was partially d.o.a.".<br><br>If the poor man's son out-does his father. Then the poor have not gotten poorer - and I know many people like that. People who have gone way beyond what their parents ever achieved.<br><br>If the poor man's son does not out do his father - he has obviously not worked hard enough despite the fact he has been given reasonable opportunity and access to an unbiased, unrestricted and undiscriminating education system.<br><br>The rich man's son on the other hand. Sure he'll get through life faster and easier than the poor man's son. BUT, if he does not out do his father, the rich cannot be said to have gotten richer, because their increment in pecuniary wealth would have shrunk. Furthermore, when you're already at the top, it's really much easier to go sliding down to the bottom.<br><br>We all have to work for what we want.<br><br>Connections count, but trust me, they are given WAY too much credit than they really deserve. You can have someone to put you in a position of advantage, but that person will not live forever - if you are incompetent, you will somehow find your own way to the bottom.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sad Ms Wee got her ideas from reading MM Lee's biography. Something about the strong shall inherit Singapore and the weak can all go and die.<br><br>Unfortunately for Singapore, Ms Wee doesn't have a clue how it's like to live below the middle income family and will probably not have a chance to appreciate it; thanks to Daddy's fat pay check.<br><br>An even wiser man once said, "Those who are born to privilege bears a responsibility to society. Those who fail to understand this will see their fortune dwindle within 3 generations."<br><br>I pity Ms Wee. She has been blessed and given the best that life and education can offer. However, she has been deprive the knowledge of humility, love of a fellow human being and thus, will probably end up successful monetary wise but fail miserably in life and marriage.<br><br>She'll probably laugh at this posting and the forumers here but that fact is that we couldn't care less. We will lend her a helping hand when she at the lowest point of her life and give her hope but till then; I hope for her sake that a miracle will happen in her life.</div>
