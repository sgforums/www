Is it because the rich man is just more capable, luckier or etc. etc. - This can't be helped, and yes indeed, the world should not work this way, but still ..<br><br>2) The son of the rich man, gets richer, and the son of the poor man, gets poorer.<br><br>With this definition, you have to ask again, why? The answer becomes apparent. This has nothing to do with luck, capability or such.<br><br>This has purely got to do with effort. The poor man's son HAS NOT, and NEVER WILL BE, deprived of a chance and opportunity to receive an education in Singapore. Considering that he is already at the bottom, the poor man's son has only one way to go, and that is up. If he does well in school, there is no reason why he should be deprived of work.<br><br>Sure, nobody is born equal - but I sure don't buy that argument that somebody is stupid simply because he is born that way. Everyone receives the same education - depending on the amount of effort put in, results will vary. Intellectual capability can be cultivated. Nobody is stupid simply because their "brian was partially d.o.a.".<br><br>If the poor man's son out-does his father. Then the poor has not gotten poorer - and I know many people like that. People who have gone way beyond what their parents ever achieved.<br><br>If the poor man's son does not out do his father - he has obviously not worked hard enough despite the fact he has been given reasonable opportunity and access to an unbiased, unrestricted and undiscriminating education system.<br><br>We all have to work for what we want. </div></blockquote>Yes of course there're people who were poor and succeeded. There're even more examples of rich people who had connections and succeeded.<br><br>The fact of life still remains. It's quite a huge feat to jump right out of your social class in just one generation.<br><br>Your view is ideal but not reflective of reality. How about parents who can't afford to send their kids to extra-lessons to gain that little bit of extra edge? Where do you think that RJC gal got to learn her French? All these add in.<br><br>Now, think of the poor. Do you think you can study in a cramped 3-bedroom HDB flat where you have to share with 5 other sibings? Do you think you can afford to hire tutors when you're falling behind in a subject? Do you think it's easy when you have to help out your parents after school?<br><br>Yes, meritocracy is an ideal system but it's still flawed. We still need to look out for those who might be weaker.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Before i see the picture i thought of spanking here. But after seeing it hell no.<br><br>A government job is not limited to purely economic growth. Part of it is to take care of the people who are not as well off or relativly deprive. Obviously the government is not doing well in terms of income ensuring equality. There is also virtualy no safety net for the people when they besome unemploy or to prevent them from being exploited. Singapore does not have any minimum wage rate policy or any regarding how much a employer has to pay in order to retrench an employee. Even an 18 yr old like me worries abt such thing. Being fed with a silver spoon spare her from such troubles.<br><br>How i envy her for coming from a prestigious family. Well they say u gain some u lose some.

Majority who were not able to secure a scholarship are doomed to slave their life away for some companies.<br><br>Has the government done more than enough to provide a foundation for all?

It prepares most for the harsh reality that is the working world. Indeed, college admissions would change dramatically if certain subjects were made compulsory - however, the education system should not revolve around the individual, but the standard that is required to propel the nation into global success.<br><br>I disagree with a multitude of government policies - especially regarding employment and FT. However, with regards to education, because of the mouldability of young Singaporeans, and the fact that uniformity and consistency has always been a foremost issue behind multiple legislative policies, I feel that the education system is one of the Singapore's greatest strengths. No doubt, we produce a hell load of annoying elitists, but truth is, those that survive the tribulations and demands of the education system generally go on to do relatively well because the education system effectively prepares many to enter the workforce.</div>

Her apology is like a LKY's apology. Her "i apologise if i have distressed you" sounds like LKY.<br>i guess her attitudes maybe influence by people around her. I wont be surprised if people around her think the same. They are probably more politically savvy than her and will only make such comments in private.</div>

From my observation, one form of discrimination that has been separating the rich and rest has been the subject English. I have seen many middle class kids do well, but they do not score well in English because they speak Chinese at home.
