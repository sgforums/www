            <div class='col-md body'>If I were born in a family like that...I think I would also be like that as its the parent's upbringing which is important. Though I'm from a middle-income family and I have to work part-time to pay own bills and allowance, I do not complain as I feel that I've been blessed with good health and an able body. So what if she's an elite, put her in the working world with nobody to look after her, I don't think she can survive more then a week before crawling back to her parents. Personally speaking, it all boils down to the parents' upbringing of the child. I'm thankful that my parents have brought me up with humility and that no matter how down and out we may be, me must always preserve our dignity.<br><br>But then again, such values are no longer valued in this "Hi-Bye!" society which we live in today.

Does it not strike anyone as odd that an 18-year-old student should presume to dictate the rules of life to a 40-year old person?  What challenges has young Miss Wee surmounted that she sees fit to declare herself the arbiter of the working man's philosophy?<br><br>Surely by the way she writes, one would have expected her to have singlehandedly acquired her third job after retrenchment, serviced a mortgage, raised a few children and come out of the other end smelling of roses and smiling like a champion.<br><br>But, whoops, what's the reality here?  More realistically speaking, her greatest achievement would lie somewhere between getting five percent more on<br><br>an examination result that nobody besides her parents would care about, or perhaps the final conquest of acne.<br><br>The simple fact is, for all of her meanderings (her writing may be grammatically correct, but I'm hard-pressed to call it articulate), how much of it is original thought?  After all, she could simply be parroting Daddy Dearest's whinges about the lazy nation over the dinner table, could she not?<br><br>Let's not cast any aspersions on her character.  After all, we don't know if she could survive Stage 3 pancreatic cancer with a wink and a smile, or if a hangnail could have her screaming blue murder.<br><br>Let's focus on the facts instead.  The facts bear out that with little firsthand knowledge of anything beyond school life, she presumes to tell the working man how to live, and that should life be hard, it's entirely his fault.<br><br>The simple conclusion is that she's ignorant - no more, no less.</div></blockquote>Ged, something I posted in the other thread about this issue. Have to agree that she's just an ignorant, arrogant twit.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">"She lacks the substance to even walk on the same path as those Rhodes Scholars or the fine men and women who work in the Peace Corps/Oxfam/Name-Your-NGO here.<br><br>All she has is an inflated sense of ego and hubris, and when she really travels the world and sees reality for herself, she'll realise her little bubble is just a little bubble.I've no time for people like her, and sometimes, it's so amusing to see a "princess" rant and yell, and I'd fold my arms and eat my popcorn for puerile entertainment.<br><br>Not everyday you see inflated clowns prick themselves in the foot and trip over the circus conductor's rostrum. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>(PS: She could learn a lot about being a more graceful person from Gayle Goh. It doesn't mean that wealth will make you a snooty upstart who makes Paris Hilton, the typical girl-next-door in Toa Payoh or Hougang) "</span><br><br></div>
