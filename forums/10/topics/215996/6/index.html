That's simply being way out of touch with reality.<br><br>The fact of the matter is that, whether Wee Sr likes it or not, the government is charged with managing the economy, and the manifestation of the economy for Derek and all your other men on the street is how secure they feel in their ability to put food on the table.  If the people do not feel they can do so, the government is doing something wrong.  Young Miss Wee's little temper tantrum in no way covers up for her father's (and his poker buddies') failings.<br><br>Therefore, regardless of the presentation of the message, the substance of little Miss Wee's message is in itself wrong, and she needs to be called on that point, if nothing else.</div>

If uncertainty of success offends you so much, you will certainly be poor and miserable.'<br><br>She concluded by telling Mr Wee to 'get out of my elite uncaring face'<br><br>Her attack was criticised by hundreds of Internet users, who accused her of being elitist, naive and insensitive to the lives of Singaporeans from humbler backgrounds.<br><br>Though she has shut down her blog, her entry has been replicated on many websites and the issue is hotly debated.<br><br>Technorati, a website that tracks the activity of blogs, yesterday listed 'Wee Shu Min' as its third most frequent search term.<br><br><strong><span class="large">Mr Wee Siew Kim said he stood by his daughter's 'basic point', but added: 'As a parent, I may not have inculcated the appropriate level of sensitivity, but she has learnt a lesson</span></strong>.'In his statement, RJC principal Winston Hodge said:<br><br>'We are disappointed with Wee Shu Min's comments on Mr Derek Wee's posting on the Web. 'We have counselled Shu Min and have conveyed to her the importance of sensitivity and empathy, qualities that she should have exercised in her response to Mr Wee.<br><br>'We are confident that she has learnt from this experience and will be the wiser for it.'<br><br>- Straits Times, 24 Oct 2006<br><br>My English is poor.

Instead of insulting a religion or a particular race, his daughter is only insulting everyone else who is not in their elite class.<br><br>Hmm... wonder which has a larger audience.<br><br>Beside, when you insult a race/religion, it is seditious as you turn one race/religion against another. How can the weak and useless normal Singaporean turn against the elite class? Therefore, not seditious lor.</div>

Should it be a private blog, there would be no search results from google, or even google cache (I tried this afew times, but not sure if it works for every private blog). But since google is able to draw search results, it meant that it isn't a private blog. What's more, even if the blog was private, it doesn't warrants such an insensitive article.<br><br>I quote an example. If I had a private blog. Does that warrant me to rant against a person i dislike and call such a person names? Certainly no, i could be facing a libel suit  if that person decides to take action.<br><br>However I hope, the government would not sidetrack due to this issue.
