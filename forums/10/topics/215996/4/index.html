I think it's not.<br><br>If a student is from a good primary school, it is most likely that the student will go to a good secondary school, then a good JC, and finally a good Uni. Am I right?<br><br>In this case, isn't it easier for children with rich parents / parents from some elite group to enter a good primary school (e.g. RGS), and therefore end up with an even better life?<br></div></blockquote>If you tell me that the rich take simpler and easier tests, or that they have a quota set aside for them in uni (a la bumiputra policies) that would be unfair. The top president scholar from my cohort took the RGS/RJC route, but her dad was a taxi driver. She was not unlike any other street punks i know; smoking drinking etc, but she also knew how to work within the system.<br><br>there is nothing that is preventing the disadvantaged from achieving the exact same success.</div>

Given her "background", I don't see why the local gossip papers will want to take up this issue. Even XiaXue and Mr.Brown not talking about this.
