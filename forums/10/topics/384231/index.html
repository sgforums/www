              <h1>The Charade Of Meritocracy</h1>
              <h2>by Michael D. Barr </h2>
              <p><strong> The legitimacy of</strong> the Singaporean government is predicated on the idea of a 
              meritocratic technocracy. A tiny number of career civil servants play a leading 
              role in setting policy within their ministries and other government-linked 
              bureaucracies, leading both an elite corps of senior bureaucrats, and a much 
              larger group of ordinary civil servants. Virtually all of the elite members of 
              this hierarchy are "scholars," which in 
              Singapore parlance means they won competitive, bonded government 
              scholarships–the established route into the country's elite.</p>
              <p class="BodyTextIndent" style="text-indent: 0in;">Scholars not only lead 
              the Administrative Service, but also the military's officer corps, as well as 
              the executive ranks of statutory boards and government-linked companies (GLCs). 
              Movement between these four groups is fluid, with even the military officers 
              routinely doing stints in the civilian civil service. Together with their 
              political masters, most of whom are also scholars, they make up the software for 
              the entity commonly known as "Singapore Inc."–a labyrinth of GLCs, statutory 
              boards and ministries that own or manage around 60% of 
              Singapore's economy.</p>
              <p class="BodyTextIndent" style="text-indent: 0in;">The basis of the 
              scholars' mandate to govern is not merely their performance on the job, but also 
              the integrity of the process that selected them. The educational system is 
              designed to cultivate competition, requiring top students to prove themselves 
              every step of the way. 
              Singapore's 
              schools first stream students into elite classes after Primary 3 and 4. They 
              then compete for entry into special secondary schools and junior colleges, 
              before vying for government and government-linked scholarships to attend the 
              most prestigious universities around the world.</p>
              <p class="BodyTextIndent" style="text-indent: 0in;">These scholarships 
              typically require several years of government service after graduation, and the 
              scholars are drafted into the Administrative Service, the officer corps of the 
              Singapore Armed Forces (SAF), or the career track of a statutory board or GLC. 
              The government insists that all Singaporeans have equal opportunities to excel 
              in the system, and that everyone who has made it to the top did so purely by 
              academic talent and hard work. Other factors such as gender, socioeconomic 
              background and race supposedly play no more than a marginal role, if they are 
              acknowledged as factors at all.</p>
              <p class="BodyTextIndent" style="text-indent: 0in;">On the point of race, 
              the 
              Singapore government has long prided itself on having instituted a system of 
              multiracialism that fosters cultural diversity under an umbrella of national 
              unity. This is explicitly supposed to protect the 23% of the population who 
              belong to minority races (mainly ethnic Malays and Indians) from discrimination 
              by the Chinese majority.</p>
              <p class="BodyTextIndent" style="text-indent: 0in;">But this system 
              conceals several unacknowledged agendas. In our forthcoming book, <em> Constructing </em><em> Singapore: Elitism, Ethnicity and the Nation-Building Project</em>, Zlatko Skrbi 
              and I present evidence that the playing field is hardly level. In fact, 
              Singapore's system of promotion disguises and even facilitates tremendous biases 
              against women, the poor and non-Chinese. Singapore's administrative and its 
              political elites–especially the younger ones who have come through school in the 
              last 20 or so years–are not the cream of Singapore's talent as they claim, but 
              are merely a dominant social class, resting on systemic biases to perpetuate 
              regime regeneration based on gender, class and race.</p>
              <p class="BodyTextIndent" style="text-indent: 0in;">At the peak of the 
              system is the network of prestigious government scholarships. Since independence 
              in 1965, the technique of using government scholarships to recruit cohorts of 
              scholars into the administrative and ruling elite has moved from the periphery 
              of Singaporean society to center stage. Even before independence, a makeshift 
              system of government and Colombo Plan scholarships sent a few outstanding 
              scholars overseas before putting them into government service, including most 
              notably former Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong. Yet as late as 1975 this system had 
              contributed only two out of 14 members of 
              Singapore's cabinet. Even by 1985, only four out of 12 cabinet ministers were 
              former government scholars.</p>
              <p class="BodyTextIndent" style="text-indent: 0in;">By 1994, however, the 
              situation had changed beyond recognition, with eight out of 14 cabinet ministers 
              being ex-scholars, including Prime Minister Goh. By 2005 there were 12 
              ex-scholars in a Cabinet of 19. Of these, five had been SAF scholars, including 
              Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong. A perusal of the upper echelons of the ruling 
              elite taken more broadly tells a similar story. In 1994, 12 of the 17 permanent 
              secretaries were scholars, as were 137 of the 210 in the administrative-officer 
              class of the Administrative Service.</p>
              <p class="BodyTextIndent" style="text-indent: 0in;">The government 
              scholarship system claims to act as a meritocratic sieve–the just reward for 
              young adults with talent and academic dedication. If there is a racial or other 
              bias in the outcomes, then this can only be the result of the uneven 
              distribution of talent and academic application in the community. As Prime 
              Minister Lee Hsien Loong put it when he spoke on national television in May 
              2005, "We are a multiracial society. We must have tolerance, harmony.  And you 
              must have meritocracy  so everybody feels it is fair." His father, former 
              Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, was making the same point when, in 1989, he told 
              Singapore's Malay community that they "must learn to compete with everyone else" 
              in the education system.</p>
              <p class="BodyTextIndent" style="text-indent: 0in;">Yet if 
              Singapore's meritocracy is truly a level playing field, as the Lees assert, then 
              the Chinese must be much smarter and harder working than the minority Indians 
              and Malays. Consider the distribution of the top jobs in various arms of the 
              Singapore government service in the 1990s (based on research conducted by Ross 
              Worthington in the early 2000s):</p>
              <p class="BodyTextIndent" style="text-indent: -27.75pt; margin-left: 41.75pt;">•
              Of the top 30 
              GLCs only two (6.7%) were chaired by non-Chinese in 1991 (and neither of the 
              non-Chinese was a Malay).</p>
              <p class="BodyTextIndent" style="text-indent: -27.75pt; margin-left: 41.75pt;">Of the 38 people who were represented on the most 
              GLC boards in 1998, only two (5.3%) were non-Chinese (and 
              neither of the non-Chinese was a Malay).</p>
              <p class="BodyTextIndent" style="text-indent: -27.75pt; margin-left: 41.75pt;">Of the 78 "core people" on statutory boards and 
              GLCs in 1998, seven (9%) were non-Chinese (and one of the 
              non-Chinese was a Malay).</p>
              <p class="BodyTextIndent" style="text-indent: 0in;">A 
              similar outcome is revealed in the pattern of government scholarships awarded 
              after matriculation from school. Of the 200 winners of 
              Singapore's most prestigious scholarship, the President's 
              Scholarship, from 1966-2005 only 14 (6.4%) were not Chinese. But this was not a 
              consistent proportion throughout the period. If we take 1980 as the divider, we 
              find that there were 10 non-Chinese President's Scholars out of 114 from 
              1966-80, or 8%, but in the period from 1981-2005 this figure had dropped to four 
              out of 106, or 3.8%. Since independence, the President's Scholarship has been 
              awarded to only one Malay, in 1968. There has been only one non-Chinese  
              President's Scholar in the 18 years from 1987 to 2005 (a boy called Mikail 
              Kalimuddin) and he is actually half Chinese, studied in Chinese schools (Chinese 
              High School and Hwa Chong Junior College), and took the Higher Chinese course as 
              his mother tongue. If we broaden our focus to encompass broader constructions of 
              ethnicity, we find that since independence, the President's Scholarship has been 
              won by only two Muslims (1968 and 2005).</p>
              <p class="BodyTextIndent" style="text-indent: 0in;">If we consider 
              Singapore's second-ranked scholarship–the Ministry of Defence's Singapore Armed 
              Forces Overseas Scholarship (SAFOS)–we find a comparable pattern. The Ministry 
              of Defence did not respond to my request for a list of recipients of SAF 
              scholarships, but using newspaper accounts and information provided by the 
              Ministry of Defence Scholarship Centre and Public Service Commission Scholarship 
              Centre Web sites, I was able to identify 140 (56%) of the 250 SAFOS winners up 
              to 2005.</p>
              <p class="BodyTextIndent" style="text-indent: 0in;">Although only 
              indicative, this table clearly suggests the Chinese dominance in SAFOS stakes: 
              98% of SAFOS winners in this sample were Chinese, and about 2% were non-Chinese 
              (counting Mikail Kalimuddin in 2005 as non-Chinese). Furthermore I found not a 
              single Malay recipient and only one Muslim winner (Mikail Kalimuddin). A similar 
              picture emerges in the lower status Singapore Armed Forces Merit Scholarship 
              winners: 71 (25.6%) of 277 (as of late 2005) scholars identified, with 69 (97%) 
              Chinese winners to only two non-Chinese–though there was a Malay recipient in 
              2004, and one reliable scholar maintains that there have been others.</p>
              <p class="BodyTextIndent" style="text-indent: 0in;">The position of the 
              non-Chinese in the educational stakes has clearly deteriorated since the 
              beginning of the 1980s. According to the logic of meritocracy, that means the 
              Chinese have been getting smarter, at least compared to the non-Chinese.</p>
              <p class="BodyTextIndent" style="text-indent: 0in;">Yet the selection of 
              scholars does not depend purely on objective results like exam scores. In the 
              internal processes of awarding scholarships after matriculation results are 
              released, there are plenty of opportunities to exercise subtle forms of 
              discrimination. Extracurricular activities (as recorded in one's school record), 
              "character" and performance in an interview are also considered. This makes the 
              selection process much more subjective than one would expect in a system that 
              claims to be a meritocracy, and it creates ample opportunity for racial and 
              other prejudices to operate with relative freedom.</p>
              <p class="BodyTextIndent" style="text-indent: 0in;">Is there evidence that such biases operate at this level? Unsurprisingly, the 
              answer to this question is "yes." Take for instance a 2004 promotional 
              supplement in the country's main newspaper used to recruit applicants for 
              scholarships. The advertorial articles accompanying the paid advertisements 
              featured only one non-Chinese scholar (a Malay on a lowly "local" scholarship) 
              amongst 28 Chinese on prestigious overseas scholarships. Even more disturbing 
              for what they reveal about the prejudices of those offering the scholarships 
              were the paid advertisements placed by government ministries, statutory boards 
              and GLCs. Of the 30 scholars who were both prominent and can be racially 
              identified by their photographs or their names without any doubt as to accuracy, 
              every one of them was Chinese. This leaves not a shadow of a doubt that those 
              people granting government and government-linked scholarships presume that the 
              vast majority of high-level winners will be Chinese.</p>
              <p class="BodyTextIndent" style="text-indent: 0in;"><img src="http://www.feer.com/assets/images/archive/2006/0610/images/Barr_chart.jpg" border="0" alt="" width="300" height="376"></p>
              <p class="BodyTextIndent" style="text-indent: 0in;">The absence of Malays from the SAFOS scholarships and their near-absence from 
              the SAF Merit Scholarships deserves special mention because this is an extension 
              of discrimination against the admission of Malays into senior and sensitive 
              positions in the SAF that is officially sanctioned. The discrimination against 
              Malays has been discussed in parliament and the media, and is justified by the 
              assertion that the loyalty of Malays cannot be assumed, both because they are 
              Muslim and because they have a racial and ethnic affinity with the Malays in
              Malaysia and 
              Indonesia. Current Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has historically 
              been a vocal defender of this policy.</p>
              <p class="BodyTextIndent" style="text-indent: 0in;">This discrimination 
              hits Malay men hard, first because it deprives many of promising careers in the 
              army, and second–and more pertinent for our study of the elite–it all but 
              completely excludes potentially high-flying Malays of a chance of entering the 
              scholar class through the SAF. A Chinese woman has a much better chance of 
              winning an SAF scholarship than a Malay man.</p>
              <p class="BodyTextIndent" style="text-indent: 0in;">Yet even before the scholarship stage, the education system has stacked the deck 
              in favor of Chinese, starting in preschool. Here is the heart of 
              Singapore's systemic discrimination against non-Chinese. Since the 
              end of the 1970s, the principles of "meritocracy" and "multiracialism" have been 
              subverted by a form of government-driven Chinese chauvinism that has 
              marginalized the minorities. It was not known to the public at the time, but as 
              early as 1978, then Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew had begun referring to 
              Singapore as a "Confucian society" in his dealings with foreign 
              dignitaries. This proved to be the beginning of a shift from his record as a 
              defender of a communally neutral form of multiracialism toward a policy of 
              actively promoting a Chinese-dominated 
              Singapore.</p>
              <p class="BodyTextIndent" style="text-indent: 0in;">The early outward 
              signs of the Sinicization program were the privileging of Chinese education, 
              Chinese language and selectively chosen "Chinese values" in an overt and 
              successful effort to create a Mandarin- and English-speaking elite who would 
              dominate public life. Two of the most important planks of this campaign were 
              decided in 1979: the annual "Speak Mandarin Campaign" and the decision to 
              preserve and foster a collection of elite Chinese-medium schools, known as 
              Special Assistance Plan (SAP) 
              schools.</p>
              <p class="BodyTextIndent" style="text-indent: 0in;">The
              SAP schools are explicitly designed to have a Chinese ambience, 
              right down to Chinese gardens, windows shaped like plum blossoms, Chinese 
              orchestra and drama, and exchange programs with mainland 
              China and Taiwan. Over the years the children in
              SAP schools have been given multiple 
              advantages over those in ordinary schools, including exclusive preschool 
              programs and special consideration for preuniversity scholarships.</p>
              <p class="BodyTextIndent" style="text-indent: 0in;">For instance, in the 
              early 1980s, when there was a serious shortage of graduate English teachers in 
              schools, the Ministry of Education ensured there were enough allocated to SAP 
              schools "to help improve standards of English among the Chinese-medium students, 
              in the hope that they will be able to make it to university"–a target brought 
              closer by the granting of two O-level bonus points exclusively to SAP school 
              students when they applied to enter junior college. By contrast, neither Indians 
              nor Malays received any special help, let alone schools of their own to address 
              their special needs. They were not only left to fend for themselves, but were 
              sometimes subjected to wanton neglect: inadequately trained teachers, 
              substandard facilities and resources and the "knowledge" that they are not as 
              good as the Chinese.</p>
              <p class="BodyTextIndent" style="text-indent: 0in;">This account of 
              discrimination against non-Chinese might lead the reader to assume that the 
              quarter of Singaporeans who are not Chinese must form a festering and perhaps 
              even revolutionary mass of resentment. Such an assumption would, however, be a 
              long way from the mark. Non-Chinese might be largely excluded from the highest 
              levels of the administrative elite, but just below these rarefied heights there 
              plenty of positions open to intelligent and hardworking non-Chinese–certainly 
              enough to ensure that non-Chinese communities have much to gain by 
              enthusiastically buying into the system, even after the glass ceilings and 
              racial barriers are taken into account. There are many grievances and 
              resentments in these levels of society but the grievances are muted and balanced 
              by an appreciation of the relative comforts and prosperity they enjoy. For most, 
              any tendency to complain is subdued also by knowledge that it could be worse, 
              and the widespread assumption among members of minority communities that it will 
              be if they seriously pursue their grievances. As long as the 
              Singapore system continues to deal such people a satisfactory hand, if not a 
              fair one, it should be able to cope with some quiet rumblings in the ranks.</p>
              <p class="BodyTextIndent" style="text-indent: 0in;">While this 
              discrimination is not sparking a reaction that threatens the regime in the short 
              term, the resulting injustices are certainly undermining the myth that the 
              regime operates on meritocratic principles. This is worrying in the longer term 
              because this myth, along with the capacity to deliver peace and prosperity, is 
              one of the primary rationales by which Singaporeans reluctantly accept the many 
              unpopular aspects of the regime, such as the lack of freedom and democracy, the 
              intrusion of government into most aspects of private life, the pressure-cooker 
              lifestyle and the high cost of living.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0in;">The 
              rhetoric of meritocracy has given Singaporeans the consolation of believing that 
              their ruling elite are the best of the best and can therefore be trusted almost 
              blindly on important matters, even if they are highhanded and lack the common 
              touch. As this illusion gradually falls away–and today it is already heavily 
              undermined–the trust that Singaporeans have for their government is becoming 
              increasingly qualified. It remains to be seen how long the regime can avert the 
              logical consequences of the contradictions between the myth and the reality.</p>
