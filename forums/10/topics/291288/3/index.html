Having a maid to do that is ignorant and irresponsilbe. Its convenient but a baby 's care and upbringing is not outsourceable like in business. Not everything in life is about outsourcing. This mentality flaw comes when one is too brainwashed such  that they think most important thing in life is money, economy and everything can be solved by money.<br><br>Either parent must sacrfice at least 1 or 2 years to bring up a child per child.<br><br>Thus, this sacrifice and cost of opportunity can be compensated by FREE EDUCATION.<br><br>I say it again, with FREE EDUCATION, many more will produce more babies within 1 year. The FREE Education compensates the parent's lost of work and alleviates completely their burden to save enough money for their childrens' education.<br><br>This is an investment and not a cost.<br><br>Also, many are already given FREE EDUCATION here. I urge the responsible persons to approve this bill to provide FREE EDUCATION for all.<br><br>This WILL solve the baby problem.<br><br>My solution is FREE.<br><br>What is this amount compared to the GDP increase that will come from more babies in years to come?<br><br>So simple, the mudder of all solution.

My argument is based on released figures in the press by the govt. Percentage of Lower income households have risen. Lower income households get a dip in average salaries. The higher income groups are the top beneficiaries of the growth in the economy, even in terms of proportion of gain(s). All the above are facts that are published by local press, not even mentioning about foreign press yet.<br><br>Among all the "hype" about a better economy, yet no significant increase in births, or birth rate, meaning (babies born to female resident ratio) also formally known as total fertility rate or TFR.<br><br>Rising property prices benefit the higher ups more than the those at the lower end of the pyramid. Firstly, if you don't own 2 units of residential assets, you cannot liquidate the one you live in. In essence, the one you live in is not an asset(depending on context of course).<br><br>Most of the construction industry dollars are going to Singaporeans/PRs? Dun know about that really, so not going there.<br><br>My point is, the govt is putting up alot of good looking abstract figures about the economy and how its doing, but then what do they have to show with regards the bread and butter issues is the common working middle class citizen? Even statistically? If what the press says is true, then other than the upper income bracket households, the rest aren't benefiting in equal proportion to the growth in the economy(if they benefit at all).<br><br>Which may not be the only factor concerning the people who want to have kids, but certainly and major one.<br><br>Take yourself for example, would you consider having kids if your household income is below3-4K a month? Or would you put it off till you can get more?</div>
