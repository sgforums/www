Change in lifestyle = People enjoy the free and easy life they have without the burden of responsibility of bringing up a child. One loses the mobility to move around too especially most jobs these days require both spouses to travel. Providing free education does not discharge the parents from their responsibility of bringing up the child at all!<br><br>3. Providing free education does not discharge the mum from suffering from loss of opportunities. As long as the work environment does not become more pro-family, you really won't see any changes to it.<br><br>4. Take away the privilage you give, especially something like free education, once implemented you can never take away without severe backlash. You will spend more time and money trying to clear the mess. It's not a tape where you can say sorry 'ba leh'  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>5. Sure you can generalise lifestyle of people. It is called profiling.<br><br>In my opinion, people will be more willing to have children if the government pass some laws that are more pro-family and laws that protect women when they get pregnant so that they won't have a bad performance over night so that the company can fire them coz pregant women are a burden.<br><br>People will also be more willing to have children if there are more childcare facilities near the work places and if more companies actually adopt flexi-hours.<br><br>I have to repeat again that lack of $$ is the best excuse to use on why I can't afford a child.<br></div>

Flexi Hours does not mean there will be additional expenses. It is planning and setting a system. Once the system is in place, it might even be more beneficial to the company because you get happy workers who are motivated<br><br>2. Free education does not equate free child care. This is a cost that has to be paid for anyway. It is just to make it more convinient to the parents.<br><br>Your point all along had been free education for all. I believe there is already free education for some extremely poor families now or they are super heavily subsidised.<br><br>You like to talk about the GDP so much. Free education for the masses = Government expenditure. Pray tell me where is the revenue coming from? As I pointed out earlier, it will come from high taxes. Go find out the tax rates of the Scandinavian countries and tell me if you like those figures  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>If you really want to invest in the young a lot of policies will have to be more pro-family. Right now the work environment is not. It's not about money now seriously. A lot of people hesitate having children these days because they feel that a child is their responsibility and they don't have the time to commit and therefore not want to have them besides other factors.<br><br>I have to repeat again that by providing free education, it does not take away the problems most working adults face like having no time for the family and having no one to look after the child without a high possiblity of jeopardizing  their job.<br><br>Plus, I wouldn't call it investment as well because humans being humans take things for granted. What can be worse than people who lack the drive to study and excel because 'Aiya it's free ma'<br><br>Anyway, why implement free education when it is not the crux of the problem where the majority of people cannot afford it, therefore not wanting to have children?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by mistyblue:</div><div class="quote_body">when compared to the lows of the past years, it will seem to have increased. But still the total number if you can provide the number, might still be small. And even with that number, it must be broken down to Citizen and PR and non Citizens as well as race and age groups to see the correct picture. In statistics, its talks about generalizations. Therefore, to really know the situation, is to know the details. To manage the situation is not just to think, oh birth rates are up. But if its non-citizens or PRs who are contributing to the increase, and they can at any time uproot. Therefore, its only a temporary solution. I even ask Malaysians our closest neighbours (PRC and most other foreigners were also asked the same question) why they didn't want to become Singaporeans. The reasons they gave were staring at our face. Though our papers like to only publish the select few who choose to stay here. Most are here either as stepping stone to better careers or just to make money due to exchange  rates and retire home bringing their locally born off-springs back there as well. Singapore is just a good hotel for them to trash up and leave. Who cleans up after them? Who benefit from these people? You have the answer.<br><br>The whole situation of local citizens not giving birth is summed up above by another poster and perhaps more reason that are not because of economy and numbers. How about the intangible thing call emotion. Ask any local born Singapore citizen if they feel emotionally attached to this land? Do they see a bright future for themselves and kids? Do they want to retire here? Do they foresee a harder time in future? Will they be able to survive given the current political party were to continue for the next 20-50 years? etc. The total environment, macro, micro and everything in between - and now people are given a choice medically if they want to bring a next generation into this land knowing what they know about the system, politics, economy, world, future and about themselves - perhaps, just perhaps, people lost that confidence in the future because they are finding it so much harder to just survive now.<br><br></div></blockquote>Misty<br><br>Everyone knows you can get killed, raped and robbed anywhere else besides Sillypore or even be a druge addict</div>
