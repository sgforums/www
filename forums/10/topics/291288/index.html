Its painfully simple. You miss the point a while mile and a half.<br>Just as stocks, if you see the stock is not going to benefit you and might make you lose money. You will not buy. Its the same situation here. If people saw a Win-Lose situation where they are the latter, people will not invest in this country if they have the option to choose.<br><br>You think Singapore are not worried about kids ending up in similar situations as well? You think singapore do not have drug addicts, rapist, serial killers and more? Perhaps more rampant cause of Asian mentality to hide the shameful things. These things are not just australia's issues.  What is not reported in the news does not mean it did not happen.<br><br>I can tell you in the old neighbourhood I stay, there are lots of fights and such things but no one even bother to call the news.  Its in Singapore if you want to argue about it.<br><br>Anyways, I am not free like you to talk rubbish and I know you propably have an easy life with silver spoon.
