              <p><em>He cited the increase of more than one million people living in Singapore over the past decade as precedence that “adding another 500,000 to 800,000 more PRs and citizens… will be disastrous and add to our already difficult infrastructure and social problems”.<br><br></em><em><strong>Privileges and responsibilities<br></strong><br>He also noted that Singapore already has too many PRs and are enjoying full citizen privileges without the citizen’s responsibilities. In an example of the latter, he said only around 30 per cent of all boys of PRs do national service.<br><br>In line with this, he said children of PRs must be made to do national service and that the government should make it an offence for them not to do so.<br><br>In addition, he proposed a levy of about $50,000 chargeable to PRs who buy HDB flats from the open market. Such flats could then be only resold to Singaporeans and the levy would be refunded within five years if the PR took up citizenship.<br><br>“The differentiated privileges will separate the genuine ones from those who are here for a ride. We should grant PRs to those who are most likely going to take up citizenships so these differentiated privileges should not stifle our plans to attract quality PRs and new citizens,” said Singh.</em></p>

              <p>This is for show only lar.  If u had been see how they rule (oops shld be govt) SG long enough, u will know their trick.  When they want to come out some policy that most cannot accept, they will throw out something for extreme first.   Then they get their own MP come out to opp it (by this, they can claim that their MP is not a Yes Man).  Then they adjust the policy to what they really want (by this, they claim that they listen to the Lesser Mortals).</p><p>
              
              </p><p>If you guy recall when they decided to build casino, the first decision is on 3 casino.  But it cause an outcry and become 2.  Thus perhaps they know that 6.9 is never the actually figures, what they want is actually 6.5, but by throw out 6.9 this figures when they adjust to 6.5.  They can claim that their MP is not Yes Man and they listen to the Lesser Mortals. </p><p>

              <p><br>actually this wont work o me. i feel there should not be any increase anymore. we have existing workforce of foreigners. cheap labor ones, skilled ones. they should be enough. when their pass gonna expire, all sould review whether they should stay. some have attitude problems, some really have problems. if they should go, we then hire new ones.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Prs new citizens. we must ensure the privilege they get as singaporeas equal stays with them. should they leave sg for good, the privilegse minus interets earned should be taken back, taxed whatever. in this way we attract PRs new citizens who really can afford our high life here, and be able to pay (to adpat to PAPPY's motto), and no more  a burden to our sg people and gahmen.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>that's is what i call fully utilize our monies and resources.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>see read this article by mah bowoh tan - i tot he shoudl not be around already why still tok so much in front of media? the cat is out of the bag. sg can only make money from foreigners. read the whole article.</p>
