              â€œI think they mentioned this to test the reaction of Singaporeansâ€¦whether its a good thing to do before the next GEâ€¦trying out the system first then see the reaction of Singaporeans. I donâ€™t think Singapore will reach that 6.9 millions rather less than that because Singaporeans and foreigners alike will run from Singapore when that happens.â€�

              â€œDonâ€™t think this is a test, 7 mil are already here. This is just a courteous reminder.â€�
                       
              I donâ€™t think so. What they are actually saying is that by 2030 we donâ€™t have enough Singaporean workforce to take up those jobs which they have projected on for Singapore base upon their planning to rebuild Singapore industrial and commercial investment projection until 2030. Now, what I see is their target of building those industrial and commercial projects all over the island. Iâ€™m trying to clear the smoke here. Iâ€™m taking away all those subject matters that they have mentioned in pertinence to ageing singaporeans, young singaporeans leaving singapore for better opportunities overseas and leaving behind their old age parents , enough housing for all, quality of life and lastly singapore need more foreigners to reach that projection of 6.9 millions to even up and balance the population white paper in order to survive global economy.
                       
              What I see is thisâ€¦they are actually saying that we have more and more ageing singaporeans. We going to have lesser and lesser young singaporeans in the workforce by 2030. However, they fail to address singaporeans is that eventhough singapore is facing those issues, we do have plenty of 18 years singaporean students by 2030 but they have yet to fully completed their education to enter the job market. Therefore, we need foreigners to fill up that gap until such time our own young singaporean students have completed their education and join the workforce to fill those jobs available in the job market.
                       
              About their projection of future industrial and commercial investments or rather land usage for industrial and commercial building, mrt lines, roads and housing in Singapore until 2030, it means billions and billions of dollars profit for them. To generate the Singapore economy they cannot stop building more projects for investment in Singapore.
                       
              So, in other words, they cannot wait for those future young singaporean students to grow up and start work so we need to take in more foreigners. Some we take them to become Singaporeans and others we donâ€™t need to until 2030. And we need to build more accomodation for not only Singaporeans but also foreigners.
                       
              The way I see it, Singapore will not face any housing shortage for Singaporeans and foreigners alike up to 2030. And Singapore do not need to have 6.9 millions people living on the island. The way I see it, 4 or 4.5 millions people living is more than enough and its a very comfortable figure as Singapore waits for her young Singaporean students to grow up and start work after they have completed their education. And with that population 4 or 4.5 millions population, the land usage in Singapore will not be exploited unnecessarily. Singapore will face shortage of housing and will be over populated if they take foreign workers from e.g. China, Myanmar, India, Philippines etc especially those faraway countries. Singapore will not face housing shortages and over populated if they take in more and more Malaysians to work in Singapore because most Malaysians will return to their own homes in Johor Baru instead of living in Singapore. Currently, the over crowding problems in public transportation and in public places are mainly caused not by Malaysians workers rather by other foreign nationals because they have no choice but to stay in Singapore unlike the Malaysian foreign workers. Majority of Malaysian foreign workers stay in Johor Baru.
                       
              The housing and over populated issues, will be Johor State problems and not Singapore but I know Johor state have no problems with space, transportation and housing shortages. In fact, it will help to build Johor state economy tremendously.

              I hope I have managed to clear the smoke bomb the enemy thrown on the battlefield to conceal their actual manpower figures while advancing our frontline. I hope you all see clearly now....now men, "Fire! Fire at will." Hehe..just to make it more interesting.
                          
              What the WP proposal is a figure that is slightly more than our current population figure which is slight above the 5 million marks which consists of Singaporeans, PRs, Foreign Workers and Foreign Students. The actual figure of Singaporean population is around 4 million to slightly above 4 millions. So, in other words, plus minus the current actual Singaporeans population, that figure will drop slightly below 4 millions or the same provided there is a baby boom trend from Singaporean themselves. What I know is this, they are talking about my generation who are in their late 40s and 50s. The way I see it, my generation will have no problems with financial burdens as much like those before us. We can take care of ourselves because most of our hdb flats now are fully paid by now or in the future. We don't have many children due to the stop at two campaigns in the 80s by the government.
                          
              The government are actually talking about economic growth here to gain more revenues and foreign investors. They need to maintain the property markets to remain competitives with high profits especially in the private market like in HK. They can sell those vacant lands you see now for sales to the developers. They need good and attractive incentives to foreign investors in manufacturing and business commercial sector hence the land usage of new industrial and commercial buildings projections came into view of their white paper population issue. They do not want it to fail and become a white elephant instead. So need as many available manpower now till to 2030. They need more foreigners to buy private properties. Malaysians will not buy properties in Singapore or become a citizen of Singapore. While other foreign nationalities e.g. Philippines, China, India etc will welcome that idea and look forward to it. Its all about dollars and cents here..which is typical of the current government principles and policies.  
                          
              They know that Malaysia, well, one area that is very close to Singapore, Johor offers excellent business incentives opportunity to foreign investors. In fact, Malaysia now is considered one of the most favourable country for foreign investment in this region. Singapore government do not want to lose out that opportunity and see Singapore economic status down. They need to be competitive to Malaysia. They do not want to see Singapore companies and foreign investors shift to Malaysia side.
              
              Presently, the Malaysian government has no issues for lands for foreign investors. They have also imposed mandatory laws that the minimum salary is RM900 and foreign workers will have to pay their own levy instead of the employers to the government which is also very low.

              Something like that. Besides the mineral resources and the vast lands, what the other Asian countries like Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Philippines etcs have, Singapore don't have? Singapore don't have the manpower. Singapore don't have that sufficient manpower to fulfil Singapore government investment projects from now till 2030 and it will be a disaster for them and for Singapore.

              MORE FREEDOM NOW
                   
              Politics is insistent in its claim on your time and in its demands on oneâ€™s nervous energy. That part, I donâ€™t really missâ€¦ Because I have more freedom now, less of that constant pressure.

              BUILDING TRUST
                   
              If people feel that, in the end â€˜Iâ€™m in your heartâ€™, theyâ€™re less likely to question every decision you make because they know it is for their good and the collective good. But if I begin to suspect you, that youâ€™re in it for yourself, then I will be much more insistent upon my needs being met.
