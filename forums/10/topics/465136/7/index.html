              I think you misread what I mean, the current UK government have nothing to do with the British Union of Fascists party as they kill off the idea.  But if you take a look of their ideology and logo, it is quite similar to our beloved party.  For you info, British Union of Fascists party do not believe in welfare just like our beloved party.

But in term of economic sector, I think it is more like a mix of fascism/capitalism  Fascism outlaw strike and state control the wage level, it also promote that State full control the economic sector (which SG have go to some extend and area).

              <p>State control of economy is left wing agenda not right wing or fascist.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Against the mainstream: Nazi privatization in 1930s Germany</strong></p>
              <p>
              </p><p>It is a fact that the government of the Nazi Party sold off public ownership in several State owned firms in the mid-1930s. These firms belonged to a wide range of sectors: steel, mining, <span style="line-height: 1.231;">banking, local public utilities, shipyards, ship-lines, railways, etc.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;"> In addition, the delivery of </span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">some public services that were produced by government prior to the 1930s, especially social and </span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">labor-related services, was transferred to the private sector, mainly to organizations within the </span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">party...</span></p>
              <p><a href="http://www.ub.edu/graap/nazi.pdf">http://www.ub.edu/graap/nazi.pdf<span style="line-height: 1.231;"> </span></a></p>
              <p></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>
              </p><p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;">....In these strange exceptions we can find one of the central principles of the Nazi system. It is a principle which is often missed.<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> We have been told that Germany had a corporate state or a totalitarian state. Neither was true. </span></strong>There was no real corporate organization (even fraudulent, as in Italy and Austria), and such an organization, much discussed before and after 1933, was quickly dropped by 1935. The<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> term "totalitarian" cannot be applied to the German system of self-regulation</span></strong>, although it could be applied to the Soviet system.</p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;">     The <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Nazi system was dictatorial capitalism</span></span></strong>—that is, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">a society organized so that everything was subject to the benefit of capitalism</span></strong>; everything, that is, compatible with two limiting factors: (<em>a</em>) that the<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Nazi Party, which was not capitalist, was in control of the state</span></strong>, and (<em>b</em>) that war, which is not capitalist, could force curtailment of capitalist benefits (in the short run at least). In this judgment we must define our terms accurately.</p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">We define capitalism as "a system of economics in which production is based on profit for those who control the capital." </span></strong></p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;">In this definition one point must be noted: the expression "for those who control the capital" does not necessarily mean the owners. In modern economic conditions large-scale enterprise with widely dispersed stock-ownership has made management more important....</p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">...The traditional capitalist system was a profit system. In its pursuit of profits it was not primarily concerned with production, consumption, prosperity, high employment, national welfare, or anything else.</span></strong> As a result, its concentration on profits eventually served to injure profits.</p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 19px;"> This development got the whole society into such a mess that enemies of the profit system began to rise up on all sides. Fascism was the counterattack of the profit system against these enemies. This counterattack was conducted in such a violent fashion that the whole appearance of society was changed, although, in the short run, the real structure was not greatly modified.</span></p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 19px;"> In the long run Fascism threatened even the profit system, because the defenders of that system, businessmen rather than politicians, turned over the control of the state to a party of gangsters and lunatics who in the long run might turn to attack businessmen themselves....</span></p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">...Many of the<span style="color: #ff0000;"> <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">economic activities which had come under state control were "re-privatized."</span></strong></span> The United Steel Works, which the government had purchased from Ferdinand Flick in 1932, as well as three of the largest banks in Germany, which had been taken over during the crisis of 1931, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">were restored to private ownership at a loss to the government.</span></strong> Reinmetal-Borsig, one of the greatest corporations in heavy industry, was sold to the Hermann Gà¹–ring Works.<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <span style="color: #ff0000;">Many other important firms were sold to private investors. </span></span></strong></span></p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">At the same time the property in industrial firms still held by the state was <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">shifted from public control to joint public-private control by being subjected to a mixed board of directors.</span></strong> Finally, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">municipal enterprise was curtailed; its profits were taxed for the first time in 1935,</span></strong> and the law permitting municipal electric-power plants was revoked in the same year...</span></p>
              <p>
              </p><p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;">   ....The danger from labor was not nearly so great as might seem at first glance. It was not labor itself which was dangerous, because labor itself did not come directly and immediately in conflict with the profit system; rather it was with labor getting the wrong ideas, especially Marxist ideas which did seek to put the laborer directly in conflict with the profit system and with private ownership.</p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;">As a result, the Nazi system sought to control the ideas and the organization of labor, and was quite as eager to control his free time and leisure activities as it was to control his working arrangements.</p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> For this reason it was not sufficient merely to smash the existing labor organizations. </span></strong>This would have left labor free and uncontrolled and able to pick up any kind of ideas. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Nazism, therefore, did not try to destroy these organizations but to take them over.</span></strong> All the old unions were dissolved into the German Labor Front. This gave an amorphous body of 25 million in which the individual was lost. This Labor Front was a party organization, and its finances were under control of the party treasurer, Franz X. Schwarz.</p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;">     <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Labor Front soon lost all of its economic activities, chiefly to the Ministry of Economics.</span></strong> An elaborate facade of <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">fraudulent organizations which either never existed or never functioned was built up about the Labor Front.</span></strong></p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;"><strong></strong> They included national and regional chambers of labor and a Federal Labor and Economic Council. In fact, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">the Labor Front had no economic or political functions and had nothing to do with wages or labor conditions.</span></strong></p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;">Its chief functions were (1) to propagandize; (2) to absorb the workers' leisure time, especially by the "Strength Through Joy" organization, ( 3 ) to tax workers for the party's profit; (4) to provide jobs for reliable party members within the Labor Front itself; (5) to disrupt working-class solidarity.</p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">This facade was painted with an elaborate ideology based on the idea that the factory or enterprise was a community in which leader and followers cooperated...</span></p>

              <p>Nope, fascism is only all in for State Control economic but with slight different compare to socialism.  Socialism is not profit driven in their state control economic, whereas Fascism is profit driven in this (which is like capitalism).

              </p><p>Where socialism sought totalitarian control of a societyâ€™s economic processes through direct state operation of the means of production, fascism sought that control indirectly, through domination of nominally private owners. Where socialism nationalized property explicitly, fascism did so implicitly, by requiring owners to use their property in the â€œnational interestâ€�â€”that is, as the autocratic authority conceived it. (Nevertheless, a few industries were operated by the state.) Where socialism abolished all market relations outright, fascism left the appearance of market relations while planning all economic activities. Where socialism abolished money and prices, fascism controlled the monetary system and set all prices and wages politically. In doing all this, fascism denatured the marketplace. Entrepreneurship was abolished. State ministries, rather than consumers, determined what was produced and under what conditions.</p><p>

For Capitalism, they will privatize it but ensure free market and allow free competition (which mean though the company is profit driven, it is up to them, which is why some private public company overseas making losses instead).</p><p>
              
              </p><p>Now come fascism, they will privatize it in name but retain full State control and ensure that it is profit driven rather than a service to the public.</p><p></p>

              Base on what you post, that is what happen, though they still privatize it.  They still have a lot of control like the products can only sell back to State etc.. 
              
              Maybe put in more layman term.  Socialism will go for State Own.  Fascism will go for State Control.  Capitalism which go choose to opt for free market.

Because if you decide that... is the possibility even though it’s not a target, then we have to make decisions now about infrastructure,” he added. “It doesn’t mean we have to hit that number, but we have to prepare.”<br> <br>Also speaking on Sunday, Minister for Law and Foreign Affairs K Shanmugam reportedly said the white paper is intended to spur discussion on Singapore’s population situation in 20 years’ time.<br> <br>Although economic growth rates were projected to be between 3 and 5 per cent up to 2020, and 2 to 3 per cent up to 2030, the minister said the actual rates depend on a variety of factors, including those of the external and internal environment.<br> <br>“But the task of a responsible government will be to look at 20 years ahead, 15 years ahead, and say, ‘These are the possible, different things that might happen. Let’s talk about them now’,” he was quoted as saying.<br> <br>He also said he could understand grouses from the public over the government’s population estimates.<br> <br>“They say, ‘I have difficulties with infrastructure, transport, housing with today’s population and you want to increase it even more; doesn’t make sense.' That’s a reaction and it’s understandable,” he added.<br> <br>Shanmugam said the government has to explain their need and resolve to solve the country’s current infrastructure problems. Regardless of the population size in the long term, infrastructure must be adequate and deliver a high quality of life, he noted.<br> <br>“That has to be a cast iron position that the government has to deliver and will deliver,” he reportedly said.<br> <br>Over the past week, the government also released a <a style="color: #5d4370;" href="http://sg.news.yahoo.com/govt-announces-land-plan-sustain-6-9m-population-052723558--sector.html">land use plan</a> to accommodate its projections as stipulated in the White Paper. <br> <br>Following that, Minister for National Development Khaw Boon Wan declared that Build-To-Order (BTO) flat prices <a style="color: #5d4370;" href="http://www.straitstimes.com/the-big-story/singapore-population-2030/story/bto-prices-will-not-rise-resale-market-khaw-20130131">would remain affordable</a>, even as the resale market continues to edge upwards. <br><br>He also reportedly said that “it’s possible” for the government to cater to a population of 6.9 million, even as it works to raise the quality of life for Singaporeans.</p>

              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.453125px;">Speaking to Members of the House on Monday, Teo said that he understood the concerns Singaporeans had over an increase in the migrant population and fears of "Singaporeans feeling like strangers" in their own country. <br><br>He went on to emphasise the importance of integration. <br><br>"Most of these migrants come from similar ethnic backgrounds. They will adapt to our lives, become more like us over time," said Teo as he sought to assuage a wave of negativity about Singapore's<a style="color: #5d4370;" href="http://sg.news.yahoo.com/s%E2%80%99pore-population-to-hit-6-million-by-2020--paper-061718360.html">projected population of 6.9 million by 2030</a>, of which little more than half would be Singaporean. <br><br>Speaking specifically on the issue of an increase in the number of foreigners with work passes, the deputy prime minister said that these migrant workers would be here to support, rather than join the population. <br><br>"Let us be clear. These foreigners with work passes are here to support Singaporeans' needs in the areas of healthcare, domestic workers and supporting our ageing population and families." <br><br>The jobs these work pass holders would be doing, he said were "jobs and services Singaporeans need but do not want to do ourselves." <br><br>Teo also said that criteria for the awarding of these passes would be made more stringent in terms of salary requirements. <br><br>"Work pass holders are only here during their productive years. They help boost the ratio of working people to retirees but do not add to the retiree population. With them, the dependency ratio will fall," he argued.</p>
