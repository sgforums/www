              <p><span class="postbody"><span style="font-weight: bold;">PR-Inside.com, 24 Aug 2009</span> <br> <br> <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: normal;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Singapore Defence report: defence spending will amount to US$11.4bn, or 6% of GDP, in 2009</span></span></span> <br> <br> <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: red;">Singapore, with its small population base, has concentrated spending on sophisticated and superior weapons systems. </span></span><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: blue;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: normal;">As
              a consequence, it has one of the largest defence budgets in the Asia
              Pacific region – over 4% of GDP. It has maintained high levels of
              spending despite being the first Asian economy to slip into recession,
              which is expected to worsen over 2009. </span></span></span>The
              principal recent development affecting the future of Singapore’s
              defence spending is the recent rapid deterioration in economic
              conditions.
              <br> <br> <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: blue;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: normal;">Singapore’s
              Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence Teo Chee Hean has
              previously announced that defence spending will amount to US$11.4bn, or
              6% of GDP, in 2009. As a percentage of GDP, this amounts to one of the
              biggest defence budgets in recent history. </span></span></span>Teo
              stressed the importance of maintaining military spending, noting that
              threats do not diminish but, rather, often emerge during testing
              economic times, owing to increased social and political frictions. He
              noted several factors that had enabled Singapore to build up its
              defence capability over time: careful spending; sourcing and upgrading
              second-hand equipment; an ongoing maintenance regime; and investment
              into research and development.
              <br> <br>In February 2009, the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) announced it
              will participate in a US-led task force in the Gulf of Aden designed to
              target pirates operating in the Gulf and adjacent waterways. Singapore
              will supply a landing ship tank, two helicopters and two-hundred
              personnel. Joining an international flotilla comprising some forty-five
              warships from Europe, China and Malaysia, the SAF deployment will help
              to escort vessels traversing the Arabian Sea, Indian Ocean, Red Sea and
              the Gulf.
              <br> <br>Teo said on June 3 2009 that Singapore was prepared to deploy a
              weapon locating radar (WLR) team to central Afghanistan, according to
              local media. The WLR team will be deployed to Tarin Kowt in Oruzgan
              province in Afghanistan, and will provide early warning of rocket
              attacks and enhance force protection measures of the International
              Security Assistance Force personnel deployed in the base there.
              <br> <br>Teo said this was in view of increased rocket attacks in
              Afghanistan, adding that multinational peace support initiatives will
              continue to be an important aspect of the SAF operations.
              <br> <br>Speaking at an overseas medal presentation ceremony, he said that
              if the deployment of the radar is considered useful, the WLR detachment
              can be deployed for between nine and 12 months from the latter part of
              this year, according to the report.
              <br> <br>Singapore hosted the annual Asia Security Summit, organised by the
              London International Institute for Strategic Studies from May 29-31,
              bringing together about 22 ministerial-level guests, along with
              parliamentarians, military leaders and security experts from more than
              27 countries and regions for discussions on regional security issues
              and defence cooperation.
              <br> <br>Teo told the forum that military transparency plays a crucial role
              in avoiding misunderstandings and increasing trust and confidence for
              the Asia-Pacific. Military transparency, he said, ‘is not an end in
              itself but a means to peace and stability’, adding it needs to operate
              at three levels, namely disclosure armaments and arsenals, statements
              of strategic intent, cooperative and inclusive action.
              <br> <br>Singapore and Australia signed the new Shoalwater Bay Training Area
              (SWBTA) Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) at the summit. The new MOA allows
              the SAF to continue training at the SWBTA until 2019. The vast and
              challenging terrain at the SWBTA enables the SAF to ensure its
              operational readiness through tough and realistic training.
              <br> <br>This quarter, we have introduced a significant new aspect to BMI´s
              Defence reports, which is the City Terrorism Rating (CTR). This
              assesses the risk of a terrorist attack. The CTR takes into account the
              overall BMI Terrorism Rating for the country in question. It also
              incorporates the ‘prevalence’ of terrorism, which recognises the
              frequency of attacks, and whether the city is a target for terrorists.
              The CTR also recognises the ‘threat’ of terrorism in terms of the
              likely numbers of victims and the ability of groups to launch sustained
              campaigns.
              <br> <br>These City-Specific Ratings are created via an integration of the
              state-wide threat, with an evaluation of the city-specific
              characteristics and level of activity.

              It is time that our leaders reduce the spending on defence as Sg is already superior in quantity and quality of weapons as compared to its immediate neighbours.  Leaders  should now improve the quality of life of all their citizens especially the bottom 20% of the population.  I would to see more funds be channelled to education, health and social matters.  
              Keep buying expensive weapons will enrich the weapons exporting country like US and in addition fast moving technology will render the weapons obsolete in matter of years.
              Remember the patriot missiles system, promoted by US after first Gulf War in 1991.  Sg was one of the countries  that purchased the system.

              <p>why are people so naive?</p>
              <p><br>Just because u spend more on people ( poor citizens ) do u think that it'll make their lives better?</p>
              <p>It is true that the disadvantaged/poor needs to be helped, but the government CANNOT and SHOULD NOT just throw money at them hoping that they would benefit. If u give them too much then theres even lesser marginal advantage ( for the poor ) to seek better employment. Then every1 might as well just take unemployment benefits since its actually comparable to an average's worker's pay.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, what if Singapore got invaded / terrorists made a successful attack one day?</p>
              <p>Sure got people like TS kp-kb-ing away about why singapore so rich but cant even afford proper defence systems</p>

              <p>To begin with, I dont understand what you mean by freedom.</p>
              <p>Adding to that, you're using another vague term "liberal". Its not that I dont want to use the dictionary definitions of those terms. Because of the vagueness of those words, people tend to have their own definitions and associations for them. So if I dont know what you mean, I cant respond to your post.</p>
              <p>Other than that, I agree with you. If a country goes to war, their soldiers wouldnt think about the elites that they're ultimately protecting. People in society dont usually think about how they are the ones maintaining the positions of the elites by consenting to being governed.</p>
              <p>If people had an intelligent up-bringing, there would be no way a society would go to war because there are so many other ways to solve problems other than killing people.</p>

              <p>This is exactly why I said that using such words cloud communication. While one person might have 1 definition for a word, another person may have a different understanding of it. If both dont know what the other is referring to, how can both of them communicate?</p>
              <p>Words like "freedom", "democracy", "liberty", "communism" all mean differently to different people who have different associations for those words as well. Ultimately, when these labels, which used to refer to situations in the past are used presently (under different circumstances), word and meaning dont match.</p>
              <p>So instead of using meaningless labels to judge someone, why not discuss based on concrete terms?</p>
