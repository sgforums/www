              <p><span><span>SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health (MOH) has stepped up checks on nursing homes, following a report on alleged mistreatment at a home that was highlighted in June.<br><br>The immediate target is Nightingale Nursing Home, which was at the centre of a video showing two of its staff allegedly mistreating an elderly patient.<br><br>In it, two staff members were seen flinging an elderly woman onto the bed. One was seen slapping her on the mouth after she moaned in pain.<br><br>The video first surfaced on MediaCorp's Chinese news programme in June.<br><br>The home cannot take in new patients for the time being while investigations continue.<br><br>It now has to submit reports every month on its day-to-day operations, covering areas such as management checks, how staff and patients interact, as well as channels to keep patients' families in the loop.<br><br>As for commercial and government-subsidised nursing homes, there will be more inspections.<br><br>Health Minister Gan Kim Yong said: "The approach is a risk-management approach. We will also look at the different nursing homes and assess what's the risk level and we will tailor and design our inspection regime according to the risk profile of different nursing homes.<br><br>"We will visit some homes more frequently. And for some homes, we will be able to allow the management to continue their work and we just conduct regular inspections."<br><br>Geraldine Lim, nurse manager of Society for the Aged Sick (SAS), said: "I always encourage peer monitoring as well as my nurses supervising them.<br><br>"So more or less, they are not left alone to do things for the elderly. There's always another pair of eyes watching what they are doing.<br><br>"Even if MOH has to closely monitor us, I have no issue with that."<br></span></span><span><span>Mr Gan was speaking on the sidelines of a ground-breaking ceremony for the Society for the Aged Sick (SAS) on Friday.<br><br>He said his ministry is also exploring the possibility of monitoring operations at nursing homes through a network of volunteers.<br><br>SAS is building a nine-storey annexe wing to meet rising demand. <br><br>Construction of the annexe wing, which will have 160 beds, will be completed by 2013 and will cost some S$12 million. It will also have physiotherapy and rehabilitation facilities.<br><br>To meet demand for bed capacity, six new nursing homes are expected to be built over the next two to three years.<br><br>- CNA/fa/ck</span> </span></p>
