            <div class='col-md body'>Elections is over, and the PAP has done 'reflections' over thier campaigning. But why is SM Goh the one making such speeches and other other MPs as well (about how PAP could have done better or will do better next time). Why isin't the party leader, PM Lee, making these comments? I am quite disturbed and puzzled by this. ... Can anyone comment on this??</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It is an unusual sign, a prelude to major changes to come. If the economy is still not really improving. The only good mark on the report card is some GDP growth that does not benefit any one of the local domestic business.<br><br>Such a report card is not good at all. Property prices are not returning to normal, jobs are not created of the right number so there will be pain. This sort of pain cannot be endured for too long by a lot of people. 30, 000 families are behind in paying their utility bills.<br><br>Some real efforts will have to be made to upgrade the economy and create more new technology start-ups. To do the real works there will have to be some major shake-up or restructuring of the cabinet</div>
