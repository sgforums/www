Among all Mr Tony Tan is the most eligible to be our PM.  He is doing well in the banking sector, military and politics.  He has more experience, wisdom and exposure compared with that LEE HSIEN LOONG.  Tony Tan is more of an all rounder compared to lee hsien loong.  Most of all it is Mr Tony Tan's humility that also impressed me.  We can't find humility in lee hsien loong.    well, lee hsien loong is of course lee ky's son!!!</div>
