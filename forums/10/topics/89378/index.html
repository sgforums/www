            <div class='col-md body'>Try reciting to a public audience of 3 million. Okay, I was wrong, 2 million are not watching TV, and half those are not watching him.<br><br>That leaves you with 0.5 million listeners including yourselves. Imagine if you said something wrong like what Bush said when so many Singapore citizens are already speaking badly behind your back.<br><br>You want to encourage them to continue degrading you by saying something wrong on national TV on the first time you're giving speech as PM?<br><br>Think about it. It's not easy to be in his shoes. Though it reflects very much his ability to convey the message confidently to the crowd. Better safe than sorry.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ok so maybe its a little bit on the harsh side..... looking at this morning's papers his speech got lots of praises... the content of his speech reflects that he is a able and has some semblance of a developed brain.... some may say its nitpicking to criticise his delivery.... but personally, delivery is very important.. as a prime minister LHL would be required to meet various dignitaries and impt ppl... if he has problems with the way he carries himself.. then would he be projecting the confidence necessary in negotiations? would other leaders sense the uncertainty in our leader?....as a certain Dick Lee said... "we are looking for a complete package"</div>

Somehow, I fear that MCDSY Youth Dept is going to be an extension of YP, and churn out more yes-men, to keep the ruling party's position intact....in other words, a purely brainwashing-directed move. And anyway, happy outlooks are key in a motivate-people-to-follow-me speech, like the kind of speeches Bush is making to Americans now about his administration.<br><br>Anyway, possible his father's presence made him nervous. I suppose having such a *successful* father and all that kinda makes him feel like a dwarf.<br><br>btw, looking around at various forums, I daresay mainline opinion has not exactly changed even after the speech, which unfortunately sounded pretty fake. the supporters still support, the opposers still reject.<br><br>the pikamastter</div>
