            <div class='col-md body'>Every country's got it's pro and cons. It all depends on how you see it. Since when is Malaysia politically unstable? At least their Umno got a PAS to worry about. How about us? only a single dictated PAP....is this democracy?<br><br>Singapore is stable? In wat sense? As of now, I think we are economcally unstable due the recession and many other factor.<br><br>Malaysia crime rampant? Are the streets in ruins? Are there frequent riots? I don't think so.<br><br>Singapore clean and green? Wat's there to be proud of if our area are maintain why foreign cleaners while we our own people keep littering and throw cigratte bud around?<br><br>I can rattle all thing but wat I'm trying to say is that every country got it's ups and downs. You cannot condemn a country just becoz of some of it's bad side ..... JUst as you cannot judge that a country is best just by words of mouth.<br><br>Singapore may be clean,well defended and politically stable.....but it's not a paradise (high living standards, no welfare, a developed country too fast while people's mindset are still of a developing country, etc....)<br><br>Malaysia may have a higher crime rate, politics and blunt media, but it's still have many good stuff that singapore dun have (the varsity of land, the low cost in living, the laxing of the law, etc...)<br><br>Wat we may persive on other country may not always be true. Some goes for those who pervice our country as evil....they are wrong too.<br><br>Anyway, Singaporean? Not very proud but always wanted to give it a good name.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree that in every nation there are its ups and downs. and Pros and cons.<br><br>As a chinese singaporean. I am facinated and proud to be a singaporean. I dont feel marginalized and i have been given every opportunity to improve myself and my quality of life.<br><br>We dont have underwear gangs and M16 gangs robbing our banks. Our ladies dont have to worry about getting raped by some perverts...and later finding out they need 4  muslim men of good character to testify for them.<br><br>Even In JB my malaysian friends are strongly aware of the gangsterism activities and the muggings.<br><br>People can say watever they want...but i am happy and proud to be living on this side of the causeway. And i feel obligated to defend singapore should she be threatened.<br><br>Everyone knows that Malaysia is years behind singapore. Just ask any cabbie or man on the street and they will tell u anytime singapore is the better place to be. Why do you think PAS is so jealous of singapore? theres absolutely nothing to hide...its so obvious.<br><br>Even in recession our economy is strong. Confidence is strong. And people begin to take this time to educate themselves and train themselves for future employment. Singaporeans dont blame the recession on God and start spending time in dark rooms training to blow  up planes. We dont strap bombs on our bodies and kill bus loads of children. We dont cheer and be hypocritical when we see towers burning...we are geniunly shocked.<br><br>We want progress. We want economic confidence. And we want our pride. Being able to look up and tell the world we are singaporean. However our soverignty must never be compromised by our neighbours bad mouthing us, or trying to hunk us.<br><br>If successful countries gives us some friendly advise...i be happy to see the country learn from them. However if 'certain' neighbours who already change presidents umpteen times in the past five years...or countries that have terrorist walk right into their army camps and ship off loads of guns...come telling singapore that we suck...i can only roll my eye balls up and sip my morning coffee...<br><br>Btw if you have only bad things to say about singapore...pls you are not welcomed in this forums...as this is SG FORUMS.

But there are areas which we need to think about.<br><br>Higher standard of living means higher quality of life? There is also a price to  pay for a  Safer place and cleaner place to live in, nothing comes free. Can you survive in Singapore for  a year without a job? or can earning 2k/month feed a family? I know you can in Malaysia but i  doubt that in Singapore. In times like these, when the government urge the people to expect pay cut, lower bonus, lower pay...how come the government themselve expect a profit from busines their in, aren't we suppose to go inline? Why increase in the standard of living like "Public" transport,  GST and even more ERP gantry? becos the PROFIT is not good enough? Can we say no? For things like PR, i have came across many foreigner easily getting one within a year, maybe you could try to get one in Malaysia, you may not even get one if you stay there for 10 years. Why? becos, the government protect the interest of their own citizen. (I am sorry if i offend any PR).<br><br>Well, do not ask me to migrate, I do have the right to voice my view. Yes, the government of Singapore<br>have also done alot of good work for people and i really hope we can be a even better country as a whole.<br>So let's not compare.<br><br>Btw, if you (Thailand_Hero) wish to post a subjective thread please allow for all type of comments. Unless you already have a answer for yourself then there is no point posting. We are living in a  stressful world already,  by commenting SgForum for Singaporean only and not allowing negative view dun make life easier for both party.<br></div>

Habibie isn't happy wif us cos we were late to congraduate him when he's appointed as president.....DUH???<br><br>And Habibie? He's happily living in UK.....away from the land he's once from. habibie abandon his own country and still talk big about us....HA!</div>
