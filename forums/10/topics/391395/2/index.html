              <p><br>There were competing claims as to who is the Boss - made by the brain, the eyes, the nose, the ears, the mouth, the heart, the arms, the legs, and the anus.</p>
              <p>While everyone ignored the anus for its position at Level 0 - the fight began with all the competing reasons for each to be the most suited candidate to be the Boss.</p>
              <p>The anus held its breathe and refused to open itself for more then a month.</p>
              <p>It did not take long for the stink created that made the eyes dizzy, the ears muffled, the nostrils stuffed, the heart laboring, and the arms and legs weak.</p>
              <p>At the end, they all voluntarily declared to the Arse-hole - YOU are the BOSS.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is not surprising that the Taiwanese 'hum' will be seen to be the Boss, as it claim to have only O Levels, which explain for its conduct in this Forum to be at Level 0.</p>
              <p>The resident Taiwanese 'hum' is an Arse Hole - can it be the Boss ?</p>

              <p>You want safe country, it's easy, impose death long term jail sentences and death penalty, soon enough nobody dares commit crime. There is no justification having multi-million dollar salaries for Ministers just to impose a draconian punishment.</p>

              <p>CPF and HDB go down because opposition in power? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
