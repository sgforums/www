            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by sgdiehard:</div><div class="quote_body">Our public housing went up and down, One minute we have couples queuing for years to get their HDB flats for marriage, the next minute we have in Ponggol thousands of units unoccupied. Upgrading of all flats is good, but it has become political because the ruling party used that as incentive for voters in election. This is when people are beginning to feel that what belong to Singapore belong to PAP, a step over the line.<br><br>I understand there is a problem with labor shortage, and the impact of globalization. I can accept more foreigners coming here to do what we cannot do. But when foreign companies in Singapore are replacing able Singaporeans with foreigners; when PR are enjoying the same benefits as Singaporeans, all with the blessing from the government, solely on lower cost basis, I begin to wonder if our government values us as citizens, or money comes first. Is the nation built for us, or are citizens expandable in building the nation?<br><br>When more and more people are retrenched at earlier age, with problem even finding money to live to 55, the government is extending the CPF withdrawal age to 62, you canÂ’t help but wonder if the government is concerned with the plight of those retrenched or simply afraid that they had to pay out CPF money earlier. After calling for Singaporean to be competitive in view of competition from rising China and India, the government announced their salary increment, and GST increase, I now believe what the Chinese says Â“guan zi liang ge kouÂ” (Government officer has two mouth).<br><br>As aging problem become more imminent, with those born in the 50s, 60s, these old supporters of PAP in the building of Singapore entering their twilight years, the realization that Singaporean life expectancy is now increased to 79, and costs of medical care continue to go up, the government considers their job done after giving us Medisave and MediShield. It is not their responsibility anymore. This is when I question if there is any social morality in those involved in the management of medical services here.<br><br>DonÂ’t get me wrong, I am not - anti PAP. The city of Singapore makes me proud, with garden and cleanliness. I find MRT most convenient as in any world-class modern city, but the taxi service here still sux to the bottom. I am proud as a Singaporean, our SAF is strong, our passports allow me to pass to many countries without visa, Singapore name is known everywhere, we are multi racial, multi religious. But, there are things that Singaporeans need to improve, to change, in order to build on the foundations our forefather laid.<br><br>As a young man, be positive, to what is good and kind, for the people in Singapore; be alert, to gossip and policies that are against the interest of the people; be active, donÂ’t waste too much time on computer games; be responsible, donÂ’t just talk and scold; learn the right values in life, money is not everything; have the right perspective, Singapore is ruled by PAP but does not belong to PAP; take a longer perspective, many things take time to achieve, time is on your side; most importantly, be courageous, you are still young, just donÂ’t make big mistakes that have lasting consequences.<br><br>When you are out, observe the life of those around you, understand them. Read the newspapers and discuss with your parents how some policies affect them and your parents. Write to the press, improve the awareness of fellow Singaporean about our society, especially events that not normally reported. But most importantly, study hard, no guarantee what are the great things you can do for Singapore, but if you fail often in your exam, you can't even write to complain in this forums.<br><br>Have a good day and God bless your future.<br><br>P/S Migrating is not a solution to life and future of Singapore.<br></div></blockquote>I like the way you summarise.<br><br>There are many different comments about singapore's government in this public forum.  some are stating facts, some are somewhat hoping to see singapore disappear for unknown reasons, some are supporters of pap, wp, sdp etc, some are in for fun, some are genuinely concerned, some are scared of future.<br><br>i would like to say that everyone wants "face" and that include PAP mps and ministers.  so probably the correct approach is to collect whatever facts presented by some knowledgeable but anti-pap forumers here and then present/discuss in private with the ministers directly.  this is not impossible.<br><br>i met one minister at an old coffeeshop (80 cents per cup of coffee that type) near where i stay.  he was there with his family for breakfast.  We smiled at each other.  All it took was one additional step from me to start a conversation and a feedback.  I admit i did not take the additional step because i was with my family too and i was not ready to engage in any political discussions.<br><br>if having a coffee talk sounds difficult, one could join the PAP and feedback through the proper channels or even directly to the PM office and attempt to change things for the better.<br><br>remember it is attitude.  if someone says something you dont like to hear, first decide whether he is factual or just anyhow whack, then analyse whether you agree.  if you agree and feel that singapore should improve in some manner, and you are willing to step out, i think the proper way is try talking to the ministers or MPs directly first.

I don't know minor things, but here are a few major things that the PAP DID NOT LISTEN and their policies WERE DECIDED BEFORE 'discussing' with the public<br><br>(1) IR. The way they started the debate, they have already decided to have the IR. People around me, many objected to the IR, and many of my friends said their friends also objected to it but they said Singaporeans support it (duh!!!)<br><br>(2) Ministers pay hike. Don't need to elaborate further<br><br>(3) GST hike. Don't need to elaborate further<br><br>(4) NKF. Did not listen to public complaints, just protect protect protect.</div>
