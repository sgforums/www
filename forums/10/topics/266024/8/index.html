My  friend challenge for facts and asked me not to speculate.<br><br>My reply was, one did not need first hand experience to make reasonable conclusion.<br><br>My premise was that the Govt has an obsession over the control of existing media. (which was a fact).Since Internet is a form of media, logically,wouldnt the govt would attempt to control it, or least contain it?<br><br>I guess in dealing with people who persistently questions for first hand facts is to make a more general statement. For example, instead of saying "The govt does not listen to its citizens when making  decisions",a statement with wider scope such as  "The govt does not listen to its citizens most of the time when making decisions" would be more defensible than the former.<br><br>Looking at the statements by LKY<br><br>Â“I am often accused of interfering in the private lives of citizens. Yes, if I did not, had I not done that, we wouldnÂ’t be here today. And I say without the slightest remorse, that we wouldnÂ’t be here, we would not have made economic progress, if we had not intervened on very personal matters - who your neighbour is, how you live, the noise you make, how you spit, or what language you use. We decide what is right. Never mind what the people think.Â”<br><br>and also the way they handle ministerial pay hike, its logical and reasonable to deduce that the govt does not listen to its people most of the time.<br><br></div></blockquote>very very good point calvin.<br><br>In Singapore, its always like that, secrets are 'open' (ie everyone can see what is going on), but yet, PAP is good at making all legal aspects of the secret invisible, such that though we know its there, we cannot say it openly, unless we want to be sued or jailed.<br><br>For people like Gazelle or oxford mushroom, who demand proof and statistics (even stats can be fabricated) for EVERY single thing, of coz its hard to obtain proof and statistics since every thing's well controlled.<br><br>But, as I spoke to some of the forumers here, in Singapore, you can train your intelligence by seeing beyond what you see, not with your eyes, but with your heart.<br><br>Then, you will realize that, beneath that calm surface, there are a lot of potential problems that are kept away from the public eye<br><br>For those who don't understand, I suggest watching V for Vendetta or even the Matrix<br><br>For those who don't want to understand, I just feel its a very sad case (like the traitor in The Matrix)</div>
