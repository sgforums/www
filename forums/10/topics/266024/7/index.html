YOu don't need to thank me, you just have to be sensible, mature, considerate and reasonable to know what is going on.

I would like to know why they think the people supports it? Where did they conduct their surveys that show people support it?

Similar to what LHL said about the private sector having to have KPIs (Key Performance Indicators), It would be interesting to know how they justify their pay hike by making their own KPIs open and showing how they meet or exceed their KPIs.<br><br>3) GST Hike. If the govt's revenue annually is still healthy, what is the reason for hiking the GST? How is the GST going to help the poor, when they are exactly taxing everyone? It is unacceptable that hiking the GST in good times than in bad times is used as a reason<br><br>4) NKF. The ministers were defending NKF so stoutly when the backbenchers were making queries about NKF, and shouldn't they take the responsibility and the blame (KPI fail) when NKF is found to have committed fraud?

When people read these facts and info, we have our freedom to express our opinions, concerns and comments, so what is there to be verified.  Think this fellow is just attempting to change our mindset about the way we look at the "pay and pay".</div>
