I would like to know why they think the people supports it? Where did they conduct their surveys that show people support it? Does the survey's sample population truly reflect the distribution of the Singapore population?<br><br>2) Pay Hike. Similar to what LHL said about the private sector having to have KPIs (Key Performance Indicators), It would be interesting to know how they justify their pay hike by making their own KPIs open and showing how they meet or exceed their KPIs.<br><br>3) GST Hike. If the govt's revenue annually is still healthy, what is the reason for hiking the GST? How is the GST going to help the poor, when they are exactly taxing everyone? It is unacceptable that hiking the GST in good times than in bad times is used as a reason<br><br>4) NKF. The ministers were defending NKF so stoutly when the backbenchers were making queries about NKF, and shouldn't they take the responsibility and the blame (KPI fail) when NKF is found to have committed fraud? So this links to point 2). How can they justify their pay hike then?<br><br>Go ahead, I am waiting to see what you can bring back.</div>

I would like to know why they think the people supports it? Where did they conduct their surveys that show people support it? Does the survey's sample population truly reflect the distribution of the Singapore population?<br><br>2) Pay Hike. Similar to what LHL said about the private sector having to have KPIs (Key Performance Indicators), I would like to know how they justify their pay hike by making their own KPIs open and showing how they meet or exceed their KPIs.<br><br>3) GST Hike. If the govt's revenue annually is still healthy, what is the reason for hiking the GST? How is the GST going to help the poor, when they are exactly taxing everyone? I find it unacceptable that hiking the GST in good times than in bad times is used as a reason<br><br>4) NKF. The ministers were defending NKF so stoutly when the backbenchers were making queries about NKF, and shouldn't they take the responsibility and the blame (KPI fail) when NKF is found to have committed fraud? So this links to point 2). How can they justify their pay hike then?</div></blockquote>Pay hike - it is not reasonable for them to base on the private sector.  They are politicians running the country, they should base on the pay of their other counterparts are getting from countries all over the world.<br><br>By basing on private sector, it is not a fair comparison.  Compare apple to apple, and durians to durians.  Be fair to us the taxpayers!  Likewise, private companies should base on other private companies to compare the salary for increment and not compare with the govt sector/organisations.  Does not mean which ever has higher pay, we will base on that to get pay that sort of salary, too.  be fair!</div>
