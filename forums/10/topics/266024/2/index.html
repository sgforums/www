For example, some like to portray the government as so heavily dominated by LKY that he becomes "the" government himself. Also, another tactic is to take the individual approach and allege that LKY as an individual took all the credit for himself while downplaying the roles of other capable ministers such as Goh Keng Swee.<br><br>These are just my comments, and should not be taken as any indication of support or disapproval of the present government.

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear unclebutcher,<br><br>Salute you for starting this thread here. If you can stand firm to discern what are one-sided arguments, what is propaganda, and what are simply expressions of dissatisfaction or dissent, you are not a minor anymore.<br><br>Singapore has come along way. Until 1980, the impact of cold war due to difference in ideologies affected and molded us in many different ways. The PAP then certainly deserved all the credits, as the party that led us to independence, from the Brits, and Malaysia. Yes, they had the support of the people, all our forefathers, who were right to elect the PAP as the government. What were the alternatives then: elected the Barisan Socialists, submited to UMNO and stayed as a state of Malaysia, or continued to stay under the Brit as a colony.<br><br>Would any of these alternatives be better than the PAP? I doubt so. The worse would be to stay under the Brits as a colony. HK Chinese never had the Brits passports; neither would Singaporeans ever become Brits citizens. The Brits would want a local government to run Singapore to ensure there were enough tax money to go back to the queen, and if LKY agrees, instead of Chris Patten, we would have a government under LKY, and the system of elitism remains, for the few who are willing to serve the masters. The running dogs of the colonial master vs. the dogs of PAP..Â… Today I remain a Singaporean where I were a PAP dog or not, under the Brits, if I were not a running dog, I would be nobody.<br><br>The passport of the Special Administrative Region of China, HK is still more valuable than the passport of the State of Singapore, a Colony of the UK.<br><br>Before 1980, I would say that we owe the progress of Singapore to PAP, together with all our forefathers for their sacrifices in founding and building Singapore. And in the PAP, all the old cadre, LKY, Goh Keng Swee, Toh Chin Chye, Rajaratnam, ..... deserve our respect.<br><br>..... to be continued.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>We entered the 80s, the 90s, into the millennium. The cold war is over, China has opened up, national security was not a big problem except to prepare for possible regional conflicts. The next phase of national building took place. In foreign relation we extended and enhanced our relationships with countries far and wide.  Our economy were transformed to be competitive, labors are not cheap anymore, so we went high tech, we invested in the region, and riding on the growth of world and regional economic boom, our economy grew even stronger, until 1997. Everything positive, and I also welcome the incentives for more children rather than the previous penalty for more than two children policy.<br><br>But during this period, the educational system took a turn into a mess. The merging of Nantah with SU, the EM3, the normal express gifted streams, later the independent schools, .Â…. and among these there are changes that are not part of the system, we had River Valley High School located in Ulu Pandan, and Tanglin School located at West Coast. All these confused the parents like hell. Nobody really knew coming or going. This was the result of Dr. Tony Tan, after visiting many schools in Europe and America. Still, there appears to be no end to such changesÂ…<br><br>This period would have been a perfect timing for growth and maturity in our political system. More people should come forth to participate in politics, to represent the voices of different segments of the society, the aging, and the growing upÂ…. unfortunately, with the booming economy, not many people were interested, besides, the ruling party make it very costly for any mistake made by opposition. We are even more unfortunate to have oppositions who were not disciplined enough and got sued for misappropriating governmentÂ’s postal services. Though we have more young faces in the parliament now, but all from the same camp. So one side get stronger and stronger with the other side weaker and weaker.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Our public housing went up and down, One minute we have couples queuing for years to get their HDB flats for marriage, the next minute we have in Ponggol thousands of units unoccupied. Upgrading of all flats is good, but it has become political because the ruling party used that as incentive for voters in election. This is when people are beginning to feel that what belong to Singapore belong to PAP, a step over the line.<br><br>I understand there is a problem with labor shortage, and the impact of globalization. I can accept more foreigners coming here to do what we cannot do. But when foreign companies in Singapore are replacing able Singaporeans with foreigners; when PR are enjoying the same benefits as Singaporeans, all with the blessing from the government, solely on lower cost basis, I begin to wonder if our government values us as citizens, or money comes first. Is the nation built for us, or are citizens expandable in building the nation?<br><br>When more and more people are retrenched at earlier age, with problem even finding money to live to 55, the government is extending the CPF withdrawal age to 62, you canÂ’t help but wonder if the government is concerned with the plight of those retrenched or simply afraid that they had to pay out CPF money earlier. After calling for Singaporean to be competitive in view of competition from rising China and India, the government announced their salary increment, and GST increase, I now believe what the Chinese says Â“guan zi liang ge kouÂ” (Government officer has two mouth).<br><br>As aging problem become more imminent, with those born in the 50s, 60s, these old supporters of PAP in the building of Singapore entering their twilight years, the realization that Singaporean life expectancy is now increased to 79, and costs of medical care continue to go up, the government considers their job done after giving us Medisave and MediShield. It is not their responsibility anymore. This is when I question if there is any social morality in those involved in the management of medical services here.<br><br>DonÂ’t get me wrong, I am not - anti PAP. The city of Singapore makes me proud, with garden and cleanliness. I find MRT most convenient as in any world-class modern city, but the taxi service here still sux to the bottom. I am proud as a Singaporean, our SAF is strong, our passports allow me to pass to many countries without visa, Singapore name is known everywhere, we are multi racial, multi religious. But, there are things that Singaporeans need to improve, to change, in order to build on the foundations our forefather laid.<br><br>As a young man, be positive, to what is good and kind, for the people in Singapore; be alert, to gossip and policies that are against the interest of the people; be active, donÂ’t waste too much time on computer games; be responsible, donÂ’t just talk and scold; learn the right values in life, money is not everything; have the right perspective, Singapore is ruled by PAP but does not belong to PAP; take a longer perspective, many things take time to achieve, time is on your side; most importantly, be courageous, you are still young, just donÂ’t make big mistakes that have lasting consequences.<br><br>When you are out, observe the life of those around you, understand them. Read the newspapers and discuss with your parents how some policies affect them and your parents. Write to the press, improve the awareness of fellow Singaporean about our society, especially events that not normally reported. But most importantly, study hard, no guarantee what are the great things you can do for Singapore, but if you fail often in your exam, you can't even write to complain in this forums.<br><br>Have a good day and God bless your future.<br><br>P/S Migrating is not a solution to life and future of Singapore.<br></div>
