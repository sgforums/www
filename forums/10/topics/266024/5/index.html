The official statements were weapons of mass desstruction and spreading democracy in middle east through Iraq.    Do the rest of the world really believe in the official statements?  are official statements always telling the whole truth?<br><br>likewise, when the ministers got a big pay rise, the reason might not convince everyone.  the next question is, what then is the real truth?  the real truth can be good, it can be bad too.  it is up to our imaginations.  I can easily imagine a few good reasons why they do it.  you certainly imagined the bad ones.  but you and myself are none the wiser.  only when we make the extra effort to discover the real truth, it is back down to speculation.<br><br></div></blockquote>This, has nothing to do with what the US have done to Iraq, but from lame reasons to hogwash, the bottom line objective is OIL.... when money and power is concern, there is no room for TRUTHS.<br><br>The public is only left with the option to speculate because the gov hardly ever sincerely communicate with the public, the policies they implement except for simply anouncing its implementation. Transparency is just a fancy term, its meaning adopted and modified beyong original defiinition.<br><br>But I do agree there some little things they have done over the recent years that benefited the people to some extent, such as allowing for Home Businesses, and for individuals to pedal services and goods in HDB estates provided they register themselves.<br><br>However, over the years, whatever good they have done, has been buried by the number of increases in basic needs and essentials such as Tarriffs, Public Transport, School Fees, HealthCare (hospital charges), GST, Season Parking in HDB MSCPs, and etc...<br><br>They give a dollar, but takes back 50 dollars...!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>My fellow forumer, the bad they have done, far out-weighs the good they have shown us...<br><br></div>
