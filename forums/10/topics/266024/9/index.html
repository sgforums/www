Without us, they can't get to where they are today, but to them without them we will become maids.  We see from here there is division - they and us. They and us! To me if the govt is genuinely serving the people with their hearts and souls, they will not make such a statement.  govt with hearts and souls for the people will say we, we , we!!!<br><br>Without us, they can't give themselves super high pay.</div>

Shareholders, board of directors, top management are the happiest people in the corporation/co when the company makes tons of money.  They are the first to enjoy the fruit while claiming that their leadership is so effective and the staff are so obedient to them.  Top over bottom!  People at the bottom have no say!  A business organisation's goal is always to earn lots of $$$$, most don't care about the wellbeing, welfare of the employees,<br><br>Gandhi is indeed respectable.  There is no Gandhi in Singapore.</div>

MIW are really genuinely too much allow any kind of foreigners here to compete jobs with the locals.   Locals are the ones who have to face the ssshhhitttt from the MIW, while these people if they don't like it, they just pack and go back.  MIW are the ungrateful lot of people, we the citizens contribute to the country and yet they refuse to protect our rice bowls.    All the lee hsien loong can say is upgrade upgrade.  What does he know about what we are facing, there are people who have upgraded and yet can't find jobs.  He only sit in the air con room and think of nuisance to make our lives difficult.</div>

In my OPINION, the baby boomers retirement is a big problems faced by the world's countries universally other than global warming.  There will be many media reports of how bad the real situation is in the western and eastern countries.  This will tell whether the PAP party has prepared well for most of our aging parents.

Becoz I don't have proof and statistics to back myself up, legally and statistically speaking, I cannot be very sure.<br><br>That's why I am still waiting for those who see the Govt as a good govt, to back up the policies they have implemented so far, and help the Govt explain their positions.<br><br>The govt always say it cannot afford to explain and explain and explain, coz it has to move fast to help Singapore, so why can't those whom think they are good, help them to explain to us poor citizens?<br><br>And with your above statement, you are sidestepping like what our ministers do. I am inviting you to raise your opinions on why you think the 4 topics I raised are justified, and as I mentioned, its open to debate.</div>
