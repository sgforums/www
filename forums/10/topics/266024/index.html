Of course, we are thankful for what the present govt did in the past to bring Singapore this far.  Bear in mind, the building of Singapore is not by the present govt alone, it is together with the people of Singapore.  So sorry to say that we are made believe to think that PAP or MM Lee built Singapore alone.  Nobody can cope with such great project like building a country alone.<br><br>We canÂ’t keep basing on the past history/past results of the present govt to look at them.  You know it is like, you canÂ’t base on your employeeÂ’s last year excellent performance to keep rewarding him when his present performance is bad.  If you do, you are encouraging bad performance.  Likewise, we take stock of what the govt did and is doing as leaders of/to our nation.<br><br>It will be good if you can gather more facts and reality before talking on this.<br></div>
