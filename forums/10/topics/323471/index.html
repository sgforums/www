              <div>We have a lot of different agencies handling different issues we have in Singapore ... ever wonder y we dun have 1 monitoring the bridal boutiques?</div>
              <div>Have v bad experience with bridal boutique, not only myself but only heard from other friends... Just wondering y no policing? Wedding is a one-time affair &amp; some of these cunning merchants are just out to make $$$ without providing the service.<br><br>Misrepresentations are what most couples met with.. say this to you when signing but when time comes, they don't give you what they said. Then they claimed they did not say that or that you interpret wrongly. <br><br>Clever people said "make them write in black &amp; white". Merchants are cleverer.. they write very vaguely &amp; in words that can be represented in such a manner that it works well for them. Some are so evil that they try to rid your worries saying "don't worry, we will definitely do that" &amp; try to change topic so that they don't need to put into words.<br><br>Some said couples can do homework by going through forum comments. If you read &amp; think carefully, don't you find it weird that some people always side with the boutique, showing little or no sympathy to those whom we think are pitiful? Sometimes they even scold those people who gave bad comments. Anyway are you sure those who said good things are not boutique staff or owners? There's no restriction to how many "identities" one can assume in cyberspace.<br><br>One super lousy &amp; silly policy/excuse i heard: <br><span style="color: #0000ff;">"Our company policy is NOT to call customers, anything we only tell them face-to-face."</span> Guess nothing much i need to say about this... we can straight away tell what is the mission of the bridal boutique.</div>
              <div>The other thing that I could hardly believe came out of the same boutique: "<span style="color: #0000ff;">The staff who was in charge of your photos editing has left and we can't find your photos</span>" When asked for them to return call, staff simply answered "<span style="color: #0000ff;">we are very busy, no time to call you..."</span></div>
              <div>Another fav act that these boutique owners like to do... sign up many packages then  "close shop" with the money. I'm sure many might have heard of Focus but that is certainly not the only one as I heard. Just heard that another quite famous boutique with proclaimed photographer who have won awards and even took photos for the celebrities had also just changed hands... Who knows what happened to the customers who signed up and their wedding dates are near. Worse still, how will they react if they go back to the shop 1 day happily thinking of their upcoming wedding and were caught by surprise when they saw the shop changed name? <br><br>So how? After all most of us only get married once &amp; these merchants play their tricks ever so often. What can we do? It seems in the end, the couples always are the ones who suffer.</div>
