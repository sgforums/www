            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE : Singapore's declining birth rate is a cause for concern as it will have a severe impact on the country's future and the Singaporean identity, says Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong.<br><br>He said that Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong will also address this problem at his National Day Rally on Sunday.<br><br>While he admitted that reversing the decline is not easy, Mr Goh revealed that the government will try again, not with bonuses or incentives this time, <strong>but by looking into making parenthood and raising a family easier</strong>.<br><br>Mr Goh was speaking at his constituency's annual National Day dinner on Saturday evening.<br><br>"Can Singapore be a viable city state which can prosper for another 100, 200 or 300 years or more? I believe we can," Mr Goh said.<br><br>And one of the reasons is Singapore's people.<br><br>Mr Goh said the problem was that Singaporeans were not replacing themselves, with fewer Singaporean babies born each year.<br><br>Some 35,500 babies were born here last year, compared to a high of nearly 56,000 when the country gained independence in 1965.<br><br>The number of births per female fell to 1.24 last year, compared to 4.66 in 1965 - meaning population growth is not fast enough to even replace both parents.<br><br>This trend is also evident in Mr Goh's constituency Marine Parade, where there were just 15,400 voters in the recent General Election, compared to 19,500 thirty years ago.<br><br>Said Mr Goh, "For our Chinese population, the situation is even graver. Now, I go back to 1957, the first year we had the data - there were 6.48 babies per Chinese female ... Last year, it was only 1.08 per Chinese female. And if it goes down to below 1.08 - and I think there's a danger it may do so - we will not even be replacing even the mother! Will Singapore last 100 years if local-born Singaporeans are becoming an endangered species?"<br><br>Mr Goh added that Singapore had no natural resources except its people, but with fewer babies and a declining fertility rate, this vital resource was not being renewed.<br><br>This would lead to problems in the future, with a lack of manpower, skills and young men to defend the country.<br><br>Mr Goh also made a plea to young couples who belonged to the "double income no kids" (DINKs) group.<br><br>Drawing from his personal experience, Mr Goh said, "<strong>My wife and I are fortunate that our son and daughter are not DINKs. They do not have a double income. My daughter is not working; my daughter-in-law is also not working, so no double income</strong>. They have three children each, which means my wife and I have six grandchildren - and they are all granddaughters. And because they are all granddaughters, there may be a chance that my son and his wife, my daughter and her husband may want a boy - or that's what I hope!"<br><br><strong>But he reminded Singaporeans that this was a problem that could only be reversed by the people themselves, and not the government.</strong> - CNA /ct<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>"Mr Goh said, "My wife and I are fortunate that our son and daughter are not DINKs. They do not have a double income. My daughter is not working; my daughter-in-law is also not working, so no double income. They have three children each, which means my wife and I have six grandchildren - and they are all granddaughters. And because they are all granddaughters, there may be a chance that my son and his wife, my daughter and her husband may want a boy - or that's what I hope!"<br><br>But he reminded Singaporeans that this was a problem that could only be reversed by the people themselves, and not the government. "</strong><br><br>I think the man has gone senile in his old age. With shrinking incomes and longer working hours, how the fuck are most of us going to raise kids on single incomes? Even double income is a problem for many.<br><br>I'm constantly amazed at how detached from reality the PAP idiots are. Of course its easy for them to reproduce like rabbits on their inflated paychecks.<br><br>Telling people to raise children while most are trying to make ends meet is morally reprehensible.<br><br></div>

Eg a life is only complete if you start a "family" etc.<br><br>I personally know a Malay chap who has 12 children and he earns only $1200 a month. Wife is of course taking care of the kids. He stays in Yishun (Anyone knows him?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> ) Now u wonder how he remembers all their b'days.....he is being plain selfish, thinking that more children means more prosperity.<br><br>A child is a liability. If a S'porean already owns a car, having another kid is like owning another car. If one has 2 kids, then make it 3 cars. The bloody baby bonus is nothing to trumpet about, govt shd wake up. Its payout is for the initial baby stage, what about life after that? Stupid people, really no brains.<br><br>Oh my, better stop.....turning into a whiner!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

It's up to the couple whether they would like to have kids. If the couple choose not to, how much can the government help? Give incentives? Tighten regulations? Will all these help in the first place?<br><br>Straits Times once reported that some couples feel that even if you give them incentives, they wouldn't want to have kids, because it's too costly. Even if the government is willing to give free food for the kids for the first few years, they still aren't willing to have. On the regulations part, companies are abusing it. A lot of women has been retrenched because they are pregnant and government can't really help, even with incentives in. Tightening of regulations won't help much either, as there will definitely be ways to bypass it. It's a matter of time.</div>
