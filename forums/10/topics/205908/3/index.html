The mother was desperate to stop but what was telling was the father's perception: that children are 'assets'.<br><br>The young working generation today has been trained and trained well to look at life in terms of assets and liabilities.<br><br>Even in the Sunday papers, there is page after page of advice on how to lower liabilities and increase assets.<br><br>And the truth is that children today are liabilities; a drain in terms of time, money, attention and almost every aspect of any parent's life.<br><br>We hear stories of parents mortgaging their homes to provide funds for a university education, or even working double shifts just to make ends meet, or for that extra dollar for music lessons.<br><br>In fact, some of the successful people in Singapore, including some in Parliament, are unmarried.<br><br>How then can we sell the message to have more babies to our younger generation wholeheartedly?<br><br>With the ever-increasing emphasis to make it in this tiny island, and with the perception that almost everything is getting more expensive, I really do not see the birth rate climbing until somehow these young ones come around to seeing children as assets.<br><br>So as far as I can see, on a personal level, issues of a non-replacing population and the need to import new citizens mean nothing to these persons.<br><br>Until children are proven not to be a drain, nothing positive will happen.<br><br>This time next year, as it has happened since MM Lee raised it about 10 years ago, the same issue will again be raised.<br><br>Michael Loh Yik Ming<br><br><a href="http://straitstimes.asiaone.com/portal/site/STI/menuitem.c2aef3d65baca16abb31f610a06310a0/?vgnextoid=7532758920e39010VgnVCM1000000a35010aRCRD&amp;vgnextfmt=vgnartid:9dfd2726bd13d010VgnVCM100000430a0a0aRCRD" rel="nofollow">http://straitstimes.asiaone.com/portal/site/STI/menuitem.c2aef3d65baca16abb31f610a06310a0/?vgnextoid=7532758920e39010VgnVCM1000000a35010aRCRD&amp;vgnextfmt=vgnartid:9dfd2726bd13d010VgnVCM100000430a0a0aRCRD</a><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>One issue here is the mindset of people. Look at sub-Sahara Africa for example. The large majority of people there struggle on subsistence level, but birth-rates are high. Not saying that we are having it easy here, but we surely cannot say that we are having it as bad. We just want to ensure that our children are well taken care of if we do want to have children.<br><br>Anyway things do look quite gloomy. I doubt the FTs would settle here and contribute their sons for NS.</div>
