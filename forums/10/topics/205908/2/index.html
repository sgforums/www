My daughter is not working; my daughter-in-law is also not working, so no double income. They have three children each, which means my wife and I have six grandchildren - and they are all granddaughters. And because they are all granddaughters, there may be a chance that my son and his wife, my daughter and her husband may want a boy - or that's what I hope!"<br><br>gong lan jiao wei!!!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It'll be interesting to see the foreign population slowly but surely overtake the local population. For one thing, the size of our armed forces will shrink because there are less locals to be conscripted, while the foreign migrants will mostly leave after only staying a few years, as they will prefer to have their children in countries with no conscription. This will have serious consequences for our security situation. Which in turn will further affect our attractiveness to foreign investors. I can understand why the PAP is worried but I'm still not going to turn my life and my unborn children's into a living hell just to provide warm bodies for the armed forces.</div>

Then why don't cherish the people of Singapore?? Instead of driving people to brink and saying that we should take care of ourselves.<br><br>Ok, we take care of ourslevs lah.. we decide not to pay so much tax to government. Government should go take care of themselves too!!!<br><br>HOw about that?<br><br>Gov don't owe us a living, we also don't need to owe them a living!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think we are too quick to point a finger at our government at the low birth-rate. The Germans, Japanese, Italians, French, white urban Americans all have the same problem. Can't say that ALL the governments are at fault eh?<br><br>I think one part of our problem is that urban culture simply does not encourage couples having children. It is just too bad. Singapore is one big city, and city-dwellers have their hands full trying to earn a living. Of course, the government should try to bring down our costs of living so that women can spend a few years bringing up junior without fearing for the family's livelihoods.<br><br>Another issue here is the fragmentation of our once three-tier families. My babies just came, and without the help of my in-laws, there would have been NO way my wife and I could cope. Our parents or the grandparents have been around to help in the past, now it seems that our younger generation finds it more difficult to "enlist" their help.<br><br>The government is right on one thing though. This can be disastrous if not arrested. Our sons are needed to serve NS. What would happen when there are not enough hands carrying rifles and the FTs decide to return to their homelands or to the US? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>
