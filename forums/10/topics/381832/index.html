              <p><strong>Robert Ho alleges that Lee Kuan Yew  rigged 1963  Elections<br></strong></p>
              <p>In the 1963 GE, LIE KY cheated again. The Barisan was leading by
                                      a landslide in the counting, in 30 constituencies out of the 50. Then, PM LIE KY caused an electricity ‘blackout’ around the
                                      City Hall counting centre, ordered everyone out, and changed the
                                      votes. After 6 hours, when electricity was ‘restored’, LIE ‘won’ by
                                      a landslide.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> Go to the National Library and check the microfilms of

              <p>What motivated the Taiwanese 'hum' from leaving Taiwan, or has all its repeated complaints in Taiwan fallen on deaf ears ?</p>
              <p>For a Taiwanese 'hum' who just got its Singapore Citizenship, it is amazing that it will dare to criticize Singaporeans when it knows nothing about the hardships of families who have been living here faithfully since the PAP stepped into power in 1957.</p>
              <p>The Taiwanese 'hum' attempts to derail the threads in this Speaker's Corner is obvious to fulfill its gratitude to PAPa for the ease to obtain the Singapore Citizenship at the expense of the interests of Singaporeans who were born and raised here.</p>

              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/IA20Ae01.html"><strong>‘Singaporean cyber-dissident speaks his mind’</strong> </a></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 5.75pt 0pt 0in;"><span style="font-size: 9pt; "><span style="font-family: Arial Unicode MS;">By Martyn See</span></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> SINGAPORE - Robert Ho is arguably Singapore's leading cyber-dissident. In late 2001, Ho was arrested in his home for allegedly posting "inflammatory" articles online during the general elections, representing the first-ever case of its kind. <br><br>In 2002, after an as-yet-unspecified article(s) was posted on the soc.culture.singapore newsgroup, police entered his home, seized his computer and served him a summons to attend an investigation. <br><br>Three weeks later, he was forcibly taken to a police station by officers who entered his home without a warrant or a charge. In 2005, on returning from a shopping mall where he had distributed flyers alleging electoral fraud, he was again apprehended and his computer seized. <br><br>In all, he has been arrested an additional three times since 2001, and on repeated occasions the authorities have remanded him at a mental institution. He has yet to be prosecuted for any of the alleged offences, although a criminal-defamation case is still pending from 2002. <br><br>While other critics, including international publications, have yielded to defamation threats from Singapore's political leaders, Robert Ho has emerged from his arrests and detentions even more recalcitrant against the establishment. <br><br>In Singapore's political cyberspace, where fear of surveillance and potential libel suits have compelled many dissident netizens and bloggers to post articles under pseudonyms, Ho continues to stick his neck out by disclosing his real identity online. <br><br>He is now a regular contributor to the <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Sg_Review/"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Singapore Review</span></span></a> newsgroup and is a <a href="http://i-came-i-saw-i-solved-it.blogspot.com/"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">blogger</span></span></a>. <br><br>Fellow blogger and independent filmmaker Martyn See interviewed Ho via e-mail and telephone last month. A longer version of the interview was first published at the blogspot <a href="http://singaporerebel.blogspot.com/"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">singaporerebel</span></span></a>. <br><br><em><strong>See:</strong></em> In 2001, you became the first person in Singapore to be arrested for posting an article on the Internet. What happened? <br><br><em><strong>Ho: </strong></em>On November 16, 2001, about 11:15am, eight serious stern men rang my doorbell and came into my flat. They quickly searched my entire flat, asked for my computer and took it as well as every single computer-related device from printers, floppy disks, CD-ROMs [and] modems to cables. <br><br>They then took me away to the CID [Central Investigation Department] Police Cantonment Complex. Being arrested and having all my entire computer system confiscated was quite unnerving and disconcerting. The handcuffs were locked on so tight I suffered a pinched nerve in my left wrist for weeks after. <br><br>At the CID, I was questioned for hours, during which I dictated my statements to [police official] Soh Kien Peng. I finished the statements around 14:05pm, pleading not guilty in summation to the charge of posting in soc.culture.singapore my article entitled "Break the law and get away with it, like PAP", posted on October 19, 2001. This article is also posted in "Singaporeans for Democracy" at www.sfdonline.org. [This was a reference to the ruling People's Action Party.] <br><br>After my statements were recorded, edited and signed, I was taken to a cell where I was to spend the night on the bare floor. The next morning, I was driven to the Subordinate Courts, where I awaited my turn for the judge to deal with me. We accused were processed like an assembly line, with each one getting very limited time or attention. Singapore efficiency, if you like. <br><br>When my turn came to plead, I tried to tell the judge that I wanted to claim trial and ask for release on bail, since my offense was probably bailable, being merely an [online] posting in a newsgroup. She was impatient, there being about 100 accused to process that morning before her lunch. I spoke into the microphone that she should not treat me on the basis of "once a madman always a madman", but I was sent to the Institute for Mental Health (IMH) for observation anyway. <br><br>In IMH, the doctors see us about once a week, so it took about three weeks before the doctor assigned to me could finalize his report, which was "fit for trial", which is another way of saying that I was not mentally ill. The charge against me was "incitement to violence" for asking voters to enter the polling stations without authorization. That this was a trumped-up charge, with very serious jail terms. <br><br>At trial, after I was released from IMH ... prosecutor Han Ming Kuang read the psychiatrist's report on me, but only the old historical parts and not the conclusion, which is that I am fit for trial, to show that I was unfit for trial! Who would believe the truth of my mental state: a [public prosecutor] and the Straits Times or the psychiatrist who saw me? I was told beforehand by Soh that the charge would be dropped, and that once released from court I was to avoid reporters and leave the courthouse. So I left the Subordinate Courts, collected my entire computer system back from the CID, and went home without giving any interviews to reporters. <br><br>[Prosecutor] Han took so long to read all the old historical parts that the judge told him testily to stop. But Han continued anyway. The next day I knew why. He was reading not for the court, but for the Straits Times reporters present. The next day's Straits Times carried a large report of Han's readings to give the impression that I was mad and that was why the charge was dropped. At that time, Han Fook Kwang was editor, now chief editor I believe, of</p>

              <p><br>The noise from Taiwanese 'hum' is made louder with the imbecilic idiocy that can only come from the useless flapping of its clitoris to make itself noticed in a public forum.</p>
              <p>The idea of a Taiwanese 'hum' is to arrange for the most jumbled details that can be stuffed into a confused paragraph so as to obfuscate any views from anyone that is prepared to read its response.</p>
              <p>Time and again, whether it is a one line statement posted, or if there is any effort to be more productive with its intellect, all that the Taiwanese 'hum' can manage is to create more irrelevance with its imbecilic reasoning and failed thinking.</p>
              <p>The reason is to keep itself happy by reaching its orgasmic pleasures to draw away all the attention in this and nay thread - and notice its presence to have a useless argument so as to drive the thread off track.</p>
              <p>Any achievement to draw anyone to debate with the "hum" will result in meeting its objective to get an orgasmic kick as an "Attention Seeking Whore".</p>
