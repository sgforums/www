            <div class='col-md body'>In my own opinion, Chee is a clown and i don't quite agree with his action most of the time. That's a 100% fact. But it's also a fact at least that he's one of us, a singaporean. Do you guys feel great putting down your own pple. Did he do great harms to you guys to earn such a verbal bombardment from you guys? Did he raise the Taxes and benefit from it to make life difficult for you pple during this crisis. I really don't understand. Why is there lack of transparency within the political system such that we the commoner don't even know what the government is up to or did behind our back? Since the government have total legitimate reasons for taking action against Chee, why did they refuse to let him get his own lawyers who offered their service in sympathy for a singaporean's predicament on the political stage that is notorious for it's unfairness. Scare to take up the challenge or lose out when the truth is being presented on the table? The government has anything to hide?

So much hidden loses to be incurred on us the pple. And still so much club house, golf field to be built to satisfy all the rich and influential pple, SAF officer etc. Lots of redundent stuffs needing lots of money from you pple.

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, kyo23, why is it that you seem to be continuously against the idea of MP being paid a high salary and also about mindef willingless to take care of its men. If Govt don't pay a high salary, do you think anyone will want to take up the burden of running the country. It is the same analogy why CEOs are paid higher salary than factory workers. Both of them have different responsibilities. As for the club house for SAF officers, if I recall, there is only one for officers and one for WOSEs. THe rest of the SAFRA clubhouses are for NSMen to use. That shows that SAF does not just favour officers or any other higher ranked specialists. If you are still unhappy about it, do something to change it, set up your own political party and run for the next election. Until you can do that and do a better job than them, perhaps you should try to understand how difficult the job is for a MP.<br><br>Wonder why people keep on complaining about the 5% GST? Have they lived in Europe before?Let me tell you from my experience as well as my fellow british students while I was studying in UK, the tax there is a lot higher and it does not benefit the citizen or as what you think. Yes, you don't have to pay for medical consultation but you have to pay Â£6 for each prescribed medicine. People needed to wait at least 3 months before they get to see a specialist. The income tax is about 25% for annual income less than Â£33K and about 40% for anything more. Everything you buy is charged at a 17.5% VAT (GST equivalent). It is even worse in other european countries where the VAT can go as high as 25%. Why is that so, because the govt takes care of people who chose not to work and still get some allowance each month. Not to mention feeding those drug addicts.<br><br>Cars are cheap here, but not the cost of maintaining it. Petrol in UK is the most expensive. Imagine buying a normal CD and it costs Â£15. That is equivalent of paying S$40 for it. And a simple fish and chip cost Â£2.50 (S$7.50). So that's how expensive it is to live in UK.<br><br>So before anyone harped on 5% GST is unbearable, maybe they should take a look at how other countries are faring with their even higher tax.<br><br>[This message has been edited by cez (edited 27 April 2002).]</div>

It has never been about him not being a Singaporean and not representing or reflecting our views. Of course he does to a certain extent, trust me when I say that his phrase 'the new poor' did indeed strike a chord with me. But being able to come up with a little catch phrase is different from substanting it and putting it into effective political gain. And it is on that point that Chee is being criticised here, inter alia, for his abhorant behaviour and his lack of civic mindedness, and his political clumsiness.<br><br>on 2), your allegation of the unfairness of the political system. You allude to the the system being slanted against opposition members here, so:<br><br>I hereby challenge you to prove it here substantially. I'm willing to put myself on the line here and rebut each and every one of your substantive (if you have any) points on why, where, how, when the political / judicial system has been unfair.<br>And when i mean substantial, I don't mean your own opinion of that 'your friends thought so to'<br>Prove it on points of law and on points of fact.<br><br>PROVE IT.<br>or retract your statement.</div>

Kyo23, there is no such thing as equality. Equality among people itself is a myth. The closest U can come to it is meritocracy which your government is or attempting to implement in your nation.<br><br>Even in communist states, there is no such thing as equality among the people. If U were to pay a highly educated person whose responsibility is much greater than a lowly educated one, who in the right mind would want to work his ass out? Get real...there is no scuh thing as people working for free or for peanuts....U pay peanuts U get monkeys.<br>To get the top talent, U need to pay out the best salary. The government and MNCs are competing for the same brains. The only pull or push factor that would bring one to the other is the money involved or paid out.<br><br>And if U think 5% is alot....do go Australia and have a look. U can rest assure that taxes there are much worse.<br><br>And lastly, as for Chee, I do not wish to say anything since this is not my country and I have no wish to interfere.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Kyo23....if you feel so strongly against things here, why don't you stand up and solve it? Lip-service amount to nothing.<br><br>Great harm you say? Much rubbish had come out from the tongue of his which seriously undermines his credibility as a Singaporean much less an opposition leader.<br><br>No transparency? If there is anyone to blame, the first to be so is yourself. Instead of ranting here, why don't you ask some one from the civil service or even better your MP? There is also the Straits Times forum for you to write to. If you had not done all these, then don't accuse the other party first. There is no initative on your part to ask in the first place.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Rudin (edited 27 April 2002).]</div>

No, for someone like him, I'm pegging the bar for him much much lower.<br>If he can't help out in S'pore's development, then the least he can do is to shut his defamatory mouth; which unless he can prove his statements of Singapore's lack of transparency.<br>Which I'm still waiting to hear from .</div>

In the USA, its 10 years. Here, there is no official policy of de-classifying documents at all. Its not how old a country is, but whether its committed to the principles of a civic and open society or not.</div>
