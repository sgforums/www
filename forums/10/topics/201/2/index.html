That's a 100% fact. But it's also a fact at least that he's one of us, a singaporean. Do you guys feel great putting down your own pple.  </div></blockquote>being a s'porean is more than just bout being born in this country. its bout being happy to be born here, being proud of this country.<br>now, i'm not tokkin bout blind patriotism, which some ppl tend to do. blind patriotism is the same as ignorance, to show pride and say u love this country and u willing to die for this country simply becoz u think u shd be proud of this country, and look down on ppl who convey the slightest displeasure at this country. at least know why and what this country has that u are proud of.<br>i feel its ok to question, to debate. but underneath it all, be aware that one must show respect for this country. s'pore has its fine points, it's bad points, like any other nation, but its s'pore nonetheless. wat u may find good for s'pore may not be the same as others.<br>chee is trying to force his vision of s'pore onto the ppl. unfortunate for him that many do not share his vision. it is absolutely wrong to insist on a demonstration even when u are aware that without a permit u are breaking the law. to flout the laws of this nation is to blatantly show disrespect. admittedly one can argue that he will not get the permit perhaps becoz the govt wants to protect mainstream view and stifle the spread of chee's views, thereby implying a restriction in freedom of expression. but the govt does this simply becoz they do not want its ppl divided, they do not want to change a system proven to work. when was the last time there was a violent demonstration in s'pore? rioting? today, more than just being afraid of the law, ppl refrain from such acts becoz they feel it is wrong, to disturb the peace is undesirable.<br>the govt has achieved its aim, which is peace among the ppl, peace in the streets. yes, at the expense of restriction in freedom of expression, but THAT is s'pore. and most s'poreans accept that, accept that sacrifice they have to make for a better living. and being a s'porean is about accepting s'pore for its good as well as for its bad. you cannot satisfy everybody. but if most ppl are happy with the way things are, why must u insist on imposing your vision into the ppl?<br>if you want us to regard chee as a fellow s'porean, then let him show that he deserves to be called a s'porean. it is not about his views, it is about his actions. i am not one to say that oppositon members are 'uns'porean', u can disagree wif the govt but as long as it is done wif respect for the govt, and more importantly for the ppl, than i will regard u as a fellow s'porean. to flout the laws is to show immense disrespect, and i loathe to regard u as a fellow s'porean.<br><br>------------------<br>RockerZ!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>What I find stupid about this affair is that this Clown prefers to make ways abroad rather than to understand the needs of the people. He chooses to pick on selected issues without painting the broad picture to the general audience.<br><br>Sometimes I wonder whose opinion is more valuable top him...the foreign so called human rights groups, who seem bent on disrupting and destroying whatever we hold dear or true, or the people whom he claim to serve and sacrifice for.<br><br>Even giving him the benifit of the doubt in the matter above, his actions and ways of carry things out are not what you expect of a gentleman, like beening willing to flout the laws of your nation, shout at your Prime Minister etc.<br><br>Chee the Clown should consider taking a leaf out of Mr. Liow and Mr Chiam before doing anything else. His fish-market politics will do him no good here.<br><br>Calling this clown an opposition leader is the greatest insult to the opposition in Singapore.</div>

He is simply playing to the foreign gallery of civil liberties and human rights groups, goading the government at their behest to do things to gain attention so he can be called things like "maverick politician" in the foreign press, while allowing them to accomplish their agenda to make Singapore look bad in others eyes. In exchange he gets financial support to carry out his antics. He has no concern for the bread and butter issues which are the concern of ordinary Singaporeans, which should be his priority, rather than human rights or free speech. Read my lips, Dr Chee, if you're reading this:<br><br>You're a stooge, nothing but a puppet. I have nothing but contempt for you.</div>

It happens that our PM and Dr chee is at jurong west area, walking around, talking to the residents that morning.<br><br>If Dr chee would like to know what really "happen" to the money, i believe he could just kindly sent a formal enquiry letter to our PM, clarifying on the matter instead of raising his voice, shouting to our PM.<br><br>what the f%^&amp;* is Dr Chee trying to do? trying to be a hero? by shouting in that manner to our PM???<br>Dr Chee, it's a big big mistake you have made....<br><br>seems like some of our opposition parties members like to have "a cup of tea" with our ministers at the high court...<br><br>I wonder why????<br></div>

FXXK off man.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>These 3 gentleman are proably from the 60's grp.  Surprisingly,2 out of 3 are agatiate.. by a parking fine??  And all it need is just a fine for them to cast their vote to anyone but the ruling party??? Very em.. implusive indeed.  So what happen to A eventually is to LL goes to a nearby postoffice and pay his fine.  Dun think he dare to do anything funny.  But then.. the anger never subside.  This is when our dear "DR" Chee comes in.<br><br>He tells u how much the govt had bully u and how bad u had being treated.  In short, he amplify A anger.  At this point, chee doesn't need any concrete base to support his theory and claim because, his target follower A, doesn't need any.  All A needs was someone who will stand with him against the govt.  As far as A is concerned, chee is a hero.<br><br>A bit of  similarity to the tactics used in some of the middle east countries.  People are not exposed to the outside world, people are poor.  Therefore people are unhappy.  Leaders turned people anger toward the west or anyone they dislike (20% effective) then use the powerful tool of religion (80% effective)  Ok, good enough, 100% effective.  Maybe this explained why he tag up with.. u know who.<br><br>So why Jurong?  Is it because there are more unhappy people?  People who are victim of the economical downturn? Lost jobs, paycut etc?  Unhappy people who are weaker in their faith and are more easy to be infected by his virus?  I dunno!<br><br>Lastly, if u can find any sense in my words, how can u call him stupid.  SDP had being the heart and blood of Mr Chiam who had made much effort to built.  Our chee manage to kick him out and took over the party thereby saving at least 10 yrs of work.  I choose to call him Miachel Jordan of dirty politic.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>u have a valid point.<br>and true, i dont think he's stupid. he's clever. too clever, thats the prob. remember how he made the lawyer give him the letter on stage to get sympathy from ppl?<br>and also,altho true, i find it disturbing that ppl will blatantly blame the PAP for stuff like parking fine. if chee were PM (heaven forbid) will he abolish parking fines? wat else do the disgruntled ppl want him to abolish? do they not realise wat kind of country we will live in without rules, without laws, even the most minor of laws? if he were to abolich such laws, this country will turn topsy-turvy. if he doesn't, which means he is sensible, but what diff will he be from the current govt then?<br>such disgruntled ppl are just not being rational, they blame everyone but themselves.<br><br>------------------<br>RockerZ!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If chee is pm. I won't be surprise, if the price is right, he will auction s'pore to malaysia or indonesia ono. If he can do such ungrateful act to Mr Chiam, wat else he cannot?  I dunno what his real goal in politic. May it be power or money but one thing for sure, ppl interest shd be last in his list.<br><br>And for god sake now he trying to use religion to stir shit.  Haven't we seen enough of this in the mid-east and ind?  Religion use by mendacious leader as a tool to gain power and support, as a tool for men to die for them to get the dirty job done!<br><br></div>

What i do know is chee had being quite busy for the past couple of years working very hard to become chairman of ARDA (Alliance for Reform and Democracy in Asia ).  My congrat to him now since he had being appointed with that honour.<br><br>So like creative and sony, it's now SDP INTERNATIONAL.  Comprises of Director chee and countries managers from Asia and US.  Suppose to be working on topics in democracy and human right stuff in asia.<br><br>While i do not wish to comment on this "company", i am not comfortable with an opposition party leader who also had association, if not, influence with outside source.<br><br>We need opposition leader to provide constructive and workable solutions to problem and improvisation and not just somebody screaming no democracy, no human right but when asked for answers, he know not.  If that's the best he can do then i believed by grandmother can do the job equally well.<br><br>Nothing personal toward chee.  Issue raise by him on high medical cost...  Agree that's an issue.  Any solution from him?  Free to everthing?  may it be heart transparent or breast enlargement, all free?  Not quite possible.  Perhaps an in depth study to the current system of subsidisation and improvise it further to aid those poor ones will be practical especially at this time.  Something like that.<br><br>Alas, we have yet to see any good, in-depth and workable proposal from him.</div>
