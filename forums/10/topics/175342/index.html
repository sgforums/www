            <div class='col-md body'>Measures are not sudden development but ongoing and meant to lift everybody up<br><br>By Lynn Lee<br>Jan 23, 2006<br>The Straits Times<br><br>WHETHER or not elections are coming, needy Singaporeans will get help as part of the Government's philosophy of progressing together as 'one people, one nation, one family', Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said yesterday.<br><br>Responding to speculation that the series of goodies promised recently meant that polls were around the corner, Mr Lee said with a smile, 'Maybe, maybe not.'<br><br>Mr Lee then hinted at more good news to come: 'If we can in this year's Budget, we will try our best to do more for Singaporeans to make them feel that the sacrifices they made in 2001 when the economy was bad will be rewarded. This is what we should do.'<br><br>But he stressed that the People's Action Party government has always looked beyond short-term electoral goals.<br><br>He placed the recent string of plum announcements in this wider context: as part of an ongoing effort to build a Singapore that is 'strong, prosperous and happy, for many years to come'.<br><br>Aptly enough, the Prime Minister, who is an MP for Ang Mo Kio GRC, made these points at an event to give hongbao to needy residents in his Teck Ghee ward.<br><br>Speaking in Mandarin and English, he also emphasised that his Government's initiatives were not a sudden development.<br><br>'Over the last three or four years - and particularly in 2004 when I became PM - we've been working at doing a lot of things, quietly, in order to help Singapore continue to grow and also to address the problems we have as we grow,' he said.<br><br>On its agenda: Helping older and low-wage workers, improving the lives of disabled people, looking into better health care and housing schemes, and better recognition for national servicemen, among other things.<br><br>Panels have been formed to brainstorm ideas, he said, citing the ministerial committee on low wage workers as one example.<br><br>The committee's suggestions, announced on Jan 12, include a one-off bonus for workers aged 40 and above and earning $1,200 or less a month, higher childcare subsidies, and new training grants.<br><br>Later this week, another ministerial panel is expected to outline proposals to help older workers stay in the workforce for longer.<br><br>The Government is now looking to see if it has a budget surplus, and how best to distribute it to the people, he let on.<br><br>He reiterated the Government's approach: 'Not just to give everybody a hongbao, but to achieve our total objective, to make sure that those who need encouragement get more encouragement, those who need more help get more help, those who have made important contributions, that their contributions are recognised.'<br><br>Mr Lee pointed out that extending such help was possible because the economy had got back on its feet over the past two years. While that was partly due to Asia's rise, it was also because Singapore had 'done the right things'.<br><br>'We've fought to make Singapore better, to upgrade ourselves and to adapt to this new environment,' he said.<br><br>Later, Mr Lee handed out $80 cash gifts to 168 needy residents, who also received food hampers.<br><br>Dressed in a red checked shirt and in a cheerful mood, he spent about half an hour visiting each table, as elderly folk tucked into fried beehoon and red bean soup, before mingling with residents and stallholders at a wet market and hawker centre.<br><br>One such elderly resident, Mr Siaw Chin Lam, brought him back to the topic of elections, noting that press reports had suggested a March date. To this, the PM quipped that he too had received the same information - also from the newspapers.<br><br></div>

This is accomplished by his quick fire one-liners and constant questioning. This might be perceived as a "no-brainer" kind of response but its not so much the lack of thought in his replies but rather the control he gains when he makes his opponent scramble for substantiations, sources and elaborations. And he follows up these substantiations, sources and elaborations by attacking these explanations causing them to look for even more explanations...<br><br>Result? He comes out as "level headed" for pointing out all the flaws and his opponents will come out looking like idiots trying to prove themselves...<br><br>I am impressed with the research done by Atobe and with Salman's quick logic (however misconscrewed).<br><br>Just my 2 peanuts worth.</div>

You expect the retrenched to use more than half their savings to upgrade themselves? Look at the trend now. Most of the retrenched are 40 years old and above. Even if they passed the course with flying colours, employers will find reasons not to hire them, like saying they are too old.
