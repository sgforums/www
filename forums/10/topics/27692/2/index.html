It was alleged that they were treated shabbily. Personally, I find that strange. Why should these people (ahem... for lack of a better word. you'll see why i say so) be accorded any human right when they are indifferent to commiting mass murder? I say that they should be treated as the Isrealis treat them, as beings that are lower than animals. Hell, if only to prevent more murders of innocent people, what's wrong with torturing them to expose more of their kind? I feel that the Americans are overly binded by their values, and this will come around and hurt them in the end... </div></blockquote>i think.. that violence is not a very effective way to end terrorism. they kill us. we kill them. they will continue killing us. and we will continue to kill them. i wonder who would be left in this world. but then again, what better way is there?</div>

That is why talks and negotiations will not work with terrorists. The 2 examples you have quoted are not really relevant as they do  not involve terrorism, and the terrorist mindset. This isn't all about oppression - that can be solved easily, but more importantly, its about their perspective on their religion.</div></blockquote>Actually the Terrorists did not get the wrong idea of Islam.<br><br>They fully understood the Islamic strengths and weaknesses of the teachings of their Prophet, and then used the Islamic vehicle for their own twisted cause, by hijacking the entire "Islamic vehicle" for their own twisted views of projecting their own powers over their own nationals.<br><br>The Ayatollahs have gained power in Iran, and they are not engineers, nor lawyers, nor professionally trained technocrats who can bring progress to their countries.<br><br>They are but power hungry men who are failed in general education, and took the easy route to power via the pulpits.<br><br>The likes of Osama bin Laden is the same.<br><br>They are rejects from their society, and had to transplant themselves on a bigger stage by creating instability worldwide; so as to usurp power by using the readily available Islamic vehicle - that give them immediate access to more then 100 million Muslims across the entire globe.<br><br>The goal of achieving a Pan-Islamic World stretching from the Middle-east, by-passing across Hindu India, and taking over power from the legitimate governments of South-east Asia with a predominant Muslim population.<br><br>The financial contribution from pseudo-Islamic Charities and Funds is but the surface of the extent of their global reach.<br><br>All these activities are not unlike the early beginning of a small guy with a trimmed moustache from Germany (or was it Austria).<br><br>A small guy with a big ambition, to be better than Napolean and achieve what Napolean had failed across Europe.<br><br>This little guy was Adolf Hitler.<br><br>The world will never run short of ambitious people with a big ego but a small petty psychic personality that will pour vengeance on anyone who obstruct their path.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think they should be treated in-kind. ie they crashed the plane into the tower, by right they should be treated like leave them in a house and set the house on fire.... they dont deserve to live in this earth. Go to their "Evil Alah" as the true Alah wont instruct them to do such a thing.<br><br>You saw Abu Baka's comment, ask the victim relative to conver to islam cos those victim are visiting sinful places like pub and club.
