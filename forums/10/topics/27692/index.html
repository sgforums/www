They would have forfeited all of their rights when they killed all those innocent men and women. I cannot understand why some people cry out to the world, asking for people to treat those terrorists properly because it is their "right". Have all of them been blinded?

            <div class='col-md body'>It's easy to advocate extreme measures -- until you're one of those up against the wall. You'd change your tune in a hurry if you were one of the innocent in that camp. Thank your lucky stars our "undemocratic" ISD is at least better than the Americans.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>Do you really think Guantanamo Bay, or any other form of injustice committed in the name of justice, fights terrorism in any way? Look at what that camp is doing to the image of the US abroad. Even the Europeans are disgusted (with Tony Blair the only exception). I cannot imagine how many people who would otherwise have remained outraged but inert were pushed over the edge by that arrogant breach of international law. So much for fighting terrorism.<br><br>Terrorists are like cockroaches: you cannot kill them all. You get rid of them by depriving them of food, and keeping your house clean. Guantanamo Bay is a big steaming pile of shit, and it's feeding these pests.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Unfortunately, there is no one legal definition of what 'human rights' is. Even if we tried to limit this discussion to 'human rights' that could apply to terrorists, that begs the further question of what is a terrorist? without a proper legal definition that is acceptable to most civilised nations (and even then doubtful, cos most 'terrorists' come frmo the shit pits of the world) there's the standard of enforcement. WHo will enforce these standards, even if they existed?<br>As it is, international law is anchored to the unshakeable pillar of national sovereignity - and each country is totally free to define what or who a terrorist is. Even amongst the G8 nations, their standards for a terrorist differ widely. Even up till now, the British are struggling to define a terrorist in the Anti-terror laws that have still yet to be passed.<br>Homeland security in the US is also facing problems - how does one draft an anti-terrorist law that protects its citizens without becoming oppressive?<br>As it is, the one way that the international authorities can deal with the terrorist threat is merely to expand their police / army's powers of search and detention - and then to try the accused (read: innocent until proven guilty) in open court using the criminal system. Since most of us, and myself included think of terrorists as nothing more than cowardly shits using religion as a crutch to commit their henious, even these criminal courts lack the legal structure to deal adequately with terrorists. I mean, criminal courts dish out punishments meant to be approximate and proportional responses to crimes like rape and murder - not for mass murder and plotting to end regimes.<br>For there special Fkers in out midst, what we need is a special judicial system to run these terrorists through, something like the Nuremburg courts to try those Nazis after WW2, but even then, something like that was criticisde as a Victor's Court awarding Victor's justice.<br><br>Until we can separate a terrorist from a freedom fighter, and define who or what makes a terroist internationally, we shall be bound by the arbitrary nature of domestic laws and their own particular inconsistencies. And the fate of the terrorist will depend on the jurisdiction of his capture. Good for the Fker if he gets caught in the US - he gets the media, some slimeball lawyer who will bray for his HR being infringed etc but what about those terrorists whom Iran arrests as being subersive Iraqi agents? they just get a bullet to the head. In S'pore and M'sia, they get the ISA and disappear to some dark cell (but at least got aircon there hahaha).<br><br>so let's separate the anger and rhetoric from out rantings and think about how we can deal with the ultimate problem: how does one create a system to deal with the terrorist threat, combat it pre-emptively and post incident without reducing a democratic country with deomcratic institutions to a freaking dictatorship?<br><br>Unofrtunately, there is no easy answer that will placate everyone.<br><br>As for me, if i ever, in wartime came across a terrorist (in my opinion), I'd spare him the agony of the legal knot and just just put a bullet to his spine. That way, he'd be crawling the rest of his life and shit in his pants.<br></div>

There were reportedly some aid workers and Red Cross personnel that were accidentally captured and subsequently released after months of imprisonment. There may be more such people. There may be other innocents there -- civilians that just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time and were snatched up.<br><br>And you're asking for all the people there to be shot? Tortured to death?<br><br>That is the reason for "innocent until proven guilty". You don't fucking KNOW who's guilty until you prove it. It's not softheartedness. It's just fucking logic!<br><br>Many of the people there did not understand what Al Qaeda was doing. Many of them knew nothing about 911. Many of them were simply peripherally involved with the organization -- people who provided them with food or clothing. Guilt is not a black and white thing. Not everyone in that concentration camp is a mass murderer, either in deed or in thought.<br><br>And even when they are proven guilty, they must be treated within the framework of the law. If you do not, then you just become another set of terrorists yourself. Laws are what distinguish civilized people from terrorists and barbarians. The law is what distinguishes justice from revenge and from murder.<br><br>I am shocked at your ideas.

I mean, say if you had in your hands a CONFIRMED terrorist, should torture be a viable method to extract info from him? I do NOT advocate using torture as a method to force a confession. I think that's pretty stupid, as an innocent person will most probably say anything to relieve himself of the torture. To those who disagree with me, I'd like to ask if they'll still cling on to their high moral values if it was their parents, their wife, girlfriend or children who was up there on the WTC? And if torture can prevent another 911 case, would you still disagree with torture?</div>
