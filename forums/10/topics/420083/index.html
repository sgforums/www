              BREAKING NEWS: PM wants TOC gazetted as Political Association
              Posted by theonlinecitizen on January 11, 2011 57 Comments 
              
              
              
              The Prime Minister of Singapore has revealed his intentions to declare The Online Citizen as a political association.
              
              According to an email sent to TOC at 5pm yesterday evening by the Prime Ministerâ€™s office, the Prime Minister  â€�intends to declare the owners, editorial team, and administrators of The Online Citizen, by order in the Gazette, to be a political association for the purposes of the Political Donations Act. The owners, editorial team, and administrators of The Online Citizen have been determined to be an organization whose objects or activities relate wholly or mainly to politics in Singapore.â€�
              
              This means that TOC is barred from receiving funds from foreign donors, letting foreigners take part in its events and operating as a political party.
              
              It is also not allowed to use its funds, premises and new media platforms in any election here, including the sponsoring of any candidate or member.
              
              TOC has 14 days to reveal the identities of its owners, editorial team and administrators. TOC is also required to designate a President, Treasurer and Secretary of the association, and they will be responsible for the preparation and accuracy of the donations reports for The Online Citizen.
              
              The last group to be gazetted is human rights advocacy NGO Maruah in November last year. Maruah is the fourth group -after the Open Singapore Centre, the Think Centre and Singaporeans For Democracy â€“ to be gazetted as a political association.
              
              If TOC complies, it will be the fifth. It will also be the first time bloggers are considered a political association.

              <p>Actually, according to the letter by press sec. MND: 'Advisers and MPs have different roles' [<a href="http://www.mnd.gov.sg/newsroom/forums/forums_27102009.htm">ST, 27Oct2009</a>] in response to ''Adviser over MP' raises many questions' [<a href="http://www.temasekreview.com/2009/10/22/adviser-over-mp-raises-many-questions/">ST, 22Oct2009</a>], and - 'Grassroots Organizations should stay non-partisan' [<a href="http://www.temasekreview.com/2009/11/03/grassroots-organizations-should-stay-non-partisan/">TR, 03Nov2009</a>] I think that the PA ought to be gazetted a 'political association' too.<br> Excerpts appended as follows:</p>

                    Singapore, MPs  also have an important role in running town councils. 
                   As provided for in the  Town Councils Act, this role includes managing 
                   the common property of HDB  estates and carrying out local improvement 
                   projects, thereby contributing to  the well-being of the people of the 
                   constituency.<br> As  for the  government-appointed adviser, his main role is to assist 
                  in  implementing  national programmes, such as government campaigns, and
                    HDB's upgrading  programmes, including the Lift Upgrading Programme  
                  (LUP).<br> The  roles of MP and  adviser are distinct and separate, even though  
                  government MPs, wearing their  other hat of advisers, are expected to  
                  perform both roles.<br> <span style="color: red;">Opposition  MPs cannot  be appointed advisers, because they do not answer to the  ruling party.</span></em> <em>..<br> Therefore,  in  opposition wards, it is the government-appointed

              <p>Notwithstanding the fact that the concept of 'grassroots advisers' is quite ridiculous beside being un-statutory under s24 of, <a href="http://statutes.agc.gov.sg/non_version/cgi-bin/cgi_retrieve.pl?&amp;actno=Reved-329A&amp;date=latest&amp;method=part">Town Council Act (Cap.329A)</a> to begin with, (see: 'Is Mr MBT (and HDB) quite mistaken regarding the statutory requirements for the Lift Upgrading Prog?'

              <p>eh did u read the story properly?being declared a political association by the minister is not a honor,it means the government think ur a threat to national security and will use ur money and influence to run campaigns in singapore and win the next election.the government is not stupid,instead of storming ur flat,arresting ur party members and tortured with rotans ,they simply declare u "illegal",if they could they probably would ban the whole of singapore from politics.</p>
              <p>if u think singapore is a democracy think again,the prime minister has the right to shut down any organization that it deems has political agendas and stop them from running in the subsequent elections.</p>
              <p>good luck fighting this in court</p>
