              <p>To add on, Australians have more tax deductibles. Even their mortgage payments can be deducted from their taxable income. I ask you, what does Singapore have in Tax deductibles?</p>
              <p>Personal is only $1.5k, Wife is a sad amount of $2k in tax deductible, PROVIDED your wife does not earn more than $2k for that year. And this $2k in tax deductible HAS NOT CHANGED for decades.</p>
              <p>But then again, no point educating lionnoisy. He will conveniently forget everything and ask the same stupid question again.</p>
