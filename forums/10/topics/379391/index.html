                  <br> <br> The U.N. Development Program recently came out with a report looking, among other things, at income inequality worldwide.
                  <br> <br> The UNDP ranked countries and regions based on a number of factors,
                  including their Gini coefficient, named for Italian statistician
                  Corrado Gini.
                  <br> <br>We have listed the world's most advanced economies based on their
                  Gini score, with zero marking absolute equality and 100 absolute
                  inequality. Scandinavian countries, Japan, and the Czech Republic have
                  the least amount of inequality. The U.S. is among the most unequal, but
                  it's not No. 1. To see which economy is, read on.
                  <br> <br> Top 11 Countries With the Biggest Gaps Between Rich and Poor
                  <br> <br> No. 1 Hong Kong
                  <br> Gini score: 43.4
                  <br> GDP 2007 (US$ billions): 207.2
                  <br> Share of income or expenditure (%)
                  <br> Poorest 10%: 2.0
                  <br> Richest 10%: 34.9
                  <br> Ratio of income or expenditure, share of top 10% to lowest 10%: 17.8
                  <br>Renowned for its high concentration of Rolls-Royces, expensive real
                  estate, and posh shops, the Chinese special administrative region has
                  plenty of rich who enjoy showing off their wealth. However, Hong Kong
                  also has one of the largest public housing sectors in the world, with
                  about half the population living in government-supported or -subsidized
                  housing estates. The city has no minimum wage—except for domestic
                  helpers from the Philippines, Indonesia, and other countries.
                  <br> <br> <span style="font-weight: bold;">No. 2 Singapore
                  <br> Gini score: 42.5
                  <br> GDP 2007 (US$ billions): 161.3
                  <br> Share of income or expenditure (%)
                  <br> Poorest 10%: 1.9
                  <br> Richest 10%: 32.8
                  <br> Ratio of income or expenditure, share of top 10% to lowest 10%: 17.7</span> <br>Singapore is one of the world's most open economies, and it
                  suffered badly following the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers last year.
                  Recently, though, the city-state's economy has rebounded, with GDP
                  growing an annualized 14.9% rate in the third quarter compared with the
                  previous quarter.
                  <br> <br> No. 3 U.S.
                  <br> Gini score: 40.8
                  <br> GDP 2007 (US$ billions): 13,751.4
                  <br> Share of income or expenditure (%)
                  <br> Poorest 10%: 1.9
                  <br> Richest 10%: 29.9
                  <br> Ratio of income or expenditure, share of top 10% to lowest 10%: 15.9
                  <br>The share of income for the top percentile of Americans was 23.5%
                  in 2007, the highest since 1928, according to Emmanuel Saez, a Berkeley
                  economist who won the prestigious John Bates Clark Medal in April.
                  Income for the top 0.01% hit a record-high 6.04%. And the recession may
                  be exacerbating income inequality.
                  <br> <br> No. 4 Israel
                  <br> Gini score: 39.2
                  <br> GDP 2007 (US$ billions): 164.0
                  <br> Share of income or expenditure (%)
                  <br> Poorest 10%: 2.1
                  <br> Richest 10%: 28.8
                  <br> Ratio of income or expenditure, share of top 10% to lowest 10%: 13.4
                  <br>Gone are the days when Israel was one of the world's most
                  egalitarian societies. Early Labor Zionist pioneers built kibbutzim for
                  Jewish immigrants, but those collectives have fallen on hard times. The
                  growing number of haredim, or ultra-Orthodox Jews, with large families
                  and men who study the Torah rather than work has worsened the
                  inequality problem.
              
                  <br> <br> No. 5 Portugal
                  <br> Gini score: 38.5
                  <br> GDP 2007 (US$ billions): 222.8
                  <br> Share of income or expenditure (%)
                  <br> Poorest 10%: 2.0
                  <br> Richest 10%: 29.8
                  <br> Ratio of income or expenditure, share of top 10% to lowest 10%: 15.0
                  <br>While Portugal emerged from recession in the second quarter, the
                  unemployment rate tops 9%. The ruling Socialists retained power in
                  elections last month but lost seats to parties on the far left.
                  <br> <br> No. 6 New Zealand
                  <br> Gini score: 36.2
                  <br> GDP 2007 (US$ billions): 135.7
                  <br> Share of income or expenditure (%)
                  <br> Poorest 10%: 2.2
                  <br> Richest 10%: 27.8
                  <br> Ratio of income or expenditure, share of top 10% to lowest 10%: 12.5
                  <br>According to the OECD, New Zealand had the biggest rise in
                  inequality among member nations in the two decades starting in the
                  mid-1980s. The country's economy emerged from recession in the second
                  quarter, but with growth of just 0.1%, the central bank is likely to
                  keep interest rates low until well into 2010.
                  <br> <br> No. 7 (tie) Italy
                  <br> Gini score: 36.0
                  <br> GDP 2007 (US$ billions): 2,101.6
                  <br> Share of income or expenditure (%)
                  <br> Poorest 10%: 2.3
                  <br> Richest 10%: 26.8
                  <br> Ratio of income or expenditure, share of top 10% to lowest 10%: 11.6
                  <br>Italians are focused now on the melodrama surrounding embattled
                  Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. The political crisis comes at a time
                  when the economy is still mired in recession even as countries like
                  Germany and France are growing again.
                  <br> <br> No. 7 (tie) Britain
                  <br> Gini score: 36.0
                  <br> GDP 2007 (US$ billions): 2,772.0
                  <br> Share of income or expenditure (%)
                  <br> Poorest 10%: 2.1
                  <br> Richest 10%: 28.5
                  <br> Ratio of income or expenditure, share of top 10% to lowest 10%: 13.8
                  <br>According to Britain's Institute of Fiscal Studies, a
                  government-funded think tank, the average national income, adjusted for
                  inflation, grew 0.5% between 2004 and 2008. In contrast, the same
                  figure for the top 90% income bracket jumped 1.2% over the same period.
                  That was predominantly driven by large salaries and bonuses from the
                  financial services sector in the pre-credit crunch era.
                  <br> <br> No. 9 Australia
                  <br> Gini score: 35.2
                  <br> GDP 2007 (US$ billions): 821.0
                  <br> Share of income or expenditure (%)
                  <br> Poorest 10%: 2.0
                  <br> Richest 10%: 25.4
                  <br> Ratio of income or expenditure, share of top 10% to lowest 10%: 12.5
                  <br>While developed economies elsewhere fell into recession, the Lucky
                  Country's good fortune held out, with Australia continuing to grow
                  thanks in part to strong demand from China for its resources. This
                  month the central bank raised interest rates, making Australia a leader
                  among countries moving away from monetary easing.
                  <br> <br> No. 10 (tie) Ireland
                  <br> Gini score: 34.3
                  <br> GDP 2007 (US$ billions): 259.0
                  <br> Share of income or expenditure (%)
                  <br> Poorest 10%: 2.9
                  <br> Richest 10%: 27.2
                  <br> Ratio of income or expenditure, share of top 10% to lowest 10%: 9.4
                  <br>Put aside the old comparisons to Asia's tiger economies. Ireland's
                  workers are suffering badly from the recession; the unemployment rate
                  soared in August to 12.5%. That's the second-worst in the EU, behind
                  only Spain.
                  <br> <br> No. 10 (tie) Greece
                  <br> Gini score: 34.3
                  <br> GDP 2007 (US$ billions): 313.4
                  <br> Share of income or expenditure (%)
                  <br> Poorest 10%: 2.5
                  <br> Richest 10%: 26.0
                  <br> Ratio of income or expenditure, share of top 10% to lowest 10%: 10.2
                  <br>Newly elected Prime Minister George Papandreou's government faces
                  potential disciplinary action from the European Union, which has
                  reprimanded Greece for a budget deficit of 6% of GDP, twice the EU
                  limit. The IMF projects the economy will shrink 0.8% this year.

              <p>Frankly, I believe they can do a good job in dealing with real issues and problems.  Very likely they refuse to do so could be due to the fact that by doing so it doesn't serve their self serving agenda.    It is not difficult to tell that this bunch of bloody selfish despots put themselves before the public interest.</p>

              <p>2.This ratio is compared between the have's and have-not's inside SG!!</p>
              <p>This is not a ratio compared across different countries.</p>

              <p>One question that deals in your area of expertise, Australia.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Singapore has a higher GDP per Capita than Japan (according to lionnoisy).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Australia has a lower GDP per Capita compared to Singapore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Why is it that Australians make 4-5 times the salary of Singaporeans?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When you travel overseas, why is it that everything is very expensive and when foreigners travel to Singapore, why is everything dirt cheap?</p>
              <p>Then you ask yourself, doesn't Singapore have a higher GDP per Capita Australia, then how come Singaporeans have less spending power. Why are supermarket food products of the equivalent price, sometimes even cheaper than Singapore?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Below is the data from Australian Bureau of Statistics, it shows the hourly wages of non-managerial employees, <strong>cleaners are paid AU$19 an hour</strong>, <strong>food preparation assistant (this could be your Mcdonalds' staff) AU$18.60 an hour and general clerks are paid AU$26.20 an hour.</strong></p>
              <p>How much are Singaporean cleaners paid, Mcdonalds' staff and general clerks paid on an hourly basis? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
