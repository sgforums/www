There is no need to match the pirated CD prices, but surely there is still much room for prices to going down. Can the consumer association persuade them to lower prices,  or WTO?

Friend of mine in the Philippines said the MNC came and paid them peanuts in pesos for writing some software, which were later sold in Manila in pesos converted from US dollars. Most small businesses, especially those outside manila, will never afford the original software. Many locals are learning computer using pirated copies hoping that when they land up a job with a big local companies or MNC, they get to use the originals. I think the local copyright legal enforces know the problem so their enforcement is usually half hearted or simply going through the motion.<br>I once read through the resume of applicants for a marketing executive position. Many claimed they are computer literate who can use Microsoft Office, Java, Mackintosh, WordPerfect, Photoshop! While I do not doubt their computer literacy but i doubt they learned all these softwares using the originals. Coming down hard on pirated software before bring the prices down, the poor and the students will be among the first to suffer. They won't turn to buying all the originals. They will probably stay at leaning Microsoft Office, which is what Bill Gates want.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ever heard of South Africa trying to manufacture all AIDS related treatment cocktails and classify them under generic pharmaceuticals?That is one bold move which we should applaud.They are putting their reputation at stake by saying that human lives are more important than big bucks and profits.They are not denying the researchers and scientists their credit, but rather they hope to see a fairer deal when it comes to saving lives.The most callous thing to do is to mak money off the misery and suffering of entire nation.There are grey areas here, and if it helps to uplift the health and the literacy of the sub-developing and 3rd World, I'd say that using a copy of a product which gives the same benefits without the inflated marketing cosr is a morally right choice.</div>

On the receiving end, software would poll a database to verify that a message was actually processed by one of those servers.<br><br>Microsoft has applied for a patent on the method for polling the database. Though the company promises to make the technology available for free, it wants to bar software developers from further licensing it - a restriction that several members of the open-source community find unacceptable.<br><br>Sender ID's effectiveness and compatibility with existing mail systems were already in question before members of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) got hung up on the patent battle, said Mr Yakov Shafranovich, a leading anti-spam activist.<br><br>The task force, which works by consensus on Internet standards, dissolved a working group on Sender ID last week after deciding that agreement could not be achieved anytime soon.<br><br>Some experts say the decision could speed up work on a different spam-control technology from Yahoo, one seen as stronger but more difficult to implement.<br><br>The IETF is expected to create a working group as early as November to craft standards for digitally signing messages, an anti-spam approach Yahoo favours. Two other groups are in the works to explore additional approaches.<br><br>The Microsoft and Yahoo proposals, along with one being tested by America Online, aim to tackle e-mail spoofing - the practice of sending messages that pretend to be from someone else, be it Bill Gates or a friend in your address book. The technology wouldn't eliminate spam, but it could help identify and block a common spam technique.<br><br>It's possible for two or more of these technologies to work in conjunction. -- AP<br></div>
