The only way to eliminate this syndrome would be for the copyright holders to licence their intellectual properties at an even more realistic prices -- they are reaping tons of profit as it is, and keeping most of it in their coffers, giving a minute amount to the artistes.

They keep the profits for their own nefarious activities!
