            <div class='col-md body'>In less than a year, my husband and I received harassments from loansharks more than 4 times, each getting more and more serious and making us feel more threatened. Yesterday, our front gate was chained and fresh red paint poured all over our door. As with the previous times, we, being second-hand owners of the flat, called up the police for assistance. Writings were all over the wall along the corridor, indicating the loansharkÂ’s contact number. As the police are all along aware that the debts came from our previous owners, I was greatly disappointed that till now, nothing effective was carried out and no assistance was given to us. Every time we lodged a police report on the loansharkÂ’s harassment, we were told that investigations will be carried out and that requires time. But on our side, every single day spells danger and we are constantly living in fear. It seems like all the investigations led to nowhere as history repeats itself once again.<br><br>We do understand the large volume of similar cases the CID are handling, but what we are facing now are syndicates who fears nothing of the law because till date, it is not an offence in Singapore to borrow money from illegal lenders. We can never get to the root of the problem if nothing is changed about punishing borrowers for their act. As the victims, we felt the frustration and anger because we have to bear the consequences of things we did not do, and even the police are unable to give us a solution.<br><br>WeÂ’re really helpless about what are the options we have now, because if we were to sell the flat back to HDB, we understand that it will be at a discounted price. We really hope to seek assistance from other channels available to us. All we ask for is to live peacefully at our home which we took great pains to build up.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i read from some other forum that police dun really look into catching the "runners", but aim at the big fish at the top.... but this info also not really accurate, cos there are cases police settle quickly for them.<br><br>suggestion will be to write to the papers lor. (Guess that's the usual method nowadays if any government/major private company body dun do a good job).<br><br>Abt the money lenders part, it will always be around, be it legal or otherwise.

            <div class='col-md body'>i dun condon loan sharking activity but some of them do live it up, for the $ they made.<br><br>in an ex-company i used to work, i was buddy wif one of the guys working as a picker in the warehouse. he is a runner. one day, he invited me for a nite out. modus operandi varies of cos by pax, but basically, he planned his rounds by hanging out in a cina beng type nightclub in geylang or lavender, loosen up with a few drinks with babes in tow, then he will make his way out for a round of collection or so. when i was with him, i hang out at the sleaze joint of cos, no point risking myself since i am not involved. bsides, i was having too much fun there. in his 1st round of collection, he came back with waxed duck for everyone, i guess a sign of success, and the 2nd time, a round of drinks on him for everyone on the table. he will be <strong>in n out </strong>(a slight digression here, but <strong>in n out </strong>is my fav burger joint when i am in us  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> ) a few times in the same nite.<br><br>i left after midnite after my fair share of fun....<br><br>he was open wif me on what he's doing outside work but he also discourage any probing questions on him. i also left it at that since this is underworld stuff. i dun want to get involved also.<br><br>another misconception is these folks are tattoo'd gangster with menacing looks on their face. some may have these F look but you'll be surprised. u actually can't pick them out from a crowd. my fren has a smily pleasant face, albeit a little rotund.<br><br>that chap at that time drives a lancer MS edition to work but have to park a few blks away becos he didn't want to arouse any suspicion on his $1k odd monthly salary. when i left the company, we lost touch after a couple of years....</div>
