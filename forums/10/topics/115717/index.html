Sometimes back, most <span style="text-decoration: underline;">NOT all</span> of these papers are diligently passed to respect depts, but that's because the admin were kind enough, not because it's their duty. How I know? Not important. Once the kind/good people all gone, of course all other papers other than cheques, or application of credit a/c, will have to tikam heavily.<br><br>Besides, all I can say is there is currently some other projects going on that relates to various depts processing details.<br><br>One obvious reason why I, and some others, left is because of office politics. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Don't be so stressed up, but imagine those doing in the backgrounds fighting the office-political wars (wasting precious time, energy and happiness)... they are even more stressed up than yourself. Any organisation is roughly the same, we either have good people to run and stablise the show, or we have wars running. There's little sense in hoping competition to oust out the weak, because which good people don't wanna do their jobs but got involved in office politics... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Just as a (resigned) old colleague commented when we met last month, '...something big is going to happen...'.<br><br>Go quickly to any OCBC centre and properly do your updates, and email a letter to the customer service stating the issue to cover yourself. Don't be a sacrifice of others' error.</div>
