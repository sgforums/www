              <p>do you know anything about what goes on outside of SG? Do you? have you studied overseas? have you spent a day beyond 2 weeks out of SG?</p>
              <p>In the US, US citizens pay US$150,000 (S$240,000) for their 4 year college fees in public universities. In SG, farmer students in its farmer universities (NUS, NTU) pay S$5,500+ per year. That's only a measly S$20,000 for four years. 2 in 3 farmer students do a three year course, so that's about a pathetic S$15,000 in total for the farmer degree and it costs less than 7% of what a US citizen pays for public college education, not to mention the costs of going to private college like Chicago, Northwestern or Ivy League. Do some fucking research first before talking shit, dumb farmer.</p>
              <p>When dumb farmer fucks like you punch above your weight on the internet like this, it always makes Singaporeans who knows whats going on outside Singapore laugh hysterically. In SG, more than 8 out of 10 citizens do not pay income tax. The few who do pay so little income tax its a joke. Even someone who earns $120K a year like my 25 year old friend, his income tax is only $6K, which means its only 5% of his annual income and he belongs to the top 10% of earning bracket here. Income tax is capped at 10% of total income here, no matter how much the person earns.</p>
              <p>In the US, more than 90% of its citizens pay income tax and more than half pay more than 50% income tax. Which means when a US citizen makes $500,000 a year, at least $250,000 of his income goes to the state. In UK and other EU countries, and especially the Scandinavian countries, income tax is between 60% to 80% of annual income. In London, a one-way ride on the tube costs easily 3 pounds.</p>
              <p>SG's super cheap tax, with 8 in 10 citizens not actually paying any income tax, and its super cheap farmer uni education, coupled with super cheap pri/sec and JC school fees (less than $10 a month!), you should be counting your lucky stars that you were born here because the govt takes care of shit like you as well.</p>
              <p>Because scum and garbage like you won't survive a day in the US.</p>

              <p>He's not in heaven, because SG is a place that doesn't give handouts to the not-smart and not-hardworking. But he won't survive a day in any first world country (SG is a developing country in my opinion). Its interesting that the people crapping about the government belong to the same strata that never had the chance to experience life outside of the government's jurisdiction.</p>

              <p>An(us)gel, remember to inform us how much income tax you filed and paid last year ok? I'm still waiting for your response.</p>
              <p>And I assure you that there are many civil servants whose contribution of income tax is more than what you earn in a year.</p>
              <p>Funny how its the most bottom dwelling of all losers like you and the like of you that crap and talk shit the most, but have the least eligibility to move or survive in other countries.</p>

              <p><br>It is not a surprise that the Taiwanese "hum" will know that "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">singapore got more bitch than beach</span></em>" when it has to be so desparate to be accepted as a "Singapore bitch".</p>
              <p>The bloody Taiwanese "hum" will shamelessly claim to be a "Singapore Bitch" - when it does not know the existence of the beaches of Changi, Punggol, Seletar, East and West Coast Parks - as well as the beaches on the surrounding islands; and cannot even know the difference between the river banks from the beach next to the sea.</p>
              <p>Obviously the Taiwanese "hum" does not come from any beach along the coast of Taiwan, and must have existed in the sewers of some small village.</p>
