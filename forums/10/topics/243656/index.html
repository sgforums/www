            <div class='col-md body'>Why are our government official unable to see that both the F1 races and Integrated Resort can be synergise together to produce a very unique F1 and Casino in Singapore?<br><br>Billions are being spent building the Casino on Marina Bay and just hundreds meter away, the F1 is to be held, which we will also easily spent hundreds of millions on infrastructure changes.<br><br>The STB, URA and Casino committer members must be blind not to see that both are can be integrated together and give both the casino investor and F1 organiser more bang for the dollar.<br><br>Both will be world class events and major tourist attraction, both are being prepared, built and organise at the same time, yet no one knows how to combine both into one or at least make them synergise with each other.<br><br>For example, since we are building the casino, why don't alter some of the  the plans to make the F1 race thru a glass enclose casino buldings when the races are held here? If this is done, even the F1 drivers them selves will be excited when entering the casino tunnels.<br><br>There are so many things that can be done to combine the two events but yet they are always discussed seperately. This only shows that sometimes govt needs strong enterprising individual from the private sector that is able to seizes opportunity and make 1+1=4<br></div>

Don't read the sport section of ST much...<br><br>But do remember that Marina IR is yet to be build, therefore racing around there next year will be a waste of view..... only a half complete builting to be seen. But most importantly is that the route is just a 'proposed' route.... anything could be change...... Since no real plan have been 'leak' to the press.... are we even sure that that is the proposed circuit  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"> </div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The fact that the Hungaroring and Magny-Cours are still on the calendar even though they're bloody processions demonstrates otherwise. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>You don't seem to understand how Formula 1 works and how Bernie works. It's not "another" tourist attraction. It has legions of fans who follow every race in the championship loyally. And deals done with circuits are signed for multiple years.

The trees have to go, but they do not have to be chopped. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>I use to believe alot of things are difficult to understand create, but then others around the world shows us that with determination (and some money), anything is possible. Thus X factor is also no mystery at all, you just need to know who to ask to make it happen.
