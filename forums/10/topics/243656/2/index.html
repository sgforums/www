            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Kuali Baba, the reason why i didn't include professionals from within F1 initially is to do away with "that's impossible" syndrome. Then the proposal by the other group of professionals will at least have some possibility. For normal cases, even if the final result is just 10% of the orinignal from the creative group, it will be very spectacular.<br><br>Agreed with you hloc that our govt must be committed; Shanghai poured $350 million into a new circuit without an hesitation, and we are trying by just S$10-12 million in support? If you were the F1 owner and organiser, how would you feel then about Singapores commitment to F1?</div>
