              <p>I know this sounds unpatriotic and provocative, but given the
              many complaints about how FTs don't have to serve NS, this seems
              like one option. If you give up SG citizenship, you will become
              stateless (unless you have another citizenship elsewhere).
              Government can't make you serve NS if you are no longer a citizen.
              Then you apply for SG PR, and as a 'first generation PR', you don't
              have to serve NS! If there is a more direct process for you to
              'downgrade' to a PR, it's even better! :D</p>
