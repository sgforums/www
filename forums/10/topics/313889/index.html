              <p>Don't you all find it ironic that an FT with no ties whatsoever to SG is welcomed as PR, but not a former SG citizen? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></p>
              <p>Actually, did a search and found this excerpt on immigration website:</p>

              <p>My indian colleague was an indian national.</p>
              <p>he did not like living here or the lifestyle or work atmosphere.</p>
              <p>I asked him why he dropped his citizenship for this.</p>
              <p>he said, he was given the offer.</p>
              <p>i cannot say if what he said is true or slightly less than true.</p>
              <p>but i am telling what he told me.</p>
              <p>he said he asked his wife to no need convert. just continue with the pr.  his son before reaching enlistment, gave up his PR and is now back home studying in great ole india.</p>
              <p>his money is now in cpf. quite a bit i reckon based on his kind of skillset and years of work here and overseas.</p>
              <p>anyway, he said he owns a flat and may sell it and even withdraw all his cpf at time of retirement. hey, his wife and son are all in india.</p>
              <p>I have no objection to his thinking. Afterall, its a free world. He can legally do that. its allowed. just like he is allowed to work here , then get PR then get citizen.</p>
              <p>very easy for him.</p>
              <p>he will see how good or bad the future lies here. but already, he is contemplating. no wind no fire.</p>

              <p><br>plan. plan, my friend. one needs to plan.</p>
              <p>it takes a few years like 5 years to get a citizenship i guess. thus, its not like when you really want to quit the INC then you quit. There is lead time required. Its not like you need to use your cpf then you quit the INC. you need some lead time.</p>
              <p>having said that, which are my personal opines, i am not saying that i encourage emigration. For my safety, i cannot say so right?</p>
              <p>emigration is a personal choice free to choose by all living in the free world with some kind of human rights.</p>
              <p>our forefudders, migrated here, right.</p>
              <p>our FTs migrating here right.</p>
              <p>so...</p>
              <p>Not anyone can qualify to migrate.</p>
              <p>It takes EQ, IQ and some time.</p>
              <p>I forgot where I saw it, there is some site that says a citizen can withdraw all his cpf when he 'resigns' from the INC. But it followed with some statement that seems to say that provided you do not want to come back to work....... not conform sure. need to be cork sure.</p>
