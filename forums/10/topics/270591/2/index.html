            <div class='col-md body'>I feel that the topic here is about postponing the age to get back our CPF.<br><br>The annual depreciation rate of money is around 1.5% (okay i forgot the exact figure but its definitely more than 1) As time pass by the fix sum in the CPF will decrease in value. True enough CPF provide a high interest rate (supposedly higher than most banks). However, is that enough especially in the context of today where the cost of living is rising rapidly. The bus fare for 20 years ago is roughly half that of now.<br><br>I am aware of schemes available to help the citizens used their CPF for investment purposes but truly how many blue collar workers knows about stocks and the likes. I am sure there r many working adults out there not truly know how investment works and what is good or bad. In the end the money just rot in there.<br><br>the lump some of money which they are able to get at the end will not be so much after all at the end.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, contrary to what LHL has said about building an inclusive society, yet to see anything substantial started to make Singapore more inclusive. In fact, its getting more exclusive. People who are less capable are getting left far behind, and even forgotten.<br><br>Boasts of economic growth, but the majority of singaporeans are not getting the benefits of such growth. Lower and middle income wages continue to drop whereas higher income earners continue to rise. Its about time, some sort of safety net be implemented. With all the billions lost due to bad investments of CPF money over the past years, that money could have been better used, here within the nation.</div>
