              <p>Hamas must somehow be brought into the Middle East peace process <strong>because the
                  policy of isolating Gaza in the quest for a settlement will not work</strong>, Tony
                  Blair has told <em>The Times</em>.</p>
              <p>The former prime minister implicitly criticises the strategy followed by the
                  Bush Administration and Israel of focusing all peace and reconstruction
                  efforts on the West Bank. “It was half of what we needed,” he said.</p>
              <p>In an interview with Ginny Dougary in the Saturday <em>Magazine,</em> Mr Blair
                  says that <strong>the strategy of “pushing Gaza aside” and trying to create a
                  Palestinian state on the West Bank “was never going to work and will never
                  work”.</strong> He hints in references to how peace was eventually achieved in
                  Northern Ireland that the time may be approaching to talk to Hamas ... “My
                  basic predisposition is that in a situation like this you talk to everybody.”</p>
              <p>He suggests that the policy was behind last month's ferocious reopening of
                  hostilities between Israel and Hamas in Gaza that were believed to have left
                  more than 1,000 people dead.</p>
              <p>Mr Blair, speaking after talks with the new US envoy George Mitchell, says
                  that Gaza will not be pushed aside because there are 1.25 million people
                  there who want a Palestinian state.</p>
              <p>Mr Blair, the Middle East envoy for the Quartet group of the US, UN, Russia
                  and the European Union, clearly believes that the Obama Administration is
                  committed to a fresh effort to secure peace and appears to have been waiting
                  for the change of government to make his strongest criticism so far of the
                  Israeli blockade of Gaza.</p>
              <p>Asked if he was surprised by the devastating events over Christmas, when
                  Israel responded to Hamas rocket attacks by bombing targets in Gaza, he says
                  that he was not. “I have been saying for some time that what was needed was
                  a completely different strategy,” he said.</p>
              <p>“Yes, we do need to show through the change we are making on the West Bank
                  that the Palestinian state could be a reality. The trouble is that if you
                  simply try to push Gaza to one side then eventually what happens is the
                  situation becomes so serious that it erupts and you deliver into the hands
                  of the mass the power to erupt at any point in time.”</p>
              <p>Thought to be privately critical of the failure of the former US
                  administration to give a full commitment to the peace process, Mr Blair says
                  that the appointment of Mr Mitchell, with whom he worked on the Northern
                  Ireland peace process, indicated a “real commitment” by America.</p>
              <p>Hinting at a change of tack he says that with Mr Mitchell as a full-time envoy
                  there will be a better chance of a strategy in Gaza “that offers people the
                  possiblity of rejoining the West Bank on the right terms”.</p>
              <p>Mr Blair also received a warm endorsement yesterday for his Middle East work
                  from Bill Clinton, the former US President. He says that Mr Blair and
                  Hillary Clinton, the US Secretary of State, “will work well together”
                  towards achieving a lasting pieace.</p>
              <p>Mr Clinton says of Mr Blair: “He has done really important work as Middle East
                  envoy under particularly difficult circumstances. I have always admired
                  Tony's willingness to wade into troubled waters and make tough decisions, as
                  he did in helping to end 30 years of sectarian violence and broker a lasting
                  peace in Northern Ireland. He is demonstrating that same dedication and
                  intensity to promoting economic opportunity and political resolution in the
                  Middle East, knowing from experience that the concrete benefits can play a
                  crucial role in making a just and lasting peace possible. As Hillary begins
                  her work as US Secretary of State, I know she and Tony will work well
                  together toward that end.”</p>
              <p>Asked whether he had changed his view about talking to Hamas since the
                  Palestinian elections, Mr Blair replies that his “basic predisposition is
                  that in a situation like this you talk to everybody”.</p>
              <p>However, he repeated the Quartet position that there can be no talks, official
                  or unofficial, with Hamas until they renounce violence and recognise Israel.</p>
              <p>Mr Blair then says that there is a distinction between the difficulty of
                  negotiating with Hamas as part of a peace process if they would not accept
                  one of the states in the two-state solution, and “talking to Hamas as the de
                  facto power in Gaza”.</p>
              <p>He declines to answer whether he has talked to Hamas unofficially, although
                  his staff later insists that he has not, and that all contacts have been via
                  Egyptian diplomats. Under intense questioning later he replies: “I do think
                  it is important that we find a way of bringing Hamas into this process, but
                  it can only be done if Hamas are prepared to do it on the right terms.”</p>
              <p>Pressed to go further Mr Blair says that he has to be careful how he expresses
                  things because “if you do this in the wrong way it can destabilise the very
                  people in Palestine who have been working all through for the moderate
                  cause”.</p>
              <p>He added: “We do have to find a way of making sure that the choice is put
                  before Hamas and the people of Gaza in a clear, understandable, unambiguous
                  way, for them to choose their future. You have to find a way of
                  communicating that choice to them in their terms. Now exactly what way you
                  choose at the moment, that is an open question.”</p>
              <p>Diplomats will point out that Mr Blair fully signed up to the Annapolis accord
                  which envisaged the creation of a Palestinain state by the end of 2008
                  whether Gaza was part of it or not. Even though sceptics said that the goal
                  was unrealistic, Mr Blair insisted that a deal could be done by the end of
                  last year.</p>
