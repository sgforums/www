              <p>I think becuase the GE is coming soon , thats why PAP has been doing this , to make people think that they are successful in ruling Singapore and vote for them , in other words i think the chances of opposition winning this time round could be lesser &amp; lesser becuase PAP even planned to introduce MRT to JB in the year 2018 , so if people now were to vote for opposition , i think this well-liked plan of MRT going into JB will be abolished...</p>

              <p>MY view is, by the time MRT is completed, LKY or you may not be around, so hy worry so much, between now and 2018, then will be another election, i say we vote PAP now, then when they build the MRT, the next election we vote them out, that will be the best solution.</p>
              <p>I hope that by the next election after this coming one, they dun come out and said they will build underground sea water channel to batam </p>

              <p>Aiyah...Msia so poor...need us to build MRT for them....poor thing.</p>
              <p>We so good neighbours...since our GDP is 10 time higher than Msia.... no choice lor. must help them. What to do, our PM (and ex-PM, ex-PM) so capable and give us so good life......so must share our wealth abit so they will not be too jealous like thier former Mr M....purposely delay this delay that.</p>
              <p>Mr N are smarter...if not the CIQ issue go to international court like White Lighthouse like that...end up Msia got nothing. LKY so kind to give Mr M something but  this beggar after 1997 come here to beg for 3 B, but Mr Goh don lend. Mr M than go back and cow father and cow mother. Don move KTM. Don sell sand. Don sell water......</p>
              <p>end up Johor got lesser and lesser revenue and need to send few hundred thousands optrs by bus load here to work and remit money to help thier economy. Also, even high grade food need to export across the bridge for us to eat while they eat those cannot qualify  for our consumption.... Cheer LKY, GCT, LSL</p>

              <p><br>Dr M is not a fan of capitialists, Singapore being a captilist country where the rich get sricher and the elite gets more elited, is not in the idealogy of Dr M.</p>
              <p>In fact, if you look at Malaysia where Dr M ruled for many years, he managed to reduce the income gap, removed the sultans rights, created jobs for the poors and controlled the financial insitutions before falling into foreign hands. Jealousy is not a good word to use on Dr. M. Singapore is uniquely small, the ability of our govt to rule this country cannot compare to leaders of other countries who have to rule a large population with a large land and borders. LKY may not even survive till today if he is to rule Malaysia, indonesia or thailand..sometime, it is of good luck that he landed here, a small land with a small population and a very high paid</p>

              <p>you have underestimated Dr M, and also remember that Malaysia is a Muslim state, LKY can never be able to rule it. The malaysians are different in a way to singaporeans is that they can take the hard knock of life much better than singaporeans, on the other hands, Muslim tends to choose to live in a simple way, you dun disturb me, i dun bother you kind of style. They are not going to be jealous about singapore economy moving up and faster than them, as the crisis that singapore can also fall faster than them too, so there is a price to pay for being moving up and up faster than the others, secondly, once you move up and up, peoples like you and me gain from it, but people in the lower income group will be getting further and further away from us, leaving a big hole in the social fabric.</p>
              <p>Dr M do not advocate to such disparity, he helps the poor of malaysia to move up before granting the rich to make more money, he makes the sultans and their sons give up most of their power and be punish same as commoners, he is not worry about singapore progression, as he said before, everything have a price to pay, our religion and culture, way of thinking and behaving are different from Singapore. Singaporeans had to pay a high price from getting to the top and a higher price to maintain at that position, they are too expose to the west.</p>

              <p>you have underestimated Dr M, and also remember that Malaysia is a Muslim state, LKY can never be able to rule it. The malaysians are different in a way to singaporeans is that they can take the hard knock of life much better than singaporeans, on the other hands, Muslim tends to choose to live in a simple way, you dun disturb me, i dun bother you kind of style. They are not going to be jealous about singapore economy moving up and faster than them, as the crisis that singapore can also fall faster than them too, so there is a price to pay for being moving up and up faster than the others, secondly, once you move up and up, peoples like you and me gain from it, but people in the lower income group will be getting further and further away from us, leaving a big hole in the social fabric.</p>
              <p>Dr M do not advocate to such disparity, he helps the poor of malaysia to move up before granting the rich to make more money, he makes the sultans and their sons give up most of their power and be punish same as commoners, he is not worry about singapore progression, as he said before, everything have a price to pay, our religion and culture, way of thinking and behaving are different from Singapore. Singaporeans had to pay a high price from getting to the top and a higher price to maintain at that position, they are too expose to the west.</p>
