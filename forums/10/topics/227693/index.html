            <div class='col-md body'>This is a completely fictitious story that has no relationship to reality whatsoever.<br><br>A long long time ago, there was a village filled with hardworking people.<br><br>The village is often approached by filthy beggars and other poor, useless folk. The village elders ordered the villagers to chased them out immediately because these beggars are poor and useless.<br><br>One day, a group of strangers came in bearing many expensive, beautiful gifts. The elders welcome them in enthusiastically because they are not poor and useless. They are rich and wonderful. They are welcome to stay in this village as long as they bring in beautiful, pricey presents. What splendid presents they are! They are dazzling and beautiful. The best presents ever!<br><br>Then somebody noticed that things are going missing in the village. But everyone was too polite and respectful of the elders to tell it. The elders have worked too hard to be informed of this minor problem. After all, people can be forgetful, who knows when the things will suddenly reappear!<br><br>Ah, those forgetful villagers.<br><br>So things kept disappearing. And the strangers keep producing new gifts. Everyone was happy. Everyone was discussing in private about their missing things, but they were all too polite to tell the elders. The elders invited more and more gift-bearing strangers into the village.<br><br>One day, the strangers stopped presenting new gifts and left. The elders thought nothing of it because they have received so many gifts.<br><br>But when they toured the village, it was empty and barren. Many villagers have died of starvation. Nobody knows why because nobody told anybody what was going on.<br><br>The village elders were furious. "YOU LAZY BUMS! Get up and work!" They did not realize that, until recently, the villagers have never worked so hard before. Exploding with rage, the elders punished the remaining starving villagers until they all died.<br><br>THE END.</div>

Despite working so hard, they can only blame themselves for not working harder. They can only blame themselves for having such a poor memory. Most villagers agree with the elders that it is their own fault.<br><br>Let me give you a concrete example.<br><br>Years ago, each villager's family had big, shabby house with a great view and a cool breeze.<br><br>Then the guests arrived and the elders ordered the construction of the Visitor's Lodge.<br><br>The houses became smaller and smaller, and was filled with all sorts of cheap, entertaining trinklets. In time, each family had a tiny apartment packed together with thousands of other families. They see the accomplishments of the elders tower over them.<br><br>The space was gone, the breeze was replaced by industrial smog and there wasn't any view really. But they had their trinkets.<br><br>The elders said that their lives were getting better. The villagers completely agreed.</div>
