              <p>Singapore is such a small country, we need tough laws to deter crimes. Death Penalty will make all potential criminals fear about coming here to disturb us. The Mandatory is good to save on unnecessary legal proceedings and so called Grey areas.</p>

              <p>So instead of putting them to death we keep them on life support for a few decades on tax payers money, including the fact that we also have to be obliged to give medical support to keep such people healthy in their old age where we do not even want to do that for our own law biding elderly?</p>

              <p>I think it's better to have two choices really. For Singaporeans who does drug trafficking, they will be punish to do community services to the poor / elderly, &amp; report to prison at the end of the day. It's better than straight away death sentences for them in my opinion. If they happen to mess with the drugs again, then excute them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For Foreign workers who commit crimes, they should be send back to their countries &amp; ban from coming back forever. It's better to kick them out than to spend money for free lodging/food for them in jail.</p>

              </p><p>It pains me to read such simplistic justifications for the mandatory death penalty.  You show yourself as a fool by mocking this cause so flippantly.  I suggest everybody at least read this report by Amnesty International first: http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/ASA36/001/2004</p>
              <p>Or even better, why not attend the rally and enlighten yourself further?  </p>
              <p>What's wrong with the mandatory death penalty.  Here are a couple of issues off the top of my head:</p>
              <p>Mandatory sentencing does not take into account mitigating factors.  You can be hanged for bringing in drugs that you did not even know was in your bag.  Is that fair?  In fact, people have been hanged while the judge still had doubts that they had even committed the crime.  Is that justice?</p>
              <p>Hanging drug couriers will not solve the issue at hand.  There is an endless supply of ignorant and foolish people who are willing to risk their lives by crossing the border with drugs.  Killing them off won't ever stop the supply of these people, so fails as a deterrent.  Nothing is gained in the war against drugs by taking a courier's life.</p>
              <p>Less importantly, mandatory sentencing makes a mockery of 'judges' roles.  What is a judge's purpose if not to judge?</p>
              <p></p>

              <p>Basically, the court throught the finding and evidence can justify the cause of innocent, Asian court procceed in a way different from the west where a jurdiciary committee is form from all walk of innocent life within that community. In Asia, the judge or magistrate appointed by the state make the final decision. In Singapore, a fair trial exist to determine an innocent person who can appeal all the way up to the president.</p>
              <p>In most part of asia, just like malaysia, if you notice the way the police handle drug couriers or robbers, they shot on the spot, and news will report that the criminals shot at police, because to the malaysian govt this are usless bums, why waste time in court and all those tax payer money and time in court just to arrive at a death penalty, they kill them once and for all...and in China, same kill their criminal on the spot, and even if go court, you got nobody to protect you, just a simple trial and you go to the firing squad on the same day as the day they sentence you to death.</p>
              <p>Drugs can turn a society into havoc, cripple the society and end up depending on it, it is in this view that a death penalty is neccessary. This is not something you dunno or you dun get it, to be fair, before you visit asian countries, you should know the rules and regulation on drug trafficking. And even with death penalty stick on it, peoples are still doing it, trading their lifes for it, just imagine if there is no death penalty, what will happen to society of Asia country, do remember that the opium had destroyed the fabric of asia by the west, do you want them to manipulate us again.</p>
              <p>Amnesty should look this as a postively, for our youngs and society, they should be more focus on poor and dictatorised countries that lack the freedom of expression and representation.</p>

              <p>Thank you for your insight.  You've now eliminated any doubt whatsover that you are a Taiwanese immigrant running a pub in Geylang.</p>
              <p>So if you are not a Taiwanese immigrant running a pub in Geylang, then what are you?  What is your purpose for such frequent and insipid diatribes in this forum?  Come on, come clean.  Do you dare to answer me?</p>

              <p><br>O u r indeed  briiliant, but still lose to me.</p>
              <p>My purpose here is nothing other than giving another vision of way people look into Singapore social and political issue. There maybe spices and sugar in my present here, but certainly, it broaden many peoples views and understanding that nothing is smooth flowing. Kind of like you are driving smoothing dreaming all the way and suddenly u hv to pull your handbrake to get a closer look at things. In another words, you can said that i am a wake up call for you, nothing to loose or gain. As i said, that $1 is still in my pocket and is yours, still inside your wallet.</p>
              <p>Yes, I am a taiwanese PR, citizen of singapore holding 2 passports, and i got pubs in Joo Chiat, Tanjong pagar and JB, Joo Chiat being my HQ, as for Geyland, we had thought of opening, but lots of PRC chinese doing business there, from steamboat to karaoke gals to massage parlour to internet call cafe. You notice the work a few months close shop and some other PRC will open again. PRC are daring, $10000 per month rental they also rent to cook fish head mee hoon..sure die one lah, but PRC are clever, they got ulterior motive in opening shops in Singapore, and these got singaporean govt fooled, for that motive, you go find it out yourselves. That is why is said, dun read too much books, be realistic, go down to the place and study yourself.</p>

              <p>Hey! As long as i am not at the end of the rope.Death penalty ok for me.</p>
              <p>No death penalty means more drugs into Singapore... More kidnapping case also...</p>
              <p>Not that i care because i dun even smoke... not rich also,so dun really bother....</p>
              <p>if u really not into death penalty,go watch the movie "Law abiding citizen".Get a feel if its ur family getting killed,then the murderer a jail for life only to get out after 10 years when president pardon him.Woohoo!!</p>
