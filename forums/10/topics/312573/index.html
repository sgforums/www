              <p>i m talking about those bunch of human rights activists in sghuman rights led by chiatilik and his bunch of lackeys like lamei and ngejay and many of their clones.</p>
              <p>all these clowns are very active in posting nonsense and petty issues in sammyboy coffeeshop. one of their gang hooliganism is to collectively attack anyone who speaks against them and hence get that targeted poster BANNED in that forum.</p>
              <p>how could they have the influence to do that u ask?</p>
              <p>easy! just register yourself as a PAID MEMBERSHIP of that forum.</p>
              <p>the trouble is these people are supposed to be "HUMAN RIGHTS" activists. do we see they  practising what they are preaching here?</p>
              <p>the current arrest of SDP protestors led by chee and chia (maybe in his capacity as the sghuman rights leeder) really made a mockery of the authencity of that protest. among the food items that were displayed to support their so all unfair price hike was FORTUNE BRAND'S SHARKSFIN and DUMEX 'GOLD' MILK POWDER.</p>
              <p>the food hike is an international phenomenal headache faced by all the countries in the world. places elsewhere, the hikes are even worst. our gov has been trying to alleviate this problem by recommending people to buy 'housebrand' products and consume frozen meat instead of fresh one.</p>
              <p>however, instead of acting rationally and contructively, these bunch of 'human rights' goondus chose to mislead the masses.</p>
              <p>it was suppose to be a 'peaceful' protest...so some parents stupidly or unwittingly brought their kids without considering much about the risks and the safety of their children should the scene turned nasty or boisterous.</p>
              <p>IT WAS ANYTHING BUT PEACEFUL. from the bystander point of views, i couldn't help but sense a more sinister motive coded inside this 'peaceful' protest. if we recall the FREE BURMESE by the burmese  and not by SDP clowns, it would be validated as PEACEFUL. WHY? when the burmese protestors were requested to stop and disperse, they did what was told. was there any arrest or charges? NO! it was really PEACEFUL!! no problems from the police. no problem from the protestors.</p>
              <p>Now look at the SDP's style. when the police asked them to stop, they argued and even teased the police by asking them: "WHERE'S MAS SELAMAT KATSTURI?" was there any respect for the laws?</p>
              <p>and this arrogant and ignorant mother who brought 2 kids there even posted that she wanted her children "to be politically awared". i wonder how her kids would grow up to be politically awared when they were still sucking their pacifiers. they might think later that police arresting people is a violation of citizens' rights and that being a criminal is not an offence cos the laws here isn't worth the respect from the citizens.</p>
              <p>singapore has come so far to achieving peace and prosperity. it wasn't accomplished over night. it took a few generations to arrive at that. with this bunch of troublemakers among our midst misleading the masses, i m very apprehensive that our society may regress to the caveman's period where no one is safe to roam the streets and curfews are imposed.</p>
              <p>why can't all these bunch of goondus get themselves into parliament first so that they can then make a difference? why can't chee soon juan accept the facts that his style of hooliganism politics CAN NEVER WORK HERE? if he loves to persist in such manner, shouldn't he migrate with his taiwanese wife to TAIWAN and show off his political expertise there?</p>
              <p>he hates the sgp gov so much...hates every policies implemented...hates for the sake of hating...and making so much nonsensical rantings, he would be most welcome to quit singapore for good!</p>
              <p>our society needs rational minded people who could come up with constructive alternatives if possible to retort the gov's policies. if we couldn't come up with a better alternative, the next best would be to stick on to what the gov has to offer. as i put up this words, i anticipate i would be branded a 'pap mole' , a paps' balls polisher and all the craps those childish wayward extremists could cough up with. BUT PLEASE GROW UP!! SEE THIS COUNTRY AS IT IS TODAY...AS IT WAS IN THE 50s...compare our beloved country to other places....DON'T RANT FOR THE SAKE OF RANTING....it's plain stupidity!!</p>
              <p> please do remember: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>WE, THE SINGAPOREANS, OWN THIS COUNTRY</strong></span>.....we definitely do not have to be like chee's sister going abroad to throw more shits at her own country.</p>
              <p>FOR WHATEVER WE DONE HERE, IT'S OUR OWN RESPONSIBLITY. we definitely do not need foreign dubious forces to interfere with out  own welfare.</p>
              <p>if that's what chee's and chia's human rights are all about, then maybe it's about time the gov should be doing something to curb it before it really escalates into public unrest misleading many deluded and disillusioned citizens.</p>
