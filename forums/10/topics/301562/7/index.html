              <p>i just dont understand why most singaporeans have such low
              opinions about other singaporeans. is it an endorsement by the PAP
              to condemn all singaporeans to be "test tube washer"? geez, im wont
              use the same model as what is used to condemn my fellow
              singaporeans..... yet.</p>
              <p>well, u enjoy your life there and i enjoy my here. There are
              many more singaporeans here in australia that come over with
              different or similar agenda but never voice it out on the forum. if
              it is soooo good in SG, then why singaporeans are leaving in
              droves?</p>

              <p>But i found it is so strange that many dunt do their home works properly before they jump ship . some dunt know what happen in their new home land,eg water restriction,teacher storage,drugs ,gangsters.</p>

              <p>3.<strong>I am more than happy many leave from SG.But pl give up your passport if u dunt have intention to come back,among other things.</strong>Dunt come back when u too old just to enjoy benefits but u spend your golden years in Oz etc to pay tax and enjoy.</p>
              <p>where is your tax to SG?</p>

              <p>However, I got my own apartment ( walking distance to the CBD and Melb Uni) before I was in my late twenties. The mortgage with my bank now is less than 30% of the total value from the first 5 years of working like crazy. So if I go bellyup , it is the property value that backs up against my debt . If die die cannot sell, got my savings  to tide me for a year at least.</p>

              <p>fishbuff, are you talking about Singaporeans living in Australia
                                          having low opinion about Singaporeans living in Singapore?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It does seems that everytime we touch on that subject
                                          overseas singapoeans (in this forum) always see
                                          themselves as one up against Singaporeans living in
                                          Singapore and somehow Singaporeans who choose to live
                                          here are always being accused as blind PAP supporters or
                                          being a turtle living in the well.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To answer your question on why you are seeing so many
                                          Singaporeans in Australia, thats because Singaporeans families are
                                          rich enough to send their children to Australia for
                                          university education.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However that shouldnt be use as the reason
                                          that Australia is a better country or vice versa</p>

              <p>The most important lesson I learnt in life is thanks to Singapore as well. I am grateful for that. Better to learn from the FT policy.</p>
              <p>Why bother complaining about FTs getting the best of both worlds? Be an FT yourself. Hey my old man started the idea , I continued with it :) .</p>
              <p>So far I look at other countries. They recruit talents that win them the olympics, that give them a nobel prize, that brings glory to the nation internationally. So far I have seen no such output from the FTs in Singapore.  Put it this way, if the ministers want to be paid like a CEO to find talents to contribute to the country's glory, and none sofar produce anything worthwhile, shouldn't they be fired like CEOs?</p>
              <p>I don't look down on Singaporeans in Singapore , I empathise with those who are stuck , like so many of my friends, and they have cannot go because of commitment or skill deficits.</p>
              <p>They are not the elites and they cannot talk about a 100K per annum salary in Singapore. Some are stuck paying off their 99 year lease apartments while supporting their families and trying to save with what measly they have left in a dream of a better life or  wishing that they belong to the elite class.</p>

              <p>Let me tell you my grandparents story :</p>
              <p>My grandma is nonya with only Pri 3 education, my grandpa born in Singapore, around the 1920s with secondary education, he looks like LKY, and supported much of the initial work LKY did in the 60s and 70s. for about 10 years into their arranged marriage, they couldn't communicate as she only spoke Malay and he English and Hokkien. Both of them went survived the Japanese occupation and understand what it was like to gather spilt rice off the floor just to survive. It was a hard life, but they eked out an blue collar existence that supported many children, due to the fact that he managed to find a decent paying job refuelling aircraft.</p>
              <p>In 1983, they decided to pack up and go to Sydney to start a new semi-retired life, after all their kids had grown up and had families of their own. Renting for a couple of years that ate slightly into their life savings, working some odd jobs here that there and then finally gaining proper residency status.</p>
              <p>In 1992 they managed to garner enough savings and earnings bought a house in Perth and migrated over there, and has been there ever since till today, retiring off the good welfare pension plans that residents over the age of 65 receive. They make yearly visits to their children's homes in Singapore. Although they liked coming back to Singapore, their visits have become shorter and shorter. The funny thing is, although they still liked Singapore, they found that they only came back to visit some of their children, and really with no other purpose. The also found that they now prefer to just settle back and relax in Australia as they get older, and are finding  that Singapore's hustle and bustle, is quite repulsive to old folks.</p>
              <p>When I was with my grandpa, he used to complain a lot about the
              Australian government and how dumb and backward they are, and sang high
              praises for LKY's initial fruitful efforts, however, he has recently
              stopped as he soon realised that the only type of information he was getting from the Straits Times supplied to the national library there on a weekly basis</p>
              <p>Now my grandparents are still there in Perth, enjoying every minute of their sunset years.</p>
              <p>It goes to show that migration was happening even way back then.</p>

              No, Australia is as competetive as Spore but Australian take a different approach to life compared to locals.
              
              Maybe it is the nature the kiasu nature of Sporeans n they have a siege mentality which drove them to work doubly hard as compared to Australian.
