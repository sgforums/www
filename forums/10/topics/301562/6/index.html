              <p>I am not sure if flipping burger is something young
              and educated Singaporeans would want to do for the rest of
              their live, plus I am not sure if australian government would
              grant you a PR or citizenship if your intention of moving to
              australia is to flip burgers?</p>
              <p>I am curious why you want to bring up USA and UK as
              comparison when we are talking about Australia. in fact, USA and UK
              are pretty bad example if you consider what is going on to their
              economy right now</p>
              <p>The subprime saga that is happening in USA is a good
              example to show that Americans are mostly living beyond their means
              (ie, using the house as ATM machine), and UK is also sitting
              on another subprime bubble waiting to burst, hence I am not
              surprise to hear "good stories" coming out of these
              countries.</p>
              <p>Dont mind me asking, how long have you been working in Singapore
              before migrating to australia?</p>
              </div>

              <p>geez, dont expect people to roll out red carpet here for u when u are new to the country. flipping burger is the "worst case scenario" but even so, i dont consider this demeaning at all. nobody bother about one social status, regardless  of Phd or a tradie. my colleague is a phd holder and he was passed off for the promotion from engineer to team lead all because of his lousy social skill.</p>
              <p>tot your focus is on $$$ as u keep probing about getting rich in australia in the other thread?? money, money, money?  so i mention to you where to earn the bigger buck since u are so fixated on acquring wealth. i have not worked nor experienced the life in UK or US, we cant really say it is for for good or for bad. i have UK and US colleagues here.. all have moved to australia because their spouse are either australians or prefer the lifestyle here.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i have been working in SG since 1990, from system administrator, engineer, to senior consultant and technical consultant. with no thanks to the current education system that SG has, i had to study part time for my advance diploma, degree and master... all while holding a full time job, with family committment, riding on a 13 years old motocycle and a pay of $1500/mth. dont tell me about hard life coz i did sell pineapple drinks in factories while i was in primary schools before. so i am a social underdog from humble background. so i didnt quit on SG first, it is SG that quit on us.</p>

              <p>I am in Singapore now. I grew up in Melbourne and life is rather laid-back there.</p>
              <p>I came here as I've got relatives who runs a business here and I want to experience the life here. Other than cars and properties, most of the stuffs here are cheaper than those in Australia except for the fact that you earn more in Australia. LOL. The taxi fares in SG are cheap while most people will shun cab drivers in Australia.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The price of cars here are "woah"..I drive a ferrari in Melbourne for your information. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Ok..i'll be giving my views as a young adult here. I've graduated from a University in Melbourne. My school mates were caucasians and kids from other asian countries. They are plain rich kids with rich parents, of course.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It's easier to study in Australia and get a PR or citizenship compared to immigrating to Australia. Life here for a young adult or kid as you all may say is fun for me. Clubbing. girls, cars. LOL.</p>
              <p>Some medicine undergraduate girls are horny too.   However, there is still a line between asians and caucasians. Also, kids from the same country tend to come together in a group. Do not be surprised that they are rich kids from Vietnam, Indonesia, India and China.</p>
              <p>I've got a friend who used to own a club in Melbourne and drives nice cars. He's only 22. He went back to his country after his mother died as he needed to take over his family business. He left behind a bunch of real nice branded stuffs which we have no choice but to take.</p>
              <p>For those who've thought of immigrating here, have you all thought about the way to bring up your kids. Drugs are a norm in Melbourne clubs and it's somewhat easy to pick a girl up from clubs.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you intend to prevent your kid from mingling with such stuffs or the general crowd, you are seriously affecting his /her teenage life and he / she will not mature well. </p>
              <p>I've seen Singaporeans who went back to Singapore after graduating from a university in Australia as they feel that they were still being treated as 2nd cough citizens there.  Cough cough...   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="icon_twisted.gif"></p>

              I would agree with Fishbuff that the education system mainly focus on result excellence n the bad part is sometimes the student's family member is also likely
              
              to put pressure on the children to excel. I also noticed especially in NS, some of the servicemen want to go OCS cause for their parents.

              <p>what to do. i dont deny there is that look that some aussies are giving to the asians. there are hoons that cruise around the sunnybank and rob asians that dare to venture out in the night. There are breakins, and there are employers that dont want to employ non-asians etc.. There is no denial of that.</p>
              <p>but there are heaps of PRCs here and some have made it so well. like the Yuan supermarket, that owner came with nothing and now he has chains of supermarkets selling asian foods, God knows how many properties he has. Another taiwanese came here at a young age of 20+, hardly speak english and now his property sales agencies has grown to a scale that make Dennis Wee realty look like a mom-pop shop. these blokes are filthy rich now. How many are there, i have no idea.</p>
              <p>by the way, the commission for realestate here is 5% for the first
              $18,000 followed by 2% afterwards. This HKie agent that is selling a
              place, had been here for 18 years and every month, he is closing 3-5
              properties easily!</p>

              Do some home work lah,90% of biz will disappear after 5 years,and very high turn over rate for house ,insurance agents.This is a common everywhere.
              
              3.This is naive to think SG is not a country let u release the potentials and she dunt treat u fair for your education level,skin of color,age,etc.And u think once u are in western soil,u can fly.

              <p>what to do. i dont deny there is that look that some aussies are giving to the asians. there are hoons that cruise around the sunnybank and rob asians that dare to venture out in the night. There are breakins, and there are employers that dont want to employ non-asians etc.. There is no denial of that.</p>
              <p>but there are heaps of PRCs here and some have made it so well. like the Yuan supermarket, that owner came with nothing and now he has chains of supermarkets selling asian foods, God knows how many properties he has. Another taiwanese came here at a young age of 20+, hardly speak english and now his property sales agencies has grown to a scale that make Dennis Wee realty look like a mom-pop shop. these blokes are filthy rich now. How many are there, i have no idea.</p>
              <p>by the way, the commission for realestate here is 5% for the first $18,000 followed by 2% afterwards. This HKie agent that is selling a place, had been here for 18 years and every month, he is closing 3-5 properties easily!</p>
              <p>bottomline: if those PRCs, HKers, taiwanese, malaysians are brave enough to make it here and excel in their business, why cant the singaporeans do it? FOR GOODNESS SAKE, we are english educated and have professional skillset. why sell ourselves short over fear?! </p>

              <p>fishbuff, I think the difference is that those hker and taiwanese who migrated to Australia are more hungry than singaporeans who migrated there to enjoy the quality of life.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The same can be said about Kwek Hong Png who came to Singapore penniless and then built an empire that is worth billions now.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Why sell yourself to a foreign land?</p>

              <p>i just dont understand why most singaporeans have such low opinions about other singaporeans. is it an endorsement by the PAP to condemn all singaporeans to be "test tube washer"? geez, im wont use the same model as what is used to condemn my fellow singaporeans..... yet.</p>
              <p>well, u enjoy your life there and i enjoy my here. There are many more singaporeans here in australia that come over with different or similar agenda but never voice it out on the forum. if it is soooo good in SG, then why singaporeans are leaving in droves?</p>

              <p>fishbuff, are you talking about Singaporeans living in Australia having low opinion about Singaporeans living in Singapore?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It does seems that everytime we touch on that subject overseas singapoeans (in this forum) always see themselves as one up against Singaporeans living in Singapore and somehow Singaporeans who choose to live here are always being accused as blind PAP supporters or being a turtle living in the well.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To answer your question on why you are seeing so many Singaporeans in Australia, thats because Singaporeans families are rich enough to send their children to Australia for university education.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However that shouldnt be use as the reason that Australia is a better country or vice versa</p>
