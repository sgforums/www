              <p>fishbuff, we do have consevative people here in Singapore too, the owner of ShengSiong Supermarket chain is also a multi-millionaire and I read in papers that he still live in the warehouse and wear torn and worn out shirt to work.

              <p>i only been here for a year so my contacts are limited. those guys bought their houses in the 90s, each like going for A100-150k. so with the market now demanding for $450k as the meridian, they arent that concern with the debts and most are fully paid.</p>
              <p><br>one thing i like about their tax system (which is rare) is that the interest that u pay for the investment property is tax deductible, plus if u acquire negative gearing (rent is not enough to cover your mortgage repayment), that is tax deductible too. plus any rennovation or repairs that u do on that property is tax deductible too. This is not applicable to your residential house. The capital gain tax is 49% applicable to investment properties but if u stay in it for 1 year, the gains are tax free.</p>
              <p>so if u dont wish to pay up front on the tax, u acquire more properties to get more tax relief. heard from my aussie colleague about this young electrican, learnt the trade from his dad and move to the mining area up in the north. pay is about A$200k a year and he pumped all into various properties around australia, up to 7 houses all in all. and he is only 27.</p>
              <p>the local aussies love properties. i heard also of surfers/ beach bums that had a stroke of reality, work their butt off and became a successful property developers. U dont get GLC or GIC to dominate the whole business scenes. everyone here has a shot at it.</p>
              <p>but people dont talk about their assets. really! im breaking the taboo in relating this to you all.</p>

              <p>fishbuff, singapore have similar tax structure for property too, ie, the interest you paid to service your mortgage for your <span style="text-decoration: underline;">investment</span> propertyis tax deductable. However you will still have to pay property tax but we dont have capital gain tax like in australia.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>By acquiring more properties to enjoy tax relief, you wil have to take up more housing loans, which means you could end up working for the banks if the value of the property doesnt appreciate as much as the interest rate you are paying. Also rental income should be taxable in austalia right? what rate are we talking about? 40%?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>AFAIK, everybody in the world love properties and that include Singaporeans and australian. Isnt that the reason why we have subprime crisis happening in america and now spreading to UK?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Singapore property landscape is not dominated by GLCs. Over here we have CDL, HoBee, Wingtai, SC Global, Lippo, Far East, MCL, and there is a long list of construction companies turn developers.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Sorry, I am not asking you to tell us who owns what, but rather, have you heard of rags to riches stories of Singaporeans in australia.</p>

              <p>if it is -ve gearing, then it is not taxable. but if it is +ve gearing, then that is yield/profit and taxable.</p>
              <p>told u that im new around here. by the term "rich", how would u define it? monetary term? peace of mind? appreciation? does it really matter? does life really boils down to one's worth that is tied to his monetary achievement? i dont think so.</p>
              <p>going by typical sinkie term, monetary term will be the default one. im not sure how much it will be.. $1million perhaps? or $2million? i dont really care. coz coming here is to shake off the sinkie mentality of greed and class system.</p>
              <p>do u think it is like ST press, everyday run news articles about who get rich where and what? who cares about the poor, the sick and the under-privileged, right? it doesnt work like that here.</p>
              <p>oz is not a place for anyone that embrace the expectation of oz to be like another SG but bigger space. it is different new ball game, if one can change his expectation, he/she can live it out well here.</p>
              <p>we dont boast our gains coz it is not the way here.</p>

              <p>fishbuff, if you want to invest in 5 properties in Australia, i am sure your intention can only be for them to appreciate isnt it? So i guess in Australia, buying property is easy, disposing them is painful if you have a capital gain?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Australians are flashy too, they do talk about mega yachts dont they? Maybe not so much in where you live.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>hsien yang is the CEO of singtel and during his realm he  acquire Optus in australia. I guess when you have to spend so much time in australia, it might be easier to become a PR to avoid all the entry VISA hassle.</p>
              <p> </p>

                              <p>fishbuff, if you want to invest in 5 properties in Australia, i
              am sure your intention can only be for them to appreciate isnt it?
              So i guess in Australia, buying property is easy, disposing
              them is painful if you have a capital gain?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Australians are flashy too, they do talk about mega
              yachts dont they? Maybe not so much in where you
              live.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>hsien yang is the CEO of singtel and during his realm he 
              acquire Optus in australia. I guess when you have to spend so much
              time in australia, it might be easier to become a PR to avoid all
              the entry VISA hassle.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When you say WE, are you calling yourself an australian already
              mate? Just curious.</p>

              Speaking about BG(NS) Lee Hsien Yang getting an Australian PR, no doubt it is less hassle free than being a foreigner in Australia, one need to know that the
              
              intangible benefit of staying in Australia than in Spore such as less emphasis on
              five C. The benefit of buying a house in Australia is better as in the person can rent out to anybody unlike HDB in which permission is needed from the HDB to rent out to others.

              <p>but
              a quick guide, IT job as an oracle database administrator in sydney can
              get $900-$1100/day on contract. SAP developer will get alot more.
              effectively, u can earn $200,000 per year as a high end IT guy.</p>
              <p> my IT career in sg is a goner. totally dominated and replaced by FTs. if i dont leave now, i will be picking cardboards for a living in my golden years.</p>

              <h1>Schools hit by science teacher shortages</h1>
              <p>By David Rood <br>Higher Education Reporter<br>April 20, 2005</p>
              <p><strong>physics teachers do not
                      have a tertiary physics major, a study finds.</strong></p>
              <p>Australia is facing an alarming shortage of qualified science
                      teachers, with some senior physics and chemistry teachers
                      "manifestly unprepared" for the classroom, according to
                      research.</p>
              <p>With a greying workforce of science teachers, falling numbers of
                      science students and problems retaining early-career teachers, the
                      shortage is predicted to worsen dramatically over the next
                      decade.</p>
              <p>A national survey of science teachers found almost 75 per cent
                      of responding schools had difficulty finding suitably qualified
                      science teachers. Forty per cent of the 629 schools cited problems
                      hiring senior physics teachers.</p>
              <p>The study, commissioned by the Australian Council of Deans of
                      Science, found that there were people teaching secondary school
                      science who had low levels of academic preparation.</p>
              <p>More than 40 per cent of senior physics teachers did not have a
                      university physics major and one in four had no tertiary background
                      in physics or studied it in first year only. A quarter of senior
                      chemistry teachers lacked a chemistry major.</p>
              <p>"No matter how good their pedagogical skills, teachers who lack
                      knowledge in their discipline are manifestly unprepared," the study
                      said.</p>
              <p>The survey of 1200 secondary school teachers, <em>Who's Teaching
                      Science?</em>, was conducted by Melbourne University researchers
                      Kerri-Lee Harris, Felicity Jensz and Gabrielle Baldwin.</p>
              <p>"The shortage of suitably qualified science teachers is likely
                      to be exacerbated in the coming years as the bulge of 'baby
                      boomers' approach retirement age," it said. Compounding the
                      shortage, almost 40 per cent of early-career science teachers were
                      unsure whether they would continue teaching.</p>
              <p>Most teachers surveyed had strong backgrounds in biological
                      science, rather than chemistry or physics.</p>
              <p>Of those aged under 30, more than half had a biology major while
                      only 17 per cent had a physics major.</p>
              <p>Council of Science Deans president Tim Brown said senior
                      teachers, particularly in physics, did not have the level of
                      qualifications that was desirable.</p>
              <p>Australia stood to lose the chance to compete in a world where
                      understanding of science was crucial, he said.</p>
              <p>"What's going to be really vital for Australia is to have a
                      supply of people who really understand what science is about and
                      how it makes discoveries that are important for society," said
                      Professor Brown, who is dean of Australian National University's
                      science faculty.</p>
              <p>In a message to federal Education Minister Brendan Nelson, who
                      is considering ending requirements that universities conduct
                      research, Professor Brown said it was "not good enough" to have
                      science degrees from teaching-only universities.</p>
              <p>"That won't give the level of skill that science teachers need
                      in order to get (the) excitement through to students that comes
                      from research engagement," he said.</p>
              <p>The report revealed there was a strong preference among heads of
                      secondary school science departments for teachers trained in
                      university science faculties, rather than through science taught in
                      education degrees.</p>
              <p>"Students who come from an education faculty often have
                      less-than-adequate basic understanding of the discipline," one head
                      of department responded. "They are OK for year 8 and 9 but year
                      10-plus is a problem in many instances."</p>
              <p>A 2003 science deans' paper found the number of full-time
                      students studying physics fell by 31.4 per cent between 1989 and
                      2002. Chemistry student numbers fell by 4.8 per cent.end of quote</p>
