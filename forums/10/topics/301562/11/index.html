              <p>i had this old church friend of more than 10 years in SG that came over to oz to place his son in the uni here. my wife was very delighted and ferried them around the place and gave them treat to meals. as they were buying furniture for the boy's new rental, we offered to sell them our desk at $20. he argued that we need to give them another table + afew chairs free and free delivery. we thought, aiyah, old friend la.. if we can help, we will definitely help.<br><br>we are going to replace the old desk with another old one from another local chinese church friend's place but somehow, my brizzie friend changed his mind and retract back his offer. so we all lan lan, i had to retain back the old desk. i called up the old sg friend who flew back to sg and tell him that we cannot sell him the table and offered to refund back + apologise.<br><br>and u know what? he blew his top and scold us verhemently. woa, for over a $20 table. then whatabout our time, energy, fuel, car that we bring him around? for nothing? our treat for him? for nothing?<br></p>
              <p>i knew that chap for more than 10 years in church and he dropped off my friendship radar for more than 5 years until recently when he want to place his son here in the uni, then he contact me.</p>
              <p>this my lesson learnt; no more extra preferential treatment for any SG friends. what a lot of ingrates.</p>

              <li>Vicious reprisals for "turf" incursions</li>
              <li>Anti-assembly powers urged</li>
              </ul>
              </div>
              <p>A TEEN bashed with a tomahawk is fighting for his life as youths warn of a Cronulla-type gang explosion in <span style="color: #ff0000;">Melbourne.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Sunshine Hospital was forced to call police and shut its emergency department as about 100 youths descended, angered by the brutal attack on their friend</span>.</p>
              <p>In another unprecedented escalation of gang violence,<span style="color: #ff0000;"> a molotov cocktail was hurled on a suburban train last week</span>.</p>
              <p>More attacks were pledged as part of a bitter conflict between two of Melbourne's biggest gangs that has seen 10 youth stabbings.</p>
              <p>Police are demanding measures to stem the growing scourge of youth gang activity.</p>
              <p>They want a Youth Crime Taskforce established, new anti-assembly powers to break up loitering crowds of teens and portable knife scanners.</p>
              <p>Shopping centres and rail operators are also changing their operations to cope with the rising gang challenge.</p>
              <p><strong>Cowardly, excessive gang attacks 'for fun'</strong></p>
              <p>Four men have been charged with attempted murder and serious assault over the attack on the 17-year-old on Friday.</p>
              <p>The teenager and four friends were "pulverised" in the St Albans attack.</p>
              <p>Their assailants - one 16 - allegedly used a tomahawk, baseball bats and hockey sticks in the violence, destroying their car and putting the five in hospital.</p>
              <p>One of the teens caught in the attack said the violent onslaught had been triggered by them being on someone else's turf.</p>
              <p>The teen, who would not give his name, had facial bruising and injured ribs and described the attack as ruthless and against innocent victims.</p>
              <p>As well as being territorial, he said the attack was carried out for fun.</p>
              <p>Police, social workers and even gang members said gang violence was flaring across Melbourne's suburbs.</p>
              <p>The Police Association - representing 11,000 officers - said the youth gang crisis demanded a regional taskforce on youth crime and anti-assembly powers.</p>
              <p>"They're under-18 and they're coming in from the outer suburbs and causing mayhem in the city and the inner suburbs," assistant secretary Bruce McKenzie said.</p>
              <p>"This is happening. And we do know it's of considerable concern to our members."</p>
              <p>The association is expected to lobby Premier John Brumby for anti-assembly powers to break up big groups of teens and expressed a desire for British-style portable walk-through metal scanners.</p>
              <p><strong>Insulting rap song inflames rivalry</strong></p>
              <p>In an escalating stoush between two of the city's biggest gangs, an Arab coalition from Melbourne's north was seething over a rap song released by enemy gang South-East Boys, threatening "another Cronulla".</p>
              <p>The song, <em>Lullaby</em>, derides the Dandenong gang's Arab enemies as "p*****s" and threatens a local Cronulla-style race clash.</p>
              <p>Gang members said the rivalry between the north and south gangs had already led to 10 stabbings.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">"Give it tomorrow, give it a year. We will hit back 10 times harder," said Ronni, leader of northern gang ASAD or Arabian Soldiers Arab Defenders. </span></p>
              <p>Gang members are aged 17 to 26 and brawl with machetes, bottles, poles, knuckle-dusters and knives.</p>
              <p>The North-West Boys, who have a distinct double-fist handshake, are made up of gangs including ASAD, which has spread from Newport, and The Clan.</p>
              <p>The North-West Boys said their opposing gang, based around Dandenong, was a mix of white "Aussie bogans", Sudanese, Afghans, Italians and Greeks.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">"We were hunting them for almost seven hours," The Clan leader Hash said.</span></p>
              <p>"If the South-East want war, then so be it."</p>
              <p>The gangs have sophisticated fight strategies and youths are attacked if they stray into another gang's side of the city.</p>
              <p>"Something in the future is going to happen to them," Ronni said.</p>
              <p>Hash said they tried to isolate their activities so members of the public would not get hurt.</p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">BLACK ski masks. Long parang knives. Black-shirted men</span></strong>.<br><br><span style="color: #ff0000;">The gang attacked and slashed Ash on his head</span>, which required stitches, as well as his shoulder and back. - Picture: KENNETH KOH<br>They looked like they belong in a fight scene in a Hong Kong movie on triads.<br><br>But there they were, at the void deck of Block 13, Eunos Crescent on Friday night.<br><br>And they confronted a group of five friends gathered there.<br><br><span style="color: #ff0000;">At first the group of friends were puzzled at the sight of seven men, who suddenly appeared in front of them.<br></span><br>Then trouble struck.<br><br>At around 9pm, the <span style="color: #ff0000;">men attacked them with the weapons</span>, causing them to scatter in different directions.<br><br>The attackers split up and chased the victims, <span style="color: #ff0000;">slashing them viciously with the parangs and knives after catching up with them in what appeared to be an unprovoked attack.</span><br><br>All five victims were later sent to the hospital, where two received outpatient treatment and three have been hospitalised since then.<br><br><span style="color: #ff0000;">And it was not the only such attack that night.<br></span><br>Over at Tampines at around 8.15pm, an <span style="color: #ff0000;">18-year-old boy was assaulted and seriously injured</span>. (See report on facing page).<br><br>When contacted, police spokesman ASP Stanley Norbert said they are investigating if both incidents are linked.<br><br>SHAKEN<br><br>Ahmad (not his real name), 24, was the most seriously injured among the five at the Eunos attack, suffering slash wounds on both arms and his head.<br><br>The other two, who were also warded, suffered slash wounds on their hand and stomach respectively.<br><br>Still looking shaken from the attack, Ahmad told The New Paper yesterday at Changi General Hospital (CGH), where he is warded, that it was an unprovoked attack.<br><br>He claimed that he and his group have no enemies nor have they offended anyone.<br><br>That was why when he first saw the armed, masked men, he thought they were going to attack others, not their group.<br><br>Ahmad said: 'I first saw about seven men, who appeared from behind the walls. They were wearing ski masks and each one was carrying either a parang or a sword.<br><br>'I thought they were looking for others. We had no time to react or run away at all before they attacked us.'<br><br>Ahmad said he and his friends, whose ages range from 17 to 24, fled in different directions with the assailants in hot pursuit.<br><br>Ahmad himself ran to Block 16 where he was pounced upon at the void deck by two attackers.<br><br>He said: 'Then three other men, also wearing ski masks and carrying parangs, appeared and also started attacking me.'<br><br>He tried to protect his head by using his hands to cover it.<br><br>'But when I did so, I heard the (hacking) sounds,' he recounted.<br><br>'I knew that the parang had hit me.'<br><br>Ahmad then tried to run into a lift.<br><br>A middle-aged man was about to exit and was threatened by the attackers.<br><br>Ahmad said: 'They warned him to get out of the way or they would also chop him.'<br><br>The five attackers then tried to force their way into the lift as Ahmad kept kicking them out.<br><br>He succeeded only after one of them told the gang 'enough' in Malay and they left.<br><br>By then, Ahmad's hands were soaked with blood, with bones visible from the wounds.<br><br><span style="color: #ff0000;">'I thought I was going to die</span>,' he said. 'If they had managed to enter the lift, I think I would have been dead by now.'<br><br>Taking the lift to the sixth floor, he sought help from a household, whose main door was open.<br><br>'I told them that I had been attacked by a gang and asked them to help call for an ambulance.'<br><br>The family also helped dress his wounds and gave him drinks.<br><br>Ahmad said they also kept talking to him because he told them he was going to faint. Later, the police and ambulance arrived to take him to hospital.<br><br>Ahmad's elder sister, 33, said she was distraught to see him badly injured.<br><br>She said: 'I don't know why they attacked my brother. He isn't the sort to mix with bad company.<br><br>'I hope the police will step up patrols and also arrest these people soon.'<br><br><span style="color: #ff0000;">Ahmad is now fearful of returning to Eunos Crescent, the neighbourhood where he had lived for nearly 20 years.<br></span><br>He moved out of the area five years ago, but would return there almost daily to hang out with his childhood friends. He said his family had plans to move back there next year because they like the area so much.<br><br>'But now, I'm not so sure.'<br><br><span style="color: #ff0000;">One of his injured friends, who is still warded at CGH, said Ahmad was the worst hit.</span><br><br>Requesting not to be named, he added: 'We do not know who these guys are and we have never offended anyone before.'<br><br>Police spokesman ASP Stanley Norbert said that so far, there have been<span style="color: #ff0000;"> no arrests</span> and those injured in both the cases are being interviewed.<br><br>'The two cases are being investigated as rioting armed with dangerous weapon,' he added.<br><br>Those convicted of the offence face a jail term of up to seven years and caning.</p>

              <p>lionnoisy doesn't care about anything that happens in Singapore's own backyard, he is only concern about Australia.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Since he is so concern about Australia, god only knows why he has not become an Australian citizen yet.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He's an ugly Singaporean who doesn't look himself in the mirror before he starts criticisizing others.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Seriously lionnoisy, why don't you take your Australia this and Australian bad to an Australian forums, folks there can better answer your questions.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You can post your issues about Australia here, we Singaporeans are not bothered about issues there.</p>

              <p>Singaporeans choose to call Australia home not because her crime rates, there are lots of other advantages living in Australia than Singapore. If you ask me, I would still emigrate to Australia despite it's higher than Singapore crime rate.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The only reason why Singapore's crime rate is low is due to it's extremely harsh punishment meted out in the courts. The harsh punishment violates basic human rights, which Singapore is not bothered with, because it has none. If you prefer low crime rates, you should try North Korea, you might have to face the firing squad if you commit robbery.</p>

              <p>Don't you know Singapore has the highest rate of prisoners per 100,000 population?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Singaporean Prisons incarcerated 4 times the amount of prisoners than Australian Prisons.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Total Persons Incarcerated 1997 (per 100,000 population):</p>
              <p>Singapore: 433.35</p>
              <p>Australia: 103.21</p>

              <p><br>If Australian crime rates are high, then proportionately the prisoners per 100,000 must also be high.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If Singapore has little crime, then proportionately the prisoners per 100,000 must be low.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Only explantion for Singapore's low crime rate, but high prisoner rate is because the judicial system metes out harsh and long sentences for convicts. Therefore before the earlier convicts can be released (like Australia), the new convicts are already in there.</p>
