              <p>I am not sure if flipping burger is something young
              and educated Singaporeans would want to do for the rest of
              their live, plus I am not sure if australian government would
              grant you a PR or citizenship if your intention of moving to
              australia is to flip burgers?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am curious why you want to bring up USA and UK as
              comparison when we are talking about Australia. in fact, USA and UK
              are pretty bad example if you consider what is going on to their
              economy right now</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The subprime saga that is happening in USA is a good
              example to show that Americans are mostly living beyond their means
              (ie, using the house as ATM machine), and UK is also sitting
              on another subprime bubble waiting to burst, hence I am not
              surprise to hear "good stories" coming out of these
              countries.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Dont mind me asking, how long have you been working in Singapore
              before migrating to australia?</p>

              <p>i bet snakebluff's house does not have floor heating (poor

              <p>If i emigrate to OZ, i would not choose to "downgrade" so much

              insects during summers. I will have floor heating high floor condo
              with 24hrs security.</p>
              <p>Over here in Singapore, I earn high interest in Aussie

              <p>Fymk :  You wait til the foreign investor buay tahan the mortgage repayments then you move in and make a cutthroat offer  with a take it or leave it option</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>TCH : While you are waiting at the sideline for the them to "buay tahan" may I know where will you be staying?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Fymk : The interest rate won't hit me so hard since my mortgage is only 30% of my property value.  My property is in melbourne and I am staying in Brisbane. So go figure.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>TCH : It is not about the interest here, it is about buy low sell low, buy high sell high.</p>
              <p>ie. if there is a property slump in Australia, your existing property value will go down in tandem with the new property you intend to acquire at supposingly "good deal", unless you are buying an <span style="text-decoration: underline;">investment property</span> or <span style="text-decoration: underline;">currently renting</span>.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Fymk : Ah I see your problem but you have to see my view - you are probably talking about the suburbs. Mine is smack near  the CBD and near the Uni of Melb. The value will go up not down . I don't look at anything else except CBD areas because the flow will always be into the city not out of the city</p>

              <p>You claim that there will always be rental demand for property
              in CBD and around UNI, hence regardless if the property price goes
              up or down, there will still be income. (Isnt this a bullet proof
              statement?)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And I am telling you that it can only be income after you
              deducting your rental with all related cost.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What I am also trying to tell you is that, if you rental
              yield doesnt offer you more than 8% return, you might as well sell
              the property and put the money into fixed deposit to collect
              interest.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>btw, do you know how to calculate rental yield?</p>

              In Spore, a flat belonged to the govt no matter when people paid for it, if need to rent out need to inform
              
              govt compared to neighbouring Indonesia or Malaysia. Coming back to the people migrating to other countries, there is an article last Sunday about people citing stress of living in Spore n the expensive pigeon hole.
