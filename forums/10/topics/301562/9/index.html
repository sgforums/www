              <p>Note that I have merely said that Singaporeans who migrated because of FTs are FTs themselves in their host country, and thus doing exactly the same thing they had detested.</p>

              <p>OZ dunt favour foreigners.So do Sporeans boss.All are favours to
                  their wallets!!They just look at value for money.</p>
              <p>I dunt see ''<strong>Australia doesn't favor foreigners over
                  their own.''.Show me the evidences.</strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">My dear, your statement is idiotic and obviously you do not take it what is said previously. The evidence is in the way they tax , the unions and how stringent work visas are given. Whilst Singapore gives out work permits like candy to allow foreigners to come in to find jobs, Australia doesn't . It is either you have a job waiting for you in Australia or else you don't come in as a foreign worker. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">But obviously , you are reciting  the attitudes of the employment sector in Singapore where cheaper is better than protecting your own local workforce.</span></p>
              <p><em>Dear friend,can understand the test kids ARE ALREADY USED IN
                  7TH FLEET?</em></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Urm it is under trialing from what I can understand. If it was so effective , why are other countries or cruise operators not taking it up?</span></p>
              <p>2nd part of your argument - I don't care what the lab says. They
                  are , in scientific terms, biased in their report.  They can
                  say alot of beautiful things. It does not matter. Until WHO (world
                  health organisation) comes up with the verdict on which companies'
                  test is the most accurate , this is a useless example of
                  anything.</p>
              <p><em>REPLY;only the fool will wait for WHO to tell which one is
                  the best.No prudent boss will wait after many of their staff die
                  from bird flu then take action.Have WHO gave u the super fast
                  temparture infra red screening remote monitor developered by
                  Singapore during SARS period?</em></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">OH YES  I am such a fool ....LOL . <em>Oh yes the test kit will be the be-all-end-all of your H5N1 problems.  </em>Tests are usually used to identify infected personnel for quarantine quickly . But no point if the US 7th naval fleet has it only , not grand old USA or the whole naval fleet.<br> </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">You must know one thing: others in the Netherlands , Australia and, Germany are developing their own test kits. Detection tests are already being used by some cruise operators for quarantine purposes.<br> </span></p>
              <p>3rd, I am talking about FT policy. <strong>Hey if Singaporean
                  homegrown scientist comes up with the rapid test that is endorsed
                  by the World health organisation, it reinforces my point that the
                  FT policy is a crap policy which negatively affected your own
                  Singaporeans and favored useless foreigners over your
                  OWN.</strong></p>
              <p>So your current argument has been rendered useless. Anything
                  else to continue making me laugh ?</p>
              <p><em>REPLY:DO U KNOW HOW MANY FOREIGNERS IN US AND UK AND OTHER
                  WESTERN COUNTRIES doing top R and D?</em><span style="color: #ff0000;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">You only talk cock about your second class
                  foreign talents  when you should be telling me about homegrown
                  scientists - your homeground scientists are the ones who will be the
                  foundation of the biotech industry . Not some foreigner. <strong>Why don't you
                  even exalt the talents of your own people?</strong></span></p>
              <p><em>I wish u good luck if u just wait for WHO instruct u to take
                  actions,especially it is headed by Magrate CHAN from HONG KONG.Pl
                  ask people from HK how they assess Mrs CHAN ability during SARS
                  period?</em></p>
              <p><em>Pl read my old thread on her.WHO wants give face to PRC and
                  the only one looks suitable is HER.u may remember the officials of
                  PRC during SARS .</em></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">You seem to be good at throwing mud on other
                  countries. Remember that other countries like USA , Germany,
                  Netherlands  and Australia have a far more established biotech sectors.
                  Why don't you compare Singapore to Taiwan? I heard Taiwan did pretty
                  well too in controlling the spread of SARs.</span></p>

              <p>reflecting this week changes, one of my friend is sending her 2nd child to brisbane for her university studies. her son has been here mid last july and she is embarking another trip this week. asking why her child already has a place in NUS with bonds but she prefers to send her here instead (and incuring S$100k+ expense). i wonder, same goes to her son whom she had budgeted another $100k+ for his study as well.</p>
              <p>i spoke to a malaysian chap who had emigrated here since 1990 and both of his children are studying in the university. i asked him if he has any worry about his children education finance, he replied that he as ABSOLUTELY no worry at all.</p>

              <p>The question is: what's so special about the set up? It was not a case of coming up with anything new, but a case of fastest finger first.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Is it an good thing to do? Yes. Is there any reason to toot our own horn about it? No. It was something that should have been done and it was done and that was that. Your attempt to blow it out of proportion as a case of Singapore boleh is actually quite disgraceful... considering instead of using our scanners, other countries figured out a cheaper solution using commercial thermal camera setups that worked just as well. They didn't get the "awards" at the end of the day, but they still got the job done... with less fanfare and pomp as well. </p>

              <p>Actually I think it's clear to everyone that lionnoisy had no concept of intellectual intergity... possibly because the two words are too big for his demostrated grasp of the language. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"><img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"><img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>I think I'll go with the people who actually stay and work there, lionnoisy can quote all the articles he wants but it's obvious that most people have the common sense not to listen to him... which is not a bad thing considering after talking so much about the problems of the ADF, he goes on to suggest it is a good move for our military to crash our latest advanced UAVs into targets as mini suicide bombs! <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"><img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"><img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>

              <div class="articleDetails">
              <div id="bylineDetails">Maxine Frith<br>February 10, 2008</div>
              </div>
              <p> </p>
              <p>WELCOME to the new Struggle Street - the middle class, suburban Sydney road where four houses in a row of six have been repossessed within 10 months of each other.</p>
              <p>Seymour Way in Kellyville is a snapshot of how the home loan crisis is moving out of traditional lower-income hot spots and into the McMansions of Middle Australia.</p>
              <p>One expert warned that a combination of rising interest rates, stagnating house prices and irresponsible lending had created a "time bomb of loans that is probably going to implode".</p>
              <p>First to suffer in Seymour Way was No.48, a four-bedroom, two-bathroom detached property bought for $950,000 in August 2005. It was sold in January 2007 for just $490,000 by First Mortgage Company, which had won a repossession order.</p>
              <p>Experts believe that, like the other houses involved, the home was massively overvalued at the time. They say many loans are financed by shonky mortgage brokers who get a commission based on the value of property - so they have a vested interest in ramping up the price.</p>
              <p>Second to go was No.42. Again it was bought for $950,000 in September 2005 and sold under order of repossession for $490,000 in March last year - again with the same mortgage company as creditor.</p>
              <p>Next door, No.4 was bought in September 2003 for $780,000. Last April it sold for $502,500, with the Perpetual Ltd company as the owner since it had been repossessed.</p>
              <p>No.52 became repossession No.4. Bought in September 2003 for $780,000, it was sold last October for $532,000 on the orders of the Rock Building Society.</p>
              <p>Shaun Crockford, manager of L.J. Hooker Kellyville, the real-estate agent that oversaw last year's sale of No.42, said: "If we had been the agents [at the time of the 2005 sale] there is no way we would have expected those houses to sell at that price. They were not worth that."</p>
              <p>Mr Crockford said some brokers were conducting "drive-by valuations", which were not giving a realistic estimate of what a home was worth.</p>
              <p>The consumer campaign group Choice wants to see national regulation of mortgage brokers and an end to the practice of commissions linked to the value of the property.</p>
              <p>A draft bill on federal regulation is out to consultation at the moment but does not have the backing of the Finance Brokers Association of Australia, which says it will not stop dodgy brokers and will create too much paperwork to be workable.</p>
              <p>Peter White, national president of the FBAA, said: "One of our big issues is that the legislation will create an anti-competitive environment. We are not against national regulation but it has got to be right.</p>
              <p>"In any environment, those that want to do the wrong thing will do it - legislation won't stop them," he said.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Another issue is the increase by 26 per cent last year of low-documentation loans that are approved by fringe lenders and mainstream banks. They were designed for self-employed people who did not have pay slips, but they have been increasingly used to approve loans for people on low incomes who cannot repay loans.</em></span></strong></p>

              <p>The value of his property is worth $500K, while his bank borrowing is $430K. Assuming he got a fixed rate loan from the bank at 6.5% (now it is about 8.5%), the total interest he will be paying for his mortgage will be about $530 per week vs his after tax salary income of $690 per week.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>The value of his property is worth $500K, while his bank
              borrowing is $430K. Assuming he got a fixed rate loan from the bank
              at 6.5% (now it is about 8.5%), the total interest he will be
              paying for his mortgage will be about $530 per week vs his
              after tax salary income of $690 per week.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you read the article again, it stated clearly that he is
              living in one of the property, while renting out the other and
              collecting a weekly rental of $240</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Supposed he doesnt need support a car and spend money on other
              big ticket items, his nett cashflow per month is only $145 per
              week.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Suppose he lost his job, the $2000 cash in his bank
              will only be enough to last him for 2.5 weeks, after which he
              will be in debt.</p>

              <p>hello?  were you really from singapore?</p>
              <p>HDB loan is state loan to individual HDB flat buyer.  Until now, there were indeed very few cases of repossessions by HDB.  These few cases were only confined to cases where the HDB flat owners abused their rights and used the flats for illegal and criminal activities.  None is due to late payments.  Haven't you heard of "debt restructuring"?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>if the loan is a commercial bank loan, sorry, it would be foreclosed.</p>
