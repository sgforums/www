              <p> alright. i will let u know if i come across any.</p>

              <p>but a quick guide, IT job as an oracle database administrator in sydney can get $900-$1100/day on contract. SAP developer will get alot more. effectively, u can earn $200,000 per year as a high end IT guy.</p>
              <p> my IT career in sg is a goner. totally dominated and replaced by FTs. if i dont leave now, i will be picking cardboards for a living in my golden years.</p>

              <p>I juz wish to highlight that pple leave the country for various reasons.</p>
              <p>Some leave becos they have better job opportunities overseas, some leave cos they wanted a more balanced life (as opposed to a hectic life here)</p>
              <p>So there may or may not be Singaporeans who made it big in aussie.</p>
              <p>May not = becos they just wanted to have a balanced life. To live a decent life, have a decent job and have time to enjoy and have fun with their family.</p>

              U can said so cause making money is not everything. I also like to migrate to other countries n I am not a Sporean, just a PR only from Indonesia. I have not 
              
              given up my citizenship for some reason.

              US is a country if u a person work hard, they can be successful n if u look at the late Bruce Lee, Jet Li
              
              they are not highly educated but when they went to US to pursue their showbiz career, they managed to be successful. Is it possible for martial artist to be successful in the Spore showbiz? Have u stayed in US or Australia to experience their lifestyle?

              <p><br>US is a country if u a person work hard, they can be successful n if u look at the late Bruce Lee, Jet Li they are not highly educated but when they went to US to pursue their showbiz career, they managed to be successful. Is it possible for martial artist to be successful in the Spore showbiz? Have u stayed in US or Australia to experience their lifestyle?</p>

              <p>America is a big country and the lifestyle in the eastcoast, midwest, westcoast, the bible belt etc are all very different. Personally I prefer the midwest, but not the weather.</p>

              I stayed there for a couple of years studying in SF Bay area n it is the same place where Glen Tan, the CEO of
              
              Subaru Spore used to study. Anyway it is called the Silicon valley n there is plenty of foreign professionals working there n in SF chinatown, surprised to see plenty of HK people going to work in Chinese restaurant.
