              <p>hello? u ever buy new HDB flat before?</p>
              <p>u think CPF will loan u direct nowaday? and when u borrow from banks, u think it is so easy to default and stay?</p>
              <p>if it is not reported in the ST news doesnt mean it doesnt exists.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Getting loan from CPF is no difficult at all, the reason some prefer private bank loans to CPF is because of the slightly high interest rate.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Singapore banks are very stringent on loan approval and the maximum loan amount home owner can take is 90% and they are seldom available unless you have a extremely good credit record.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In Australia I believe you can take up to 97% of your property valuation. which means if you want to buy a $1m property in australia, all you need is to have a good credit record and $30,000 in cash. </p>

              <p>Really?Oh My God!!I think just US can get near 100% loan.When u give near 100% loan,it is a sub prime already!!I dunt know oz also like this.</p>
              <p>I quote in ''There are many Singaporeans in Oz lately'that few houses just foreclosed and sold by banks recently at half of the 2005 prices!!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2.Why?A drop of 5 % in property value will make the bank in loss,the sale price cant cover the loan.But in the down hill market,the realised price will be lower.</p>
              <p>3.Review Oz now.</p>

              <p>I am sad people  here first to look at who post the posting first before the postings.Do the materials inside the postings important than the poster?While your English is much better than me,does it mean your opinions is better than mine?</p>

              <p>You ought to be sad... because after tooting so much of our horn, how can it be our progressive, world class educational system failed to make any dent on your inability to use english properly.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You know, if you actually did less cut and paste your english might improve? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"><img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And might i remind you <span style="color: #ff0000;">"here first to look at who post the posting first before the postings" </span><span style="color: #000000;">is not only a disaster of language that only you can make, it's a really funny statement.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Unfortunately considering how your arguments are always blown to bits, your opponents not only have a better grasp of the language, but of logic and reason as well.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And you know what is even more funny? Your poor english renders you unable to understand your opponents replies. The number of times you have misread, or answered totally out of point even the most simple posts is almost too many to count. In the latest example, you asked FMYK a question that she had already answered in her previous post, and that was funny because it was right there and totally obvious.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now if you can't even read the normal english of your opponents properly, there is little confidence in your ability to properly understand the journalistic language in the articles you rabidly cut and paste. </p>

              <p>2.I dunt think u MUST get to know one place by staying there.I have seen sone forumers here dunt know the Oz city they stay facing water shortage.</p>

              <p>You don't need to <span style="color: #ff0000;">"MUST get to know"</span> (another example of lionnoisy english as it is broken) a place by staying there. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However if you are going to make very big statements about any place, you must understand that there will be people who ACTUALLY are there and right there and then in that situtation who you must contend with. And unfortunately they are far more convincing then your articles.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The reason is simple, articles are written not to be mundane, because it is about "news", not "no-news". Hence all you get are the highlights of the picture and not the big picture. The people in the cities your mentioned read the same articles as you, not to mention they actually see the other things beyond the articles.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Simply put, when we had SARS we knew we were facing a problem. But at no one point did we think it would do us in. It was something we had to deal with and live with.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And Roonoisy (your australian counterpart) can quote all the SARS in Singapore articles he wants to paint the situtation there as dangerous and unsituable, but ultimately the average Singaporean knows that it's just a problem, and not an insurmountable one. Life still goes on.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Why? Because they know the place better then you. They know that articles aside, there is still a life worth living and totally possible despite the problems. And mind you these are people who have seen both sides of the coin, both Singapore and Australia.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The difference is this: other countries have the guts to face up to their problems as things to be faced and solved. The US deals with tornados, Australia with droughts and what have you not. In Singapore, our problems, such as a brain drain of top local talent, the uncertain replacement of them with FT, is dealt with as if it didn't even exist or given some spin.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And unfortunately unlike water, a brain drain is harder to reverse. You can patch the holes here and there but unless the actual rot is taken care of it will not be solved.</p>

              I believe some of the local parents are not happy with full time NS given to their children. Some of the parents
              
              went to send their son to other countries in hope they never came back to Spore. Korean mother often go to Canada to give birth to their son in hope of giving Canadian citizenship. The policy of reservist is that once a person came back to Spore, he still need to fulfill his reservist obligation.

              <p>Problem with Lion is that he/she shoots her mouth off without considering other facts. Lion does not live in Australia yet he/she wishes to argue with Singaporeans who do LIVE overseas while he/she have been using newspaper  reports as the holy grail of facts - the last question would apply towards Lion.</p>
              <p>There is a difference between fact finding and the croaking of the frog in the well. Unfortunately Lion would fit perfectly in the latter not the former.</p>

              <p>You ought to be sad... because after tooting so much of our horn, how can it be our progressive, world class educational system failed to make any dent on your inability to use english properly.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You know, if you actually did less cut and paste your english might improve? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"><img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And might i remind you <span style="color: #ff0000;">"here first to look at who post the posting first before the postings"</span> <span style="color: #000000;">is not only a disaster of language that only you can make, it's a really funny statement.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Unfortunately considering how your arguments are always blown to bits, your opponents not only have a better grasp of the language, but of logic and reason as well.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And you know what is even more funny? Your poor english renders you unable to understand your opponents replies. The number of times you have misread, or answered totally out of point even the most simple posts is almost too many to count. In the latest example, you asked FMYK a question that she had already answered in her previous post, and that was funny because it was right there and totally obvious.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now if you can't even read the normal english of your opponents properly, there is little confidence in your ability to properly understand the journalistic language in the articles you rabidly cut and paste. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You don't need to <span style="color: #ff0000;">"MUST get to know"</span> (another example of lionnoisy english as it is broken) a place by staying there. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However if you are going to make very big statements about any place, you must understand that there will be people who ACTUALLY are there and right there and then in that situtation who you must contend with. And unfortunately they are far more convincing then your articles.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The reason is simple, articles are written not to be mundane, because it is about "news", not "no-news". Hence all you get are the highlights of the picture and not the big picture. The people in the cities your mentioned read the same articles as you, not to mention they actually see the other things beyond the articles.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Simply put, when we had SARS we knew we were facing a problem. But at no one point did we think it would do us in. It was something we had to deal with and live with.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And Roonoisy (your australian counterpart) can quote all the SARS in Singapore articles he wants to paint the situtation there as dangerous and unsituable, but ultimately the average Singaporean knows that it's just a problem, and not an insurmountable one. Life still goes on.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Why? Because they know the place better then you. They know that articles aside, there is still a life worth living and totally possible despite the problems. And mind you these are people who have seen both sides of the coin, both Singapore and Australia.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The difference is this: other countries have the guts to face up to their problems as things to be faced and solved. The US deals with tornados, Australia with droughts and what have you not. In Singapore, our problems, such as a brain drain of top local talent, the uncertain replacement of them with FT, is dealt with as if it didn't even exist or given some spin.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And unfortunately unlike water, a brain drain is harder to reverse. You can patch the holes here and there but unless the actual rot is taken care of it will not be solved.</p>

              <p>Yawn... the difference is this:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Do you want to take your own destiny into your own hands and learn to make your own life or do you want to live in a place which spoonfeeds you your path and exacts a cost from you for it?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Lionnoisy cannot understand the main problem is this: The kind of people that our Government WANTS to retain... the creative, talented people are exactly the kind that cannot be spoonfed by the system. They would so much rather brave the "dangers" of other countries (crime, drugs and the like) and live a real life with their own choice, and as it goes many have and have not regretted their decision.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Who said going to Australia would solve everything? Will there be downsides? Of course... but can Australia give a lot of things Singapore as it now stands cannot?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>CERTAINLY.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And for many that's more then worth it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Last I checked in Singapore you still can get beaten up and chopped for no reason by parang. (just ask any NSF policeman what they come across in 2 years)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There still are drug problems and there are places in our tiny island that are not safe at night. (Ask any CNB officer if they think their job is ever finished)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We still get crimes and murders and accidents enough to fill the New Paper.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So "alternate" all the views you want, but as it stands most people who do their homework see that Australia still more then a viable option. Which is exactly why the people here paint a "rosy" picture. It's not a "rosy" picture as it is a real picture of what the TYPICAL migrant in Australia eventually becomes.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Did the Australian govt. point a gun to the head of the Singaporeans in there to report a rosy picture back? If it was really as "alternative" as Lionnoisy cranks it out to be, there would be an uproar by now... but as it stands the tide's still going the other way.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So at the end of the day, whatever Lionnoisy posts... what reality is really saying back to him is:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"So what?"</p>

              <p>Here's a clue Lionnoisy... instead of cutting and pasting reports written by journalists with highly charged political adgendas... try going to this webpage called <a href="http://www.strategypage.com/">http://www.strategypage.com/</a> in there is where REAL soldiers and experts from all over the world talk about their military. There is a forum on Australia and her military and try spreading your ideas of an ineffective, unworkable ADF in there.</p>

              <p>Maybe Lionnoisy doesn't know but army equipment/vehicles can be modified . Alot of countries modify old war machines or weaponry with their special specifications including Singapore. What's the use of people purchasing a vehicle that has known weaknesses?</p>
              <p>The ADF have their own problems but they have been involved in real arm conflicts. They have the experience of dealing in real wars , not some exercise drill. Australian soldiers have came back in coffins during this decade because they engaged in frontline combat in a real war.</p>
              <p>If you dare insult the ADF  in Australia , you probably get a tongue lashing . They are proud of their war veterans and soldiers. Everyone knows the sacrifices they make.</p>
              <p>Even when Singapore first started looking at her defence, they had to invite the Israelis in to help out. Why? Because Israel has been engaged in real conflict against bigger odds and they have stood their ground so far. They were experienced while Singapore was not and still remains unexperienced in real war on a mass scale.</p>
              <p>Winning a war  is not about technological prowess only. It is also about strategy that comes from experience.</p>

              <p>NS is good,</p>
              <p>It instill patriotism in those who had gone through it. And i believe all of us still recognise ourselves as singaporeans</p>
              <p>But it is just that we cannot concord with changes in things, and most of it was a result of policies lay down by a self serving group of people.</p>
              <p>That why we move to find a heaven for ourselves, but deep in our heart we hope to return to be with our relatives, friends, life styles, language, .. food</p>

              <p>Yawn... if I remembered, we spent millions of dollars and over 20 years messing around with an 1950s era light tank with weak firepower, nonexistent armour and less mobility then tanks 4 TIMES its weight before deciding to spend another couple of million finally making the solution that was obvious all these years in getting a proper MBT that people have already been using for years.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In the meantime, several tankers were killed in accidents with this 1950s era light tank that could have been avoided with more modern designs.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And finally after spending millions of dollars, and 20 wasted years on keeping a vintage design... we finally decided to use them as scrap metal. </p>
