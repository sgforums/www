              <p>Only explantion for Singapore's low crime rate, but high
              prisoner rate is because the judicial system metes out harsh and
              long sentences for convicts. Therefore before the earlier convicts
              can be released (like Australia), the new convicts are already in
              there.</p>

              <p>Maybe we can start advocating death sentences for more criminal offences, then we will have fewer crimes.</p>

              <p class="standfirst"><strong style="display: block;">GRUBBY benchtops, sloppy pest control and off deli meats were found during independent audits of public hospital kitchens that found 94 per cent did not comply with new hygiene and safety laws.</strong></p>
              <p><em>The Daily Telegraph</em> can reveal 166 of 171 hospitals checked during voluntary audits "required one or more corrective actions" for them to meet new guidelines set down by the <span style="color: #ff0000;">NSW Food Authority</span>.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Four public hospitals were deemed so bad they failed completely, scoring an "unacceptable" rating for their operations.</span></p>
              <p>But the hospitals won't be named and shamed as the Food Authority claims it would be a breach of their business affairs - considered more important than patients' right to know of threats to their health.</p>
              <p>It was also claimed identifying the hospitals would make them unco-operative in complying in future audits.</p>
              <p><strong><em>Use the feedback form below to tell us your hospital food horror stories.</em></strong></p>
              <p>Overall, documents obtained under Freedom of Information laws show there were 719 areas of corrective action required for the 166 hospitals.</p>
              <p>Censored audit reports for the failed public hospitals show the detail of how poor some hospitals are on hygiene and safety.</p>
              <p>One of the reports shows a coolroom was running at an unhealthy warm temperature, a precondition for food poisoning. The same kitchen had frozen meats and milk powder stored beyond used-by dates with sliced deli meats with a 24-hour life found stored for four days.</p>
              <p>Another report of a public hospital found unclean can openers, no records on pest control and food handling concerns.</p>
              <p>Staff involved in food preparation wearing gloves were observed picking up food off the floor. One staff member was "observed coughing into her glove and not removing it".</p>
              <p>The unhealthy kitchens are the latest blow to the NSW health system, already reeling over scandals including mismanagement of Royal North Shore Hospital and the bungled construction of the new Bathurst Hospital.</p>
              <p>A NSW Health spokeswoman said none of the issues raised in the audit incurred penalty notices and there was no threat to public health.</p>
              <p>"In all cases where there was an issue found at audit, remedial action was undertaken immediately," the spokeswoman said.</p>
              <p>Brian Holloway, 56, had nothing but praise for the medical staff at Mona Vale Hospital during his long stay last year_ but he had no love for the hospital's menu.</p>
              <p>He was appalled at being served what he said was quiches served flat like pancakes, rice tough enough to put through a slug gun and mashed potato like "quick-set cement''.</p>

              <p><strong>SINGAPORE:</strong> A strain of dengue new to Singapore is <span style="color: #ff0000;">impeding efforts to stem the spread of the mosquito-borne disease that has infected hundreds in the affluent city-state</span> this year, a top health official said Thursday.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Health Minister Khaw Boon Wan said the <span style="color: #ff0000;">current rise in infections</span>, including a <span style="color: #ff0000;">record 210 cases last week</span> and <span style="color: #ff0000;">one fatality</span>, evoked memories of a <span style="color: #ff0000;">2005 epidemic that killed 25 in the tropical island-nation of 4.5 million</span>.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"<span style="color: #ff0000;">I'm quite worried about the dengue trend,"</span> Khaw told reporters on the sidelines of an infectious diseases exhibition.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Authorities said earlier this week that Singapore recorded a nearly <span style="color: #ff0000;">50 percent increase in dengue infections in the first 4-1/2 months of this year compared to the same period in 2006.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Dengue cases reported from the start of January to May 12 rose to <span style="color: #ff0000;">1,488 — up from 993 in the corresponding period last year</span>, the Health Ministry said.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The dengue virus now predominant in Singapore is believed to be the same as in neighboring Indonesia, and is different from the main active strain in Singapore over the past few years, according to local media reports.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Those previously infected with other types of dengue are not immune, and may even face a higher risk of complications when infected with a different strain, The Straits Times newspaper said.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Health officials have been combing public housing estates in search of mosquito breeding sites. Dengue-carrying insects can breed in tiny pools of water found in flower pots, discarded bottles or cans, or old tires.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Health Ministry said the recent spike in infections is likely due to warmer weather during this period of the year, which is conducive for breeding mosquitoes and the spread of dengue.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <div class="postcontent">My adopted long-term home, Singapore, is having its worst outbreak of mosquito-borne dengue fever in recent memory according to an AFP <a href="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2005-09/11/content_476784.htm"><span style="color: #0000ff;">article</span></a> carried in Voice-of-the-State, <em>China Daily</em>. Don't underestimate what a big deal this is for Singapore, which invests huge amount of effort into mosquito control and which prides itself on being the one Southeast Asian nation that you would actually consider raising your children in. This is being called the biggest health crisis in Singapore since SARS. That's really saying something, because I remember SARS in Singapore, and it was a spooky and weird time. Medical facilities are being pushed to their limits, and the nation is being called upon to make the sacrifices that you would expect in times of severe hardship:<br></div>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">By one estimate, over 100 new cases per day are now being reported, and since there is no effective vaccine against the virus, mosquito eradication is the only means of containing it.<br><br>Health Minister Khaw Boon Wan has gone to the extent of urging Singaporeans to postpone breast enlargement and other forms of non-critical surgery to ease the load on public hospitals in Singapore, where foreigners regularly go for sophisticated operations.</span></p>

              <p><span>SINGAPORE: 95 percent of students in primary and secondary schools have experienced bullying in their schools. <br><br><span style="color: #ff0000;">Out of 4000 students surveyed, almost all said they have experienced bullying. <br></span><br>Majority were victims of verbal bullying such as teasing and name calling. <br><br>But over <span style="color: #ff0000;">2800 cases of physical bullying such as being kicked, hit or pushed were also reported. <br></span><br>The survey was conducted by the Harvest Centre for Research, Training &amp; Development, and also the Coalition Against Bullying for Children &amp; Youth. <br><br>"Quite a huge percentage said they feel angry and the second highest would be the <span style="color: #ff0000;">sadness and depression</span>, which could lead to <span style="color: #ff0000;">low self esteem</span>. International research has shown that bullies, by the age of 17 to 27, have a higher tendency to enter a <span style="color: #ff0000;">criminal career</span>. There has been known cases where bully victims take matters into their own hands because they need to do something about it. For example, they <span style="color: #ff0000;">slash their wrists with penknives or they plot revenge</span>," said Esther Ng, founder of Coalition Against Bullying. <br><br>The survey also found that in primary schools, 46 percent of instances of bullying took place in the canteens, and 42 percent in the school field. <br><br>But in secondary schools, 38 percent of bullying instances took place in the classroom, 35 percent in the canteen and 23 percent in the school toilets. <br><br><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">In Australia and the United States, it is mandatory for schools to have anti bullying programmes.</span></span> <br><br><span style="color: #0000ff;">But not in Singapore.</span> <br><br></span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><strong><span style="font-size: 8.5pt; color: black; font-family: Arial;">SINGAPORE : Four SAF commandos have been found guilty of causing the death of Second Sergeant Hu En Huai. Sentencing will take place next Friday. <br><br>The 19-year-old NSman died during combat survival training on Pulau Tekong last August. <br><br>After 36 days of testimonies from 50 witnesses, January 7 was to be a day for the lawyers to make their closing submissions. <br><br>Lawyers from all sides presented their closing arguments and expected judgment to be adjourned to a later date. <br><br>But 40 minutes later, District Judge Ng Peng Hong returned from his chambers with a judgment. <br><br>The judge found the four army officers guilty of causing the death of Second Sergeant Hu by committing a rash act. <br><br>The verdict comes nearly 10 months after Second Sergeant Hu died after his head was repeatedly held under water. <br><br>This was part of the Combat Survival Training course, designed to prepare trainees for the potential treatment they might receive as a prisoner of war. <br><br>Both Lieutenant Jeff Ng Chin Fong and Lieutenant Divanandhari Chandrasekharan were among those who conducted the training course. <br><br>They were charged with causing death, by holding Mr Hu's head under water and ''digging his nose'' to prevent him from holding his breath.</span></strong></p>

              <p><span style="color: #000000;">THE parang attack ended as swiftly as it had begun.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">In less than five minutes, the attackers had fled the scene after pouncing on a group of seven friends.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">The silence was telling too. It</span> was as if the gang of around eight male attackers was focused on just slashing their victims.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">One victim said the attackers were so quiet that all he could hear was the sounds of parangs slicing their bodies.</span> </span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">But the ferocity of the attack was never in doubt.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">It left two victims lying in a pool of their own blood.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">One had his left hand nearly chopped off - he "could feel it dangling".</span></p>
              <p>Another victim managed to flee the scene, but not before getting a deep cut that stretched from his right ear to his mouth.</p>
              <p>A fourth man and the three women who were with them escaped unharmed.</p>
              <p>All three victims, men in their mid-20s, survived the vicious attack, which happened outside Liang Court shopping complex near Clarke Quay at about 4am on Sunday.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">It was the latest in a string of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">similar horrific incidents</span>.</span></p>
              <p>The trio, who are colleagues at a pest control company, and their family members declined to be identified when The New Paper spoke to them in hospital.</p>
              <p>All three victims claimed the attack had been unprovoked and that neither they nor their friends had offended anyone recently.</p>
              <p>They also insisted they had not stepped on anyone's toes while partying at the nearby Ministry of Sound (MOS) on Saturday night, shortly before they were attacked.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">All that violence was over a dispute during a soccer game. </span></p>
              <p>Unhappy that Puvaneshvanan Bala, 18, had pushed him during the game, Rudy planned revenge and roped in his brother to help in case he was outnumbered.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He already had a parang hidden in the bushes near Block 421 Jurong West Street 42, where they lived in a four-room flat.</p>
              <div>On Nov 30 last year, he retrieved the parang and, along with his brother, approached Puvaneshvanan who was with three others walking along the void deck of the block.</div>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">They set upon Puvaneshvanan, who used his left hand to ward off the blows. Rudy sliced it off at the wrist.</span> One of the victim's friends, a 15-year-old boy, ran away but Rudy caught up with him. <span style="color: #ff0000;">He slashed him on the back of his head and his body.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The brothers then fled while the two injured teens managed to flag down a passing motorist who took them to Jurong Polyclinic, about 100m away. <span style="color: #ff0000;">A medical officer rushed back to the scene to recover the missing hand. He found it lying on the pavement of Block 421.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Puvaneshvanan's left hand was surgically re-attached to his wrist at the National University Hospital. The other victim had the cut on the back of his head stitched up and was discharged.</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Trebuchet MS;">Australian troops were instrumental in killing as many as 300 Taliban and al-Qaeda fighters during Operation Anaconda two months ago.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Trebuchet MS;">The commander of Australian Special Air Service Regiment (SASR) troops involved in the war on terror has revealed the Australian forces played a key role in ensuring the success of what has become known as the Battle of Shahi Khowt.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Trebuchet MS;">The commander of the Australian troops, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the enemy forces made it easy for the Coalition because they stood and fought.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Trebuchet MS;">For his part in this battle an Australian SASR sergeant was awarded a Distinguished Service Cross.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Trebuchet MS;">"We were all too happy to go in there and engage them in combat. Clearly they expected to win. They didn't," he said.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Trebuchet MS;">The battle involved an attack on major al-Qaeda positions in the south of the country.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Trebuchet MS;">It wasn't that easy with the United States forces suffering significant casualties when their helicopters were struck by rockets.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Trebuchet MS;">Australian forces adopted observation positions.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Trebuchet MS;">The officer said this was a little bit out of the normal SASR role.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Trebuchet MS;">"We did it very well. A large number of enemy were killed by our forces," he said.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Trebuchet MS;">"It is difficult to get into figures but the figure confidently quoted is around about <span style="text-decoration: underline;">300 in battle damage assessment, that is killed by our people directly or indirectly</span>."</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Trebuchet MS;">The officer's candid assessment of the SASR role came as Defence Minister Robert Hill and Chief of the Defence Force Admiral Chris Barrie toured the SASR base.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Trebuchet MS;">The officer said the al-Qaeda threat was not yet over, despite their defeats.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Trebuchet MS;">"Right now they are attempting to re-establish themselves and their arms and ammunition in Afghanistan," he said.</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 7.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana; "><span style="font-size: small;">BETWEEN Feb 3 and 11, I had to go to National University Hospital (NUH) daily because a family member was hospitalised. The medical care was excellent and the nurses professional and kind. However, the standard of hygiene in the public toilets left much to be desired. <span style="color: #ff0000;">To put it bluntly, they were disgusting and, given our reputation for cleanliness and efficiency, quite disgraceful.</span> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"> </p>
              <p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana; "><span style="font-size: small;">I had to use the men's toilets on the ground floor and the shared individual cubicles on the sixth floor regularly. <span style="color: #ff0000;">The floors were inevitably sopping with used paper towels strewn about. The toilet seats were broken, unhinged, wet, stained or all of the above. Needless to say, the stench was unbearable. </span></span></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana; "><span style="font-size: small;">What I found most distressing was <span style="color: #ff0000;">the sorry state of the shared cubicle outside the Intensive Care Unit (ICU)</span> on the second floor. Metres from what is supposed to be a sterile environment, the tap above the sink in the cubicle was not even working. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">There was no sterilised mat at the entrance of the ICU, which meant anyone who had just stepped out of the toilet would carry whatever creepy crawlies their shoes picked up from the wet floor into the ICU.</span> </span></span></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana; "><span style="font-size: small;">Excuses of constant human traffic and insufficient cleaning staff cut no ice with me. The standard of hygiene in a hospital is supposed to be - pardon the pun - whiter than white. If NUH cannot rely on toilet users to be civilised, it should increase the number of times the toilets are cleaned every day. "</span></span></p>

              <h2>"<span style="color: #ff0000;">Australian researchers will travel to the United States this week to demonstrate an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) featuring information processing technology drawn from insects and that may be included in future Martian aerial probes.</span></h2>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The researchers, from the Defence Science and Technology Organisation (DSTO) and the Australian National University (ANU), will demonstrate their delta-wing aircraft to officials from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) Ames Research Centre and Jet Propulsion Laboratory.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>DSTO's Dr Javaan Chahl will lead the team to the demonstration at a NASA test range in California's Mojave Desert north east of Los Angeles.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Dr Chahl said the demonstration will show that small aircraft equipped with an array of simple sensors, including cameras, can avoid collision with the ground even over rough terrain. </span></p>
              <p>Dr Chahl and his team have spent several years studying how insects fly and navigate and how this can be applied to autonomous aircraft. They analysed the ocelli (a second set of eyes), an obscure sensor in the heads of dragonflies, and found a complex optical and neural arrangement that helps the insect maintain level flight under adverse conditions.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>They have also borrowed from the insect world to develop a sun compass that uses the polarisation pattern of skylight, an important technology for Mars, where there is no magnetic field.</p>
              <p>Their findings have been translated into technologies fitted to a small delta-wing aircraft that will be used for the demonstration.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">NASA is interested in insect technologies that it hopes can be used in the development of small unmanned aircraft to explore the surface of Mars and other planets in the future.</span></p>

              <p><br>lol, as you can see, there is little point in talking to lionnoisy... just that now he has a little taste of his own style in noisylion... who happens to be JUST like him in english ability and lack of common sense... but just that noisylion happens to support "Oz" instead of "SG".</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am just here to see how funny it can get. When you put two characters that know little except to keep repeating the same thing over and over again and copy and paste from the media on opposing sides, as well as doing it in very poor english... comedy will result.</p>
