The pay is a norm for engineers in Australia.<br><br>Moreover, my friend stated Oz has lot of social benefits despite the higher income tax. The weather is nice (for Melbourne)...<br><br>It sets me thinking. In Singapore, engineers are undervalued and unpaid but overworked.<br><br>hmm... Migrating is no small matter. Need lot of consideration and pondering.<br><br>Any advice?</div></blockquote>I think you are on the right track.....I agree its no small matter as I also made that decision years back, albeit not Aust...but I believe it will pay off in the long run......you really have to envision what Sillypore will be like in 5-10 years time...of course they will paint you a nice picture here but you will have to see the flip side too and decide if its what you want for your children...don't worry about replacements as they will get them from Indian and China....your duty should be to think for yourself and family first.......seriously.....think about how congested it will be here....so whether it be better pay, social welfare.....bigger space, less congestion.....think carefully.....you can see where Sillypore is headed to if you visit URA website and see what urban plans they have in mind to further congest the place.....good luck</div>
