If you cannot point out specifically and exactly what I have said, what grounds do you have to question? Go on, tear apart each and every single word to understand the whole post.

              <p>I don't know where you learn your proper english from, but a cock is the male version of a chicken. In addition, <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=talk+cock">the phrase talk cock is a phrase whose meaning has totally no relation at all to the word penis or lan jiao</a>.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, I will try to call you senile kid from now on. And I will understand in the future if you cannot understand the english used in this forum.</p>
              <p>As for your second post, it is still sad that you cannot understand the posts again. Won't blame you. I shall put it more clearly. I am stating that you are trying to attack me on something that you yourself is doing to others. Hypocrite? Obviously that is what I'm saying about you now.</p>

              <p>I wonder which statement I said that pointed out what a pussy is. Care to point out? Or are you being delusional this time round? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> I can't see how being delusional about the contents of a post and asking others to think deeper can link together.</p>
              <p>And since you want to interpret talk cock as talking to a male chicken, go ahead. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> No one is stopping you </p>
              <p>Not to mention that you like to think that the phrase 'pussy birdie' coined by you is a cat birdie. Hmmm... You have a warped understanding of words. That is interesting</p>
