              <p>fell down twice, retrenched? all the more the MIW would crave for u n such stories. u shld send your resume over to them and they may put you up as a success story or `best practice' as they call it. i look fwd for their next ad bitz on how good n successful sinkaporean stay put and make a life for themselves. in sinkapore, i.e. .nvr run away, and now, replaces his boss. we cld all learn from u. menthol....i mean, mentor.</p>
              <p>n here u go again, say i put words in your mouth.i am just sayng what `you would consider a shitty life'. i nvr say u said tt. i said that. how wld tt qualify as me putting words in your mouth.</p>
              <p>i call it sinkapore, not sillypore or whatever. now, dun put words in my mouth. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>n no, i haven't run away yet. i know u cldn't care less, but i mk sure i pm u when/if i decided to leave so you got a stronger case agst me.</p>

              <p>My father taught me to know what I want and live my own life  (although in the beginning he always dictated what was good for me), never according to miw. While everybody had two children, my father had 3, much against the government policy at that time. It was tough to raise 3 children, especially when the youngest one had no priority in school. We just had to study doubly hard.</p>
              <p>I don't support the miw to the end, I do what I think what is right, what is good. I used to vote for PAP, now I vote for the WP, but it doesn't mean that everything PAP does is wrong, or WP can be a better government.</p>
              <p>I think most people like those who are full of vigour, energy, most importantly, positive. My father thought me to be like that, not to please any miw or jeng hu lang.</p>
              <p>My father came from Malaysia, din't know what was meritoracy, just knew that if you are not bumi, tough luck, there was nothing he could do. In Singapore, under meritoracy, we have a way out.</p>
              <p>I have little experience in life, but when I learn from my father, I can say "I've come a long way". We know what we want, we know what we can and can't have. From a young age, I knew migrating is out of question for me because my father is chinese helicoptor and my mother is not educated, Singapore is good enough. Australia we'd been there many times, .... not a place for us,</p>
              <p>think about your own life and those around you who love you, decide what you want, and work for it. We are still young.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>

              <p>7 singaporeans a day leaving singapore, hmmm...they must have left Singapore among the thousands of singaporeans who left on cheap travel packages bought during the last Natas Fair, all very happy leh. Last Saturday was also at another Natas at the Expo, really crazy, queque for half an hour just to buy tickets.</p>
              <p>Don't get me wrong, just remembering the number does not in anyway means I don't feel for them. I rejoice with all who have seen the light and know what is night, I admire those who have seen the light and still strive for new height, I laughed at those who have just lighted up a candle and think it is very bright, I pity those who have laboured in broad day light but still cannot see any light.... Good luck.</p>

              <p>TCH05 is right, you can be jobless anywhere. Do the australian government guarantee that you are gainfully employed until you retire meh? or they just give you handouts when you have no job? if that is the case, you can plan to stop work at 40, that is called retirement, not jobless.</p>
              <p>Now I know there is another reason to migrate: in case I got no job when I am 40.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/embarrassed.png" alt="embarrassed.png"></p>
