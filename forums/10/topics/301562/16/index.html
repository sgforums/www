              <p>You claim that there will always be rental demand for property
                              in CBD and around UNI, hence regardless if the property price goes
                              up or down, there will still be income. (Isnt this a bullet proof
                              statement?)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And I am telling you that it can only be income after you
                              deducting your rental with all related cost.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What I am also trying to tell you is that, if you rental
                              yield doesnt offer you more than 8% return, you might as well sell
                              the property and put the money into fixed deposit to collect
                              interest.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>btw, do you know how to calculate rental yield?</p>

              <p>I have already answered your question that the answer lies in that question. But I understand a senile person like you wouldn't be able to comprehend what an analogy is.</p>
              <p>So let me state it clear: I'm saying you are not qualified at all because you have not been able to show or tell us anything about your credentials that you have had an experience in doing it. Yes, what you said earlier are common sense, I agree. But that does not mean you are qualified to give advice.</p>
              <p>Similarly, because you seldom or don't lift weights at the intensity that fishbuff does it, nor can you prove to us that you have read a lot of scientific articles about certain methods, you are not qualified at all to tell him much about weight lifting.</p>
