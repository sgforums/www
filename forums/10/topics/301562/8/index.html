              <p>1. Eligible but have not got noble prize yet is not really the same as getting awarded a nobel prize.  There is one Singaporean who shares the nobel peace prize as part of <strong>an international team </strong>on global warming (the prize does not belong to Singapore) . When your precious FT get the nobel Science prize, feel free to brag about him as you do.</p>
              <p>As far as I am concerned - only one SINGAPOREAN, <strong>not an FT </strong>,have something to do with the nobel prize. That makes me wonder about the <strong>hoohaa of importing FTs into Singapore</strong> <strong>, when the Singaporean govt forsaken their own potential homegrown talents to take a  slippery path<em> in the hope of  shortcut glory</em> via FT route.</strong> What does that tell you? Sometimes parents tell us never to do things shortcut because it may take a longer time and more trouble than it's worth.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. Don't need to remind me on what I can or cannot do. I don't hate Singapore. I just don't like the Government.</p>
              <p>3. Like I say - I wait to read the news about that. If the newspaper has anything to say about it , it will.</p>

              per cent are paid less than the legal minimum wage, according to the
              research.</p>
              <p>The alarming findings come as education overtakes tourism as the
              nation's biggest services export, increasing by a huge 21 per cent in
              2007 to $12.5 billion. The number of international student enrolments
              rose 18 per cent on the previous year to more than 450,000, the latest
              figures show.</p>
              <p>The authors of the joint Monash University and University of
              Melbourne studies slammed universities for treating foreign students
              like "cash cows", and criticised the Australian Vice-Chancellors
              Committee (now known as Universities Australia) for failing to include
              overseas students in a recent student welfare study.</p>
              <p>They wrote that "many internationals are disadvantaged by their
              relative deficit of language and cultural skills, they are crowded into
              a narrower range of jobs than is available to their domestic peers, and
              they commonly offset these disadvantages by working for less than the
              legal (minimum)".</p>
              <p>The two papers, one on international students in the workforce and
              the other on the financial difficulties faced by overseas students,
              were based on interviews with 200 students at nine universities across
              Australia.</p>
              <p>The researchers found that almost 60 per cent of students earned
              below the minimum wage and 37per cent had experienced financial
              hardship, including not having enough money to travel to university or
              even eat.</p>
              <p>"I had a very hard time finding a job. (For the) first two months I
              was unemployed," one 36-year-old Indian student told researchers. "My
              rent is very high - it's $120 a week - and other than that you have
              travelling, eating, everything.</p>
              <p>"So I starved."</p>
              <p>The researchers discovered 70 per cent of international students
              worked at some stage during their studies in Australia and a number
              admitted to working more than the maximum 20 hours allowed by their
              study visas.</p>
              <p>"<strong>Of the students who reported their hourly rate, 58 per cent earned
              between $7 and $15 per hour at a time when the legal minimum for a
              casual waiter was $16.08 an hour and the rate for a casual shop
              assistant was $17.97 per hour," the study states.</strong></p>
              <p>Conducted by Simon Marginson, Chris Nyland, Erlenawati Sawir, Gaby
              Ramia and Helen Forbes-Mewett, the research also found foreign students
              were more likely to be exploited because of their lack of English
              skills and ignorance of workplace rights. The researchers called for
              urgent action by governments and universities.</p>
              <p>They urged better education for international students about their
              workplace rights and better investigations by workplace authorities to
              expose the injustices experienced by working overseas students.</p>
              <p>Professor Nyland and his colleagues wrote that the decision by UA
              not to include overseas students in its finances study "sadly lends
              credence to the much repeated claim that Australian university managers
              view international students primarily as customers who exist to be
              milked".</p>
              <p>But UA chief executive Glenn Withers rejected the claim that
              tertiary institutions treated international students like cash cows and
              don't care about their welfare.</p>
              <p>He defended the decision not to include international students in
              their student finances survey, saying that that survey was targeted at
              the federal government to try to improve income support for domestic
              students.</p>
              <p>Dr Withers said universities were helping overseas students where
              they could by providing support services and going into public-private
              partnerships to construct accommodation for students close to campuses.</p>
              <p>"The biggest problems are the exchange rate - and universities
              cannot control that - and expensive housing, and universities cannot
              control that either," he said.</p>

              <h1>Migrant mix not right</h1>
              <div class="article-publish">
              <p class="author">John Masanauskas</p>
              <p class="published-date">February 06, 2008 12:00am</p>
              </div>
               
              <p class="standfirst"><strong style="display: block;">DEEP
              concerns about high Asian migration and multiculturalism have been
              revealed in a survey of Australian-born residents in Melbourne's
              southeast.</strong></p>
              <p>A sample of people living near the
              Vietnamese enclave in Springvale showed that most believe Asian
              migrants don't make much effort to mix with Australians, according to a
              Monash University study.</p>
              <p>And almost 40 per cent were unhappy with the number of Asians in the area, the study found.</p>
              <p>Researchers conducted the 2006 survey in three suburbs, including
              Dingley Village, a mainly Australian-born area about 5km from
              Springvale's shopping hub.</p>
              <p>Almost half of the 330 Dingley Village residents surveyed said that Australia's migrant intake was too high, the report said.</p>
              <p>And more than 40 per cent agreed that "Australians are justified in
              thinking that their way of life is threatened by multiculturalism".</p>
              <p>A similar number thought Asian migrants were interested in personal gain, not building a better Australia, the survey found.</p>
              <p>However, more than two-thirds of the Dingley Village residents
              agreed that Asians had much to offer Australia, although 83 per cent
              added that government policy should be to encourage migrants to fit in
              as quickly as possible.</p>
              <p>Asians comprise more than half of Victoria's migrant intake, with
              Indians, Chinese, Filipinos, Sri Lankans and Vietnamese the biggest
              groups.</p>
              <p>About 60 per cent of Springvale's population is foreign-born, with more than one in five residents born in Vietnam.</p>
              <p>The researchers also surveyed Vietnamese-born people in Springvale,
              finding that about two-thirds thought the nation's migrant intake was
              about right or too low.</p>
              <p>Only 13 per cent of the Vietnamese agreed that Australians were
              right in thinking that multiculturalism threatened their way of life.</p>
              <p>The report, by Andrew Markus and Arunachalam Dharmalingam, will be
              released today by Monash's Centre for Population and Urban Research.</p>
              <p>The authors said the survey revealed big differences between
              Australian-born and Vietnamese-born residents on attitudes towards
              immigration, multicultural policy and the willingness of Asians to
              integrate.</p>
              <p>"This survey highlights problems of communication, which present a major challenge for the community," they said.</p>

              <p>Those are <strong>not </strong>Australian students or permanent residents. I don't see the need for Australia to roll out the red carpet for overseas students unless they are of a rare and talented calibre.</p>
              <p>It is their choice to go over to a foreign country without some financial calculation and it happens to be their choice to exploited without knowing how the system works.</p>
              <p>If someone gets exploited in the big companies , hell will kick up and the newspapers will play on it. Let me tell you a story of how my cousin got exploited in Australia before he got permanent residency. He got exploited by <span style="text-decoration: underline;">a fellow asian who happened to be an ex Singaporean in Australia </span>to work less than 60% of the nominal wage because <strong>reputable companies in Australia prefer to employ Australian citizens or permanent citizens NOT a graduate on bridging visa</strong>. So when he got permanent residency - he resigned and got a real job that pays above the legal minimum wages.</p>
              <p>I am actually earning than 20% above the minimum wage rate for my position.  So thanks for your luck , but I don't really need it. So look at what story?</p>

              <p>Yes but have you considered the factors that those vietnamese-born persons tend to speak their own language all the time , tend to hang out with their own crowd? They don't exactly come from an english speaking country.</p>
              <p>The vietnamese born fellas tend to speak to me in vietnamese because they think I am one of them . They get angry until I tell them I am chinese and I have no f**king idea with the mumbo jumbo they are trying to say.  Same goes with the koreans. I got approached twice by koreans speaking to me in korean. I have alot of problems getting  them to accept the f**king fact that I don't speak their language. One girl was so adamant that I was korean even after I told her I am not korean.</p>
              <p>With all cases, once I establish the fact that I am not one of them , they ignore me. At least the japanese exercise alot of effort to get me to understand their english after they find out that I am not japanese. The Singaporeans , Indo chinese and Malaysians speak english at first glance .</p>
              <p>So far, I am ok with the Australians. A neighbour, who just moved  from townsville, happen to speak to me about the unfriendliness of a big city - he is ang moh and he said I was the first person he managed to have a real conversation.</p>

              <p>Those are <strong>not</strong> Australian students or permanent

              <p>It is their choice to go over to a foreign country without some

              <p>If someone gets exploited in the big companies , hell will kick

              residency. He got exploited by <span style="text-decoration: underline;">a fellow asian who happened to be an
              ex Singaporean in Australia</span> to work less than 60% of the
              nominal wage because <strong>reputable companies in Australia
              prefer to employ Australian citizens or permanent citizens NOT a
              graduate on bridging visa</strong>. So when he got permanent
              residency - he resigned and got a real job that pays above the

              <p>I am actually earning than 20% above the minimum wage rate for

              <p>You quoted 2006 and I quoted 2007. So which is the latest?</p>
              <p>Answer to Q2: US has attracted FT for a long long time because of their technological advances . Those are top class FTs not some second or third rate FT. What did world bank say again?</p>
              <p>And to your first article - <em>"Veredus is not the only company that has developed the bird flu kit. In
              fact, Veredus is competing with much larger and established competitors
              who also see lots of money-making opportunities in the global
              preparation for bird flu. Those competitors include AJ Roboscreen,
              based in Leipzig, Germany, and Qiagen in Venlo, The Netherlands."</em></p>
              <p>Now the above doesn't say that Veredus is successful . And the 2006 news you gave me only tells me about a trial. It doesn't tell me anything. I have not heard anything from WHO (World health organisation) yet on <span style="text-decoration: underline;">who is the one with the most sensitive and specific tests.</span> Bearing in mind , H5N1 mutates easily  and the test can be invalidated if it is targeting certain compounds in the virus which may have changed.  <strong>A trial is a testing phase FYI. Nothing proven as YET.  </strong></p>
              <p>2nd part of your argument - I don't care what the lab says. They are , in scientific terms, biased in their report.  They can say alot of beautiful things. It does not matter. Until WHO (world health organisation) comes up with the verdict on which companies' test is the most accurate , this is a useless example of anything.</p>
              <p>3rd, I am talking about FT policy. <strong>Hey if Singaporean homegrown scientist comes up with the rapid test that is endorsed by the World health organisation, it reinforces my point that the FT policy is a crap policy which negatively affected your own Singaporeans and favored useless foreigners over your OWN.</strong></p>
              <p>So your current argument has been rendered useless. Anything else to continue making me laugh ?</p>

              <p><em>Dear friend,can understand the test kids ARE ALREADY USED IN 7TH FLEET?</em></p>
              <p>2nd part of your argument - I don't care what the lab says. They
                                      are , in scientific terms, biased in their report.  They can
                                      say alot of beautiful things. It does not matter. Until WHO (world
                                      health organisation) comes up with the verdict on which companies'
                                      test is the most accurate , this is a useless example of
                                      anything.</p>
              <p><em>REPLY;only the fool will wait for WHO to tell which one is the best.No prudent boss will wait after many of their staff die from bird flu then take action.Have WHO gave u the super fast temparture infra red screening remote monitor developered by Singapore during SARS period?</em></p>
              <p>3rd, I am talking about FT policy. <strong>Hey if Singaporean
                                      homegrown scientist comes up with the rapid test that is endorsed
                                      by the World health organisation, it reinforces my point that the
                                      FT policy is a crap policy which negatively affected your own
                                      Singaporeans and favored useless foreigners over your
                                      OWN.</strong></p>
              <p>So your current argument has been rendered useless. Anything
                                      else to continue making me laugh ?</p>

              <p>I have mentioned this a long time ago in some post... When we complain about too many foreigners in our country and migrate, we are also becoming a foreigner in their country, doing exactly the same thing to others that we had detested.</p>
