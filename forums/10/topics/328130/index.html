              <p>I think is one of the hardest stats to find... Singapore boasts itself for having low unemployment rate... But what exactly is its underemployment rate...</p>
              <p>I know this uncle... He's an Orang Lama and a Orang Laut... He had worked on Oil rigs, worked as an AB all the way to the Red Seas and Antlantic Oceans and worked as a techcom for Royal Brunei Navy... In addition, he's a good mechnaic and can make an excelent paint job on cars...</p>
              <p>But come back to Singapore, he can only work as a security Guard... He productivity can easily make at least $8,000 per month but now he's worth only $1,000 per month... Absolutely sad... He still have a few years a head of him but companies rather employ young bloods whom have less experience compared to the years of experience this Orang Lama has...</p>
              <p>I wonder what people in his shoes should do...?</p>

              <p>He should be an example on fanancial planning for our young.</p>
              <p>Theoratically, by the age of 25, one would have reached his productivity prime. This age would be whereby you would have gain street-wise knowledge if there is a lack on academic subjects. Apprenticeship would be over. Your salary would strongly be based on your productivity, self-sufficiency in an equal opportunities environment of our world's major international companies, based on merit, more so in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Should his productivity worth be $8,000/mth ( considering the oil industry is a lucrative employer), saving $4000/mth, he would still have a quality of life to enjoy with the balance $4000/mth.</p>
              <p>I am assuming he is 45 years old now, and that would have been an est. $960,000 without interest, in his personal bank account by today. His present job as a security guard would be just a past time for him, to keep himself productive and mentally alert.</p>
              <p>Similarly, for our young, at $3000/mth, if set aside $1000 as savings, it would be $240,000 w/o interest by the time he is 45 years old.</p>
              <p>Is that HDTV worth buying and throwing away your 50inch plasma TV? Is that box in the sky costing $1.0m + another $1.0m in interest payments over 30 years worth it, as compared to a similiar sized unit box in the sky from HDB costing only $300,000 and interest free ( cos you are only borrowing from your CPF, which is your money anyway), more worth it?</p>
              <p>Could it be that we Spore man have too much manly pride, and our pampered singaporean women too demanding to seek such high quality materialism in our youth, sacrificing at the expense of our old age? </p>
              <p>But unfortunately, the young never realized that they will get old until it is too late. They tend to spend 150% of their salary within 2 weeks, and go hungry for the next 2 weeks till pay day, regardless of gender and salary scale, a reality in our highly consumerist world.</p>
              <p>They forgotten that one can only get rich by saving, and NOT by spending. The rich didnt got where they are today by spending all their salaries. They save every penny of it, and every penny spent MUST bring in more pennies, or they immediately cut loss. The young never did learn this lesson often until too late!</p>
              <p><strong>Perhaps, it is high time our society start another national campaign - Save Money Campaign.</strong></p>
              <p>Comming back to the uncle, assuming he has no savings, then he has no choice but to be more self reliant. Our society will help, but there is not enough money to help EVERYONE. We will either go broke by tomorrow or be taxed to the hilt.</p>

              <p>Saving is not an easy task. We are only humans. It is so easy to give in to temptation of spending. Sometimes when we pass by shops, it seemed like the items there know our names can call out to us!</p>
              <p>More so with the attractive adverts, tempting us every second of our lives. There seem to be no escape.</p>
              <p>But then, poverty in old age is more frightening if we give in.</p>
              <p>Our past generations also faced high costs of living then, and  didn't hunger for materialism they way we this generation did. They were happy living in huts and kampongs, with mud between their toes, but homes kept clean, kids never starved.</p>
              <p>Where had we, this generation went wrong? :-(</p>

              <p>I applaud your consideration for them, very few and far between amongst our centred youths and adults, including myself.</p>
              <p>I guess it is too late for regrets that they have. They are living the consequences of their freedom of choices. BUT it is still not too late for them to continue on with life, with more dignity, or as much level of dignity they wish for their own lives, which we must respect above all.</p>
              <p>One thing about these old folks are their experiences, which are valuable, if they are not yet senile. But i do not have an idea on how 'experiences' may be a commodity of exchange in the market place. Here's hoping someone would have an idea. </p>

              <p>"delayed gratification"</p>
              <p>This is true. But there is one school of thought:- instant gratification. This philosophy is grounded on the belief to enjoy what you have now, for either you may not live long enough to drink the fruits of your labour, or you will be too old to take pleasure in what you have.</p>
              <p>For example, should one wait for 1 year later to buy a HDTV, to replace current TV model, with savings or</p>
              <p>a.) hire purchase one now at 10% interest per annum,</p>
              <p>b.) buy now and starve for the rest of the month?</p>
              <p>Actually, the subject matter is not whether to buy HDTV now or H.P. It is the need for one. Is that few more pixels on the TV screen going to make the show more better or the movie itself that is more critical?</p>
              <p>My point is, when faced with difficult decisions which we face all the time, some superficial such as a TV purchase, others more critical that deal with happiness and sorrow, the solution is always to define and rely on what our <strong>PRIORITIES</strong> are.</p>
              <p>Nothing in life is constant except for changes. Thus mathematically, the job you hold now, or that investment plan, is subjected to the law of life - changes. Planning one's career and investment portfolio would need to factor in 'changes', otherwise it would only be a flawed plan, with dire consequences on our very own existence.</p>
              <p>There is only one sure security in life - your savings, be it stagflation. inflation, deflation, or whatever that hits. Some money is better than NO money at all. </p>
              <p>Another thought is for the those who subscribe to 'instant gratification'. Should you spend all your money today, and yet lived long enough to see tomorrow, who would be responsible for you and your life?</p>
              <p>Should others who are responsible, lived 'delayed gratifications', be made to pick up your tomorrow's living expenses when you spent it all today?</p>
