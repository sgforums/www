Please note that the word 'WORTH' is not defined by MONEY or WHAT ur brain thinks, its about what we the person who buys it feel.  On paper,  a trip to western europe costing MUCH MUCH more would be of no worth to u but to the husband wanting to please his newly wed wife on a honeymoon, to him thats value, to a son who wants to bring his aged parents on a trip, that is worth to him, so i demand to know, WHO ARE YOU to determine whats worhtless and worth for US?</div></blockquote>The value of "WORTH" is not the question, neither is "VALUE".<br><br>In the 1980's, the "GREED" of Singaporeans towards all things material, and the blind rush to make MONEY, led to concern of some retired Politicians that "MONEYTHEISM" is setting in, at the expense of sensible social values.<br><br>This senseless RUSH and WILLINGNESS to pay $31,000 for a piece of paper, is beyond human good sense.<br><br>Try visiting the Used Car Markets, and one can see the number of brand new cars that are about 11 months to 2 years old; with many of these cars being repossessed by Finance Companies as a result of defaults in instalment payments.<br><br>It is no skin off my nose, if you agree or not with this post, which is placed to see the different reactions that speaks volumes in the manner that Singaporeans feel about this issue.<br><br>It probably confirms the Government Policy Planners expectations that Singaporeans have a very high threshhold for the imposition of more monetary levies to regulate their consumption.
