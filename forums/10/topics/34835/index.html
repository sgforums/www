            <div class='col-md body'>I think the government is contradicting itself in this case.  On one hand, it wants people to get a COE for their car, this is supposedly to control the 'car population', however, on the other, they allow people to drive cars off without down payment first. Promoting more cars on the road?  Plus the COE is so darn high, u can buy a whole car (not just the paper) with that money in various countries in the region. . .<br><br>They encourage people to tak public transport, but public transport is already congested like crazy, anyone taking MRT or bus during peak will know.  Virtually impossible to squeeze in at City Hall around 6 or so everyday, which is the time people need public tranposrt most. . .hopefully the new MRT line eases some of this congestion.. .<br><br>MOst of the time, I support government decisions, this time I just don't agree.<br><br>However, taking care of one's parents is still a basic responsibility people should take. . . btw, is there a certain birthday on which u can take out all ur CPF money (minus Medishield) ??<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>this is a way that singapore gov control car populartipn... not fair to say tat other country is cheaper as u fail to account tat other country is bigger too. If there is no control, then the road will be filled with problems of congestion. COE is smart way as can control car population and tax the richer people. They do account coe earnings into gov budget isn't it ?<br><br>Anyway if u r without a car, u will not die as public transport still available.  There is no such thing as absolutely must have a car. Even drivers can work for companies with car if they so need it.<br><br>About saying why people r stupid enough to spend so much money, tat is not for anyone to say... Somebody can spend money on stamps, or on 4d or donate it away. Some people like to save money on usual stuff while buying big investment like house or cars. Some people neevr spend money and treat cash like a score board. They r really personal preference</div>

Please note that the word 'WORTH' is not defined by MONEY or WHAT ur brain thinks, its about what we the person who buys it feel.  On paper,  a trip to western europe costing MUCH MUCH more would be of no worth to u but to the husband wanting to please his newly wed wife on a honeymoon, to him thats value, to a son who wants to bring his aged parents on a trip, that is worth to him, so i demand to know, WHO ARE YOU to determine whats worhtless and worth for US?</div>
