            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span class="large">Wee Shu Min: Is she devastated ?</span> </strong><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Far from it, ex-classmate says sheÂ’s Â‘laughingÂ’ at and Â‘mockingÂ’ web responses. </span><br><br>"I was a top student from RJC (Raffles Junior College). Just graduated a few years ago. Most people that I know in RJC were just too full of themselves.<br><br>They thought that since they are from RJC, they are the smartest in Singapore. Unfortunately, many of my RJC friends have low EQ and common sense.<br><br>Most only know how to memorise and practice questions and possess very weak critical thinking skills."<br><br>"To follow up on what fellow Rafflesian, Gene, said above, I would like to emphasise that the majority of us from RJC are not like Shu Min.<br><br>In fact, few of us sympathise with her current "plight" (not that she is taking it badly, she was in fact laughing and mocking at the responses on various websites).<br><br>What had happened also did not surprise us because she is well known in school to have an inflated sense of superiority and low tolerance of the pedestrian and the uncultured.<br><br>But please remember that one Wee Shu Min does not make RJC. The rest of us from RJC should not be impeached because of her."<br><br>"I'm a classmate of Shu Min in RGS and RJC. Many of us don't know her well because she does move around in her own exclusive circle of the smart and well-connected.<br><br>And yes, she is conceited, overbearing and thinks that she and her clique own the world. But, I do think some of the comments here are excessive, even unreasonable.<br><br>You can fault her character and her worldview, but is there a need to descend to vulgarity?"<br><br>"As a Rafflesian, I am saddened that our good name has been smeared by the poison pen of one elitist female.<br><br>The saddest part of this episode is that she reminds me of the remark made by newbie Michael Palmer, "Before I joined the grassroots organisation, I never knew there were poor people in developed countries".<br><br>Where does the PAP find such freaks? They are no better than the Hitler Youth, and our country can only be the worse because of them."<br><br>Source: <a href="http://weikiatblog.blogspot.com/2006/10/looking-back-home.html" rel="nofollow">http://weikiatblog.blogspot.com/2006/10/looking-back-home.html </a><br><br></div>
