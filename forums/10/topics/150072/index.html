            <div class='col-md body'>Hold that cynicism, please<br><br>By Chua Lee Hoong<br>Sept 12, 2005<br>The Straits Times<br><br>WHEN the results of the police investigation into the white elephants at Buangkok MRT station are made public, what will the people's reaction be?<br><br>If the perpetrators are found to have been (mischievous) grassroots activists with the People's Action Party, and they are let off with a mild warning, will people say, 'Double standards. It would have been different if it had been an opposition party'? If they are levied a stiff fine, will people say, 'Oh, it's all for show?' In other words, will the people insist on, Heads I win, tails you lose?<br><br>These, more so than the rights and wrongs of the elephants themselves, are the questions that interest me.<br><br>Not that the rights and wrongs of the case are that clear. The incident has many facets with broader implications, which explains why an official decision on the case is so long in coming and why the public is so interested.<br><br>Legally speaking - that is, going by the letter of the law - it is clear enough: the placing of the eight white elephants on a road-divider outside the Buangkok MRT station can easily be construed as falling within the meaning of 'public entertainment' as governed by the Public Entertainments and Meetings Act, and required a licence. (Which there wasn't - unlike in the case of the cow cut-outs that appeared on a number of grass patches around Singapore a few months ago, put up by an advertising agency.)<br><br>Singaporeans know however that the letter of the law is not always enforced when infringements are minor.<br><br>Housing Board by-laws, for instance, prohibit placing personal belongings like plants along the common corridors, but this is seldom enforced.<br><br>Displaying placards of a non-sensitive nature - advertising a new neighbourhood coffee shop, say - would normally also fall within this category.<br><br>Those who put up the white elephants would presumably argue that what they did was harmless enough. After all, it was just eight cardboard cut-outs, which remained in the public eye for less than 24 hours before they were taken down.<br><br>And the date - Aug 28, 2005 - was also the second anniversary of the opening of the North-East Line. The then-Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, the guest of honour, had promised at that time: 'We do not squander money on big white elephants that become financial burdens for our future generations.' What's more, he had worn a specially-bought tie with an elephant motif that day.<br><br>So white elephants have been on the minds of Buangkok residents for a while, and if a little visual reminder helps to hasten the opening of the station, well, why not? All in the practical interests of Buangkok residents; nothing subversive at all.<br><br>But therein lies the rub. Where does one draw the line between promoting residents' needs and pushing the boundaries, between acceptable political activism and unacceptable civil disobedience? This is the grey area, the contentiousness of which is bound to grow, if one goes by how the white elephant incident seems to have struck a chord among Singaporeans.<br><br>Early last month, Home Affairs Minister Wong Kan Seng drew a line in the sand when he warned against wilful breaking of the law: 'Regardless of whether he thinks it is a silly law or not, he does violence to the rule of law even if his actions are peaceful.'<br><br>That warning, however, doesn't seem to have received much traction. There are still many Singaporeans who think the Government is over-reacting to the white elephants, and who would prefer that investigations be dropped. But that, from the official standpoint, is clearly a non-starter because it would be an unwanted precedent. Buangkok station today, Raffles Place MRT tomorrow? White elephants today, hammer and sickle tomorrow? Laws become meaningless if too many remain unenforced.<br><br>When the results of the investigation are made known, the police will have to show that it is impartial in enforcing the law, regardless of which political parties are involved. And I hope Singaporeans will hold that cynicism, because heads I win, tails you lose isn't exactly a fair sporting approach.<br><br><a href="http://www.asiaone.com/st/st_20050912_340319.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.asiaone.com/st/st_20050912_340319.html</a><br><br>It's fair to say the white elephants are a harmless display with more jest than an out and out  political message. Still, it would be interesting to see who initiated them and how the men in blue handle this case after the fiasco at the CPF building.<br><br></div>

(Which there wasn't - unlike in the case of the cow cut-outs that appeared on a number of grass patches around Singapore a few months ago, put up by an advertising agency.)<br><br>Singaporeans know however that the letter of the law is not always enforced when infringements are minor.<br><br>Housing Board by-laws, for instance, prohibit placing personal belongings like plants along the common corridors, but this is seldom enforced.<br><br>Displaying placards of a non-sensitive nature - advertising a new neighbourhood coffee shop, say - would normally also fall within this category.<br><br>Those who put up the white elephants would presumably argue that what they did was harmless enough. After all, it was just eight cardboard cut-outs, which remained in the public eye for less than 24 hours before they were taken down.<br><br>And the date - Aug 28, 2005 - was also the second anniversary of the opening of the North-East Line. The then-Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, the guest of honour, had promised at that time: 'We do not squander money on big white elephants that become financial burdens for our future generations.' What's more, he had worn a specially-bought tie with an elephant motif that day.<br><br>So white elephants have been on the minds of Buangkok residents for a while, and if a little visual reminder helps to hasten the opening of the station, well, why not? All in the practical interests of Buangkok residents; nothing subversive at all.<br><br>But therein lies the rub. Where does one draw the line between promoting residents' needs and pushing the boundaries, between acceptable political activism and unacceptable civil disobedience? This is the grey area, the contentiousness of which is bound to grow, if one goes by how the white elephant incident seems to have struck a chord among Singaporeans.<br><br>Early last month, Home Affairs Minister Wong Kan Seng drew a line in the sand when he warned against wilful breaking of the law: 'Regardless of whether he thinks it is a silly law or not, he does violence to the rule of law even if his actions are peaceful.'<br><br>That warning, however, doesn't seem to have received much traction. There are still many Singaporeans who think the Government is over-reacting to the white elephants, and who would prefer that investigations be dropped. But that, from the official standpoint, is clearly a non-starter because it would be an unwanted precedent. Buangkok station today, Raffles Place MRT tomorrow? White elephants today, hammer and sickle tomorrow? Laws become meaningless if too many remain unenforced.<br><br>When the results of the investigation are made known, the police will have to show that it is impartial in enforcing the law, regardless of which political parties are involved. And I hope Singaporeans will hold that cynicism, because heads I win, tails you lose isn't exactly a fair sporting approach.<br><br><a href="http://www.asiaone.com/st/st_20050912_340319.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.asiaone.com/st/st_20050912_340319.html</a><br><br>It's fair to say the white elephants are a harmless display with more jest than an out and out  political message. Still, it would be interesting to see who initiated them and how the men in blue handle this case after the fiasco at the CPF building.<br><br></div></blockquote>I treat her writings like the scribbles on toilet doors. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> You can clearly see that it's a perfect example of one-sided party journalism. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

Of these, about 390 fall within a 400m radius of the station.<br><br>He also said there are other housing programmes in the pipeline, including a private condominium that will be built just south of the station.<br><br>Although there is still insufficient residential support to create the mass needed to open Buangkok station, Mr Yeo said the LTA will now take a few months to review and assess the feasibility of opening the station sooner.<br><br>In doing so, it will look at the latest figures for completed residential units in the area.<br><br>Mr Chong's initial reaction was to point out the apparent change in the deadline for the LTA to respond.<br><br>However, he told The Straits Times later he merely wanted to urge the Government to act quickly, without compromising the quality and accuracy of its findings.<br><br>'If the LTA says it needs a little more time, I think we should accept that, provided it can come up with a good review and arrive at the right conclusion,' he said.<br><br>'Buangkok residents have been quite patient over the past two years, and they can afford to wait for another two or three months if that means the LTA is able to make a reasonable decision. I will encourage them to continue to be patient.' </span><br><br><a href="http://www.asiaone.com/st/st_20050920_341783.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.asiaone.com/st/st_20050920_341783.html</a><br><br>Isn't it ironic? When the LTA offered the terms for Hock Kee, they were a mere 1 month. But when pressed by residents over the delayed opening of Buangkok, they 'appeal' for a few more months.<br><br>What is 'a few more months'? 2 maybe 3 additional months beyond the deadline? It seems the LTA has a lopsided respect for deadlines...i.e. projects which they are directly responsible tend to have rubber timings. It doesn't matter that their inefficiencies and bureaucratic foot dragging delays resident-affected amenities.<br><br>On the other hands, they have no qualms with evicting tenants when they are being pressed by the threat of liquidated damages by their contractors.<br><br>Could the LTA get any worst?</div>
