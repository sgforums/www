            <div class='col-md body'>So far, there are quite a number of threads starting with my name. I appreciate my supporters here to encourage me and lend support to my course. And I am also appreciative to my critics also, for I believe a good person cannot evolve better without challengers.<br><br>But I want to put it on record here, this is NOT about me. It is NOT even about Workers' Party. It is about the future of our nation, our society as a whole, that we need people to step out of their comfort zones, to take ownership of this country, to build it better, to demand more sustainable political-social-economic models or systems for us and our future generations to prosper.<br><br>And this cannot be done without "rational people making the irrational choices", like me, to throw myself into the adversity, to provide the necessary political challenge and competition to PAP to produce better results for everyone in the end. The best boxers in the world cannot evolve without his sparring partners.<br><br>Politics is about people; political parties are made up of people. Without the activism of the people's participations, we could not possibly evolve. As I have said, it is the dismay state of opposition or alternative politics that make me jump into it. You could criticize all you want about the opposition, but without people's activism in it, it will always be just another organization.<br><br>I could criticize PAP all I want, they have alot of people in them, but without people start kicking them, they might just be the same. Political complacency is a more serious problem than political apathy.<br><br>I am just a small fry in Workers' Party. But I am more than happy to become even smaller fry when more capable people come forward to serve in whatever capacities.<br><br>If SDA or SPP or NSP could grow bigger, the better it is. It is a movement that we are concerned, not about means. A Movement that is to provide the sparks and challenges that will make us a better soceity. A Movement that is aim to increase the cohesiveness within our society by means of political activism. A Movement that aims to create a more balance soceity with a balance political system. A Movement that aims to eradicate political apathy as well as political complacency. A Movement that will secure our future generations' well being.....<br><br>It is just this Movement, definitely not about me.<br><br>Goh Meng Seng<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>Your concern and attempt to clarify is understandable and appropriate.<br><br>It may serve you and others to think that you are one of the new breed of political concerned younger generation.  Your choice of using the net to express your views give the public a window to see the development of the opposition parties they don't usually have a chance to see.  Because there are people like you, the alternative parties are viable and will continue their quest of social reform.<br><br>By thinking you are one of the many, this may help to focus the attention not on you but the MANY.<br><br>On the other hand, there is no MOVEMENT if people are not involved.  You have involved yourself in this MOVEMENT as you call it.  Safe to say that you are a member of this MOVEMENT.  How this MOVEMENT will develop and what role each involved will play depend on their choice and action.<br><br>Whether you are just a window/channel or you will assume a bigger role in the future, it is open.  For the rest, we do need to understand there is a bigger picture beyond a GMS.<br><br></div>

However, I think it is very unlike for me or Workers' Party to be in Jurong as we have limited resources and our area of operation is basically concentrated on the other half of the island.<br><br>However, you could still help us to spread the words around.
