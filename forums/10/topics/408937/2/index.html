              <p>World Longest ruling party will be Korean Workers Party, which is the party who rules North Korea.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Second will be Chinese Communist Party. Well, there are people say soon people in North will revolt, and probably DPRK will collapse soon especially they dont really accept Kim Jong Il's 3rd son to be his successor. So this CCP in China will takeover their record.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As for PAP --- no chance la, CCP where can / will collapse one leh? Even if people are unhappy, they are at least more stable than North as we do not see mass refugees fleeing to neighbouring countries / areas from China anymore.</p>

              <p>Well, so conincide is Cheng San in 1997 and Aljunied in 2006 get 45% and 43% of votes by WP respectively. 2001 sure jia lat like hell, so Gomez wayang. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/BoxedEmoticonSet/confused.png" alt="confused.png"></p>

              <p>The ironic here is PAP give us prosperity, education, peace and harmony, tho we may have to slave for it, but the reward is pure, unlike N korea, who accomplished nothing but get poor and poorer ending up with its citizen having to suffer without knowning that they are suffering because there is total lack of exposure and certainly human rights.</p>
              <p>As for the CCP in China, it is begining to show improvement but still there is a great disparity between the rich and the rural poor due to poor distribution of wealth and greedyness of the rich to pound on the poor. This is exactly the same condition before the CCP took over the Kuo Ming Tang, CCP was then the poor pleasants, get together and revolted against the Kuo Ming ruling party and those richs, took over powder and ruled China till modernisation by Teng which open the door to demorcratic economy. And today, you see the same thing again, somewhere, somehow, there will be another young Mao among the poors who will start the revolution again.</p>
