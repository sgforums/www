            <div class='col-md body'>It is with great dismay and surprise that the case of the family of the late Chua Ya Ta versus the NUH Doctors has resulted in the court ruling against the family.<br><br>In delivering his verdict, the judge ruled that no 'criminal negligence' had been committed by the doctors. Yet in his summary, he delibrated on the following:<br><br>a. the judge agreed that Dr Tey "had harboured in his mind the possibility that Cpl Chua was not in pain", posing questions over his professionalism and raising the issue of whether Dr Tey indeed believed Cpl Chua was 'malingering'.<br><br>b. reservations over whether Dr Wong had examined Cpl Chua as thoroughly as he claimed.<br><br>c. Quote..."Not withstanding the evidence of Dr Lingaraj and Dr Wong, given the paucity of the medical notes recorded, I have no option but to note that there are clearly some doubts as to how thos examination was conducted."....<br><br>With such lingering doubts in his mind, one must be surprised as to how the judge considered his verdict of 'not criminally negilgent'.<br><br>It has been clearly defined that the doctors did not:<br><br>1. discharge their professional duties as required.<br><br>2. properly examine the blood sample taken  from Cpl Chua, which would have possibly led them to suspect that some infection far more sinister than a common fever was engulfing the victim.<br><br>Even the doctors themselves on testimony did not deny 'failing to diagose or treat Cpl Chua', clearly indicating that their planned defence stemmed from convincing the judge that the infection symptoms were 'so atypical' and rare that they could not be faulted for failing to save his life.<br><br>From a doctor's point of view, is that a fair assessment? Worst, from a neutral's point of view, isn't that a blatant excuse?<br><br>We are not asking doctors to be omnipotent lifesavers, nor are we saying that they are infallible,  but were all avenues to prevent it happening explored? Were the doctor's providing their due dilligence and professionalism in examining the patient? Did they even express concern and reassurance?<br><br>This stinks of an ellaborate scheme to close ranks and protect themselves from medical negligence. There are clear indications of gross miscommunication between doctors involved in the case and of a medical system that seems more bureaucratic than efficient. A sanctioned neutral examination of the NUH medical system is likely to reveal more skeletons in the closets than what has been learnt in this courtroom.<br><br>As in the case of the korean family who was killed while crossing the road, no portion of the guilt was pinned on the expatriate driver. Surely we are not saying the family was not to blame but how can the driver be completely absolved of guilt in the accident?<br><br>The manner in which the outcome has been presented seems to indicate subtle nudging towards a civil suit.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My condolences to our dear corporal Chua. It seems like its the negligence of the NUH doctors. Being a patient in a government hospital, it is the responsibilities of the doctors to respond to his deterioration of his medical condition. Genuine-ill NSFs who visit government clinics are often given attend B which requires them to return back to their camp. These doctors will examine them with a mentality of them malingering. These genuine cases are being dismissed as malingerers often ended up in government hopitals. While these doctors gave them a cold shoulder as long as they are NSFs. Such mentality should be erased as NSFs are being unpaid and only given little allowance to serve the country. Professional medical service should be improved. Medical Officers should be professional in their pratice in the medical field. Where is the care for soldier value as so called pledged by the SAF?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You have to understand how our legal system works. The Coroner's inquiry is only an inquest and the scope of his investigation is very limited. You may not realize this but his job is not to apportion blame but to discover what happened. Occasionally when he discovers that the death is the result of negligence to a degree that would amount to 'manslaughter' under Sect 304A, he will refer his findings to the AG Chambers to decide on prosecution.<br><br>Remember that the burden of proof in a criminal case is 'beyond reasonable doubt'. The Coroner's findings do not stop the family from taking up a civil suit, where the standard of proof is much lower, just  on the balance of probability.<br><br>An error of judgment by the medical doctors is not sufficient to constitute negligence. We do not know the details of the case unlike the Coroner and so we are not in a position to make a judgment. However, from what the press has reported, it does seem to me that it would be difficult to make a legal case for negligence.<br><br>Some actions of the junior doctors in question appear to fall below the standard of a reasonable doctor, according to the press reports, such as the failure to read the lab reports and act on clearly abnormal results. However, the experts in this case have said that even if the results had been acted upon, the disease was so virulent that they would not have been able to save him at that point in time anyway.<br><br>Again many of us may not realize that even if a 'negligent act' had been committed, if you cannot prove that the act directly led to the damage, there is no negligence. You cannot prove causation. So if the underlying disease is so virulent that he would have died anyway at the time the abnormal lab report was wrongly ignored, that negligent act did not cause death and so there is no negligence.<br><br>If I were to advise the family, I will threaten a civil suit but settle out of court for an undisclosed sum. It is difficult to win such a case unless I can find experts that can convince the court otherwise.</div>

But what disturbs me greatly is the manner in which the whole incident was handled. (no i mean bungled)<br><br>If a doctor had indeed performed to his utmost to try and determine the root cause of infection right up to his death, the family would certainly be unlikely to take the case further, knowing all that could have been done was done. Unfortunately, that apparently was not the case.<br><br>The bitterness stems from the poor and nonchalant treatment of the family and patient by NUH doctors and nurses during and after the hospitalization of CPL Chua, which was widely publicised in the media. In addition, the unprofessional conduct of Dr Tey in assuming that CPL Chua may have 'malingered' hardly endeared him to family and public after his death.<br><br>What happened to benefit of doubt?

It was not a single glaring error that resulted in CPL Chua's death but a sequence of events which indicate mismanagement on the part of the doctors.<br><br>How else would one describe their case? Instead of assuring the court that all procedures and efforts were performed in the course of diagnosing CPL Chua, the defence chose to rely solely on the argument of an uncommon virus so rare that it would have been almost impossible for even the most experience doctors to identify?<br><br>Surely the use of both would have strengthened the case? We Singaporeans are, after all, very quick to remind others that it is not the end product but the effort leading to it that counts most of the time.<br><br>The only reason i can see is that the defence knew that the prosecution would have certainly poked gaping holes in that strategy, knowing that the doctors had not discharged their duties by covering all the bases.<br><br>One wonders whether this is an everyday occurance instead of a one-off affair in NUH?</div>

We're responsible for our own health, if we've no choice but really need to report sick a few more times, so go ahead &amp; just do it. If need to confirm if the diagnosis is real or not, can go for a further check-up, &amp; that's nothing wrong in doing that.<br>During a training, I landed on 1 of my foot 1st, &amp; I heard a 'crack' sound. Then my leg became injured. I went to my unit's MO, he told me that no bone was broken, the injury only involved the muscles. To further clear my doubts, I requested for an X-ray, &amp; the MO agreed. After that, my X-ray showed that the bones in that injured leg weren't broken.<br>If the MO didn't give in to my request, really, I'll resort to anything to make sure that I can get an X-ray of my injured leg to clear my doubts.<br>U see, we've to overcome this fear if we don't want anything to happen to us.</div>
