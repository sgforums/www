If the family had won this case, I can assure u a whole lot new can of worms will be opened up. This will be a landmark case, as people who has relatives who die of the same circumstances or almost similar to the case will start suing the hospitals, creating unnecssary pressure on doctors/nurses. I mean, their job is already too stressful, and if add to the fact that 1 wrong dignosis may cause them 2 be sue, who would want 2 be in the medical profession anymorE?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by nanren4ever:</div><div class="quote_body">i may get flame for this, but I think the judge was right in giving the verdict against the family of the dead. If the family had won this case, I can assure u a whole lot new can of worms will be opened up. This will be a landmark case, as people who has relatives who die of the same circumstances or almost similar to the case will start suing the hospitals, creating unnecssary pressure on doctors/nurses. I mean, their job is already too stressful, and if add to the fact that 1 wrong dignosis may cause them 2 be sue, who would want 2 be in the medical profession anymorE?</div></blockquote>Actually I sort of agree with what you have said.  Though I believe a doctor or even just a health care worker, has a duty to look after their charge to the best of their ability.  Even doctors are human they do make mistakes as well.  What I want to know is if the doctor who treated the corporal had a preconcieved notion that he was maligering (not sure about the spelling sorry).  If so it would have been wrong no?</div>
