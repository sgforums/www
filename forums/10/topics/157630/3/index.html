            <div class='col-md body'>Case history.<br><br>Family sues NUH, 6 doctors<br>By K.C. Vijayan<br><br>THE family of a dead full-time national serviceman is suing six doctors and the National University Hospital (NUH), alleging that their negligence led to his dying two days after he was admitted for a pain in the right leg.<br><br>Two NUH doctors accused Corporal Chua of malingering "to avoid his army training".<br>The six include a consultant surgeon and an orthopaedic specialist who attended to 23-year-old Chua Ya Ta in June, 2001.<br><br>The dead man's parents, carpenter Chua Seow Cheong and housewife Tan Hong Eng, both in their early 50s, and his sole surviving brother, Ya Lin, 21, are behind the suit, which was filed in the Subordinate Courts late last month.<br><br>A spokesman for the family's lawyers, Oei and Charles, said that the firm is in the process of serving the suit.<br><br>Corporal Chua, who was a tank driver in the army, saw the doctor at his camp on June 15, 2001, when his leg started hurting, and was advised to go to hospital.<br><br>TWO YEARS AGO...<br><br>Â• June 15: Army doctor refers Cpl Chua Ya Ta to hospital as his leg hurts. He is admitted to NUH after a second visit.<br><br>Â• June 17: He has breathing difficulties; his condition worsens. He dies of an acute bacterial infection.<br><br>At NUH, he received treatment and was sent home.<br><br>But less than three hours later, he returned to the hospital complaining of pain and a fever that came and went, and was admitted.<br><br>In the next two days, despite suffering from the pain, he was accused by two of the doctors of malingering 'to avoid his army training'.<br><br>In fact, the morning after he was admitted, his girlfriend, IT administrator Gladys Seow, also 23 then, was told by a nurse that the hospital wanted to discharge Cpl Chua and was handed a bill for the medical charges.<br><br>He was not discharged as by then, he had difficulties standing without assistance.<br><br>At about noon, he fainted in the hospital toilet while showering.<br><br>There was also blood in his stool.<br><br>His condition worsened and at about 3pm the day after, he was given oxygen because he had difficulty breathing.<br><br>By this time, his fingers, toes and face had also turned slightly blue.<br><br>Distressed, his uncle, businessman Chua Kok Poon, who was visiting his nephew then, asked that he be transferred to another hospital.<br><br>At about 5pm, he received a note from a doctor assuring him that Cpl Chua was in stable condition and not in 'clinical danger'.<br><br>He was later transferred to the intensive care unit, where he died at 11.10pm of an acute bacterial infection.<br><br>The suit alleges that NUH doctors failed to take sufficient steps to diagnose the infection and prescribe early treatment.<br><br>Contacted on Thursday, an NUH spokesman said that the hospital had referred the case to the coroner in 2001 and had cooperated fully in the investigation.<br><br>She added that the hospital has always kept the lines of communication with the family open.<br><br>'We also offered them grief counselling, as well as our fullest assistance whenever appropriate,' she said.</div>

I accept the coroner's<br>finding that Mr Chua Ya Ta had died from a rare infection with a<br>reported mortality rate of up to 80-100 per cent.<br><br>However, the point that concerns me the most is that the doctors<br>attending to Mr Chua accused him of malingering. They might have been<br>baffled by his condition but, as medical professionals, should they<br>not have given their patient the benefit of the doubt?<br><br>I understand that doctors do encounter malingerers and they would be<br>better off helping patients who needed their attention.<br><br>However, Singaporeans entrust the lives of their loved ones to the<br>care of doctors every day. Surely, brushing off an NSman's complaint<br>as malingering would be deemed irresponsible? This is especially so<br>in Mr Chua's case.<br><br>While it is not up to me to determine if there had been medical<br>negligence, I hope that doctors understand the great responsibilities<br>that are placed in their hands.<br><br>Having said that, as an individual with a medical history, I must say<br>that most of the doctors whom I have encountered have been thoroughly<br>professional and competent.<br><br>ALEX YEO SHENG CHYE<br><br>but we need to re-highlight this again...in ST. forum.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"></div>

I had a similar experience in 1997.<br><br>On that day, I went to my dental surgeon for root-canal treatment which lasted more than an hour. With due diligence, my surgeon asked if I had any drug allergy and I told him I had no history of adverse drug reaction. I was then prescribed a painkiller, Naproxen (Synflex).<br><br>Hours later, I took the Naproxen and, within minutes, swelling and rashes were visible from head to toe. I called the surgeon, who advised me to see him immediately. I rushed down and, to my surprise, found him waiting outside his clinic to usher me to a general practitioner a couple of doors away.<br><br>I was given an anti-histamine jab and my blood pressure was monitored. My dental surgeon then took me to his clinic and I was asked to rest in his dental chair for further observation.<br><br>Not long after, I experienced difficulty in breathing and felt very faint. Sensing my distress, the surgeon took the unusual step of taking me to hospital personally. To ensure that I was adequately taken care of, the dental assistant went along.<br><br>At the hospital, my blood pressure dropped drastically and I went into shock. Nursing staff, internal-medicine specialist, dermatologist and pharmacist surrounded me and I was assured that they would do their best to save me.<br><br>I was hospitalised for nearly a week and, during this trying period, my surgeon and his wife never failed to visit me.<br><br>I survived the ordeal and to this day I am grateful to my dental surgeon, Dr Pang Chin Heng of Pang &amp; Ng Dental Clinic, for his dedication and alertness, and for going the extra mile to ensure my recovery and comfort.<br><br>Special thanks also go to the medical experts, namely Dr Chew Choi Noi and her staff, whose professionalism and experience saved the day.<br><br>My advice?

NOT to pass judgement on patients to be Malingering.<br><br>Right now, it shows that Cpl Chua wasn't Malingering and has died from his illness. This cannot be reversed. But if the doctor/s involved had been more professional, they could have given the young man the benefit of a doubt, and treated him to ensure that death, don't come knocking at his door. If indeed Cpl Chua was Malingering, he could then be charged accordingly. But no, he wasn't, and he died all because Regulatory Red-tapes were upheld and preserved.<br><br>It appears sorely apparent, that government rules &amp; regulations are given more priority than one mere young life.<br><br>Hereafter this incident, what the HELL are the authorities going to do in preventing such stupidity?? Can I safely assume that if I have a son, he won't be denied proper medical attention because he is a soldier?? Will doctors be better trained to differentiate Malingering from a real medical condition??<br><br>Frankly, I DON'T KNOW!!!<br><br>Do you all????<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I guess young people about to do national service will have to be educated on how to stand up for their rights, even if it means getting parents, MPs or the media involved, to hell with red tape or chain of command.

It was a pain going through several medical boards though.  Thankfully I was never in any life-threatening situations. Another friend of mine did get his MP involved, and managed to get his MO's earlier report overturned. He had spinal injuries and they wanted to send him for re-course BMT!

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes, my friend knew about the regulations against going outside the joke known as the "chain of command". He decided he'd rather risk getting charged than risk permanent paralysis or death. In his case the gamble paid off. The CO and MO were hopping mad and threatened to charge him but thankfully never followed through on their threats. Don't let yourself or your loved ones be bullied by the SAF, especially when lives are at stake. Of course, if your MP happens to be a bastard and refuses to help, then you're royally screwed. Female MPs are more likely to be sympathetic  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>
