            <div class='col-md body'>From ST forum. Mr.  Poh thinks<br><br><strong>MOM too liberal about jobs for foreigners</strong><br><br>MANY Singaporeans share the concern of Dr Lim Boon Hee in his letter, 'Are foreigners depriving unskilled locals of jobs?' (ST, Nov 2<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">.<br><br>He has highlighted a simmering issue that is troubling our society.<br><br>Foreigners are ousting locals not only in unskilled jobs but also in professional, executive and clerical positions.<br><br>With employers' penchant for young and cheaper foreign workers, locals - particularly the older ones - struggle to find employment.<br><br>I know of at least one private school where the majority of the office staff are foreigners. In some schools, Chinese nationals dominate the Chinese Department.<br><br>The crux of the problem is that the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) is too liberal in its treatment of foreigners. A few examples, from the MOM website, attest to this:<br><br>Spouses, parents, children (including the handicapped), parents-in-law, stepchildren and unmarried daughters above 21 years of age of professionals are allowed to be brought in, and these people are allowed to take up e1/8mployment.<br><br>Foreign students studying here are allowed to work.<br><br>Companies can bring in foreign workers for attachment and training.<br><br>Little wonder then that foreign workers have made huge inroads into our society.<br><br>With the high cost of living, Singaporeans, too, need a job but to their dismay they are being supplanted by foreigners.<br><br>The Government needs to address this issue seriously.<br><br>Poh Tip Twee</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>From ST forum. Frankie says:<br><br>INFLUX OF FOREIGN WORKERS<br><br><strong>Help mature qualified Singaporeans find jobs</strong><br><br>I REFER to Dr Lim Boon Hee's letter about locals being deprived of jobs by foreign workers and the news on the Government easing up on S-passes.<br><br>Despite the Government and private employers' call to employ mature Singaporeans, employers generally do not wish to employ them for it is now easier to hire foreign workers as the Government has relaxed work-permit approval. It is also cheaper to employ foreign workers.<br><br>Hence, there is now a pool of mature citizens - qualified and with much experience - who wish to be employed and be relevant to society but who are unable to land a job.<br><br>This pool of workers has not yet been tapped and yet we are relaxing the rules for employers to employ semi-skilled foreign workers on S-passes.<br><br>I am 60 years of age. From 1971 to 2001, I worked for two multinational corporations as an administration/human resource manager.<br><br>In the last job, I was retrenched when the company relocated.<br><br>Since then, I have sent hundreds of applications for job vacancies suited to my experience but to no avail.<br><br>I am not fussy but rarely do prospective employers call me for an interview. On the rare occasions when I was interviewed, because of personal recommendation, I was not successful.<br><br>The feedback was that I was too old and could not fit into the company environment. The prospective employers were being presumptuous. I was prepared to<br><br>work based on employment conditions which would not cause the employer to worry about my age but there was just no opportunity to discuss this.<br><br>If the Government wishes the people to work till an older age, it must look into this category of mature people who can fill various job vacancies. They certainly can be employed and there is no necessity to issue S-passes, which take away the jobs.<br><br>I would like to suggest that the Ministry of Manpower establish a section to register this category of people and coordinate with employers who have difficulty hiring such staff.<br><br>We would also need to change the mindset of company executives who think that people above 55 years of age are old and are unable to fit into today's corporations.<br><br>Frankie Ng Puck Nang</div>
