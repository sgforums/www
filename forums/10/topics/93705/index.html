In my school, i can see malays often communicate with chinese. i don't see any reason why there is any difficulty. During lessons like Physical Education, i can see my malay friends enjoying themselves with the chinese students. It's the same for me. I like to talk to my malay friends. They got different views on different matters. And most of the time in school, i can malays chatting or playing with chinese students. Personally, i experience this too! My malay friends in the art class like to joke and play soccer with chinese classmates. We did not have difficulty in communicating to each other. SO, skyfoo, it seems that you are wrong this time.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I am proud to be Singaporean.Above all others,I hate racists.I may have Chinese blood,Indian blood and Portueguese blood,but I am above all proud of my Singaporean roots.<br><br>I honestly couldnt' care less about race.To me,different races are an ethno-cultural-linguistic product.Take for example the many stories of Chinese raised by Malay families in Singapore.Biologically,their heritage may be North East Asian,but to themselves,they see themselves as Malay.When you are in love with a woman,her race wouldn't matter to you.<br><br>I see racial harmony ever other day.My father is Chinese but my mother is Indian with some distant Portueguese blood.They have remained married for 20 years.I know of Indian friends with Chinese girlfriends,of Chinese friends with Australian girlfriends.<br><br>Ironically,living in Australia,while I have heards of racism by white people against others,I have never personally experienced it.Instead,any racism I have ever experienced has come from my fellow Chinese,because of my mixed blood.I know both racial harmony and racial tension,and I can tell you,while opposing many of the government's policies in principle,I cannot argue with the results of their past policies as it has helped greatly in reducing racial hatred and suppressing and removing much racial tension.While racial tension still exists in Singapore,in my personal experience,it is minor.<br><br></div>
