As for care the health services has been good but the price turn those who need it away. Nourishment is one thing i thing Singapore lack seiously. Singapore is based on meritocracy, where everyone is given a fair chance. But how true fair is it? The education system is created in such a way that every child has to land his first step on the right path. Why? The chance of the child succeeding in a good school is relatively higher then a neighbourhood one. Just look at the vast difference in the standard of teachers in a neighbourhood school as compare to those elite like RI. I am not saying that good neioghbourhood teachers are hard to find. Its just that as Elite school are private they can afford to hire better teacher and attract those good teacher from the neighbourhood. The playing field of a child education is not really fair. Therefore i feel Singapore meritocracy is undermind. I will not protect something in which i do not really like.</div>

Its not as though the generals and the scholars would lose money on their investments such as CAO and Suzhou right?<br><br>And the only reason why your govt offers upgrading every election is because they are concerned that you are living in the slums and every five years, you are told to vote for them or live in the slums, after the elections, they do not want to inconvenience you and hence they do not upgrade your flat.<br><br>And your govt cares so much for you that your opinion matters. Its not like they decided on the cabaret and gambling dens without consulting you first. Its not like they would invest your taxes without telling you first. Remember, you are free to air anything you feel on a blog or a forum. You will not lose your job, say as a journalist, if you criticise the govt after all, they love you right?

Men in the Haredi community may choose to be exempt while enrolled in Yeshivas, a practice that is a source of tension [4], though some yeshiva programs like Hesder provide opportunities for service.<br><br>Men serve three years in the IDF, while women serve two and sometimes under two. The IDF may on occasions require women who volunteer for combat positions to serve for three years because combat soldiers must undergo a lengthy period of training. Women in combat positions are also required to serve as reserve for several years after their dismissal from regular service, pending marriage, or pregnancy, is in order.<br><br><strong>Reserve Service</strong><br>Following regular service, <strong>men may be called for reserve service of up to one month annually, until the age of 43-45 </strong>(reservists may volunteer after this age), and may be called for active duty immediately in times of crisis. In most cases, the reserve duty is carried out in the same unit for years, in many cases the same unit as the active service and by the same people. Many soldiers who have served together in active service continue to meet in reserve duty for years after their discharge, causing reserve duty to become a strong male bonding experience in Israeli society. A well-known Israeli joke refers to civilians as soldiers on 11-month furlough.<br><br>Although still available to be called up in times of crisis, most Israeli men, and virtually all women, do not actually perform reserve service in any given year. Units do not always call up all of their reservists every year, and a variety of exemptions are available if called for regular reserve service. Virtually no exemptions exist for reservists called up in a time of crisis, but experience has shown that in such cases (most recently, Operation Defensive Shield in 2002) exemptions are rarely requested or exercised; units generally achieve recruitment rates above those considered fully-manned.<br><br>Recently, legislation has been proposed for reform in the reserve service, lowering the maximum service age to 40, designating it as a purely emergency force, as well as many other changes to the current structure (although the Defence Minister can suspend any portion of it at any time for security reasons). The age threshold for many reservists whose positions are not listed, though, will be fixed at 49. The legislation is set out to take effect by 13 March 2008.<br><br><strong>Border Guard Service</strong><br>Some IDF soldiers will serve their mandatory military service in the Mishmar HaGvul (abbreviated to Magav) or Border Guard. Once the soldiers complete their IDF combat training they undergo additional counter-terror and Border Guard training. They are then assigned to any one of the Border Guard units around the country.<br><br>The Border Guard units fight side by side with the regular IDF combat units. They also are responsible for security in heavy urban areas such as the City of Jerusalem.<br><br>Many officers in the Border Guard come from the IDF combat units. While the Border Guard does retain their own command structure, on the ground they are almost indistinguishable from the regular IDF units.<br><br></blockquote></span></div>
