Oh well, he is suggesting that most S'poreans of our generation do not have the patriotism that the Israelis have. He's right.<br><br>But to compare with the Israelis? That's absurd. Yes, we live in a region of muslim neighbours but relations have always had at least a decent measure of cordiality.<br><br>But the Israelis? They thrive because they have to. Imagine living in a country where your Arab neighbours cannot wait to eliminate you from the face of the earth and exterminate your race. Israelis have gone thru the Holocaust and they desire to be stronger because of that too.<br><br>Now take a look at S'pore, do we have any Holocaust to speak of? If we do, would that make us more patriotic? Of course. It's the circumstances which make people of a nation unite, not just because simply that's where we grew up.<br><br>This writer must be out of his mind to have made this comparison.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmmm....... if u ask this qns to those lao jiao generation, the answer will be a truthful YES!! But for now 2006, I doubt the answer is more of a wayang YES.<br><br>Why?<br><br>The older generation experience harsh conditions during nation building and has taken part in forging feelings, an unique national identity for this island. Singapore is more of a precious brainchild of the them in their perspective andthey will do anything to defend it.<br>But sadly, in this recent yrs, being a Singaporean, the word "Singaporean" doesn't hold ani water now. Any xyz with loads of cash, or could thump their chest loudly and proclaim that they are a foreign talent, could easyland u, at least a PR or even a citizenship. Being a Singaporean is so cheap as in just swearing in at the age of 21 and immediately get pink IC. Singapore is transforming unknowingly a place rather than a republic. With a large in flux of foreigners turn citizens, we can be for sure there are going to be many "fair-weather Singaporeans". For those that read last week LIFE! section, they say many ah mas do not see Singapore as a home, but a place to work, as they are not born here so no feeling. Judging on how generous our MIW are giving out student visa and lucrative scholarship to the Chinese citizens, do u think they will like Singapore and want to be a PR. From wad I gathered from them, they treat Singapore as a "carrot-head" so they can fleece it effortlessly. When time is up, they just go home. You believe these guys will stay and hold the fort? When Singapore is in a state of conflict, you believe Singapore will still appear as attractive to those FTs? Just remember the fall of the kingdom of Venice. They relied on too much foreigners turned locals for their army, and they are allowed to influence local politics and discussions. In the end, all those FT fled when the city was sieged by neighbouring kingdoms.</div>
