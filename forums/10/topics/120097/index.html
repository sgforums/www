            <div class='col-md body'><br>I wonder which economist would tell you increasing population size would increase the economic growth... maybe our "leader" should be sent out to tell all those small population countries about their "poor" economic growth...<br><br>There are more factors in macro economics than just population. One of which is the govt policies. Even with 10 million, we won't grow much if the policies our "leader" set are counter productive.<br><br>the population renewal is dual prong. One of whch if no one ever noticed is the govt is dead set against support us when we age, So we were forced to have CPF. Then they realised CPF is insufficient. So they want to have a more younger people to support the increasing number of older people (or hope they all become quitters). Yes, having more younger people is good for the economy and they had calculated the returns from having young people and they have held this single idealogy dearly. However, their policies and system right now cannot handle the multitudes of issues that arise in this new age and thinking in the higher number of younger people. And the young also do not want to be saddled with having to take care of the old.<br><br></div>
