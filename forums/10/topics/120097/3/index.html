That's another reason why pple not willing to have kids cos of high education costs.<br>Everywhere crowded, that's why I don't go shopping/ Orchard Rd on weekends.<br><br>The present old folks are still ok cos some have pension/ large amt in CPF.<br>They bought properties very cheaply (My aunty's terr. cost only $22,000 30 yrs ago) &amp; can retire by downgrading. Also they have many kids to help support them (Very common to have 5- 7 kids then).<br>We, on the other hand are still servicing  prop. loans (HDB alone ave $300K), not much left in CPF. Most have 1 - 2 kids.<br>We cannot depend on our kids cos by the time they graduate, they have high study loans to pay + low pay. That is a worrying trend.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Fling,<br><br>Yes, HK n Japan property are more expensive but their pay is also higher..For HK, MTR is cheap n they do not have PTC (Public transport Committee) tat consist of members of SBS Transit, MRT etc...So there are no consumer or very small consumer voice within the PTC. Why have gahment recently set the PTC formula for fare price..in fact, these bus companies, MRT annouces "obscene profits" after the fare increase, as they claimed tat they are answerable to shareholders. A public service becomes a "private entity" whose sole aim is to make profit. What can u say.<br><br>Yes, it is also true tat HK, Japan and Shanghai , the MRT are packed like sardines during peak hours. They even have pple employed as "pushers" to push pple into the train.<br><br>We need critical mass to succeed in this globalised world n certain types of FTs, not the mediocre engineers, clerks etc tat we often encountered...this policy need to be finetune...<br><br>Singapore is only a small city and it is easy to manage. Imagine, chinese government official have to "rule" over 21 million pple in Shanghai, getting the city up n going is much complicated that Singapore dingy 4 million pple.<br><br>I think we should moderate our expectations, China is a "awakened giant". We are no longer the No.1 in this or tat, tat our gahment would like us to believe. For years, we have "obscene" surpluses...remember ex-Minister of Finance, Richard Hu. U can bet on it tat there are always "surpluses". Every gahment body is a profit centre, geared for cost recovery...wat do u expect.<br><br>Our young are NOT hungry enough...most of our brightest are co-opt into gahment...look...how Sim Hong Woo do we have...n almost all the entrepreneurs are circumstancial millionaires....pay our scholars,S$20k - S$30k a month, n they would nvr make tat kind of money if they are running a business..so why take the risk....<br><br>Take a bus if u have too...downgrade if u have to...just live within yr means...dont compare with the Mr Tan or Mr Chan, it will nvr be the same again. Are there anymore good years....hmmm...maybe with the casino...<br><br>We really do not have any choice..we need the casino to survive n thrive in this new world order. For now, our aging population is getting more and the ratio is 8 : 1 ie every 8 working person to support 1 elderly..but by 2030, it is 4:1.<br><br>So just struggle on till yr retirement at 60 or 65. Then gahment will give u back yr CPF money....Cheers...<br><br></div>

Weekends I stay at home because the whole purpose of weekends is to take a break and relax, and not go out and jostle with the huge crowds, getting pissed off in the process.
