What does say about our MPs, PM and MM? And they still say country first <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If we transfer 100 civil servants whose pay are $80,000.00 - $150,000.00 pa to the private sector and two years after transfer the private sector bosses are very happy to keep them because they are making more monies, I would agree that our public sector officials are not over-paid.<br><br>Here and there despite claim of our scholars being world-class talents, such transfer do not result in private sector making more monies. Some one could always carry out a survey to find out how successful were the former MPs in turning around private sector companies.<br><br>So all the talks about the ability and talent of civil servants and ministers are plain bull. The benchmarking against private sector bosses (many of whom compared are paying themselves higher salaries from their own business profits to avoid paying higher taxes) is another bull.<br><br>The passing of self-proposed and self-benchmarked world's highest salaries for ministers and retirement annuities are 2/3 of last drawn salaries after two terms is a serious conflict of interest and on this ground is unenforceable in court.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well...Minister Mentor is paid 5 figure sum to guide ministers and run the government making other MPs and ministers political puppets. The puppets as well are paid 5 figure sum. But our people is the one who are slogging day and night to make a decent living. Workers fear retrenchment as companies are employing PRCs and Malaysians. PRCs are given PRs like chocolates. What will happen to Singaporeans if PRCs are getting all the jobs. Do we have to beg on the streets to wait for PRCs to throw coins at our iron rice bowls?</div>
