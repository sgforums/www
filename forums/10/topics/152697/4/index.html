            <div class='col-md body'>Hello Lotus999,<br><br>What you have said is now reproduced below:-<br><br><blockquote><strong>Lotus999: You seem so concerned about the governmental control that you've become exceedingly paranoid. This paranoia has caused you to loose your rationality and your reasoning to become confusing and sometimes conflicting. Here are some examples: </strong></blockquote>As for my remark "have'nt we locked up enough people for the slightest faults" that remark was in reply to a forumer who suggested to lock up people for racism over the blogs. It was to express my point that before government takes any actions on perceived racism over blog, it should prove its case.<br><br>You have obvioulsy quoted me out of context and insisted that I should prove my statement - "have we not locked up enough people for the slightest fault."<br><br>In view of your convoluted view of my remark, I am now obliged to enlighten you on the examples of people locked up for the slightest faults. These include people who were sued and detained for defamations over speeches made during election, for none other than political speeches made in the heat and in the nature conduct of electoral process. What faults have they committed?<br><br>There are those who were detained under ISA till these days without their faults being conducted with proper hearing in open court, so what offences have been committed? Have alleged offences been proven?<br><br>If laws and orders are to be extended to the sphere of blogs, sad to say, I don't see why authority cannot first prove the rationale that posting of views in blogs are indeed as pervasive as mass circulation newspapers.(irrespective of average readership of 20 daily per topic over popular site like CNA)<br><br>Can we say that it is fair to insist on conventional interpretations of publications of printed words when racist remarks in blogs and internets are matter of personal communications.<br><br>Obviously internet is today one fo the greatest commuication invention permitting people to communicate on different plain - private as well as public irrespective of borders or nationalities. Has government really understood the nature of internet and blogs. If government really wants to open up the pandora box but extending sedition laws to blogs then it should study how consistently resolve how it will take further actions for similar remarks in blogs and internets posted by foreigners on foreign blogs.<br><br>It will be ironical for PM Lee to say he wants people to have views and independent thinking or to build an inclusive society if he does not first produce sufficient facts and figures to prove that blogs are indeed pervasive mass circulation and not personal communication devices, a view I have consistently posted.<br><br>I hope his announced intention to build an inclusve society is not an empty promise.<br><br>I am only asking for more open and accountable corporate governance before extending greater control over citizens' last freedoms of expressing their political views or beliefs or government policies. Citizens should play a part in asking to be heard on the rationale for draconian controls.<br><br>Blogs can be private in nature as well as public just like YP website. It is the responsibility of government to differentiate those which are private in nature even though under conventional meaning, the views may be accessible to public. Severity of punishment does have to take such factor into account.<br><br>I have made relevant replies to various pertinent points and I do not think I have strayed off the issues. As of debates I am not debating for the sake of debating or semantics but am giving my views on an important issue - actions of government for perceived seditions in blogs.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hello Toofree,<br><br>The minister himself has realised (though his view was not backed by the judges who try seditions in court in recent years) the old Sedition Act may be inadequate to be extended to blogs or internet. So why not have the whole issue in our mature Singapore today be debated in parliament and let there be proper accountable governance before taking actions on racism over the blogs or internet. Morever publication of words or expression in blogs might not necessarily have the same intent or impact as those published purposefully in mass circulation newspapers or televisions. The minister owes a duty to the public to introduce proper legislation amendment before extending laws or punishments over publications in the private blogs or semi-public websites like youngPAP.<br><br>As a matter of fact many views and words in YoungPAP were found to be very vulgar and foul but they have up to this time been tolerated. This fact only confirms my view that publication on blogs or internet might be private or semi-public without the same intent as those in the mass circulation papers.<br><br>There is also the question of fitting of punishment to the crime. Has the minister considered this fact. Many materials from outside the country also appear in cyberspace and the governmnet might not be able to take them to tasks even if the sedition is amended to cover blogs and internet.<br><br>Let the minister enlighten the more educated people of today that he will treat all seditions published on blogs and newspapers as of the same severity without differentiation even though the blogs might be of different nature and intent.<br><br>Only then will I as a citizen accept the laws and not hastily extended by some extrapolation in his mind that blogs are the same in intent or impact as mass circulation newspapers the original the media over which seditions normally apply.</div>

If our laws are uncertain and too sweeping like the sedition laws, they have to be changed. It will be good to all citizens to have a government which is willing to justify extention of control into blogs and internets by proper amendments to existing unclear legislation. This is my point.<br><br>Let's look forward. I have  given a certain off-the-cuff reply in an earlier post "have we locked up enough people already for the slightest fault" to some forumer who suggested locking up more people for racism not to lock up people without jusf process and laws. In the context of that forumer's over-bold remark I do not think I am being frivolous.  I still maintain this view.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I am all for freedom of speech in cyberspace, especially since we have few avenues left to speak freely without fear of recrimination. However, blogs which are freely available to perusal by all and sundry can become the vehicle for sowing social unrest.<br><br>I presume robertteh is old enough to remember the racial riots of the 60s. We live in 'interesting times' and in a volatile region where extremists are waiting to exploit any opportunity to destroy the racial harmony we currently enjoy. I have full confidence that our Malays and Muslims are religious but not fanatical, proud of their cultural heritage but not segregationists. However, they are not immune to spoilers who would cast the non-Muslim, Chinese hegemony that exists as a diabolical plot to contain the minority in the midst of an overwhelmingly Muslim region.<br><br>Both in this forum and in Singaporean society I have encountered young people with misguided views that are frankly racist. We must not allow such a window of opportunity to let in extremists who would turn Singapore into Afghanistan. If we have to curtail civil liberties to ensure our continued stability and prosperity, I am for it.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Short title.<br>1. This Act may be cited as the Sedition Act.<br><br>Interpretation.<br>2. In this Act Â—<br><br>"publication" includes all written or printed matter and everything whether of a nature similar to written or printed matter or not containing any visible representation or by its form, shape or in any other manner capable of suggesting words or ideas, and every copy and reproduction or substantial reproduction of any publication;<br><br>"seditious" when applied to or used in respect of any act, speech, words, publication or other thing qualifies such act, speech, words, publication or other thing as one having a seditious tendency;<br><br>"words" includes any phrase, sentence or other consecutive number or combination of words, oral or written.<br><br>Seditious tendency.<br>3.

            <div class='col-md body'>Seems to me that a bit harsh to jail them. We live in a multi-racial country where different cultures and religions co-exist. Definitely, there will be friction as we grapple with each other's beliefs. Many times I also have come across Muslims saying nasty things about Chinese. But that doesn't make me go about reporting to the authorities every single thing. The solution is tolerance. If one party feel offended in any way and wants to exercise its right to stamp on the other one then this is unhealthy.What one individual say is not representative of how the whole community feels toward the other race or religion.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by robertteh:</div><div class="quote_body">Hello Oxford Mushroom,<br><br>...My only concern here is the manner racism is being dealt with - sedition over the blogs or internet. Is this action taken as a prelude to intended clamp down on our last freedom of speech. Citizens should be mature and discerning enough not to be sold any new policies which as was done with GRC - double edged and also intended to serve political purpose i.e. to suppress political views or expressions in the guise of racism harmony. Singapore may be in greater danger of losing the rights of political participation more so than the racial disharmony..</div></blockquote>Hi Robert,<br><br>I agree with your concerns in general, although I believe there are enough racists in Singapore to pose a genuine threat to our security. Nothing fires up emotions as much as race and religion and we already have enough young people with loose tongues to start a flame war in cyberspace. Just go to EH and read the threads attacking Christianity. I shudder to think if someone does the same with Islam, which may well happen.<br><br>Nevertheless, I share your concern about the wording of the Sedition Act. There are some safeguards in the legislation but the definitions were kept rather vague. For example, Sect 3(1) states,<br><br>"Seditious tendency.<br>3. Â—(1) A seditious tendency is a tendency Â—......<br><br>(e) to promote feelings of ill-will and hostility between different races or classes of the population of Singapore."<br><br>A debate in the forum about the elites and non-elites in society can be construed to satisfy the criteria set forth in subsection (1)e, since it can certainly arouse a great deal of disaffection against the ruling elite class. What is more worrying is (what I consider to be) rather irresponsible calls by some to start nationwide strikes and demonstrations, which are clearly illegal and may well spur the government to clamp down online forums such as this. Whilst we criticise the government over the lack of transparency and autocratic policies, we must be careful not to give them a reason to remove whatever space for free speech we currently enjoy. And that will be a sad day indeed...<br><br></div>

Please do see the main issues being discussed in my post that before any control is extended to blogging or internet like the GRC, such action should be substantiated by proper accountable debates in parliaments with proper laws passed to consider views posted in blogs as actionable. For now it seems to be only uncertain based on extrapolation of existing laws which is not that accountable.<br><br>It will then be fair exchange and you don't owe me nor I owe you.

It excludes the courts (and the prosecution) from the process. From a civil rights perspective, this is not ideal. It is far better to have the bloggers charged under the Sedition Act, and brought to trial in open court. There is more fairness and transparency.<br><br>Also, the MHRA deals with religion, not race. As the bloggers' posts were offensive not just on religious grounds, but also on racial grounds, MHRA is thus not sufficient to deal with these bloggers. Whereas the Sedition Act, designed to deal with the promotion of hostility between "different races or classes of the population of Singapore", comes a lot closer to the heart of the matter.</div>
