Large audiences are exceptions rather than the rule.<br><br>It does not enjoy the same audiences as national newspapers or televisions which are truly the traditional media of mass communication and public.<br><br>So posting on blogs or websites should not be regarded as public or mass circulation media as newspapers or TVs. I am not encouraging anyone to post defamatory or racists stuff in internets but I feel that given our tight media controls and lack of freedoms of poltical participation, one more move to penalise people for expressions of views or opinions may be counter-productive to further progress and opening up of our society.<br><br>There may be a misunderstanding about the role of websites or internets as compared with other mass media. Penalty for racist remarks should therefore be moderated accordingly and not be more as heavy as those meted out to defamations or racisms published in mass circulations newspapers or TVs. </div></blockquote>I think you have under-estimated the power of internet.

Look at all the broadcast channel websites like channel news asia. How many people really bother about any posts on that site. I have counted posts at "Business" and "Community" threads as not more than "20" for any topic daily.<br><br>This volume is by far miniscule as compared with readership of national daily like the Straits Times. So on factual evidence, government will be seen as overreacting to blogs as viewers of such site are very small.<br><br>If channel news asia website viewers say increase to 500,000 daily, may be there is a case for concern.<br><br>As for posts across borders, it will be assumption to say that the impact is even greater. Check the fact again. How many foreigners really bother to read any of the post in sgforums, channel news asia or feedback unit.</div>

Continuation of more clamp down and control of the whole intellectual and business vibrancy or a bit of policy adjustment or interpretation issues over nature and role of internet and blogging.<br><br>If the actual role (private nature and usually read by less than 20 persons per day) of blog or internet website is properly understood then it will be found that there is no problem with a minority of errant racists whose private ranting nobody really care to read, least incensed into enraging themselves into communal riots.<br><br>Perceptions are just as important in the way we solve problems. Do our leaders have the correct and objective perceptions.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Lotus999<br><br>Whether a law is necessary or not depends not just on the act itself but on the particular circumstance in which the act or presumed offence is committed.<br><br>If the act is very serious, it should be punished more severely. Murder is punished with death penalty so is drug trafficking involving certain quantity of heroin.<br><br>I agree with you that racial hates may be serious. But hs the government fully and objectively taken into consideration the circumstance as well.<br><br>If the act is made in highly publcized media like the national newspapers or televisions, I agree that the racists should face severe penalty.<br><br>In the case of private blogs, and internets even if they are accessible to public which are mostly scantily read by not more than 20 per day, are they so serious as presumed by the government.<br><br>What I am pleading is not racism is not serious or should be condone. What I am pleading is for the government before introducing any more draconian controls like ISD-type presumptuous laws, be more objective and consider the rationality and circumstances as well.<br><br>Has the government so far given any facts or figures to show that the particular offending blogs were widely read with high traffic.<br><br>Is it government's duty to consider each case according to merits, circumstances and reality of the situation before jumping to conclusions of any kind like in this particular case.<br><br>There is no need to jump to the conclusion that any racist words uttered are racist and will cause immediate harm or damage. Why leave so much presumptions for the government to use big axe on citizens based on presumptions as in this case. Government should be more objective and not go back to the old days of passing all kinds of laws on presumptions.<br><br>If an old woman let out her flat carelessly to a foreigner without work permit, should she go to jail on presumption that harbouring illegal immigrant is seriouis.<br><br>If one or two high-rise window drop off its hinge because HDB failed to introduce proper workmanship or standards in construction of flats should government be so rash as to conclude that all the flat owners deserve to be punished by heavy fines for not maintaining windowns. This kind of presumptuous laws are being passed by our government making everyone liable for acts they did not commit to be guilty of draconian punishments to suits government convenience.<br><br>Our society is not facing big racism problems because of one or three racists. Our country does not become a poor country because of one family sleeping in HDB car park or void deck as published in the newspaper today.<br><br>Which is a greater evil - over-control until citizens are punished or liable to punishments for all kinds of presumptuous acts not well established on facts.<br><br>We are fast losing creativity and vibrancy due to all kinds of control freaks taking charge of presumed problems when they are not even established as such by proper facts and figures.<br><br>There is a need to be objective in taking actions on people. Let the new leaders be different from the old and not make the same mistakes of overreacting to presumed problems and refusing to listen to good views of the people like in the NKF case. Let the government prove its case if it wants to take more actions against people for slightest offensive posts in internet or blog. Apart from this caution, I am in support of certain level of action against racism.</div>

The major problem here may be perceptions. Our new leaders have been asking young people to come forward to serve the people. Are they indeed sincere judging by the last clamp down on blogging and internets.<br><br>In my view, our leaders claiming to be more open and inclusive should be more pro-people and willing to change otherwise more narrow-minded interpretations of blogs and internets might lead to worsening of our social and cultural climate so essential to progress.</div>

Government should not blame the citizens who think differently as there is a clear case of using of sledge hammer to swat the fly. A small penalty on any seditious private blog posting  is more than sufficient. This is especially so if the offender is a young person hardly more than 17 of age.

Charges are against racism not against different points of view<br><br>There are many sites on the net against singapore government and its policies, but the government has not banned them, or prosecuted the owners. It's only racist sites that are being brought down. This can not be seen as an all out war against freedom of expression.<br><br>You are free to express your opinions, but that does not mean you can say anything you like. You are still responsible for your comments. Insults, false accusations, etc. will get you in trouble.<br><br>Note that we all have a duty to our fellow beings under the law of torts. People seem to forget this very often. This duty takes precedence over your right to free expression in cases where you cause emotional distress to people through your expressions.<br><br>2. Blogs are not private!!!<br><br>As long as you are open to the 'worldwide web', a blog is not private, and serves as a stage to promote your views to an audience. It becomes a virtual public assembly. Please note that for a real public assembly in Singapore you need to get police permission. Yet to make a virtual public assembly you don't need police permission. So one could argue that Singapore has become more lenient after the advent of the internet. (There were at least a 100 visitors to the some of the racist blogs by very conservative estimates.)</blockquote>(Reply by Robertteh):<br><br>Please read my posts again. I am not saying that racism should be tolerated and not be punished. What I am saying is that before punishing racism do consider blogs or websites are not as prevalent as national newspapers or televisions.<br><br>So in coming down on racism posted in blogs, do consider this fact that blogs are both private and accessible to public. This fact has to be considered objectively and let the government not go overboard or  overreact.<br><br>I wonder if the government has considered this point. If it has not, I suggest that it should. I suggest that in an internet age any foreign blogs can have just as much effect on our local conduct and behavior.<br><br>Practically any citizens may access the blogs and say something, and is the government going to apply a big broad brush of sedition laws or publication on everyone for many stupid things said, many of which may be said in jest or humour as well.<br><br>Do we have a government who understand the global nature of internet and blogs. I urge the government to relook at the old precepts that anything published or aired anywhere is liable to seditions without taking into account the private albert publicly accessible nature of blogs.<br><br>If government insists that blogs are public and not private then why allow ypap website to limit access. I happened to read some YP posting and saw that they are full of defamatory remarks but so far no action has been taken. I suppose the lack of similar action on rantings in YP is not due to practice of double standard but some form of tolerance of new forms of communication that is both private and accessible to public.</div>

If we want to stop racism posted in blog, or internets, there should be some forms of objective and transparent standards like what constitute racist outrage and publishing before taking of actions. After all seditions are not minor offences and fines or jail sentences at this moment can be heavy.</div>
