            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by oxford mushroom:</div><div class="quote_body">Hi Robert,<br><br>I agree with your concerns in general, although I believe there are enough racists in Singapore to pose a genuine threat to our security. Nothing fires up emotions as much as race and religion and we already have enough young people with loose tongues to start a flame war in cyberspace. Just go to EH and read the threads attacking Christianity. I shudder to think if someone does the same with Islam, which may well happen.<br><br>Nevertheless, I share your concern about the wording of the Sedition Act. There are some safeguards in the legislation but the definitions were kept rather vague. For example, Sect 3(1) states,<br><br>"Seditious tendency.<br>3. Â—(1) A seditious tendency is a tendency Â—......<br><br>(e) to promote feelings of ill-will and hostility between different races or classes of the population of Singapore."<br><br>A debate in the forum about the elites and non-elites in society can be construed to satisfy the criteria set forth in subsection (1)e, since it can certainly arouse a great deal of disaffection against the ruling elite class. What is more worrying is (what I consider to be) rather irresponsible calls by some to start nationwide strikes and demonstrations, which are clearly illegal and may well spur the government to clamp down online forums such as this. Whilst we criticise the government over the lack of transparency and autocratic policies, we must be careful not to give them a reason to remove whatever space for free speech we currently enjoy. And that will be a sad day indeed...<br><br></div></blockquote>I did not disagree that racist remarks should be punished . My point of departure is before taking any actions for racism or any other breaches in the new media of personal communication like blogs or internet, laws on publications should be made certain so that there will be respect for rule of law by citizens. Do think about this point and I hope citizens will grow to be more objective and discerning so that we can avoid similar kind of gerrymandering in laws and enforcements as has happened with GRC.</div>

Freedom of expression is wasted on these people like what a Malay saying says - giving flowers to monkeys.</div>

Immersion in the Malay community may help him get over his misplaced animosity for Malays in general.<br><br>I can understand the amount of rage he felt at that particular Malay couple who indirectly led to the death of his younger brother, but I cannot accept his animosity for the Malay race because of that. I cannot truly say that I understand his emotions, but to harbour a hatred for an entire people just because of a couple of people is highly unacceptable, and, as I had said, misplaced.<br><br>I'm not excusing what that couple did - if their identity does ever get found out, I hope they'll spend time behind bars for what they did.<br><br>But consider this: if the couple had been Chinese, will he harbour an animosity for his own race because of that? Will he hate himself for being Chinese? I'm inclined to believe that's not the case.</div>
