              <div><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'lucida sans unicode';">1.	One way of demonising an opponent, particularly a political opponent, is to give him a derogatory label. <br><br> 2. At one time Lee Kuan Yew labeled me as a Malay ultra. After that
              caught on, I could do nothing that would not be labeled as extreme.
              Even if I make the most innocent statement, it would be considered as
              extreme, as racist. <br><br> 3. It took me decades to live it down. When I was appointed Deputy
              Prime Minister there was consternation among the Chinese. What was
              going to happen to Malaysia when this Malay ultra took over the Prime
              Ministership?<br><br></span></div>
              </div>
              <p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'lucida sans unicode';">4.
              However, by the time I stepped down I had managed to belie that
              description. In the 1999 Election it was Chinese votes which helped
              give me the 2/3 majority in Parliament. <br><br> 5. Now the doomsday label is Mahathirism. Such was the fear of this
              thing called Mahathirism that Tan Sri Muhyiddin had to assure the
              public that Najib's ascendancy to the Premiership would not bring back
              Mahathirism. The foreign press seem to imply authoritarian Government
              with Mahathirism. <br><br> 6. No one has yet described the rule of Dato Seri Abdullah Badawi as
              Badawism. It must be because he is said to be liberal and free from
              authoritarianism. But is he? <br><br> 7. It appears to be simply because the mainstream media, print or
              electronic, is totally controlled by him through his hatchet man,
              Kalimullah. And Kali ensures that the media plays up Abdullah's
              supposed liberalism, his transparency, his tolerance of the press etc.
              That the media blacks out any news that is not flattering of him is not
              noticed by readers, especially the foreign press. <br><br> 8. Until the bloggers came into the picture and their blogs became
              extremely popular as they reported the truth, the black-out was
              effective. Now Kali's media reports some of the news and views
              appearing on the blogs. <br><br> 9. But still the general public is not aware of the kind of
              authoritarianism of Abdullah. Ministers and civil servants critical of
              him have been removed. Many are in cold storage. Tan Sri Sanusi Junid
              who was President of the International Islamic University was one of
              those removed. No one has been appointed to his vacant place yet. <br><br> 10. A whole bunch of journalists working with the UMNO owned paper had
              to resign, to be replaced by Kali's nominees from Singapore. <br><br> 11. But Kali has friends amongst the foreign journalists. So we do not
              hear of Badawism. But privately people have given all kinds of
              uncomplimentary labels to the 5 years of misrule by the fifth Prime
              Minister of Malaysia. <br><br> 12.	By now people can draw their own conclusions as to whether Mahathirism in whatever form has returned.</span></p>
