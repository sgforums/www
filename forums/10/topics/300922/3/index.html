To classify something that takes up to almost 40% of a person's productive awake time as being "a small part of it" is something else.<br><br>Maybe you are part of the elite, that's why work is inconsequential to you.<br><br>Money has the highest standing in Singapore, simple reason is, if you don't have money for your basic necessities (e.g. mortgage, food, clothing, transport, medical), no government body is going to give you money for your survival, as we are not a welfare state. I wish we could all survive on love, self-esteem and families, but the biological truth is that we can't.<br><br>If you belong to the elite class, then obviously it's not about how much you make, because you do not have to maintain a basic human existence. It's not about how much taxes you pay and welfare claims? If you don't have a job, you definitely won't get welfare from the government, you probably can't survive. Humans strive to survive even under extreme conditions, if you don't have food, clothing and medical, you can't survive at all. Maybe you should tell us what it's all about, if it's not about survival bread and butter issue. In Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory, most human beings would satisfy their physiological needs at the base of the pyramid first before considering his other needs above that level. Maybe you are different from us.<br><br><img src="http://i208.photobucket.com/albums/bb312/maurizio13/400px-Maslow27s_hierarchy_of_nee-1.png"><br><br>If I were to leave Singapore, I guess the only thing I would miss is the food, nothing else.<br><br>It's correct, nobody is indispensable, the world still spins if the world population dies off. Then why are all our Ministers indispensable? They need to pay them high salaries because they can't do without them?<br><br>Your grandfather came here while Singapore was starting out, with nothing, I respect your grandfather for contributing to the economy of Singapore. But what have these new immigrants sacrificed? Other than their political freedom. I give you an analogy.<br><br>When Mr. Lee started his company (Singapore), the company was poor and without resources. He got a group of workers to labour for his company, the company was poor so he could not afford to pay them high salaries but gave them shares instead, these workers relented because they have faith in the vision of this CEO.<br><br>The workers strive and laboured through a few decades, finally the company was profitable and making money. But the CEO said, he can't distribute the profits in the form of dividends to the workers cum shareholders. Why? It's because he has to maintain reserves to cushion the impact of any adverse business cycle. So these workers cum shareholders end up working their lives away without any prospects of retiring with the dividends they had hoped to get.<br><br>Finally some of these workers cum shareholders died off, some are still working their butt off in their old age (washing toilets, "recycling" cans from rubbish bins). These workers transferred their shares of the company to their children, hoping that maybe the children will reap the rewards from the dividends.<br><br>BUT, now the CEO of the company wants to issue new shares to many foreign workers at zero cost (same as the first batch of workers). e.g. if the existing shares were 1,000 shares and the company has a total value of $1,000,000. The old workers are entitled to $1,000 per share. With the new share issue of another 1,000, the value of the share would be $500.<br><br>Is this company being fair to it's existing shareholders?</div>

" on 12 January 2008 Â· 02:38 AM. Money which is directly linked to work is a major part of life in Singapore, without work, there won't be any life. If you consider it a "small part", maybe you should stop work and see how you can manage your daily lifestyle. Fancy calling something that takes up close to 40% of your waking time "small".<br><br>It's the norm in developed countries, but the way you classify small and unimportant is horrendous. Try stop working for 1 year and tell me how small the change is to your lifestyle.<br><br>Who said Norwegians don't work? You or me? But you have to understand that the way income is distributed in the population of Norway and Singapore are totally worlds apart. In Norway, the income difference isn't as stark as Singapore because taxes are used as a measure to redistribute income back to the lower income earners, so as to help them to maintain a decent standard of living. In Singapore, if you are jobless and out of work, you are on your own. When job market in Singapore is tight, one has to contend that he/she will be out of job for a period of time. How does an unemployed survive? Have you ever been out of job? What about structural unemployment where the economy undergoes a drastic change to restructure? Definitely during such time, more will be out of job for a longer period of time. How does the government ensure the sustenance of these people? Do they provide some basic necessities during such period of needs? Or are they more engrossed in their motive of increasing their own salaries to benefit themselves?<br><br>Norwegians who worked 8 hours a day end up being more happy because at the end of the month when all the bills come, they know that they are abled to afford it. When they end up unemployed they know that the government will provide some assistance to them for them to pick themselves up. When they end up in hospital without any savings in the bank account, they can be sure that the goverment will take care of their welfare and provide some basic healthcare.<br><br>I won't engage you in a physiological disccusion of how serotonin and dopamine triggers off the receptors. But what you mentioned about being happy is subjective, maybe we should just stick to objective things and not veer off this path. One person could be happy going out to the beach to sun, while another could be happy staying indoors, these are all subjective issues, BUT both of these rational people would definitely be happy if they receive $1 million in lottery. Just stick to the objective view.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br></span><br><br>I'm not suggesting that u eat air. And I have raised the issue of social safety nets in Singapore before. I think its sorely lacking and more should be done to help those who have fallen on hard times, esp those who are in that position through no fault of their own.<br><br><span style="color: darkblue;">I agree with you on this part, more should be done about social welfare. Some of these workers are unemployed not of their own volition, but as a result of market restructuring (manufacturing to service oriented industry). Just because one moron publicly announced to the world that we are not a welfare state and he does not want to admit to the mistake as he is NEVER WRONG, does not mean that we have to acquiesce his fallacious statement. He is NOT GOD you know. Humans are not infallible, we are not perfect and we do commit mistakes once in a while.<br><br></span><br><br>Am I different from everyone else or am I just different from YOU?<br><br>By lumping everyone into the bottom rung of maslow's hierarchy of needs, u are simply abusing the theory to suit your overly simple arguments.<br><br>The fact of the matter is, very few Singaporeans are in the lowest rung. Most of us, including YOU, live lives that are quite comfortable.<br><br>We may not be at the level of "self-actualization" but be fair... Its not like we're too poor to have friends, too poor to have a self esteem, too poor to date and too poor to have sex.<br><br>Interesting that you brought up maslow's hierarchy of needs because it is the ideal model to illustrate that happiness is a complex state of mind and varies for different pple at different stages of their lives.<br><br><span style="color: darkblue;"><br>How am I abusing the theory? Maybe you can elaborate? Why I chose to used Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory (MHNT) is simple, because you kept emphasizing the importance of family and friends, which is the 3rd level in MHNT, we need to satisfy the 1st and 2nd level before we can even fathom the 3rd level. Thus money which is directly linked to our physiological needs is like food, housing, clothing and warmth is still the most fundamental needs.<br><br></span><br><br></div></blockquote></div>

" on 12 January 2008 Â· 02:38 AM. Money which is directly linked to work is a major part of life in Singapore, without work, there won't be any life. If you consider it a "small part", maybe you should stop work and see how you can manage your daily lifestyle. Fancy calling something that takes up close to 40% of your waking time "small".<br><br>It's the norm in developed countries, but the way you classify small and unimportant is horrendous. Try stop working for 1 year and tell me how small the change is to your lifestyle.</blockquote>Work is really a small part of my life. It is true that we spend 8 hrs or more on it... But it is simply not true that just because u spend time on it, it is a big determinant of happiness.<br><br>It is really a matter of perspective.<br><br>e.g. I spend 42 hrs a week in the office. Time crawls sometimes. I spend 8 hrs on a weekend engaging in my hobby. Time flies. I spent less time on my hobby than my work. Nevertheless, my hobby contributed to my happiness to a larger extent, even though it is my job that allows me to earn money to engage in my hobby.<br><br>What's wrong with that? I never said that work is "unimportant". But work alone doesn't make u happy. It is merely an enabler.<br><br>That's why I say, the work and the stress is really a small part of it because I like all the other things that I have here: my friends, my family, all the things I like to do.<br><br>If all I had was money and no family, no friends and no passion for any hobby, I'll be miserable.<br><br>In the same way, if i had no work and no money, I'll be similarly miserable.<br><br>But that's the whole point isn't it? Its never just about work and money.<br><br><blockquote>How am I abusing the theory? Maybe you can elaborate?

U always need them and u feel affected when u do not have them in sufficient quantities.<br><br>They exist in everyone in varying degrees of priorities and when such needs are not met, the individual re-prioritizes his resources to meet those needs. They do not permanently regress down the pyramid and other factors that are "classified" as being in the higher layers are still in focus. Re-prioritized perhaps, but STILL in focus.<br><br>e.g. You are hungry. You believe that it is wrong to steal. You do not want to borrow money cos u believe that it affects friendship. You don't want to beg for food cos its embarrassing. You have money to buy food.<br><br>So u go buy food! It doesn't mean that u forget about self-esteem, morality and friendship just because u're hungry.<br><br>Now, if we flip the situation around. All things remaining unchanged, You now have NO MONEY to buy food. The next best course would be to borrow money rather than to steal food, beg or go hungry.<br><br>Friendship has been re-prioritized, but u may still care about morality and self-esteem.<br><br>Nobody lends u money? Then u consider begging or stealing... But once u have food, u may not want to continue doing that... Its bad for your image, morality and self esteem. Also, u may get caught.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Its only the very base and very dire of the lot that gets stuck in layer 1 and it is human nature to care to varying degrees about other things other than subsistence.<br><br>And that pretty much sums of pple everywhere... not just in SG or Norway, but in most developed countries where the pple are educated and there are opportunities for socio-economic advancements.<br><br>So why does it bother u so much that I am able to find happiness within my limited means?<br></div>
