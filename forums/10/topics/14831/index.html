            <div class='col-md body'>Water is a sticky issue between Singapore and Malaysia. Nobody was wrong in signing those contracts in the past, though it lacked some foresight. As they might be bogged down by any other issues and the temperaments might be different in those days between and Mslaysia and Singapore.<br><br>The save water campaign might be right but it was overplayed by certain sectors to instil fear in the people across the nation and exploited to its fullest by PUB for imposing almost 100% tax on any consumption!This has undoubtedly caused the present political backlash between Singapore and Malaysia as the later feel that the former is utilising its cheap water to make some mountain of profit.Take a look at this analogy, most sensible donors of charity fund would not part a cent if the fund is channeled to some personnal pocket!You were not donate your blood if you discover that somebody is using the donated blood to make  money!<br><br>Water is cheap but it needs expensive facilities for its treatment and distribution. Most laymen may not understand its implication and its long term cost. Most Singaporeans are willing to pay for the convenience and its reliability of constant supply and potability. Malaysia sees otherwise.<br><br>Frankly speaking, any knowledgeable Singaporean would know that Singapore could one day be self-sufficient in its water supply if it wants to do it in the near future. It would be great if one day Singapore could tell Malaysia that we would not buy any water from them anymore.<br><br>They are some innovative ways to get cheap and natural filtered water from sea water, and that could provide some endless perennial supply of water that Singapore needs, whether it is drought or otherwise, sea water is always there. May be Singapore should try out this method by digging some layers of football field size wells along those newly enclosed reservoirs like Kranji Reservoir, Tengah Reservoir,Murai Reservoir, Serimbum Reservoir,or even Lower Seletar Reservoir. The water in these reservoirs will be less salty over years and salted water will be less salty after passing through some layers of natural soils, sand. or rock!The water supply is aplenty as the sea water will never dry up. If land use is to be maximised, builing or read system may be built over those layered wells. It may be costly to build but cheaper to treat and in the long run it's cheaper than desalination plants or even cheaper than importing from Malaysia!</div>
