I am surprised that JI students should be considered parallel to the doctor. Like what Wuming said, why should the doctor be named?  Agreed that SARs is very BIG SCALE, but a doctor who fails to detect SARs is similar to a doctor who failed to detect cancer. Do we name every single doctor and put more unnecessary stress on them? I guess if the hospital decides that action will be taken, it will be taken and let it rest there then.<br><br>2.  I am quite appalled by SCDF's stance too. But again, they were not the cause of the death but the point is, do we want to wait till such problems occur before corrective steps are taken?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>About the hospital thingy, I got to ask, is tis law set because of private hospital profit making ?<br><br>First, the person involved may not want to pay for higher hospital fees. Second the person involved may not be able to pay the medical fees themselves. Wat if it is a vangabond tat suffer a car accident ? For private hospital who only cares about profit, don't u think they will reject patients, or give them poorer medical attention ? For Gov hospital, the vangabond will still be treated lke normal people. If they cannot pay, then tat is just too bad for taxpayers like us.</div>
