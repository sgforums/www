Upto 40 years old, a graduate employee should generally have saved around 200K and more. Quite tempting lump sum leh. This just a logical commonsense concern.  luckily so far, no official response that this method is practisable.  There must be at least 300K - 500K working adults aged 25-40? This does not include dependents counts.<br><br></div>
