MIW say CPF 40% to 37%, now retirement age change to 67yrs, no say in our CPF, must buy annuity, etc. wat can we do but LPPL, go out protest or so much as voice ur concern over blog.. u risk getting sue, lock for 7yrs, etc. Over there, the gov say increase school fees by 2k per year... million strike. the gov no choice but think of better way to get more $$ for school.. i can name lot more... Btw, my mate is married with child there. Given free milk powder by gov. and soon free education for his child.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Gazelle:</div><div class="quote_body">2) People in UK are monitored by millions and millions of CCTV everyday, are you saying that living in UK you have more privacy? Plus with the rising terrorist threat in UK, do you have reasons to believe that government are no monitoring each and every of your communication on email?<br><br>Why dont you try asking your mate to exchange some emails discussing how to build a bomb and set up an explosion in london tube station and see if the authority willl come knocking at their doors.<br></div></blockquote>What make u so sure that they are not doing the same in s'pore? Well to qoute u one simply eg of privacy, they dun even have identity card. [NRIC], how much more private can they get? U think they scan all the email? even google mail scan all email. ISP there dun even set up a must go thru proxy unlike here in s'pore where all out going internet traffic is monitor &amp; thru proxy. So what is so bad or wrong when they went around questioning suppected terrorist or ppl whom are trying to learn how to build bomb? What is the purpose of learning how to build a bomb? For hobby or to kill someone or just for fun? Try learning how to build a bomb in s'pore and see what trouble u getting urself into.<br><br>So what if big brother is watching? Isn't it the same everywhere? It is how we use technology that matter, not the technology. So what is wrong about putting CCTV on a dark lit area or high crime area? Isn't fight against terrorist for the benefit oh us citizen? They might put ton of CCTV, but they dun used it to invade personal privacy or for ill intend.<br><br>At least over there, they place speed cam on road with ample warning sign telling u that there is speed cam ahead so that driver will slow down when near. They even paint their speed cam bright yellow so that driver can see them from far. They install speed cam to slow down driver so as to prevent accident, rather then hiding them with the intention to add income to the gov.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Gazelle:</div><div class="quote_body">3) Better health care for the poor and old? Could you please quantified that.<br><br>Why didnt you mentioned about the high interest rate, high petrol prices, high tax, expensive public transport, and the fcuk type weather in UK?<br><br></div></blockquote>Free health care for all. Here, medisave empty = RIP. High interest rate is subjective to a country economy. High petrol price but cheap car. Good for environment. Make u wanna use the public transport. Efficient public transport which isn't really that expensive. U are pay higher salary, so higher cost of living, it break even. Haha lastly the weather, unless u are god and move UK to anywhere u want on earth... then dun complain. Not all ppl hate the weather there. U hate the weather there... then dun go loh.<br><br>UK isnt a perfect country to live in, but there is lot that we s'pore can learn from them.

Ppl there are in for a tough time if they carry on their current rate of spending and saving. Over there, the gov are trying to fix problem, coz the citzen aint behaving well. Here, ppl are behaving too well, working and slogging, but is been taken advantage of by the gov.<br><br>If the debt issue worsen in uk, it is the people there whom are to be blame. Where else here, our gov just isn't giving what its ppl deserve. Both country are not good nor perfect with room for improvement. It isn't that hard to survive in UK. In fact u can leech on the system. But the point is not how good or bad the system is. It is the intent of the system. They did it with welfare of the poor and old in mind. Here, the system is very much lacking when it come to the low income and old.</div>
