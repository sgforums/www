And assuming they set aside 20% = near $500 (This is already a lot of money) a month for the repayment of bank loans. This requires 48 months = 4 years. Male students graduate at the age of 25... So they will be in debt till at least 29 years old! Note: 3k a month is for a good economy. Labour mobility was not taken into account.<br>4) Fact: Zero interest ONLY during the 4 yrs in uni. Interest starts as soon as graduation.</div>
