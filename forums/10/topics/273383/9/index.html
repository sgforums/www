However, I feel, personally as an Indian myself, alienated from the community. First of all, the prime minister did his speech in three languages. Is it not that Tamil is part of the 4 official languages of Singapore? From reliable sources, I gather that President Nathan learns mandrain on top of knowing the three other official languages. In that case, why is it that the PM cannot give the speech in tamil?<br>Then, there the Malay and Chinese special programmes. And the suggestion of a Bahasa Indonesia. How come there is no Tamil special programme?
