              </span></p><h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #f5a216;">ISLAMIC HELL-TORTURE CHAMBER FOR UNBELIEVERS</span></span></h2>
              <p><span style="color: red; font-size: x-large;">I</span> n this article I shall describe the Islamic Hell or Jahannum which was an imagination of Prophet Mohammed used primarily for two reasons:<strong></strong></p>
              <strong><span style="color: red;"><ol>
              <li>To have a torture chamber for all the kafirs (unbelievers and people of other religions)</li>
              <li>To terrorize people into accepting Islam.</li>
              </ol></span></strong>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The purpose of Hell in Islam is <strong>not to </strong>punish the Muslim wrong-doers. Because, for them Mohammed will recommend paradise, beautiful virgins and young boys on the Day of Judgment. His recommendation is final and Allah cannot deny it. It is available to all murderers, rapists, arsonists, cheats, thugs, pickpockets and pimps provided they are following Islam. <strong>On the contrary, a flaming Hell is reserved only for all Hindus, Sikhs, Jews and Christians, no matter how pious and God-fearing they may have been.</strong></p>
              <p>This article is divided in two sections. The <strong>first section</strong> deals with the brutal instructions Prophet Mohammed gives to his followers about Kafirs and how to torture, maim and murder them ruthlessly.</p>
              <p>The <strong>second section</strong> explains the various procedures devised by Prophet Mohammed's sick imagination for torturing people of other religions in Hell.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #a52a2a;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Instructions to Muslims about Unbelievers</span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: green;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Koran 9:29</span></strong></span><br><span style="color: red;"><em>Fight those who do not profess the true faith (Islam) till they pay the jiziya (poll tax) with the hand of humility.</em></span></p>
              <p><strong>So here Prophet Mohammed is instructing a true Muslim to fight people of other religions until the unbelievers debase themselves and pay tax for their existence. So the greatness of Islam is revealed only when follwers of other religions are humiliated.</strong></p>
              <strong></strong>
              <p><span style="color: green;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Koran 8:12 </span></strong></span><br><span style="color: red;"><em>Remember Thy Lord inspired the angels (with the message): "I am with you: give firmness to the believers, I will instill terror into the hearts of the unbelievers, Smite ye above their necks and smite all their finger tips of them."</em></span></p>
              <p><strong>Here Mohammed is giving step by step instruction on how to torture and kill Kafirs if they don't follow Islam.</strong></p>
              <strong></strong>
              <p><span style="color: green;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Koran 9:5 </span></strong></span><br><span style="color: red;"><em>"Then, when the sacred months have passed, slay the idolators wherever ye find them, and take them (captive), and besiege them and prepare for them each ambush. But if they repent and establish worship and pay the poor-due, then leave their way free. Lo! Allah is Forgiving, Merciful."</em></span></p>
              <p><strong>In the above verse Prophet Mohammed is clearly instructing his followers to kill the idolators in any brutal way possible until the idolators submit themselves to Islam. Allah is indeed merciful !!</strong></p>
              <strong></strong>
              <p><span style="color: green;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Koran 9:73 </span></strong></span><br><span style="color: red;"><em>Prophet, make war on the unbelievers and the hypocrites and deal rigorously with them. Hell shall be their Home: an evil fate.</em></span></p>
              <p><strong>Here Mohammed is trying to justify his brutal acts. He conveniently claims divine justification for the expression of his hatred by saying Allah himself revealed to him personally that people of other religions are evil and belong in Hell. Therefore, according to Mohammed any barbaric act against the unbelievers is completely justified.</strong></p>
              <strong></strong>
              <p><span style="color: green;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Koran 4:144 </span></strong></span><br><span style="color: red;"><em>Believers, do not choose the unbelievers rather than the faithful as your friends. Would you give Allah a clear proof against yourselves ?</em></span></p>
              <p><strong>This verse clearly states that a Muslim can only befreind a Muslim. Mohammed in order to ensure that his followers will not befriend and get influenced by people of other religions, revealed this verse. This verse illustrates that if a Muslim befriends a Non-Muslim than the wrath of Allah will be on him. Therefore in Islam, people of other religions should be treated with contempt,disrespect and cruelty.</strong></p>
              <strong></strong>
              <p><span style="color: green;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Koran 47:4 </span></strong></span><br><span style="color: red;"><em>When you meet the unbelievers in the Jihad strike off their heads and, when you have laid them low, bind your captives firmly. Then grant them their freedom or take ransom from them, until War shall lay down her burdens.</em></span></p>
              <p><strong>In the above verse, Mohammed is giving detailed instruction about how to maim and torture unbelievers in Jihad. And finally when the Muslims are satisfied enough after torturing and maiming the unbelievers, they should proceed to demand ransom for the captives. All for the sake for all-merciful Allah !!</strong></p>
              <strong></strong>
              <p><span style="color: green;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Koran 5:33-34 </span></strong></span><br><span style="color: red;"><em>The only reward of those who make war upon Allah and His messenger and strive after corruption in the land will be that they will be killed or crucified, or have their hands and feet and alternate sides cut off, or will be expelled out of the land. Such will be their degradation in the world, and in the Hereafter theirs will be an awful doom; Save those who repent before ye overpower them. For know that Allah is Forgiving, merciful.</em></span></p>
              <p><strong>In this verse, Mohammed devises another recipe for torturing unbelievers. This particular recipe involves chopping off alternate limbs and expelling the Kafirs (people following other religions) out of the land.</strong></p>
              <strong></strong><br><br>
              <p><span style="color: #a52a2a;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Instructions to Muslims regarding Christians and Jews</span></strong></span></p>
              <p><strong>Prophet Mohammed has reserved special position for certain sects of Unbelievers in his so called "Holy Book" Koran. Those unbelievers are none other than followers of Christianity and Judaism. I have selected few verses from Koran to display what Muslims are taught and instructed as far as treating Christians and Jews is concerned.</strong></p>
              <strong></strong>
              <p><span style="color: green;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Koran 5:51</span></strong></span><br><span style="color: red;"><em>Believers, take neither Jews nor Christians for your friends. They are friends with one another. Whoever of you seeks their friendship shall become one of their number. Allah does not guide the wrong-doers.</em></span></p>
              <p><strong>In this verse Prophet Mohammed is clearly instructing his followers never to befriend a Christian or a Jew. Because if they take a Christian or a Jew as a friend, they will commit a wrong deed and Allah's wrath will be on them.</strong></p>
              <strong></strong>
              <p><span style="color: green;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Koran 5:57 </span></strong></span><br><span style="color: red;"><em>Believers, do not seek the friendship of the infidels and those who were given the Book before you, who have made your religion a jest and a pasttime...</em></span></p>
              <p><strong>Here "those who were given the Book before you" refers to Christians and Jews. Once again Mohammed is warning Muslims of all time never to befriend a Christian or a Jew.</strong></p>
              <strong></strong>
              <p><span style="color: green;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Koran 5:64 </span></strong></span><br><span style="color: red;"><em>The Jews say: 'God's hand is chained.' May their own hands be chained! May they be cursed for what they say!...</em></span></p>
              <p><strong>In the above verse Prophet Mohammed is showing his deep respect for the Jews.</strong></p>
              <strong></strong>
              <p><span style="color: green;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Koran 9:29 </span></strong></span><br><span style="color: red;"><em>Fight those who believe not in Allah nor the Last day, nor hold the forbidden which hath been forbidden by Allah and his messenger, nor acknowledge the Religion of Truth from among the People of the Book, until they pay the Jiziyah with willing submission. And feel themselves subdued.</em></span></p>
              <p><strong>Here 'People of the Book' refers to Christians and Jews. The 'Religion Of Truth' refers to Islam. So in the above verse Prophet Mohammed is instructing Muslims to fight and torture Christians and Jews (who do not believe in Islamic version of God) until they pay tax to Muslims for their existence. Muslims are also strictly instructed to make the Christians and Jews feel 'subdued'. Allah is truly benign !!!</strong></p>
              <strong></strong>
              <p><span style="color: green;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Koran 9:30 </span></strong></span><br><span style="color: red;"><em>The Jews call 'Uzayr-a son of God', and the Christinas call 'Christ the Son Of God'. That is a saying from their mouth; (In this) they but intimate what the unbelievers of old used to say. Allah's curse be on them: how they are decluded away from the Truth.</em></span></p>
              <p><strong>Here Prophet Mohammed is wishing that Allah's curse be on Jews and Christians. And what did the Christians and Jews do for such special favour from Allah ? All they did is that out of respect and love, they called their Prophets 'son of God'.</strong></p>
              <strong></strong><br><br>
              <p><span style="color: #a52a2a;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Islamic Hell and Unbelievers</span></strong></span></p>
              <p><strong>Now we will enter the Islamic Hell brought into existence by Mohammed's hallucination and weird imagination.</strong></p>
              <strong></strong>
              <p><span style="color: green;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Koran 98:1-8 </span></strong></span><br><span style="color: red;"><em>The unbelievers among the People of the Book and the pagans shall burn for ever in the fire of Hell. They are the vilest of all creatures.</em></span></p>
              <p><strong>Here "People of The Book" refers to Christians and Jews. So according to Prophet Mohammed, Christians, Jews and pagans are the vilest of all creatures in the world. Islam in deed holds a high respect for people of other religions !!</strong></p>
              <strong></strong>
              <p><span style="color: green;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Koran 22:19-22:23 </span></strong></span><br><span style="color: red;"><em>Garments of fire have been prepared for the unbelievers. Sclading water shall be poured upon their heads, melting their skins and that which is in their bellies. They shall be lashed rods of iron. Whenever, in their anguish, they try to escape from Hell, back they shall be dragged, and will be told: 'Taste the torment of the Conflagration!'</em></span></p>
              <p><strong>Here Mohammed has imagined vividly how people of other religions will be punished in Hell. By his sick and disgusting imagination, he is trying to make sure that people of other religions convert to Islam out of sheer terror of Hell. And if this terror doesn't work, then the Muslims are always instructed to convert unbelievers to Islam brutally by force in Jihad.</strong></p>
              <strong></strong>
              <p><span style="color: green;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Koran 18:28-30 </span></strong></span><br><span style="color: red;"><em>For the wrongdoers We have prepared a fire which will encompass them like the walls of a pavilion. When they cry out for help they shall be showered with water as hot as molten brass, which will scald their faces. Evil shall be their drink, dismal their resting-place.</em></span></p>
              <p><strong>Who are the "wrong-doers" here ? None other than the people who DO NOT follow Islam. So Prophet Mohammed here continues with his hallucination and gives the description of Islamic Hell in the form of a revelation.</strong></p>
              <strong></strong>
              <p><span style="color: green;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Koran 40:67-40:73 </span></strong></span><br><span style="color: red;"><em>Do you not see how those who dispute the revelation of God turn away from the right path ? Those who have denied the Book and the message We sent through Our apostles shall realize the truth hereafter: when, with chains and shackles round their necks, they shall be dragged through scalding water and then burnt in the fire of Hell.</em></span></p>
              <p><strong>Prophet Mohammed here explains what will happen to those people who choose NOT to follow his revelation "Quran"- a manual of plunder, rape and murder. So for people of other religions following scriptures other than Quran, Allah has pre-planned punishment. First they shall be dragged through scalding water with chains around their necks and then they will be burnt in the fire of Hell. Allah is truly merciful !!</strong></p>
              <strong></strong>
              <p><span style="color: green;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Koran 43:74 </span></strong></span><br><span style="color: red;"><em>..The unbelievers shall endure forever the torment of Hell. The punishment will never be lightened, and they shall be speechless with despair. We do not wrong, themselves.</em></span></p>
              <p><strong>Mohammed was not satisfied by just having burnt the unbelievers once in Hell. So here he is saying that the punishment is never-ending and people following other religions will be burnt in Hell forever.</strong></p>
              <strong></strong>
              <p><span style="color: green;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Koran 55:41-52 </span></strong></span><br><span style="color: red;"><em>..That is the Hell which the unbelievers deny. They shall wander between fire and water fiercely seething. Which of your Lord's blessing would you deny ?</em></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: green;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Koran 76:1-5 </span></strong></span><br><span style="color: red;"><em>For the unbelievers We have prepared chains and fetters and a blazing Fire...</em></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: green;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Koran 73:12 </span></strong></span><br><span style="color: red;"><em>We have in store for the unbelievers heavy fetters and a blazing fire, choking food and harrowing torment: on the day when the earth shall quiver with all its mountains, and the mountains crumble into heaps of shifting sand.</em></span></p>
              <p><strong>Once again, in the above verses, Mohammed is emphasizing that heavy fetters, choking food and hell fire are in store for the unbelievers while the Muslims enjoy the beautiful virgins and young boys in Islamic Paradise.</strong></p>
              <strong></strong>
              <p><span style="color: green;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Koran 77:20-77:50 </span></strong></span><br><span style="color: red;"><em>Woe on that day to the disbelievers! Begone to the Hell which you deny! Depart into the shadow that will rise high in three columns, giving neither shade nor shelter from the flames, and throwing up sparks as huge as towers, as bright as yellow camels...Eat and enjoy yourselves awhile. You are wicked men..."</em></span></p>
              <p><strong>In the above verse, Prophet Mohammed is making sure that the people of other religions do not get any shade or shelter when they are burnt up in the Islamic Hell. Allah is also revealing to him that all people other than Muslims are basically wicked in nature.</strong></p>
              <strong></strong>
              <p><span style="color: green;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Koran 8:73 </span></strong></span><br><span style="color: red;"><em>The unbelievers give aid and comfort to each other. If you fail to do likewise, there will be disorder in the land and great corruption.</em></span></p>
              <p><strong>The Great Mohammed divided the Arabian society in two tight compartments: Momins and Kafirs. The word momin means believer in Mohammed and Allah. In contrast a kafir is a non-believer. The momins did not have to be better men than the Kafirs in terms of character or consciousness. Momins had only to recite the Kalima (incantation)- "there is no God but Allah and Mohammed is his Prophet." By doing that the 'momins' become qualified to kill as many kafirs as they could or pleased, looting and burning their belongings and enslaving their women and children in the process. In the above verse, Prophet Mohammed once again is telling his followers to help each other in banning up against unbelievers (people of other religions)</strong></p>
              <strong></strong>
              <p><span style="color: green;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Koran 21:96-21:101 </span></strong></span><br><span style="color: red;"><em>..The unbelievers shall stare in amazement, crying: 'Woe to us! Of this we have been heedless. We have done wrong.' You and your idols shall be the fuel of Hell; therein you sall all go down.</em></span></p>
              <p><strong>This verse is another instance which displays the deep respect Islam shows towards other religions. Here Prophet Mohammed is stating that people who choose to represent God by idols will be burnt in hell along with their idols. Islam is truly compassionate towards other religions !!</strong></p>
              <strong></strong>
              <p><span style="color: green;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Koran 33:7-12 </span></strong></span><br><span style="color: red;"><em>...But for the unbelievers He has prepared a woeful punishment...</em></span></p>
              <p><strong>Here, we find the same old blabbering by Mohammed once again regarding how unbelievers will be punished.</strong></p>
              <strong></strong>
              <p><span style="color: green;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Koran 44:40-49 </span></strong></span><br><span style="color: red;"><em>..The fruit of the Zaqqum tree shall be the unbelievers's fruit. Like dregs of oil, like scalding water, it shall simmer in his belly. A voice will cry: 'Seize him and drag him into the depths of Hell. Then pour out scalding water over his head, saying: "Taste this, illustrious and honourable man! This is the punishment which you have doubted."</em></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: green;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Koran 52:1-52:15 </span></strong></span><br><span style="color: red;"><em>..On that day they shall be sternly thrown into the fire of Hell, and a voice will say to them: 'This is the Fire which you denied...Burn in its flames. It is the same whether or not you show forbearance. You shall be rewarded according to your deeds.'</em></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: green;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Koran 31-37 </span></strong></span><br><span style="color: red;"><em>And burn ye him in the blazing fire. Further, make him march in a chain, whereof the length is seventy cubits. This was he that would not believe in allah Most high amd would not encourage the feeding of the indignant. So no friend hath he here this day. Nor hath he any food except the corruption from the washing of wounds.</em></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: green;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Koran 56:52-56 </span></strong></span><br><span style="color: red;"><em>Ye shall surely taste of the tree Zaqqum. Then will ye fill your insides therwith, and drink boiling water on top of it. Indeed ye shall drink like diseased camels raging with thirst. Such will be their entertainment on the day of Requital!</em></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: green;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Koran 69:30-37 </span></strong></span><br><span style="color: red;"><em>We shall say: 'Lay hold of him and bind him. Burn him in the fie of Hell, then fasten him with a chain seventy cubits long. For he did not believe Allah the tremendous, and urged not on the feeding of the wretched. Today he shall be friendless here; filth shall be his food, the filth which sinners eat...</em></span></p>
              <p><strong>The above five verses contain detail description of various kinds of punishments people of other religions will undergo in Islamic Hell. They display the true respect Prophet Mohammed had for people who were not following Islam. And through these verses, Koran (the manual for plunder, rape and murder)which is treated as a timeless scripture by Muslims, teaches how lowly people of other religions should be treated by Muslims regardless of time or space.</strong></p>
              <strong></strong>
              <p><span style="color: green;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Koran 2:39 </span></strong></span><br><span style="color: red;"><em>Those who reject faith shall be the companions of the Fire.</em></span></p>

              <p><strong>The summary of the above six verses is that a person follwing any religion other than Islam, is automatically assigned to Hell. His good thoughts, good actions or peity are of no value until and unless he follows Islam. So if in this life, a person does not follow Islam and does not believe in Islamic scripture, Allah will store Hell-Fire, Hot water, Molten brass, thunderbolts and other humiliating punishments in the life hereafter for him.</strong></p>

              <h2><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #f5a216;">ISLAMIC HELL-TORTURE CHAMBER FOR UNBELIEVERS</span></span></span></h2>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-large; color: #ff0000;">I</span> n this article I shall describe the Islamic Hell or Jahannum which was an imagination of Prophet Mohammed used primarily for two reasons:</p>
              <ol>
              <li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">To have a torture chamber for all the kafirs (unbelievers and people of other religions)</span></strong></li>
              <li>To terrorize people into accepting Islam.</li>
              </ol>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The purpose of Hell in Islam is <strong>not to </strong>punish the Muslim wrong-doers. Because, for them Mohammed will recommend paradise, beautiful virgins and young boys on the Day of Judgment. His recommendation is final and Allah cannot deny it. It is available to all murderers, rapists, arsonists, cheats, thugs, pickpockets and pimps provided they are following Islam. <strong>On the contrary, a flaming Hell is reserved only for all Hindus, Sikhs, Jews and Christians, no matter how pious and God-fearing they may have been.</strong></p>
              <p>This article is divided in two sections. The <strong>first section</strong> deals with the brutal instructions Prophet Mohammed gives to his followers about Kafirs and how to torture, maim and murder them ruthlessly.</p>
              <p>The <strong>second section</strong> explains the various procedures devised by Prophet Mohammed's sick imagination for torturing people of other religions in Hell.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #a52a2a;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Instructions to Muslims about Unbelievers</span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Koran 9:29</span></strong></span><br><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>Fight those who do not profess the true faith (Islam) till they pay the jiziya (poll tax) with the hand of humility.</em></span></p>
              <p><strong>So here Prophet Mohammed is instructing a true Muslim to fight people of other religions until the unbelievers debase themselves and pay tax for their existence. So the greatness of Islam is revealed only when follwers of other religions are humiliated.</strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Koran 8:12 </span></strong></span><br><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>Remember Thy Lord inspired the angels (with the message): "I am with you: give firmness to the believers, I will instill terror into the hearts of the unbelievers, Smite ye above their necks and smite all their finger tips of them."</em></span></p>
              <p><strong>Here Mohammed is giving step by step instruction on how to torture and kill Kafirs if they don't follow Islam.</strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Koran 9:5 </span></strong></span><br><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>"Then, when the sacred months have passed, slay the idolators wherever ye find them, and take them (captive), and besiege them and prepare for them each ambush. But if they repent and establish worship and pay the poor-due, then leave their way free. Lo! Allah is Forgiving, Merciful."</em></span></p>
              <p><strong>In the above verse Prophet Mohammed is clearly instructing his followers to kill the idolators in any brutal way possible until the idolators submit themselves to Islam. Allah is indeed merciful !!</strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Koran 9:73 </span></strong></span><br><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>Prophet, make war on the unbelievers and the hypocrites and deal rigorously with them. Hell shall be their Home: an evil fate.</em></span></p>
              <p><strong>Here Mohammed is trying to justify his brutal acts. He conveniently claims divine justification for the expression of his hatred by saying Allah himself revealed to him personally that people of other religions are evil and belong in Hell. Therefore, according to Mohammed any barbaric act against the unbelievers is completely justified.</strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Koran 4:144 </span></strong></span><br><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>Believers, do not choose the unbelievers rather than the faithful as your friends. Would you give Allah a clear proof against yourselves ?</em></span></p>
              <p><strong>This verse clearly states that a Muslim can only befreind a Muslim. Mohammed in order to ensure that his followers will not befriend and get influenced by people of other religions, revealed this verse. This verse illustrates that if a Muslim befriends a Non-Muslim than the wrath of Allah will be on him. Therefore in Islam, people of other religions should be treated with contempt,disrespect and cruelty.</strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Koran 47:4 </span></strong></span><br><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>When you meet the unbelievers in the Jihad strike off their heads and, when you have laid them low, bind your captives firmly. Then grant them their freedom or take ransom from them, until War shall lay down her burdens.</em></span></p>
              <p><strong>In the above verse, Mohammed is giving detailed instruction about how to maim and torture unbelievers in Jihad. And finally when the Muslims are satisfied enough after torturing and maiming the unbelievers, they should proceed to demand ransom for the captives. All for the sake for all-merciful Allah !!</strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Koran 5:33-34 </span></strong></span><br><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>The only reward of those who make war upon Allah and His messenger and strive after corruption in the land will be that they will be killed or crucified, or have their hands and feet and alternate sides cut off, or will be expelled out of the land. Such will be their degradation in the world, and in the Hereafter theirs will be an awful doom; Save those who repent before ye overpower them. For know that Allah is Forgiving, merciful.</em></span></p>
              <p><strong>In this verse, Mohammed devises another recipe for torturing unbelievers. This particular recipe involves chopping off alternate limbs and expelling the Kafirs (people following other religions) out of the land.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #a52a2a;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Instructions to Muslims regarding Christians and Jews</span></strong></span></p>
              <p><strong>Prophet Mohammed has reserved special position for certain sects of Unbelievers in his so called "Holy Book" Koran. Those unbelievers are none other than followers of Christianity and Judaism. I have selected few verses from Koran to display what Muslims are taught and instructed as far as treating Christians and Jews is concerned.</strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Koran 5:51</span></strong></span><br><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>Believers, take neither Jews nor Christians for your friends. They are friends with one another. Whoever of you seeks their friendship shall become one of their number. Allah does not guide the wrong-doers.</em></span></p>
              <p><strong>In this verse Prophet Mohammed is clearly instructing his followers never to befriend a Christian or a Jew. Because if they take a Christian or a Jew as a friend, they will commit a wrong deed and Allah's wrath will be on them.</strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Koran 5:57 </span></strong></span><br><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>Believers, do not seek the friendship of the infidels and those who were given the Book before you, who have made your religion a jest and a pasttime...</em></span></p>
              <p><strong>Here "those who were given the Book before you" refers to Christians and Jews. Once again Mohammed is warning Muslims of all time never to befriend a Christian or a Jew.</strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Koran 5:64 </span></strong></span><br><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>The Jews say: 'God's hand is chained.' May their own hands be chained! May they be cursed for what they say!...</em></span></p>
              <p><strong>In the above verse Prophet Mohammed is showing his deep respect for the Jews.</strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Koran 9:29 </span></strong></span><br><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>Fight those who believe not in Allah nor the Last day, nor hold the forbidden which hath been forbidden by Allah and his messenger, nor acknowledge the Religion of Truth from among the People of the Book, until they pay the Jiziyah with willing submission. And feel themselves subdued.</em></span></p>
              <p><strong>Here 'People of the Book' refers to Christians and Jews. The 'Religion Of Truth' refers to Islam. So in the above verse Prophet Mohammed is instructing Muslims to fight and torture Christians and Jews (who do not believe in Islamic version of God) until they pay tax to Muslims for their existence. Muslims are also strictly instructed to make the Christians and Jews feel 'subdued'. Allah is truly benign !!!</strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Koran 9:30 </span></strong></span><br><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>The Jews call 'Uzayr-a son of God', and the Christinas call 'Christ the Son Of God'. That is a saying from their mouth; (In this) they but intimate what the unbelievers of old used to say. Allah's curse be on them: how they are decluded away from the Truth.</em></span></p>
              <p><strong>Here Prophet Mohammed is wishing that Allah's curse be on Jews and Christians. And what did the Christians and Jews do for such special favour from Allah ? All they did is that out of respect and love, they called their Prophets 'son of God'.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #a52a2a;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Islamic Hell and Unbelievers</span></strong></span></p>
              <p><strong>Now we will enter the Islamic Hell brought into existence by Mohammed's hallucination and weird imagination.</strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Koran 98:1-8 </span></strong></span><br><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>The unbelievers among the People of the Book and the pagans shall burn for ever in the fire of Hell. They are the vilest of all creatures.</em></span></p>
              <p><strong>Here "People of The Book" refers to Christians and Jews. So according to Prophet Mohammed, Christians, Jews and pagans are the vilest of all creatures in the world. Islam in deed holds a high respect for people of other religions !!</strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Koran 22:19-22:23 </span></strong></span><br><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>Garments of fire have been prepared for the unbelievers. Sclading water shall be poured upon their heads, melting their skins and that which is in their bellies. They shall be lashed rods of iron. Whenever, in their anguish, they try to escape from Hell, back they shall be dragged, and will be told: 'Taste the torment of the Conflagration!'</em></span></p>
              <p><strong>Here Mohammed has imagined vividly how people of other religions will be punished in Hell. By his sick and disgusting imagination, he is trying to make sure that people of other religions convert to Islam out of sheer terror of Hell. And if this terror doesn't work, then the Muslims are always instructed to convert unbelievers to Islam brutally by force in Jihad.</strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Koran 18:28-30 </span></strong></span><br><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>For the wrongdoers We have prepared a fire which will encompass them like the walls of a pavilion. When they cry out for help they shall be showered with water as hot as molten brass, which will scald their faces. Evil shall be their drink, dismal their resting-place.</em></span></p>
              <p><strong>Who are the "wrong-doers" here ? None other than the people who DO NOT follow Islam. So Prophet Mohammed here continues with his hallucination and gives the description of Islamic Hell in the form of a revelation.</strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Koran 40:67-40:73 </span></strong></span><br><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>Do you not see how those who dispute the revelation of God turn away from the right path ? Those who have denied the Book and the message We sent through Our apostles shall realize the truth hereafter: when, with chains and shackles round their necks, they shall be dragged through scalding water and then burnt in the fire of Hell.</em></span></p>
              <p><strong>Prophet Mohammed here explains what will happen to those people who choose NOT to follow his revelation "Quran"- a manual of plunder, rape and murder. So for people of other religions following scriptures other than Quran, Allah has pre-planned punishment. First they shall be dragged through scalding water with chains around their necks and then they will be burnt in the fire of Hell. Allah is truly merciful !!</strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Koran 43:74 </span></strong></span><br><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>..The unbelievers shall endure forever the torment of Hell. The punishment will never be lightened, and they shall be speechless with despair. We do not wrong, themselves.</em></span></p>
              <p><strong>Mohammed was not satisfied by just having burnt the unbelievers once in Hell. So here he is saying that the punishment is never-ending and people following other religions will be burnt in Hell forever.</strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Koran 55:41-52 </span></strong></span><br><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>..That is the Hell which the unbelievers deny. They shall wander between fire and water fiercely seething. Which of your Lord's blessing would you deny ?</em></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Koran 76:1-5 </span></strong></span><br><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>For the unbelievers We have prepared chains and fetters and a blazing Fire...</em></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Koran 73:12 </span></strong></span><br><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>We have in store for the unbelievers heavy fetters and a blazing fire, choking food and harrowing torment: on the day when the earth shall quiver with all its mountains, and the mountains crumble into heaps of shifting sand.</em></span></p>
              <p><strong>Once again, in the above verses, Mohammed is emphasizing that heavy fetters, choking food and hell fire are in store for the unbelievers while the Muslims enjoy the beautiful virgins and young boys in Islamic Paradise.</strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Koran 77:20-77:50 </span></strong></span><br><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>Woe on that day to the disbelievers! Begone to the Hell which you deny! Depart into the shadow that will rise high in three columns, giving neither shade nor shelter from the flames, and throwing up sparks as huge as towers, as bright as yellow camels...Eat and enjoy yourselves awhile. You are wicked men..."</em></span></p>
              <p><strong>In the above verse, Prophet Mohammed is making sure that the people of other religions do not get any shade or shelter when they are burnt up in the Islamic Hell. Allah is also revealing to him that all people other than Muslims are basically wicked in nature.</strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Koran 8:73 </span></strong></span><br><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>The unbelievers give aid and comfort to each other. If you fail to do likewise, there will be disorder in the land and great corruption.</em></span></p>
              <p><strong>The Great Mohammed divided the Arabian society in two tight compartments: Momins and Kafirs. The word momin means believer in Mohammed and Allah. In contrast a kafir is a non-believer. The momins did not have to be better men than the Kafirs in terms of character or consciousness. Momins had only to recite the Kalima (incantation)- "there is no God but Allah and Mohammed is his Prophet." By doing that the 'momins' become qualified to kill as many kafirs as they could or pleased, looting and burning their belongings and enslaving their women and children in the process. In the above verse, Prophet Mohammed once again is telling his followers to help each other in banning up against unbelievers (people of other religions)</strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Koran 21:96-21:101 </span></strong></span><br><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>..The unbelievers shall stare in amazement, crying: 'Woe to us! Of this we have been heedless. We have done wrong.' You and your idols shall be the fuel of Hell; therein you sall all go down.</em></span></p>
              <p><strong>This verse is another instance which displays the deep respect Islam shows towards other religions. Here Prophet Mohammed is stating that people who choose to represent God by idols will be burnt in hell along with their idols. Islam is truly compassionate towards other religions !!</strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Koran 33:7-12 </span></strong></span><br><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>...But for the unbelievers He has prepared a woeful punishment...</em></span></p>
              <p><strong>Here, we find the same old blabbering by Mohammed once again regarding how unbelievers will be punished.</strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Koran 44:40-49 </span></strong></span><br><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>..The fruit of the Zaqqum tree shall be the unbelievers's fruit. Like dregs of oil, like scalding water, it shall simmer in his belly. A voice will cry: 'Seize him and drag him into the depths of Hell. Then pour out scalding water over his head, saying: "Taste this, illustrious and honourable man! This is the punishment which you have doubted."</em></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Koran 52:1-52:15 </span></strong></span><br><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>..On that day they shall be sternly thrown into the fire of Hell, and a voice will say to them: 'This is the Fire which you denied...Burn in its flames. It is the same whether or not you show forbearance. You shall be rewarded according to your deeds.'</em></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Koran 31-37 </span></strong></span><br><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>And burn ye him in the blazing fire. Further, make him march in a chain, whereof the length is seventy cubits. This was he that would not believe in allah Most high amd would not encourage the feeding of the indignant. So no friend hath he here this day. Nor hath he any food except the corruption from the washing of wounds.</em></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Koran 56:52-56 </span></strong></span><br><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>Ye shall surely taste of the tree Zaqqum. Then will ye fill your insides therwith, and drink boiling water on top of it. Indeed ye shall drink like diseased camels raging with thirst. Such will be their entertainment on the day of Requital!</em></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Koran 69:30-37 </span></strong></span><br><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>We shall say: 'Lay hold of him and bind him. Burn him in the fie of Hell, then fasten him with a chain seventy cubits long. For he did not believe Allah the tremendous, and urged not on the feeding of the wretched. Today he shall be friendless here; filth shall be his food, the filth which sinners eat...</em></span></p>
              <p><strong>The above five verses contain detail description of various kinds of punishments people of other religions will undergo in Islamic Hell. They display the true respect Prophet Mohammed had for people who were not following Islam. And through these verses, Koran (the manual for plunder, rape and murder)which is treated as a timeless scripture by Muslims, teaches how lowly people of other religions should be treated by Muslims regardless of time or space.</strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Koran 2:39 </span></strong></span><br><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>Those who reject faith shall be the companions of the Fire.</em></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Koran 2:89-90 </span></strong></span><br><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>The curse of Allah is on the unbelievers... humiliating is the punishment.</em></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Koran 13:13 </span></strong></span><br><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>..He hurls his thunderbolts at whom he pleases Yet the unbelievers wrangle about Allah..</em></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Koran 58:5 </span></strong></span><br><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>Those who resist Allah and his messenger will be humbled to dust.</em></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Koran 70:15-16 </span></strong></span><br><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>The fire of Hell will pluck out his being right to the skull..</em></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Koran 5:10 </span></strong></span><br><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>As for those who disbelieve and deny Our revelations, they are the heirs of Hell.</em></span></p>
              <p><strong>The summary of the above six verses is that a person follwing any religion other than Islam, is automatically assigned to Hell. His good thoughts, good actions or peity are of no value until and unless he follows Islam. So if in this life, a person does not follow Islam and does not believe in Islamic scripture, Allah will store Hell-Fire, Hot water, Molten brass, thunderbolts and other humiliating punishments in the life hereafter for him.</strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Koran 70:39 </span></strong></span><br><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>We have created the unbelievers out of base matters.</em></span></p>
              <p><strong>So here Prophet Mohammed claims that all the people of other religions are basically useless and evil because they are made up of base matters. But the same people become Allah's favourite and become capable of earning Houris and young boys when they convert to Islam.</strong></p>

                          was an imagination of Prophet Mohammed used primarily for two
                          reasons:</p>
              <ol>
              <li><strong><span style="color: red;">To have a torture chamber for
                          all the kafirs (unbelievers and people of other
                          religions)</span></strong></li>
              <li>To terrorize people into accepting Islam.</li>
              </ol>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The purpose of Hell in Islam is <strong>not
                          to </strong>punish the Muslim wrong-doers. Because, for them
                          Mohammed will recommend paradise, beautiful virgins and young boys
                          on the Day of Judgment. His recommendation is final and Allah
                          cannot deny it. It is available to all murderers, rapists,
                          arsonists, cheats, thugs, pickpockets and pimps provided they are
                          following Islam. <strong>On the contrary, a flaming Hell is
                          reserved only for all Hindus, Sikhs, Jews and Christians, no matter
                          how pious and God-fearing they may have been.</strong></p>
              <p>This article is divided in two sections. The <strong>first
                          section</strong> deals with the brutal instructions Prophet
                          Mohammed gives to his followers about Kafirs and how to torture,
                          maim and murder them ruthlessly.</p>
              <p>The <strong>second section</strong> explains the
                          various procedures devised by Prophet Mohammed's sick imagination
                          for torturing people of other religions in Hell.</p>

              <p><strong>Here Mohammed is trying to justify his brutal acts. He
                          conveniently claims divine justification for the expression of his

                          people of other religions are evil and belong in Hell. Therefore,
                          according to Mohammed any barbaric act against the unbelievers is

              <p><strong>This verse clearly states that a Muslim can only

                          revealed this verse. This verse illustrates that if a Muslim

                          Therefore in Islam, people of other religions should be treated

              <p><strong>Prophet Mohammed has reserved special position for
                          certain sects of Unbelievers in his so called "Holy Book" Koran.
                          Those unbelievers are none other than followers of Christianity and
                          Judaism. I have selected few verses from Koran to display what
                          Muslims are taught and instructed as far as treating Christians and

                          chains around their necks and then they will be burnt in the fire
                          of Hell. Allah is truly merciful !!</strong></p>

              <p><strong>The Great Mohammed divided the Arabian society in two
                          tight compartments: Momins and Kafirs. The word momin means
                          believer in Mohammed and Allah. In contrast a kafir is a
                          non-believer. The momins did not have to be better men than the
                          Kafirs in terms of character or consciousness. Momins had only to
                          recite the Kalima (incantation)- "there is no God but Allah and
                          Mohammed is his Prophet." By doing that the 'momins' become
                          qualified to kill as many kafirs as they could or pleased, looting
                          and burning their belongings and enslaving their women and children
                          in the process. In the above verse, Prophet Mohammed once again is
                          telling his followers to help each other in banning up against
                          unbelievers (people of other religions)</strong></p>

              <p><strong>This verse is another instance which displays the deep

                          burnt in hell along with their idols. Islam is truly compassionate

              <p>Hmm, for every religion, the non believers of that religion will go to hell or reincarnated into some hideous being or something. So to each his own.</p>
              <p>Dont add your own words into the verses, i have a Quran of my own and i dont see any quote that young boys will be given to pious people in paradise. Besides Islam is against homosexuality. If you do see it, then post it here,</p>
              <p>Jizyah is tax. Muslim also pay taxes or alms in the days of the Caliphate. Now we pay tax to a secular goverment. Whats the difference?</p>
              <p>Violence is in all religious text. The Bible, Torah and Talmud is full of them. Why not put them here and compare instead of nitpicking?</p>
              <p>Basically in all religion, you are your own God's favorite instead of everyone is equal. If all is equal, then whats the point of professing to a faith? Might as well be Muslim one week, Christian the other week and Buddhist the other week.</p>
              <p>Dont post things you see on email or some website without knowing the basis. It just show you are a copy and paste dickhead without knowledge.</p>
              <p>Try reading this:</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">"And there are, certainly, among the People of the Book [Jews and Christians], those who believe in God, in the revelation to you, and in the revelation to them, bowing in humility to God: They will not sell the Signs of God for a miserable gain! For them is a reward with their Lord, and God is swift in account.   (The Noble Quran, 3:199)"</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">"Not all of them are alike: Of the People of the Book [Jews and Christians] are a portion that stand (For the right): They rehearse the Signs of God all night long, and they prostrate themselves in adoration.  They believe in God and the Last Day; they enjoin what is right, and forbid what is wrong; and they hasten (in emulation) in (all) good works: They are in the ranks of the righteous.  (The Noble Quran, 3:113-114)"</span></p>
              <p>Basically the Islamic point of view is the Noble Quran is a new and last gospel from God. Muslims do believe that the Bible (Injil) and Torah (Taurat) are from God but has been deviated and changed by man.</p>
              <p>(Try googling the Council Of Nicea, the council even put the divinity of Jesus to a vote! Great idea by Roman Emperor Constanstine who simply chose the winning side. He was only baptized on his death bed and was a life long pagan. He was instrumental in introducing elements of Sun Worship into Christianity like halos and resurrection and Christmas. Basically cut and paste from the Egyptian pagan religion)</p>
              <p>Islam is not a new religion created by Muhammad. It has been in existence since Adam. Even Muslims believe in the prophets quoted in the Bible, like Noah, Jacob, Abraham. So the text in red are referring to Jews and Christians who still worship God alone.</p>
