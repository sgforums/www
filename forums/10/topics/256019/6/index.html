            <div class='col-md body'>Unrealistic is simply too accurate. Private US universities have far smaller enrollments than Public universities for the same reason that university education is expensive. Here in Singapore where the salaries do not match the high cost of living and university funding support is pathetic, UNSW simply charged the full amount and hoped the name of the university is enough to attract candidates. Then couple to geography, of course we would have a limited market to cater to.<br><br>UNSW is a public institution and they rely heavily on Govt funding to function. As such, they do not have enough funds for something as grandiose as what EDB seeks. 20000 over students for a university charging private fees with no huge scholarship, grant support? Who is anyone kidding? It's a huge and expensive endeavour, not least Singapore is by no means a cheap place to set up any business, unlike M'sia.<br><br>And EDB simply doesn't understand, or is too stupid and arrogant to, that UNSW is practically doing us a service at their expense. This is akin to dealing with a customer and offering him a tough bargain. Customers can walk away, just so in case EDB does not know that.</div>

Private US universities have far smaller enrollments than Public universities for the same reason that university education is expensive. Here in Singapore where the salaries do not match the high cost of living and university funding support is pathetic, UNSW simply charged the full amount and hoped the name of the university is enough to attract candidates. Then couple to geography, of course we would have a limited market to cater to.<br><br>UNSW is a public institution and they rely heavily on Govt funding to function. As such, they do not have enough funds for something as grandiose as what EDB seeks. 20000 over students for a university charging private fees with no huge scholarship, grant support? Who is anyone kidding? It's a huge and expensive endeavour, not least Singapore is by no means a cheap place to set up any business, unlike M'sia.<br><br>And EDB simply doesn't understand, or is too stupid and arrogant to, that UNSW is practically doing us a service at their expense. This is akin to dealing with a customer and offering him a tough bargain. Customers can walk away, just so in case EDB does not know that.</div></blockquote>The irony of it all stems from the fact that those bureaucrats handpicked by this regime to oversee its state agencies like the EDB are inept to the extent of being unable to comprehend the intangible details which render the educational landscape here being different to that of the US or UK.<br><br>For all the talk from the fascists about wanting NUS and NTU to be among the world's best universities (in their lingo, being comparable to the Harvards, UC Berkeleys, Oxfords, Cambridges and Princetons of this world), they don't even seem to have been able to comprehend the dynamics and distinction between public and private institutions, much less the different demographic composition integral to such institutions. The whole UNSW debacle is nothing more than an extension of such fallacious "foresight" backfiring spectacularly on them.<br><br>In short, their disgraceful effort (with UNSW) to establish this regime as an educational hub in the region is, at best, nothing more than a wild attempt at trying to conquer Mt Everest with just a pair of slippers...</div>

Even the 22K SGD is only a few thousand dollars off what some US universities charge. It's ridiculous that they even charged that much. Then next is the Govt to provide real financial support to the university so that they can subsidise local students. Then you might consider a huge student population. Anything else is plain stupid and unrealistic.<br><br>But given how this damn Govt thinks, such a plan is highly unlikely, seeing how it operates in general and no doubt the other NTU and NUS would squawk at seeing their potential funds wither away and then you have the backdoor realpolitik the Govt is full of.<br><br>That said, it is obvious the Govt is targeting foreigners. That's a definite. But, obviously, they totally overestimated their self-worth as usual. They must be smoking pot when they thought people would buy the whole "Singapore is a safe, secure country" bull shit.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think the key point of all the key points that come out of these debacles is accountability. Sure, ventures fail. But in the real world, when ventures fail, the individuals who orchestrate and operate these very ventures have to account for their failings. It is not about pointing the finger and going on a witch hunt, it is more than that. Accountability, if i could use it in such loose terms, shows what went wrong and god willing, that such mistakes not repeat itself. If a recipe doesn't work out, or for that matter a tried and tested recipe doesnt work out in a new enviroment, surely its about time we try something differnet?</div>
