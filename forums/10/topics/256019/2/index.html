EDB never take responsibility for the winding up of so many companies in Singapore, why should they be accountable for a university.<br><br>It is true that we need more opposition members. So we not only need to vote for them, if we know what are the mistakes of EDB, should voice out, and give ammo for the opposition to shoot on issue.

He admitted the venture had always been risky and that he did not know of any Australian universities making money in the overseas campuses they had pegged as the solution to their financial woes.<br><br>Offshore education is now worth $30 billion worldwide. Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development figures show Australian universities enrol about one third of their students offshore.<br><br>The closure announcement comes a day after the university revealed it was shedding all casual staff and some subjects in its arts faculty, and less than a year after a redundancy program that involved 10 per cent of its non-academic staff.<br><br>UNSW Asia was planned as a unique venture among overseas operations of Australian universities, both in terms of its scale and that it planned to conduct research as well as teaching.<br><br>It was banking on a student population of 15,000 over the next 20 years, but it decided to close after enrolling fewer than 150 students this semester, less than half the anticipated number.<br><br>The university has already spent $17.5 million on the project, but it had guaranteed a further $140 million for the construction of a permanent campus in South Changi.<br><br>Professor Hilmer said the university had lost $15 million in not reaching its anticipated enrolment numbers, and as a result it was unable to borrow the money it needed. "I don't want to play a blame game [but] I inherited a situation," he said.<br><br>"But I know that the council and senior management took it in good faith."<br><br>Singapore has invested heavily in higher education with hopes of becoming an overseas student destination in its own right, and its national universities are cheaper than the foreign ones.<br><br>The market was always going to be difficult for an Australian university to compete in, said Carolyn Allport, the national president of the National Tertiary Education Union.<br><br>John Kaye, the NSW Greens education spokesman and a former lecturer at the University of NSW, said the failure of the campus would be a blow to the university's reputation in the international student market. "It's huge egg on their faces as a provider in South-East Asia," he said.<br><br>Simon Marginson, a professor in higher education at the University of Melbourne, said UNSW Asia was never in the university's interests because it was designed for "B" students, while the best students went to Singapore's own universities. "This was not good given that UNSW itself is a world class research university not far below National University of Singapore and at least as strong as Nanyang IT."<br><br></div>
