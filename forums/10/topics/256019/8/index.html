Just marketable skills also can liao. Or I may mistaken you?<br><br>Seems like many are talking if not suggesting of migrating.<br><br>We are all free to choose.<br><br>But what if all who dun like the current system migrate?<br><br>These are definitely people who are capable to some extent, having the international value to migrate.<br><br>But it also can mean that the opposition will forever be as weak as it is now.<br><br>Those who gave up and packed up want some kind of change.<br>If all migrate, there will be no change in the most fundamental way.<br><br>Can still keep your citizenship for a while longer while you work or live overseas , in a country that gives you more of what you lack here.<br>If all things fail , come back having the citizenship still in your wallet.<br><br>As long as we can extend the work permit, you need not come back right? Unless that country dun have voting arrangement for you.<br><br>Who knows, nothing and no man lasts forever. One day, maybe your kind of change will be realised ?<br><br>To prevent being bombarded by white internet squad, I will say that I am a white supporter.  Entertain them.<br><br></div>
