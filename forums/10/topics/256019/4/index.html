            <div class='col-md body'>Dam heng for me...<br><br>was looking at going to NSW but wasn't interested in the courses, so i enrolled in Newcastle with PSB... glad i made the right choice.<br><br>Anyway i would expect the team at NSW to atleast complete the course for the current students in Singapore, i mean a couple of years more right? maybe move to a smaller place or rent a location from EDB. And not juz pull out and move back to kangaroo land.<br><br>Well rather dissappoint that this will happen to a *top 8* university in ozzie... Expect them to understand that the first 1 or 2 years u can't really break even or make a profit... the school will need time to get its reputation and standing in the Singapore / Asian community up, then start outsourcing to different countires around asia for students.<br><br>Anyway nuff said, i feel for those NSW students. If anyone of you is out there, and need some feedback on other overseas unis in singapore can drop me a note, i abit to searching b4 i decided.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
