Neither can they cope with globalisation. Looking at the trouble that Temasek has got into with Thailand and Indonesia, and with the recent UNSW case, somehow I find that we lack of capable guys to run EDB &amp; Temasek.<br><br>By the way, who do you think EDB &amp; Temasek reports to? By right, the Finance Minister should be the one who is overseeeing the two ministries. BUT WHO IS OUR FINANCE MINISTER? Our Dear Prime Minister. In that way, I really cannot see any accountabilities of our reserve. I cannot believe that a country striving for a first class education hub cannot find a suitable candidate to take up as the Finance Minister other than the Prime Minister himself. Maybe we should hire a FT to do the job. (Just trying to be sacarstic)<br><br>And where is our second Key to the Nation's Reserve? In the midst of all these crisis, what have he done?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>May 30, 2007<br>EDB clarifies involvement with UNSW Asia<br>EDB regrets the decision by UNSW to close its Singapore campus but respects it as a business decision the UNSW has taken after finding that the initial student intake had fallen considerably short of plan. We are particularly concerned at the distress and uncertainty this situation has caused the students, parents and staff members. Our first priority is the welfare of the students. Together with the Ministry of Education, we have been working closely with UNSW to provide alternatives for the affected students.<br><br>I write to clarify various issues referred to in your reports and Forum page letters on EDB's involvement with UNSW Asia and the Global Schoolhouse programme.<br><br>EDB had been fully committed to the success of UNSW Asia from the start. The EDB support package of grants and loans was first accepted by UNSW in December 2004. Following a request for review from UNSW, this support package was renegotiated in August 2006 and EDB's enhanced package was accepted by UNSW in December 2006. When the enrolment for its first intake in March 2007 turned out to be lower than anticipated, UNSW reviewed its operations in Singapore again and requested a revised support package. Both parties explored various options and scenarios extensively.<br><br><strong>UNSW had proposed a scaled-down number of about 2,000 students. The EDB therefore had to correspondingly scale down the amount of support we could give. In the end, EDB and UNSW could not agree on a revised package that was acceptable to both parties. UNSW then decided to cease operations because of what it saw as an unacceptable level of financial and operational risks.<br><br>We are unable to give details of the support package offered to UNSW, for confidentiality reasons. We nonetheless would like to explain the terms which typically apply to support packages offered by EDB for qualifying investments and business activities which would enhance Singapore's economic competitiveness. These normally comprise tax incentives, loans or grants which are recallable if pre-agreed milestones and outcomes are not met.</strong><br><br>The Global Schoolhouse programme seeks to develop Singapore as a premier education hub comprising a rich diversity of quality education institutions and programmes from all over the world. Besides the substantial economic spin-offs, it also helps attract and develop talent to build up a strong knowledge base in Singapore. Singapore has been successful in attracting a wide range of quality institutions such as Insead, the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business, Duke University, S P Jain School of Management, University of Nevada Las Vegas, Cornell University, Global Indian International School, Delhi Public School and Chinese International School. These institutions are doing well here. Some are even expanding their campuses due to strong demand. EDB also continues to engage a range of reputable foreign institutions. We will press on with our Global Schoolhouse initiative.<br><br>Ko Kheng Hwa<br>Managing Director<br>Economic Development Board </blockquote></div>

Plus, it is no loss to UNSW to walk away from an agreement which it finds is not beneficial to it.<br><br>It is just business.</div>
