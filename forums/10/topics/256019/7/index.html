It is not about pointing the finger and going on a witch hunt, it is more than that. Accountability, if i could use it in such loose terms, shows what went wrong and god willing, that such mistakes not repeat itself.

Even the 22K SGD is only a few thousand dollars off what some US universities charge. It's ridiculous that they even charged that much. Then next is the Govt to provide real financial support to the university so that they can subsidise local students. Then you might consider a huge student population. Anything else is plain stupid and unrealistic.<br><br></div></blockquote>You've got to be kidding. Afterall, you're talking about a regime run by boffins whose educational system is so unique it belongs to a select handful (if not the only one) where foreigners actually pay the same fees as the locals(in fact, when you consider the scholarships available for foreign "talents", they probably pay less than locals). I wonder when will the US Federal government follow in the silly footsteps of this regime by providing federal grants to foreigners...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Yes, we're supposed to believed NUS and NTU are on their way to becoming the world's top universities under the stewardship of imbeciles.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

Credit goes to the Govt. and the EDB. However, discounting the lessons from UNSW pull out and just trumpeting these successes would be foolish for the long term prospect in creating Singapore as an education centre.</div>

Yet the news of UNSW Asia's collapse was the hardest Professor Hilmer has had to handle.<br><br>His trip to Singapore to bear the bad tidings to students and staff in late May was "really awful" and "emotionally very difficult", he said in an interview in his office at the Kensington campus this week.<br><br>The decision to abandon a proposed $200 million-plus greenfields campus after projections for enrolments turned out to be wildly optimistic left UNSW with $17.5million in losses and 106 staff and 148 students without a university.<br><br>"I felt I had to explain it myself. I fronted the students and the staff. That was the worst day of my working life," Professor Hilmer said. "People were crying, it was terrible, it was like a funeral."<br><br>Adding to the upset was his belief he had a workable plan for the campus's future, which was rejected at the 11th hour by the Economic Development Board of Singapore.<br><br>UNSW's rescue proposal called for a significant but "not unreasonable" subsidy from the EDB, Professor Hilmer said, but it "didn't find the plan was attractive enough to support".<br><br>"It was basically for a smaller, slower start-up with less research, certainly in the early years," he said. "We could have got something a little more like Monash in Malaysia, which is much more closely integrated with this campus. But it was not going to be the fourth great university in Singapore."<br><br>Professor Hilmer said there were no signs that UNSW's standing among prospective students had suffered. "There is nothing in our enrolment figures in next semester or next year that gives me any cause for concern. The reality is, to students who want to come here, it is irrelevant."<br><br>The students from UNSW Asia were "now largely taken care of and we are working through the staff issues", Professor Hilmer said.<br><br>"The only thing that got me through it was, I thought that if I don't do it this year, if it's next year, with a larger number of staff and a larger number of students, it would have been an almost impossible egg to unscramble," Professor Hilmer said.<br><br>On the upside, he has plans for a more rounded education for UNSW's international students and new ways to pay for a $700million building program during the next five years or so.<br><br>The key to successful international operations was close integration of core domestic activities, he said. To this end UNSW planned to offer overseas students studying in Australia work experience in their home markets as part of their degrees, as it already does in a program for domestic students.<br><br>It will take "some years" to put in place, Professor Hilmer admitted, but "our students could get work in Hong Kong, Singapore or Malaysia. We will be using our alumni and academic network to seek co-operative strategies so students' experience will be international.<br><br>Meanwhile, a financing method he learned during a visit to leading US universities last year will pay for a new $120million cancer centre.<br><br>Frank Lowy, executive chairman and co-founder of Westfield, has made the largest philanthropic gift, worth $10 million, in the university's history to the centre, and government funding and the university's capital bring the total available to $70 million.<br><br>To pay for the remaining $50million, the university is setting up a sinking fund of $10million to be quarantined and invested until it reaches $50million.<br><br>Universities can use the advantage that they are not "under the gun" from shareholders, as commercial ventures are, to take a long-term investing stance, Professor Hilmer explained.<br><br>"You have to use the fact that you don't have urgency to minimise the risk," he said.<br><br>He hoped the financing method might be useful to leverage any payments from the Higher Education Endowment Fund as the university embarks on a renewal program to update its ageing capital infrastructure.</div>

EDB's share in the loan is not known.<br><br>The EDB has repeatedly stated that the amount given in grants is confidential, but its support packages for investments typically "comprise tax incentives, loans, or grants that are reliable if pre-agreed milestones and outcomes are not met".<br><br>In a separate report on Wednesday, The Australian quoted an anonymous senior academic as saying that UNSW's Singapore management had asked the Sydney headquarters for a A$10,000 ($13,000) discount to take the sting out of its $25,000 fees.<br><br>"We realised we faced very severe fee competition (with Singapore universities), " said the academic. But Mr Hilmer only offered A$7,500 to certain students "who could meet certain criteria".<br><br>Other academics blamed the lack of proper marketing for the campus' demise. "It didn't know its main feature to attract students: Why would they come, what was the selling point," said one academic.</div>

Here's how</strong><br>Expert says closer study of governance structure would help<br><br>Friday Â• July 6, 2007<br><br>Jasmine Yin<br>jasmine@mediacorp.com.sg<br><br>LOOK beyond the glowing record of the foreign university and pay more attention to engage the different stakeholders within the institution.<br><br>Doing so could help mitigate future dents on Singapore's education hub ambitions, advised Dr Ravinder Sidhu, a visiting academic who is doing research here on trans-national education providers.<br><br>The University of New South Wales (UNSW) Asia shut its doors last Friday. Classes had been operating for one semester before UNSW vice-chancellor Fred Hilmer Â— who took over last June Â— decided to pull the plug, due to the poor student take-up rate.<br><br>"There needs to be a closer examination of internal governance structures of invited universities Â— how decisions are made by governing councils, presidents or vice-chancellors and the faculty," said Dr Sidhu, a Research Fellow from the University of Queensland who presented her paper at a closed-door workshop on trans-national education and migration this week.<br><br>"More attention needs to be given these different tiers within the institution for a better risk analysis and securing greater commitment."<br><br>Media reports had pointed to the UNSW not having deep enough pockets as a key reason for the pull-out. The increasingly corporate approach to governance among universities translates into looking at the world from a market perspective, such as costs and revenues, Dr Sidhu observed.<br><br>UNSW Asia is one of a handful of foreign universities that she is looking at for her research on Singapore's Global Schoolhouse initiative. The Economic Development Board (EDB) has targeted to attract 150,000 foreign students to Singapore by 2015 and create 22,000 jobs.<br><br>Dr Sidhu said she was about to fly back to Australia to interview UNSW staff when the news broke.<br><br>"I was stunned," she told Today. "There was no indication of closure to the people on the ground. They were expecting restructuring, in light of the student numbers."<br><br>She also cautioned against perceiving invited foreign universities Â— which receive funding from the Singapore Government to set up shop here Â— as bastions of creative and cutting-edge work, as well as talented staff and students.<br><br>The challenge is to ensure that the local universities are not limited to just the "bread-and-butter ", though important, tasks of administration and preparing students for the labour force, she added.<br><br>As for the Global Schoolhouse initiative on the whole? She said Singapore was "certainly developing a name for itself as an emerging education hub", but it was "still early days" to give a fair assessment.<br><br>"This is an expensive policy endeavour. The question of whether the money could be better utilised for other ends is a valid one, especially in light of any high-profile 'failures'."<br><br>The workshop, held on Tuesday and Wednesday, was organised by the National University of Singapore's Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences Migration Research Cluster and the Asia Research Institute.<br><br>Issues raised included how globalising cities re-invent themselves as education hubs; how educational trans-migrants, especially youth, navigate cultural differences; and the role of local and foreign education providers in this phenomenon.<br><br>One other interesting finding for Singapore was Associate Professor Ho Kong Chong's research on young foreign students at universities here.<br><br>His initial findings Â— after discussions with 10 of them from Asian countries such as China, India and Vietnam Â— showed that foreign students live in a "social bubble", without embedding themselves here, and tend to make friends only among themselves.<br><br>This would defeat the purpose of the varsities to expose their local students to a multi-cultural environment, pointed out Assoc Prof Ho, who is with the Sociology department of the National University of Singapore.</div>

But it has been reported that it gave UNSW some $17.3 million last year.<br><br>The university was also given a loan facility of $156.8 million to develop its Changi campus by the EDB and the Australia and New Zealand Bank. So far, $21 million had been drawn down.<br><br>sandra@sph.com.sg<br><br>Copyright Â© 2007 Singapore Press Holdings Ltd. Co.

            <div class='col-md body'>WTF are wrong with those idiots at EDB? The UNSW people realize that what EDB is demanding is too much, that there's no chance that they will be able to complete with NUS and co. So they want to scale back their plans and develope a small scale version. And those idiots at EDB are living in their own world and they expect UNSW to stick to what they wanted. Now the campus is close, millions of taxpayer money is wasted and I don't see how forcing UNSW to close shop is "for the good of the public". If the upstairs people at EDB refuses to fire those responsible for this fiasco I expect more failures to occur.</div>
