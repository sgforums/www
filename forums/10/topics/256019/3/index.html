            <div class='col-md body'>Professor Fred Hilmer, Vice-Chancellor of the University of New South Wales, said: "Last year....we actually had much stronger demand in Sydney than we had in the previous four years. I think one of the things we've learnt, and it's really for Singapore to draw its own lesson, is that geography is really important. When a student says he wants an Australian degree, what he really means is, 'I want the experience of living in Sydney', and not just in educational terms but riding a surfboard, <strong>doing the other things a lot of students in a campus like ours, do."</strong><br>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Financial issues, breakdown in negotiations because EDB wonÂ’t compromiseÂ…Â…what other possible issues?<br>Students cannot get Aussie PR after graduation?<br>Disenchanted by limits on academic freedom?

Her ranking in speech and press freedom or even academic freedom are closer to Singapore's ranking.<br>[/b]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This concept was doomed to fail from day 1. The people at UNSW have already admitted that they are at the level of NUS and NTU in recognation. So if their main target were foreigners what's the point of them coming over to UNSW instead of NUS or NTU? I guess the people at UNSW realized that and combined with the money grabbing demands of EDB they decided there's no chance of them making money and they cut their losses early. Why did the people at EDB or UNSW green light this project in the first place?</div>

Will they get refunds? Why no mention anywhere?</div></blockquote>I think they won't refund it, because it was reported that the students can go on to the Aussie campus to study, and they will be on partial scholarship which covers their accomdation. Not sure if it covers anything else.<br><br>Besides, I doubt many of the students pay the whole course fees at 1 go. It is the norm in private schools in Spore for students to pay in installments or by sememster, so if that's the case, then UNSW need not refund their students since they say they will close only at the end of the sememster. I don't know what the payment system in the UNSW Spore campus is like, but i think its most probably the same as other Spore private schools.<br><br>Nonetheless, to hype the school only for it to close down less than 6 months is a disgrace to EDB too. It could have hint of a lack of adequate research, as well as inability on its part to make UNSW Singapore campus the university they want it to.</div>

The announcement was made to staff and students earlier today, and I expect will be covered in the media tomorrow.<br><br>This difficult decision has been reached after an intensive review of the project, which was sparked by lower-than-expected initial enrolments and disappointing demand for the August semester. The review showed that the operation is not financially viable. In these circumstances, it would have been irresponsible to continue.<br><br>The decision follows extensive discussions with the Economic Development Board.<br><br>I can assure you that we are speaking with every staff member and student on an individual basis to ensure the best possible outcome for each of them.<br><br>The media release issued today is provided below.<br><br>We look forward to your continued involvement with UNSW.<br><br>Fred Hilmer<br>Vice-Chancellor<br><br>UNSW ASIA TO CLOSE<br><br>The University of New South Wales will close its campus in Singapore, Vice-Chancellor Professor Fred Hilmer announced today.<br><br>The campus will be closed on 28 June 2007, the end of the current semester.<br><br>The decision has been reached after extensive discussions with SingaporeÂ’s Economic Development Board and follows lower than anticipated enrolments.<br><br>Â“We have been fully committed to the success of this enterprise, and are disappointed to have to make this decision,Â” Professor Hilmer said.<br><br>Â“We particularly regret the disruption to students and the consequences for staff.<br><br>Â“However an intensive review of our operations in Singapore clearly indicates that to continue would involve an unacceptable level of risk to our institution.<br><br>Â”We are taking the decision to close at the end of the current semester, because to attempt to continue would not be in the best interest of the students,Â” Professor Hilmer said.<br><br>UNSW was invited by the Singapore Economic Development Board in 2004 to establish what would have been the first private comprehensive university in Singapore.<br><br>Â“The University Council and senior management of the time accepted this invitation in good faith, and after taking extensive expert advice,Â” Professor Hilmer said.<br><br>Â”UNSW Asia was to be the first comprehensive research and teaching institution to be established by an Australian university overseas.<br><br>Â“This was an initiative with potentially significant benefits to both Singapore and the University.<br><br>Â“However the lower than anticipated enrolments and current demand have highlighted financial and operational issues that make the operation unsustainable.Â”<br><br>Â“As with any pioneering venture, there is a fuller appreciation of the risks involved once the venture becomes operational.Â”<br><br>The UniversityÂ’s first priority is the welfare of the students currently studying at the UniversityÂ’s campus at Tanglin, said Professor Hilmer.<br><br>Â“All enrolled students will be offered a place at UNSWÂ’s home campus in Sydney, providing scholarships to help with travel and accommodation costs. And we will work with those who are unable to accept a place in Sydney to meet their needs.Â”<br><br>Students were informed of the decision today. A team of advisers will work with students on a case-by-case basis to develop the best solution for each studentÂ’s particular situation.<br><br>Discussions with affected staff are also underway, following a general meeting with UNSW Asia staff members.<br><br>The UNSW Asia campus currently has 148 enrolled students, with some 100 of these being Singapore residents. The anticipated enrolment for the initial intake in 2007 was 300 students. Second semester enrolments were anticipated at 480 students but it is clear that this target would not be met.<br><br>Professor Hilmer said that UNSW looks forward to continuing its cooperative relationships in Singapore and will maintain its presence in Singapore, through activities such as foundation schooling for university entry, research collaborations, University of New South Wales school competitions and joint programmes with Singapore institutions.<br><br>Media contact, Sydney: Judy Brookman, UNSW Director of Communications, ph + 61 2 9385 3249, mob 0421 061 251, j.brookman@unsw.edu.au<br><br>Date issued: Wednesday 23 May, 2007.[/b]</div>
