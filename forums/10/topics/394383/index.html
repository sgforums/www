              shops as customers raise quick cash for gambling</span></span> <br> <br> 23 March 2010 / CNA
              <br> <br> SINGAPORE: The opening of the casino in Singapore has led to better 
              business for some pawn shops. 
              <br> <br> Pawn shops said they are seeing more customers, especially older folks, 
              who said they are pawning their valuables to raise cash for gambling. 
              <br> <br> While the number of such customers is small, pawn shop owners said it 
              will rise in the coming months. 
              <br> <br> However, some industry players have expressed concern. 
              <br> <br> They feel pawn-broking is meant to help people tide over urgent times, 
              rather than a means to raise quick cash.

              <p>I think the casinos churned the economy, things are moving, people are pawning, more people are employed, taxi drivers are gaining, tourism is booming which will lead to chain reaction improving in our economy, as far as money and goods are changing hands, you get a vibrant economy, and you can also be debt free, let me, give u an example of how money was moved and people become debt free in a money world.</p>
              <p>A man enter a motel, paid the boss at the counter $100 deposit, the boss of the motel took the $100, paid the chambermaid whose salary was overdue, the chambermaid took the $100 and paid the next door grocery store which she own them on credit, the grocery stall took the $100 went down to the mechanic shop and paid the mechanic for repairing his lorry on credit. The mechanic than took the $100 and pay a poor prostitue who he patronised on credit, the prositute then took the money and run to the motel to pay the boss for the room rental on credit.</p>
              <p>Then at that particular time, the man who had entered the motel, came down and told the motel boss that he dun like the room, so the boss gave him back the $100 deposit.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Is it any surprise to see that the efforts of the resident CBM here is obviously to sabotage the thread with its flippant and irrelevant replies, and get all attempts at serious discussion to be driven off track - simply to bring attention to its own stupidity ?</p>

              <p><br>Come on Angel, the problem with Sg is that it is attracting the wrong PRC gals into the country. The pigs follow the pigs and dogs follow the dogs. The kama of this follow with ppl that Sg govern allow into this country with open arm. Wat they call 'FT'.</p>
              <p>I dont know what PRC ppl has been given entry to Sg as PR but in my company and friends I associate with, there are many highly educated and elegant PRC ladies who dont give a dame to going to sg.</p>
