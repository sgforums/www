              <p><strong>'Hang up national flag if you forgive me'  <br>Jurong resident surprised to find bike left outside flat with strange letter <br>August 07, 2008</strong>      </p>
              <p>WHEN Mr Jack Ngui was leaving for work on 28 Jul, he found a black bicycle that did not belong to him outside his flat.</p>
              <p>  <br>Surprised by the bike left outside his flat, Mr Jack Ngui (above) checked with his neighbours if it was theirs. -- TNP Picture: KUA CHEE SIONG  <br>Attached to the bicycle was a white envelope.</p>
              <p>But as he was running late, the 33-year-old manager did not think much about it.</p>
              <p>When he returned home that evening, the bicycle and the envelope were still outside his 14th-storey flat in Block 625, Jurong West Street 61.</p>
              <p>Then he saw that his unit number was on the envelope and realised that someone had deliberately left the bicycle for him.</p>
              <p>Inside the envelope was a one-page handwritten letter of apology from someone who had signed off as 'Depressed Teenager'.</p>
              <p>The letter writer confessed to stealing the bicycle from Mr Ngui's unit about four years ago, and was returning it because he felt remorseful.</p>
              <p>But Mr Ngui, who lives with his wife and his sister in his three-room flat, told The New Paper that the bicycle did not belong to him.</p>
              <p>He said he does not own a bicycle, and had moved into the flat only in November 2005.</p>
              <p>SORRY</p>
              <p>In the letter, the writer said: 'I am terribly sorry for whatever I did... I want to correct my mistake.'</p>
              <p>The writer also said that he was an adopted child and that his 'uncle' and 'aunty' had not treated him well.</p>
              <p>'I wanted to go jail because staying with them was worse than jail and so the only way to go to jail is to commit a crime.'</p>
              <p>He said he regretted his actions later and decided to return the bicycle after living with the guilt for a few years.</p>
              <p>But if Mr Ngui is not the owner of the bicycle, who is?</p>
              <p>'At first, I thought it could have belonged to the previous owner of my flat,' said Mr Ngui.</p>
              <p>But when he checked with his neighbours, a married couple, he discovered that the bike may have belonged to them.</p>
              <p>His neighbour, Mr Krish Ng, 32, said his family's bicycle had gone missing about four years ago.</p>
              <p>Mr Ng, 32, and his wife have been living in the flat for the past five years.</p>
              <p>Although the bicycle they lost was red, a closer inspection of the returned bicycle showed traces of red paint beneath the black.</p>
              <p>PAINTED OVER</p>
              <p>Mr Ng said: 'Perhaps it was painted over. The bicycle is most likely mine.</p>
              <p>'There were some other changes besides the colour but I can't remember everything about the original bike.'</p>
              <p>The thief had admitted to modifying the bicycle in his letter but did not specify what he changed.</p>
              <p>The Ngs said it had been so long since their bicycle went missing that they had forgotten about it.</p>
              <p>In his letter, the thief asked to be forgiven.</p>
              <p>He wrote: 'If you guys really, sincerely want to forgive me... I hope that you hang the national flag for at least 5 days upon receipt of my letter.'</p>
              <p>But the Ngs said they do not have the Singapore flag and are not planning to buy one.</p>
              <p>Mr Ng said: 'Asking us to hang up the flag is not the right way.</p>
              <p>'If he sincerely wants to be forgiven, he can knock on my door and talk to me and then I will forgive him.'<br> <br> </p>

              <p>i think the `reformed' thief will then see from a far that he is forgiven. definitely not underwear, becos everyone hangs them out to dry...</p>

              <p>Looking at the low number of residents who hang flags( other than those RC blocks facing the roads) we should implement some pragmatic solution to improve the situation.</p>
              <p>We could</p>
              <p>1) offer upgrading to the block with most flags hung out</p>
              <p>2) lucky draw for those units that hang out the national flag. The winner can move to a condo ( which means they do not need to hang flags in future.)</p>
              <p>3) Give converservancy rebates to blocks with more than 80% flags displayed</p>
