The U.S. image remains relatively poor in Muslim countries like Jordan and Pakistan, but has bounced back in Indonesia, the worldÂ’s most populous Muslim country which benefited from U.S. aid to tsunami victims, as well as in India and Russia.<br><br>Support for the U.S.-led war on terror has dipped in European countries like Britain, France, Germany, Canada and Spain, while it remains low in the Muslim countries surveyed like Pakistan, Turkey and Jordan.<br><br>Danforth: 'A great wariness' of U.S.<br>Â“There is a general recognition that terrorism is a terrible problem that strikes home in countries all over the world,Â” said John Danforth, the former Republican senator from Missouri who also was U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.<br><br>Â“The position of the United States as the one surviving superpower is to be assertive in responding in a world of terrorism. But in the rest of the world, there is a great wariness about that,Â” said Danforth, now a St. Louis attorney.<br><br>The poll found a positive reaction in European countries to President BushÂ’s campaign for more democracy in countries around the world. People in Muslim countries were wary of the U.S. campaign, but supportive of the idea of democracy in their own countries.<br><br>Danforth said the attitudes in the Middle East about democracy were a bright spot.<br><br>Â“We should keep plugging away on democracy,Â” he said. Â“But we need to do a better job of communicating what weÂ’re trying to do.Â”<br><br>The survey found that a majority in most countries say the United States doesnÂ’t take the interests of other countries into account when making international policy decisions. It also found most would like to see another country get as much military power as the United States, though few want China to play that role. People in most countries were more inclined to say the war in Iraq has made the world a more dangerous place.<br><br>People in other countries who had unfavorable views of the United States were most likely to cite Bush as the reason rather than a general problem with America.<br><br>Madeleine Albright, the secretary of state when Bill Clinton was president, said big majorities of the public in these countries are discontented with Bush Â“and say BushÂ’s re-election has made them view the United States less favorably.Â”<br><br>The polls were taken in various countries from late April to the end of May with samples of about 1,000 in most countries, with more interviews in India and China and slightly less than 1,000 in the European countries. The margin of sampling error ranged from 2 percentage points to 4 percentage points, depending on the sample size.<br><br>Â© 2005 The Associated Press.
