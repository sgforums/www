              <p>If you don't find Singapore a good place for you to live, emigrate!</p>
              <p>Singapore is a global city, people come, people go.</p>
              <p>People born in China will always be recognised as Chinese, India as Indian, Philippine as Philippino...But, people born in Singapore holding oz passports are australian, american passports are american....and people born in China holding singaporean passport are also singaporean,..... today you are singaporean, tomorrow you are not, or yesterday they were not, today they are, what difference does your presence made to the rest of us?</p>
              <p>if you cannot find comfort in Singapore to call it home, even at this good time when the economy is growing, then we cannot expect you to stay when there is a crisis in Singapore.</p>
              <p>You can scold LHL because he was born in the good time and grow up in the good time. You really can't ask LKY to die because he was born in the bad time and grew up fighting the communists, the colonial english, .....and for most of you who were born after the 80s, don't say that you are having it bad in Singapore, you really don't know what is bad time.</p>
              <p>Move on, if you don't like Singapore, if you don't see yourself part of singapore, or if you see better places else where, emigrate, with sincere good wishes from all singaporeans.</p>
              <p>It will take many more years, after many generations for Singapore to truely call singapore home, when they had learned to love the soil, the humid air, the singlish, the oil food, the crowded streets, ...and of course, the lousy government.</p>

              <p>It's not NATO.</p>
              <p>SINGAPORE is losing about 1,000 of its best and brightest every year
              and the numbers are growing, Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew has said,
              sounding the alarm on the severity of the brain drain.</p>
              <p>It's surprising that MM lee is not doing something concrete to stem the outflow, always making it seems that it all boils down to monetary gains. Is that the only reason people left, talent or non-talent?</p>

              <p>without going too much on the details, LKY has been using scare tactics for the longest time, from the communist threat days of old to how the country will crumble if the MIW are not in power.</p>
              <p>believe u me, this is the best time to get PR. i know of FTs who r technicians, etc. who is now PR. came on a contract, try his luck, got PR and the whole tagalog speaking family joined him soon after. He got the job probably becos he's willing to take a lower wage than a sgprean.  a TWnese colleague of mine , a middle manager, got his PR in 4 weeks. no disrespect to him, his job and so-called talent can be filled by any Singaporeans I know. i cld go on n on.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>is it any wonder tt some of the singaporeans feel squeezed out?</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>I agree that there is a seige mentality among Singaporeans because Singapore is small, surrounded by neighbours who don't really want us to succeed and the ruling party is making the best use of it. Threat of communism was real in those days, just like terrorism is real today, threat of our drinking water being cut off is real even today, or are all these just a scare tactics used by LKY? what other threat used by LKY?</p>
              <p>Will Singapore crumble if the MIW are not in power? I thought the question often asked is who will take over. Will a running car crash if there is no driver? is that a scare tactics?</p>
              <p>I don't deny the fact that it is easier to get singapore PR now than ever before, especially now when more singaporeans want to migrate. My question is, who employ the tagalog speaking technician and the middle manager from Taiwan? Were local staff within the company given the opportunity? How many singaporean applied for the same job? Did the guy come in really at a lower salary? Too many unkown and "probably" weaken your argument.</p>
              <p>As far as I know Singapore government offer PR only to those who can prove they can be gainfully employed in Singapore and would not be a burden to the society and the government in the long term. So for anybody to get PR, the first step is to get employed. Who employ them?</p>
              <p>The overall cost of engaging a foreigner on contract is definitely lower than a local on employment term. On contract everything is clearly written and may not be subject to changes. On employment, company pay CPF, fringe benefits, bonuses, plus it is always easier to terminate contract then to retrench. It is the companies who are exploiting the situation or may be the HR of the companies were sent by the government. Why nobody blame the MNCs, the employers...?</p>

              <p>From what I understand from my China classmates, Singapore willingly throws PR at them.  They come here on subsidized studies, and are required to work X years in Singapore under bond.   During that period, they'll get their PR.</p>
              <p><br>With regards to moving to Australia.  Consider it VERY carefully.  Its not all a bed of roses over there.  There are issues such as racial tensions and "anti-Singaporean" sentiments.  Their Tax rates are also very high.  If you earn about 50k pa, be prepared to fork out almost 10k in taxes. Couple that with higher costs of living, and you'll see why Singapore has its positive sides. </p>
              <p><br>Of couse, professionals would have less problems.  Most in senior positions should be able to comfortably make 100k pa easy whereas they might not even smell 60k in SG.</p>
              <p>Why is there a brain drain?  Cos the brains sufferinng from a financial drain.  It seems that the only brains not suffering from it are those that benefited from that 25% increase in their "salary."</p>
              <p>IMHO, I feel that Singaporeans should aim to go global as well. Expand your world view and horizon.  Look at all the mainland chinese, vietnamese that leave all they have behind and head to Singapore to work.  They are less equipped to find jobs here but they still did.  Singaporeans OTOH are so much better equipped to move out to places such as US an Aus to make a living. </p>
              <p>Btw, despite saying all this, I still love Singapore.  =P</p>

              <p>sgdiehard,</p>
              <p>u assume PAP is the only driver in the car, without it, it is driverless. that is presumptious and a wrong analogy.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>PAP did Singapore no favor by its "no tolerence, crush at all costs the opposition" mantra. when cracks do appear from within, and cracks will definitely appear, and shows itself to be incapable of governing, especially post-LKY, singapore will be left drifting. nothing lasts forever. not even PAP.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>instead in engaging in meaningful debate and policy matter, opposition has no voice, or a negligible one. Singapore is often left with a one track mind of policy deployment. while not all are bad, singapore accounts itself very well in the last few decades, but its growth and maturity lags. it is so 1 dimensional.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If Singaporeans do not leave in droves, FTs will not be able to come in so freely. The MIW inadvertantly drive away the people whose blood and ties are entwinned in Singapore and replace them with those who come here to make a better living for themselves and holds no stake in the country.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Granted it is not easy to govern a country, but all that happened is due to a lack of an alternative political voice that gives the policy implementation a balanced view.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Touch wood, if Singapore spiral down next time due to some conservative, stiff technocrat who has a tunnel vision who is unresponsive to the country's needs, there will be very few who can come forward to perk the country up. Why so....many are already gone.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And when Singapore don't do well, you think the FT will remain, or tt employers can afford them?</p>

              <p>genie, u forgot to factor in the cost of living.</p>
              <p>Out of that $4k AUD per month after tax deduction, it might cost you anywhere between $2-3k to survive. Things are much more expensive there, from food, to cellphones and internet connection. I'm still trying to verify the cost of livin figures though.</p>
              <p>Still, yeah, Singaporeans will earn more in Aus than in Singapore.  As for stealing rice bowl, its an unjustified claim, hence I believe the sentiments to be more racial.  They have so much rice and no one to eat it. Without anyone to eat it, the farmers got less to do and are unable to realise their potential as super farmers. Hope you catch my drift.</p>

              <p><br>Not really unjustified lar... like if you earn less than them you wont see alot of it but if you are like doing better then alot of them thats where you can see some racism. But all this is inside the company environment. Outside people usually don't care about you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thats the thing i like about Aussie, people dont go comparing cars and houses and clothes all that crap. Cos the wage gap not so big so not so much competition and jealousy here. In Singapore alot of these "comparing" <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/cry.png" alt="cry.png">. Everyday conversations would likely end up being "how to make big bucks" .... " so and so drive beemer" ..." so and so pay how much".... down here no one cares <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/BoxedEmoticonSet/smile.png" alt="smile.png"> and i like it that way.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Cost of living here not so high ar brother... i earn around that range de... normal worker here, not some high flyer with deglee....... i eat out alot also.... the food here quite ex.... around $30 for me 1 person but good food lar... i usually order 2 portions cause i dun stinge on food. I.e Unagi bentoh... steak.... parmagianas... sashimi.... my daily lunch.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Cellphone $29 cap plan. ADSL2 i pay $50 a month.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Then my hardworking wife ... must reward her with bling also mah....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If i dont eat out dun spend on wife .... i think save $2.5k a month bery easy.</p>
              <p> </p>
