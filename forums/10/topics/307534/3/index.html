              <p>if MM lee's remarks make good sense to you, then believing in santa claus is not that difficult either.</p>
              <p>yea, i admit we migrants arent that competitive coz;</p>
              <p>- we have NS and reservist to serve whereas FT dont.</p>
              <p>- we have to earn enough to support families here in SG. FT dont.</p>
              <p>- we have to lease a proper hdb flat for our families to have a decent stay. FT have their family back in PRC or China and they can stay 5 -10 to a room.</p>
              <p>- we have no privileges to NUS/NTU education but the FTs have.</p>
              <p>coz we are singaporeans, most of the IT depts heads and managers are indians or PRCs will only hire their own races. see Credit Sussie, stanchart and citibank for example.</p>
              <p>we are not that competitive so we left SG for less competitive places like australia, canada or usa. these are the countries that recognise our less-than-competitive qualifications and allow us to work in their countries and earn 2-3x more salaries. sad isnt it?</p>

              <p>i cant say about canada but australia is abit difficult at this stage and it is getting harder every year.</p>
              <p>people say that they will wait until 50 or 60 then migrate. but by then, who want them?</p>
              <p>ultimately, to move or not is entirely up to individuals. but when there is a severe economic downturn in SG, people will start to apply frantically but by then it will be too late.</p>

              <p>you are worried because you are forming wealth  by risk taking and cannot afford the returns to be taxed.  For Jim Rogers, he has already made it big and already formed his wealth.  At his age and wealth, he will not be taking too much risk versus his total net worth.  Risk taking would then be for a game.  Why should he then be worried about capital gains tax?</p>

              <p>Why do rich people keep accumulating wealth? Why do they try means and ways to avoid paying taxes? Why are so many companies incorporated in Bermuda? If you're trying to say that Rogers is content and not greedy, why don't I see him donating his wealth to charities like Bill Gates, Buffet and even Soros? Instead, he 'quit' America at the first sign of trouble, instead of staying like those above.</p>
              <p>So in your opinion, what is the main reason that Jim Rogers took up SG citizenship? And how does that argue against people emigrating? Remember that Jim Rogers is also a quitter, but he is a worse quitter because he is a filthy rich quitter who doesn't need to make a living anymore.</p>

              <p>you are worried because you are forming wealth  by risk taking and cannot afford the returns to be taxed.  For Jim Rogers, he has already made it big and already formed his wealth.  At his age and wealth, he will not be taking too much risk versus his total net worth.  Risk taking would then be for a game.  Why should he then be worried about capital gains tax?</p>

              <p>speaking of jim rogers, might as well throw in why the burma generals are here to seek medical treatment and indonesian rich folks are stashing their money in sg banks, it is practically a swiss bank of the east. throw in afew IR gambling casinos to do money laundering, viola! clean hard cash for the generals of the golden triangle and burma.</p>
              <p>indonesia is trying all means to extradite the cash from sg banks on grounds that they were the cash stolen during suharto's times.</p>
              <p>but then again, who are we to comment the decisions of the social almighties. we are but digits, expendable cannon fodder in the eyes of LKY. a dictator will never grant freedom and democracy to his country and he make sure that all are suppressed under his reign.</p>
              <p>any sensible person can see the mismanagement of the country, but a selfish one will sell his/her soul to the devil to profit while deceiving others into such belief. that sir, is a evil fool that believes the lies that the dictatorship want him/her to believe. fortunately, there are many singaporeans that have seen thru' this deceits and actively participating in this forum dennouncing the dictatorship, there are however, afew wolves in sheep clothings going around playing the trumpets of the sea nymphs hoping to ship wreck some unwary singaporeans and marooned in a matrix.</p>
              <p>if jim rogers really respects human rights and all that american civil rights stuffs, he would stay cleared of singapore, but no, like all rich men, conscious is one thing they cannot afford to have, it is a hinderance in their path to make profits. how much does he have? nearly half of what soros has and that is in the billions. is he contented? no! does he want to make more? yes! does he care that there is no democracy nor strong civil rights here? no!</p>
              <p>does singapore has the mechanism to enable him to make more money even simply by exploiting the mass of the singaporeans to serve his goal and eventually reward the sporean elite riches? yes! all of us are expendable in the elite sight. if they so g-d damned care about us lower-middle income, laws like min wages, anti-competition will have surfaced but the elites suppressed the general society for the own selfish consumption.</p>
              <p>ahhh, but the avenue of emigration is not capped. people still can venture overseas to see, and like one forumers that had said before; "once the mind has expanded and freed, it is impossible to contract and confine."</p>

              <p>dont forget the $7k grant if u are buying it for the 1st time. interest paid on the IP is tax deductible and so are the -ve gearing + rennovation + building deprecation.</p>

              <p> a snake drops a bomb on Jim Rogers.  Well, thats what you always do.  I saw you calling TCH05 a kid <strong>after </strong>you lost the debate of a young man who leveraged too much on two properties.  Common, even if TCH05 is a kid, he did the correct calculations to prove his point correct and yours wrong.  Now, you start to do the same on Jim Rogers. <strong>Common, Jim Rogers is innocent.  Why slander him?</strong> </p>

              <p>Jim Rogers is smart. He can give up his US citizenship and still is considered a US citizen by the US state department.</p>
              <p>There are special provisions for persons who are deemed to have renounced citizenship for purposes of avoiding US taxation.</p>
