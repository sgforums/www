              In reply to Acx1688, I don't have to go to London regularly. I have lived there as a student and worked there for a while. How else do you think I know they refer to their subway system (i.e. their MRT) as the tube. 
              On the other hand, I'd like to ask you whether you have actually set foot in London before or does your impression of London come from the tv. Have walked along Oxford St. - London's own Orchard Road. You will notice there are no trash bins - not just on Oxford St. But throughout most of Greater London. Why not take a ride on their tube during summertime and check the soot accumulated on your collar - you know, the so-called 'ring' around the collar.
              Anyway, here's some food for thought. Should we hold a referendum and limit the % of foreigners living and working in Singapore: dated 14 Feb.
              Inspired by Switzerlandâ€™s immigration vote, which has infuriated the European Union, one of Norwayâ€™s ruling parties is calling for the country to hold its own referendum on limiting immigration from the EU.
              
              On Sunday, Switzerland voted 50.3 percent in favor of re-introducing strict quotas for immigrants from the EU, thus scrapping the policy of free movement within the 28-nation bloc.
              
              The surprise choice sent shockwaves across Europe, with Brussels threatening to reconsider its relations with Switzerland and anti-immigration activists applauding the result.
              
              â€œI wonâ€™t take a stance on such a quota system that the Swiss people have voted for. But the idea of a referendum is interesting, and Norway also should have a referendum on immigration,â€� said Mazyar Keshvari, immigration spokesman for the Progress Party (FrP), which is part of Norwayâ€™s Conservative-led government.
              
              â€œI am quite sure that there is majority support for tightening immigration across Norwayâ€™s political parties. The polls show that,â€� he told VG newspaper.
              
              Keshvari is himself a second-generation immigrant. The 32-year-old politician comes from an Iranian family who took refuge in Norway in the aftermath of the Islamic Revolution when he was a child.
              
              Although the Swiss poll prompted calls for similar immigration-curbing measures from far-right movements across Europe, Norway has become the first nation where a government party has expressed its support for the idea.
              
              However, Vidar Helgesen, Norwayâ€™s Minister of EEA (European Economic Area) and EU Affairs expressed concern about the Swiss vote.
              
              â€œThis will create problems for the Swiss business sector and the economy, which have benefited greatly from labor immigration from the EEA, as has Norway. It will be interesting to see what consequences this has for Switzerlandâ€™s relations with the EU,â€� Helgesen said in a statement on the Foreign Ministryâ€™s website.
              
              â€œThe Swiss people have expressed their disagreement with their government on an important aspect of Switzerlandâ€™s relations with other countries. Norway would like to emphasize the importance of free movement of persons for growth and prosperity in an open economy,â€� said Helgesen, a politician for center-right Conservative Party, which leads the ruling two-party coalition.
              
              Keshvari, of the Progress Party, argued that EEA migration was not that beneficial.
              
              â€œLithuanians and Poles who come and seek employment in Norway gladly bring their family here when they discover anything they can get for free by residing here, including free healthcare and social security benefits,â€� VG quoted Keshvari as saying.
              
              The FrP party has repeatedly said that Norway should study the EEA Agreement and use whatever room for maneuver there is to limit immigration, Keshvari said.
              
              Conservatives and the FrP government are now reportedly in tough negotiations with the Liberals and Christian Democrats on measures to limit immigration to Norway.

              Ice - you truly are retarded or you have a serious problem reading English as you have spelling it. This was my original post on Anton Casey:
              
              In the first place, if LHL was really a responsible PM, he would have rescinded Anton Caseyâ€™s PR for his remarks and sent him back to that filthy island of his. Has anybody over here visited London and experience the riding the tube (i.e. Their MRT). Have anyone taken a walk along Oxford St. and look at the filth along their streets? The sad part is that this white piece of shit and his Singapore slut wife are gone temporarily and not permanently.
               Yes, some of us Singaporeans have been victims of those British skinheads â€“ and itâ€™s only fair we treat these albinos exactly the same way.
              
              Many disagreed with my description of that shithole and I was just replying to Acx1688 who remarked that I should visit that city regularly. Never in any of my posts have I made a comparison of the city we built with that grey, ugly city. The only filth we have in our clean city/country are the foreigners..
