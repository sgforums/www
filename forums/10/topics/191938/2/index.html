From cash they can manage their life better with greater flexibility. It is not true that they will squander their cash more readily when they have more cash.<br><br>Ministers in charge have made some fundamentally wrong assumptions that it is necessary to enforce savings. Look at the state of CPF nestegg today, many people ended up losing their entire savings due to enforced saving scheme being finally incorrectly liberalised by none other than government ministers themselves resulting in most people losing them on shares, property etc.<br><br>With more cash at their disposal, economy has a better chance to do better. Cash will lead to greater private investments instead of being locked up.<br><br>People were unable to correct ministers' many past wrong assumptions because their views are often edited, censored or witheld from publication by the controlled press.<br><br>Here at this forum, I hope more people is able to come up with more correct view to put forward to the government - do not just conceive any scheme from one point of view whether for its own surpluses or employers' competitiveness.<br><br>So when you keep referring to employers having to compete for cheaper foreign workers in industries relying heavily on foreign workers, I am sorry to say that this kind of thinking is biased towards the employers and government and at the end we will end up not making government getting more tax revenues or the employers getting more competitive.<br><br>Some thinking in the past are always big-banner propaganda-type of thinking and not really good in improving our economic competitiveness.<br><br>India and China are now surging ahead for different reasons with each applying its own strength. It does not rely solely on making cheaper and cheaper products. India uses its niche very well in software engineering which open up whole industries to benefit workers and spin the economy.<br><br>China depends a lot of multi-cultural talented manufacturing to reach out to the world producing what the whole world needs. It is capable of making the whole new high-technology products within a short time.<br><br>Singapore is too control minded in everything is does. Its governemnt spells out a few policy assumptions and stick to them like glue.<br><br>So by over-emphasising on a very unchangeable policies of the past centred on pro-foreign investment incentivising, at the expense of building capabilities and entrepreneurship among its own domestic sector private economy, we are losing out in innovation and technology start-ups in many areas.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi all,<br><br>Seems like the topic is kinda straying, but jus offering my 2 cents, pls dun flame me.<br><br>CPF works as a mandatory form of savings, initially planned for retirement purpose. Noble target, but mismanaged in my opinion.<br><br>As opposed to being able to withdraw your "retirement funds" there is a mandatory minimal amount required prior to withdraw (anyone can ascertain this?) This is totally contradictory to its original intention of retirement funds right?<br><br>The last I remembered the minimal sum is S$100,000. Lets face it, how many of us are able to have that surplus in our account by the time we retire at the 20/13% ruling we have currently?<br><br>The monthly CPF does have its pros as well. Its good to use for your monthly housing mortage, apart from that, I seriously do not see much benefits in that system.<br><br>Plus if you plan to migrate, you will still not be able to withdraw your CPF money, kinda dumb if you ask me. But as some of us have mentioned, elections is over and pls do not flame the government or complain cos its OUR choice that they are placed there to implement all these mandates.

Noble target, but mismanaged in my opinion.<br><br>As opposed to being able to withdraw your "retirement funds" there is a mandatory minimal amount required prior to withdraw (anyone can ascertain this?) This is totally contradictory to its original intention of retirement funds right?<br><br>The last I remembered the minimal sum is S$100,000. Lets face it, how many of us are able to have that surplus in our account by the time we retire at the 20/13% ruling we have currently?<br><br>The monthly CPF does have its pros as well. Its good to use for your monthly housing mortage, apart from that, I seriously do not see much benefits in that system.<br><br>Plus if you plan to migrate, you will still not be able to withdraw your CPF money, kinda dumb if you ask me. But as some of us have mentioned, elections is over and pls do not flame the government or complain cos its OUR choice that they are placed there to implement all these mandates. In HOPE of making Singapore a better place to live in.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> </div></blockquote>the basic sum is $120k.</div>
