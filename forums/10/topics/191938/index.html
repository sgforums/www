            <div class='col-md body'>They ought to show their heartware - to be really concerned for people's health, jobs, livelihood not to prove that NKF is not their problem.<br><br>They created the problems of NKF, but they keep denying them. If fundamentals are not addressed but only tempered with some medishield and medicare, people will have to suffer big problems at the end of their retirement years.<br><br>By deducting my medishield premium from my CPF, they are reducing my retirement nesteggs and that is not what we want. They can reduce their costs by not charging double on lands the hospitals are standing on. Then medical costs will really and truly come down.<br><br>When government keep collecting $500,000 - $800,000 per household from big ticket items like housing and vehicle ownership, they are creating surpluses from taxes especially when they also corporatise all the services to enable them to charge higher fees and recover all costs.<br><br>Surely when people have been paying so much and building up their surpluses, the heartware surgeons among some of our best scholars can tell the heartware solution is to use say 20% of citizens' surplus amounting to $US150 billions as endowment funds to generate secured returns in AAA investments to lower our costs of housing, medical and essential services.<br><br>By doing the above-mentioned endowment, we will not end up as a welfare state. By investing in Souzhou, Bangalore and Shincorp, we stand a greater risk of losing our surpluses and will at the end cause more NKF problems.</div>

Please talk big big topic in a more important thread leh.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>This thread cannot handle that kind of problem..This one only let the worker bring home an extra $360 per month.  Just like the kid in the Mcdonald advertisement, maybe you swinging down, for them definitely be a up swinging. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> </div></blockquote>Bigger problems are not often solved but grossed over with some shields or defensive strategies to look good and clever.<br><br>So when the government keeps postponing bigger NKF types of problems and try to come up with look-good shields preferring to keep quiet over bigger cost problems, people may not be too happy to go along whatever their solutions as by supporting shields people miss the chance to solve bigger problems.<br><br>For this point you posted, it has to be done carefully as employers may be helped by another government measurs into shortchanging the workers as has happened during the whole recessions.<br><br>After recessions, ministers got back their salary cuts very fast but most workers today have not got back their CPF cuts.<br><br>So you see the government in proposing any higher cash take home pay from the CPF component of workers' pay may give employer another opportunity to shortchange the workers.<br><br>We cannot keep solving our economic problems by doing everything for employers. The employers have one hundred and one ways to reduce their costs and wages is only one portion of overall costs.<br><br>Many employers already have big power to terminate employees' service by contracts or witholding certain rights.<br><br>So don't keep passing laws or managing economy in one-sided manner. This time, if the government wants to give employees more take home pay from his CPF portion, government should make sure that this is done provided the gross pay is not reduced to benefit the employer again.<br><br>If government wants to help employers, it can help by lowering costs of doing business and not having so many pro-foreign investment policies and give them incentives to encourage employers to employ locals.<br></div>
