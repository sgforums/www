In contrary, they now usually keep  eyes closed on families more than two children as they can both registration fee from families and subsidy from centre government. from last year, the argricultural tax was swept and centrel government subsidizes a lot to the rural area.</div>

I am personally from the rural area and now studying in university. the really problem is that the income is really low. one person can only earn 1000 singapore dollar per year if he just works in farm, doesn't work in factory.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I have been to China, many times. What I said still applies. I suggest you check it out with Chinese nationals yourself. There are places in China where traveling is restricted. And news don't exactly flow freely in China.</div>
