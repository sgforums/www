            <div class='col-md body'>Just like what Singapore are facing now.Last time when Singaporeans born alot of children that time,Lee Kuan Yew urge n even impose laws that discourage ppl from having too much kids.Now Singapore suffer from not enough birth rate to replace the old n retire population.<br><br>Becoz when a country becomes more n more advance,many ppl will reluctant to have more kids.This is a natural process,u go everywhere is the same.Thats why mainland China no need to impose such a strict law to discourage ppl from having too many kids.As their country developed,their birthrate will naturally drop.<br><br>Another problem of having 1 kid is that when the child grow up,especially teenage period.When they have doubts or problems,they dont have siblings to turn to for help.From my personal experience,my brothers n sisters help me alot in my life,even up until today.<br><br>Also if only having 1 kid,the parents will tend to pamper the child which will then spoil the child n make them difficult to get along with others when they grown up.Thats why i said,China will suffer from "1 child policy" in future........Mainland China is big n good,but it is rule by the stupid communist,really f**k up!!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The PRC wont get it right even if they make a mistake.A mistake is a mistake,they wont become a right.Besides,the policy is too inhuman n inconsiderate.They should let natural take the course,not to rush them.<br><br>You see,even now when our government encourage ppl to born more children,the result is discouraging.Human are not like pigs or other animals.When u want ppl to born more babies,they born more babies.When u want them to born less,they born less.<br><br>Human are not that obedient.We are highly sophisticated n far more complex animals.Thats why when PRC impose such law,they cannot expect the way they treat animals n use them to treat their own ppl.Again,F**K up communist.</div>
