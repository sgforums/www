            <div class='col-md body'>I never believe their figures.  Statistics can be manipulated, but numbers don't lie.  Give us the numbers.<br><br>And anyway, those who *do* managed to get employed either have to settle for lower-than-industry pay/increment, or take on alot of extra responsibility within the company (work load does not commensurate with pay and position).  The very few who actually get fair pay / workload without having to go out of their way to keep their jobs.<br><br>Heck, sometimes when u're in ur 40s, your management will decide to increase your quota to an impossible level, way above your peers, so that u appear like you cannot handle your position.. then they offer to demote you to, say, a clerical/admin position.  So either you accept your lower position and pay, or resign (which is what the company was trying to do in the 1st place).<br><br>This happened to some of my friends' parents.  Some of them have not found other jobs for more than 6 mths because they used to be in high managerial positions.</div>

This is where I was born and grew up. I should fight for what is rightfully mine. Just recently the Alpha-S hit the news again about pay. Where are the other unions? They sing the gahmen songs. A lot of us are jobless after graduating coz these companies want to pay us peanuts. Worse still, gahmen advocate by saying we need foreign 'talent'. Those who cannot tahan just grab first coz we got mouths to feed. You see, this report of rise in employment is a cover-up of the pain and anguish of many of us. Singaporeans are good workers coz they take small pay and the gahmen ensure there are no riots.<br><br></div>

Ranting in sgforums will not make any difference to your employability.<br><br>Employers will always sack older workers and look for younger ones unless  experience makes such a big difference to their business. Older workers command higher salaries, so unless your skill is in such high demand, you will lose your job to cheaper, younger workers who can do your job just as well. No point blaming the government..it's the law of the jungle in the commercial world.<br><br></div></blockquote>Mr mushroom... you made the wrong step in trying to explain things to these people... I have always tried to do the same thing as you in other threads, but everytime the same group of people will always argue back with their shallow and narrow insights... They blame everyone else except themselves...<br><br>I suppose most of you who replied here are unemployed eh? That is why you have so much time to reply threads in sgForums... Or maybe the very fact that you guys are online forum dwellers has lowered your industrial worth in terms of employment? Waste so much time online to whine and do nothing to improve your employability...<br><br>I know that I will be shot up-down-left-right-center for what I just said.... and for supporting Mr mushroom... and also for supporting the government...

Why should we run away from our homeland? This is where I was born and grew up. I should fight for what is rightfully mine. Just recently the Alpha-S hit the news again about pay. Where are the other unions? They sing the gahmen songs. A lot of us are jobless after graduating coz these companies want to pay us peanuts. Worse still, gahmen advocate by saying we need foreign 'talent'. Those who cannot tahan just grab first coz we got mouths to feed. You see, this report of rise in employment is a cover-up of the pain and anguish of many of us. Singaporeans are good workers coz they take small pay and the gahmen ensure there are no riots.<br><br></div></blockquote>Some money is better than no money. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>
