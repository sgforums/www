The problem comes when these $$$ are being<br>allocated or channeled based on justifications that many has come<br>to question its true intend. Is it to serve the people, to government<br>or simply to enrich a few well-connected indivudual ?<br><br>Take one example of the chopping of the Bus Travel Information<br>System by LTA in a single boardmeet. Didn't LTA head realise that<br>he/she is running a PUBLIC office and NOT a private one ?<br>Why the sudden and behind-door decision making without public<br>feedback? Whatever happened to the informous PTC (Public<br>Transport Council, http://www.ptc.gov.sg) which is supposed to be<br>part of the group responsible for feedback on Singapore's<br>transportation issue ? Were the council informed by LTA of their<br>decision to past the buck to the public operators ?<br><br>In fact, today's ST reported a different story from maker of this<br>system, Stratech Systems, whose executive chairman ,Mr Chew<br>says "there were  no problems with the software for its Bus Travel<br>Information System, or transit.smart and NO issue with the<br>technology used. Instead, he blame in on <strong>commercial   concerns and difficulties faced in coordinating work with the LTA and the two bus companies, SBS Transit and Trans-Island Bus Services (Tibs</strong>). He gave a parting shot :<br>"Everybody is doing what they are supposed to do - protecting their<br>own turf."<br><br>So some folks thanks of migrating simply that they are fedup with<br>to lack of commitment by the so-called governemnt-feedback<br>bodies?. I can't blame these "quiters".<br><br></div>

Should they?<br><br>Remember, we Â– the Citizens Â– are led to believe that there is a dearth of talent in Singapore; and whatever little talent there is, have been scooped up by the Ruling Political Party.<br><br>The remaining few in Opposition are supposed to be the laggards of the Talent Pool Â– so the propaganda machine has got this message across, each time when any Opposition dare to challenge the established line of thought.<br><br>Even those few "talented" Members from the Opposition, who have been elected into Parliament, are NOT to interfere in Matters of State, which is supposed to be in the hands of the Very Talented Few with the brains to handle such issues of the State and Matters relating to the International Scene.<br><br>Those Members of Parliament (from both sides of the Political Divide) elected to Parliament are NOT to interfere in Matters of the State, but to look after its IMMEDIATE Constituencies Â– on Conservancy Issues, Block Upgrading and Maintenance, keeping the drains clean and HDB Lifts working, attending to the immediate needs of the residence.<br><br>Any matters beyond such defined areas of responsibilities Â– including local transportation to the Constituencies Â– do not even involve the Member of Parliament for that affected Constituencies.<br><br>The Talented Few that are elected to Parliament, and take over Cabinet Posts, will be paid Million Dollar Salary; BUT most of the work is done by an army of younger researchers, engineers, thinkers, secretaries, clerks, accountants, and administrators - all of whom are paid less than a fraction of the Million Dollar Ministerial Salary.<br><br>When Singapore economy is doing well, it is due to the efficient policies of the Million Dollar Ministers.<br><br>However, when the Singapore economy is not doing so well, it is blamed on World Events that have affected all sectors of the Singapore Economy.<br><br>Yet, the success of SingaporeÂ’s Economy during the Good Times is NOT attributed to the events of the World at Large, but due to the intelligent policies of the Million Dollar Ministers.<br><br>When World Events caused the Singapore economy to crash, with large structural changes that result in massive job losses, the Million Dollar Ministers have no solutions to stave off the situation.<br><br>Are they not supposed to be the Talented Few from a limited pool of 4.5 million Singaporeans? The Very Best from the a very limited pool of Singaporean Talents?<br><br>It seems that talent only exist in the Talented Few, and extend to family members who then occupy High Paying Seats in the Boards of Directors of GLCÂ’s Â– in which remuneration also run in Million Dollars with stock and bonds options.<br><br>At one time, it was reported that our Senior Minister had admired the Japanese Corporate Management style - as the Chairman or CEO will take FULL RESPONSIBILITY for the poor performance and failures of the Corporation, and will resign from the Company. There was no shifting of blame and responsibilities attributed to others.<br><br>SingaporeÂ’s economy is a small fraction of the Japanese Economy, and comparable to the turnover of the biggest Japanese Conglomerate.<br><br>We have seen the failures of GLCÂ’s investments, as well as Government Policies, and yet the Ministers and / or CEO remained and even got elevated to higher posts.<br><br>Is the Opposition to be blamed for these events?<br><br>Certainly, an emphatic - NO.<br><br>It is the Singapore Citizens who should be blamed for being parochial to their own immediate interests, and for expecting everything placed on the plate before them.<br><br>What has the Singapore Citizens done to cultivate and nurture the supposed Â“Lower TalentÂ” into a Higher Performing Opposition, who can represent their interest, as an Alternative Fall Back measure?<br><br>The culture of fear and self-survival takes priority, and with such a mentality being encouraged by the Political Party that is in power.<br><br>Three cheers for Â“KiasuismÂ” and Â“Kiasi-ismÂ”.<br><br>Singaporeans harvest what they sow, and deserves the fruits of their non-labor or labor.<br><br></div>

Just by comparing with other countries we know we are living in a great country. But people always keep asking for more.
