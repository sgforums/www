            <div class='col-md body'>Temasek is despised by number of garmens not becasue its a Singapore investment company BUT because of the close links to the Lee family right from the CEO of Temasek to the CEO of Singtel. Foreign governments and their media are always quick to point out how Ho Ching is linked to the Prime Minister who is also the son of LKY.Foreigners see it as a family run organisation using Singaporeans money. The question is whether all this family related publicity doing Temasek any good or is it harming the company and its investment interest? Lets not even discuss transparency of GIC and Temasek.</div>

Look at it from the view point of their people, if lets say today Temasek took over the controlling interest of a big company that has up to 3000 people under its pay-roll.  What will happen if (big if here hor) Temasek should break up the company, strip it of it's most valuable assets and sells it off.  What do you think will happen to those 3000 people?  Normal business will be a large-scale lay-off rite?<br><br>While I don't think Temasek is so bad, in a way I can understand how their people might feel.  If some other country's gov was to take over control of my company, I too will feel threaten by it and start to wonder if retranchment is in the cards for me.</div>
