              <p>A lot of discussions about this currently in other forums. What do you think of an opposition candidate who once voted for the PAP? Did he make the right choice? Should he have voted differently since he was a member of the opposition?</p>
              <blockquote>
              <h6 class="uiStreamMessage"><span class="messageBody">A Vote For The Other Side<br>Last
              Sunday, during WP's walkabout at Nee Soon East SMC &amp; Ang Mo Kio
              GRC. A party member shared with me about rumblings in a local Internet
              forum (Sammy Boy) that some forum participants were unable to reconcile
              with the fact that I voted for Teo Ho Pin in GE2006.<br><br>This party member subsequently sent me the forum link here.<br><br>I
              am of the view that it is a trait for humans to operate within the
              paradigms of subjectivity and objectivity. Personally, I do not believe
              in opposition for opposition's sake. In this regard, there is nothing
              inherently wrong for me to vote for an MP, regardless of his/ her
              partisan background, whom in my opinion is the better man who can
              better serve the interests of Singapore and my community (Bukit Panjang
              SMC).<br><br>Consciously in so doing, I have raised my understanding on
              a required 'standard for parliamentary entry'. In another words, being
              a forefront partisan activist, myself am of the view that a particular
              candidate from the ruling regime deserves my vote rather than another
              from the opposition, this invariably reminded me that, the WP has to
              'strive so much harder', 'offer so much more' and 'convince so much
              more' in order 'to get there'.<br><br>Actually during GE06 itself,
              there were also some in WP who raised their eye brows when I shared
              with them that I will be voting for Teo Ho Pin. On polling day, one
              urged me that since the incumbent will win anyway I should perhaps
              'spoil my vote' instead. However as a citizen of our constitutional
              state, I take my voting duty very seriously and will never waste my
              precious vote, unless the political circumstances really warrant it.<br><br>The
              interesting question perhaps would be, if a WP candidate is to offer
              himself/ herself for election in the constituency I reside, will I vote
              for this WP candidate? Partisan considerations will certainly weigh
              heavily in my considerations. Having said that, ultimately this WP
              candidate has to convince me that he/ she has what it take to better
              serve the interests of our country and the constituents to win my vote.<br>Posted by Yaw Shin Leong at 7:16 AM </span></h6>

              <p>it's in yesterday's newspapers, page A11,</p>
              <p><strong>"Yaw won't vote for PAP again" </strong></p>
              <p>In it, he says he's voting for James Gomez (of the missing nomination papers fame, who happened to be an ex WP member ... ), this time round ...</p>
              <p>because, he says " An opposition leader voting for the ruling party send out a 'very confusing signal' to supporters, and went against the opposition's goal.</p>
              <p>that article stuck in my mind, cos it also revealed that one of the young WP babes this time round, angela oon, also only got her citizenship in july last year and shortly after joined the party.</p>
              <p>I dunno which one came first, the ST or this one, but what he's written and did, was the right thing to do ..... I only hope that he could be consistent in his convictions, and that other opposition members could have the same convictions about his responsibilities as a voter as this chap did.</p>

              <p>if the WP comes to my estate it'll be a real dilemma for the voters in my household ... they have been doing and saying a lot of right things since the last elections, and got rid of a lot of dead weights (which went away to other parties, like the SDP) .... I say they are on the right track to be an opposition that's right for singapore, not opposing just for the sake of opposing.</p>
              <p>my folks thought it was the NSP that's coming, so they said they cannot vote for someone who's taken naughty pics of his maid before  ... but I said nope, the SDP is coming ... so I know which party they'd definitely NOT be voting for ..... </p>

              <p>If you belong to a particular party, you should vote for that party. No qns asked. Otherwise why join that party? Imagine the sec-gen of PAP voting for an opposition party. What kind of message does he send to his party cadres?</p>
              <p>He voted for PAP's Teo Ho Pin because he can better serve the interests of Singapore and Bukit Panjang.....right....then look at the rising costs of living after PAP had gotten their self proclaimed mandate. And look at the wet markets issue in Bkt Panjang SMC....they were acquired by Sheng Siong and turned into air con makets, higher prices too. So Yaw Shin Leong had a contributory hand in that because he voted for Teo.</p>

              <p>if the WP comes to my estate it'll be a real dilemma for the voters in my household ... they have been doing and saying a lot of right things since the last elections, and got rid of a lot of dead weights (which went away to other parties, like the SDP) .... I say they are on the right track to be an opposition that's right for singapore, not opposing just for the sake of opposing.</p>
              <p>my folks thought it was the NSP that's coming, so they said they cannot vote for someone who's taken naughty pics of his maid before  ... but I said nope, the SDP is coming ... so I know which party they'd definitely NOT be voting for ..... </p>

              <p>Todate, the only opposition party in Singapore which is credible, with good track record, organized, talk sense, is the WP.</p>
              <p>Chiam as an individual is credible as an opposition, but he have not been able to manage a party. Any rambo, no matter how strong he is, he grows old, his body will fail.</p>

              <p>Chiam looks to be in terrible physical shape ... i'm not sure if lau lee would last through another term, and i'm not sure chiam looks like he could, either .... as much as he is the elder stateman of opposition politics, I was quite disappointed to hear him say that the opposition could actually form the next goverment. To me, that is just hubris.</p>
              <p>The WP are standing out because they are saying and doing the right things, most of all by getting rid of a lot of dead weights that went away to other parties, that was dragging the party's credibility down. At the recent TV debates I think the only opposition party that stood out was WP. Incidently, the WP was the only opposition party that also understood and acknowledged that the opposition won't be able to form an effective goverment, not by this election. </p>
              <p>heard it on the radio when they stated that they are a party that won't oppose for the sake of opposing, and not bitch about any policies that the MIW tables. That's how it should be, and what thinking voters would like to hear.</p>
              <p>I personally think, that chen show mao is another dead weight. For all of his gold plated academic credentials, did the WP really think he's someone who could really connect with the voters ? I mean, have you heard this guy's mandarin interviews ? Can someone who speaks english with an ang moh accent, (something that vincent wijeysingha and kenneth jeyaratnam is also guilty of), and speaks mandarin with an alien, mainland accent, someone who's been away for 30 years connect with heartlanders ? ....true, he is a Singapore citizen, a taiwanese born but got his citzenship in 1986 ... so do the math .... he's been abroad for over 30 years ..... that means that he's away from singapore for most of the time after he got his citizenship. The PAP has often been accused of foisting foreign born candidates onto the voters, it is perplexing that the WP would chose to do the same thing, especially so when the influx of immigrants in recent years have caused unhappiness about foreigners who "chopped" a singapore citizenship and then went away on the advantage of our red passport to yet another country.</p>

              <p>actually, George Yeo can speak mandarin, he's given speeches in mandarin before .... and not in a mainland accent like chen show mao either, but like you and me, I think he speaks malay and his dialect, teochew, as well, but nevermind about the chap.</p>
              <p>you're right to say that chen cannot fight alone .... he's got to be hidden in a team, given his background, though the WP seems very keen to push this chap out to the front.</p>
              <p>This chap is different from other foreign born candidates in the worker's party. Take angela oon for example, the babe of WP, true, she's a malaysian who only got her singapore citizenship last year, but she's been here since a toddler, she was here the last 30 years, she went through the good times and bad here, so in this sense she has a more concrete stake in Singapore than this particular gentleman. Someone like that, whether in the WP or PAP, it's fine.</p>
              <p>Now imagine if Chen came out as a PAP candidate instead of an opposition one, can you imagine the kind of flak he would have caught, as someone who disappeared for 30 years after getting his citizenship, who doesn't even live here till this elections, who doesn't even speak like us ? Can someone like that be expected to connect with the heartland grassroots ? He would have been buried so deep online if he were a PAP candidate.</p>
              <p> And that's the irony here, it seems that the negative sentiments are so strong on the ground that many are quite happy to lap up, swallow and praise whoever the opposition throws up as candidates. There's this strange silence ... where are the chaps who used to snipe at some of the PAP MPs and office holders just for being foreign born ?  I'll find it very very sad if this man were to be able to ride on the current wave of popular dissatisfaction with the MIW into parliament, and WP and the other opposition parties would do well to remember that if they do win in the coming elections, it's actually not so much an affirmation of their capabilities, or their proposed policies, but rather, simply discontent against the MIW.</p>

              <p>I saw this bit in bangkok, I wouldn't have been so pissed off if they didn't show this ...</p>
              <p>Here is a man who got his citizenship and soon after stayed away for 30 years, but he's still benefiting from the system ?!?!?!?! ....</p>
              <p>if it was just another regular chap who did this, say an ordinary ah tiong, or even a PAP candidate, wouldn't people be cussing and swearing at him ? Reminds me of this ah tiong storeman chap I knew in the army, he got his citizenship, was flummoxed to be called up for NS, and right after farked off to oz on the strength of our red passport. I wonder if he got his growth dividend this time round too.</p>
              <p>How ironic, that while one of the major sources of discontent against the ruling party this time round is the influx of foreigners leeching on our country, the worker's party threw up this candiate upon the people, it's almost making a mockery of the electorate, I'd say. And where were the people who were railing against people like him ? ... someone who just comes in, plumbed for a red passport, and soon after disappeared from Singapore ?</p>
              <p>Like I said before, imagine a PAP candidate with a similar background doing this, "true ! ... I was born in taiwan, true, I moved away from Singapore soon after I got my Singapore Citizenship and stayed overseas for 30 years, but my passport is still red, and the goverment still gives me money inspite of me being away for 30 years" ...... in any other case people would have been railing against him and calling for his blood .....</p>
              <p>But ....... because he is an opposition candidate, there is this deafening and ironic silence ...</p>
