            <div class='col-md body'>public housing is supposed to be afforable to the people, in Masia it is called low cost housing, meaning the cost is low but in singapore it is not low cost, it deviates from its original aim,HDB came out with so many fanciful scheme, making public housing unaffordable to many ppl, because prices of flats keep increasing and salary stays stagnant, I wonder how the youngsters can afford their first house nowadays. This will delay their marriage in order  to save some money for their downpayment, and they dare not have children early due to affordability issues and therefore the population will decrease over time, this is real, it is a chain reaction,</div>
