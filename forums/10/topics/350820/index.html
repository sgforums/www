              Do you all know of this:
              
              PA did not deny northwest CDC staff bonus rumors
              According to rumors circulating on the internet lately, two staff of Northwest CDC received 8 months of bonuses last year which also includes the 13th month bonus.
              
              The rumor was started by a forumer who posted it on the CNA forum. It was subsequently picked up by a blogger who wrote to Northwest CDC Mayor Dr Teo Ho Pin to seek for clarifications.
              
              Our radio station had tried to contact Dr Teo too, but was unable to do so as he is currently overseas. Northwest CDC refused to comment on our queries and referred us to the Peopleâ€™s Association (PA) which is the overall in charge of the 5 CDCs in Singapore.
              
              In the interview, PA did not verify or refute the rumors. Its official stance is: the wages of CDCâ€™s staff are set within the guidelines of the National Wage Council. This means that the wages are fixed using multiple flexible components depending on the workerâ€™s performance and economic background.

              Huge leftover of fund doesn't mean that the staff can take it as bonuses for themselves. If that is the case they wouldn't have any incentive to plan any courses or program  to help the people.
              
              Maybe i think i should apply for a job there.

              <p><br>That is under PA right?  If it is under PA, the staff is given fixed travel allowance and if used up what is given there is no claim for it.    For those staff doing events are to work very late like past 11 pm.  Turnover rate for this sort of position is very high.</p>
              <p>Whatever, PA being a non profit organisation paying so high bonus at this worst economic downturn is questionable.</p>

              <p>Only a rumour, but even if it's true what is wrong with receiving a big bonus? It's not like the receivers are responsible for losing billions of our dollars.</p>
              <p>Say a old newspaper collector worked his ass off everyday last year. The boss thinks he is a hardworking responsible man and decide to give him more money. Anything wrong with that? Just because all the man's neighbours and relatives and friends are losing jobs makes it wrong for him wrong to receive the bonus?</p>
              <p>And why is it insensitive? It's not like the receiver of the bonus go around laughing at people who got retrenched. In fact, whoever started circulating this information most likely obtained it by questionable means. He/She is the one that is disclosing other people's private and confidential information.</p>

              <p>Only a rumour, but even if it's true what is wrong with receiving a big bonus? It's not like the receivers are responsible for losing billions of our dollars.</p>
              <p>Say a old newspaper collector worked his ass off everyday last year. The boss thinks he is a hardworking responsible man and decide to give him more money. Anything wrong with that? Just because all the man's neighbours and relatives and friends are losing jobs makes it wrong for him wrong to receive the bonus?</p>
              <p>And why is it insensitive? It's not like the receiver of the bonus go around laughing at people who got retrenched. In fact, whoever started circulating this information most likely obtained it by questionable means. He/She is the one that is disclosing other people's private and confidential information.</p>

              <p>bro, there is differentiation in your comment. firstly garang guni is privately own. as long as they dont take govt money, no one care hwo much they paid to employee.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>How do we draw the line when another civil servant who go oversea spent lavishly and got reprimanded for being inconsiderate?</p>
              <p>does paying CDC workers 8 mths bonus sound sensitive to average joe in singapore?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>maybe singapore is running like an AIG or merril Lynch, where the performance of workers is depend on individually and not on the generally condition of the economy.</p>

              <p>Firstly, it's a rumour. So lets not be quick to judge here.</p>

              <p>It is unrealistic to say that bonuses should be fixed at a certain number of months in the civil service.</p>

              <p>personally i dont it is a rumour. coz i heard from radio some minister was ask to comment on this issue but he said, like what BOA CEO lewis said, " it is necessary to pay top dollar to top ppl".</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>yeah sure, ppl in govt sector with bonus not tight to the economy but to individual bonus? can you imagine what the bonus would like in good times?12mths?  make a guess!</p>
