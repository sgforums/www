            <div class='col-md body'>The PTC Fare hike that was recently debated in parliment produced little ans and even more questions.<br><br>It was indeed heartening to see over 20 MPs taking the stand to voice their concerns and that of the public over the poor timing of the implementation of the rise in transport costs for SMRT and SBS transit.<br><br>However it was equally disheartening to see zero progress made other than the fact that care and discretion will be taken into account in such future cases. (how strange since the only result was that some form of assurance was made by Yeo Cheow Tong  to consider the sensitive aspects of such a dramatic fee hike in the future)<br><br>MPs like Ong Ah Heng (who concidentially chairs the labour union) actually lambasted several MPs for taking the PTC and transport portfolio to task for upping transport hikes. No attempt was made on his part to be more diplomatic and point out significant issues on the part of the SMRT and SBS such as employee wages and improvements (changes are more like it) justified (in a manner of speaking) the increases. Instead he spoke as if he was simply trying to sweep away all the "pestering" criticisms concerning the hike.<br><br>In truth, such obvious disregard of important issues by MPs can only bode poorly for future generations of leaders. Such MPs present themselves as uncaring and seemingly uninterested in the views of the general public. It's as if they sit back smugly secure in the knowledge that they have already been re-elected, hence these affairs are of limited interest to them.<br><br>If such attitude proliferates, one wonders about the kind political backlash that would be inflicted by a disgrunted community seeking merely the basic needs - to be heard and understood.<br><br>Incidently, it would interesting to note that despite all the appeals to postpone the hike or at least freeze it temporarily, no compromise was reached. In fact, the MPs concerned (we all know who they are) vehemently defended the decision of the PTC and subsequently supported it by justifying its actions. I especially like the one that states:<br><br>".....transport hike was implemented.....because we felt a small increase now was better than a larger rise after the recession...." or something like that.<br><br>As one disappointed consumer pointed out, no attempt was made to survey the public or convey this question: whether the ppl would have prefered a small increase now or a larger one later. No effort was made to pump in a "small" amt of money into commissioning an inquest from the public to prevent a "large" outcry on the final decision made.<br><br>It's therefore easier in the eyes of the public to have a rather mercenery outlook of the transport companies concerned...but hey like they all say........<br><br>Business is business......</div>
