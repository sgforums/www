Improved chamber designs and methods have made such experiments feasible in mammalian neurons, especially at ambient pressures &lt;5 atmospheres absolute (ATA). Here we summarize these methods, the physiologically relevant test pressures, potential research applications, and results of previous research, focusing on the significance of electrophysiological studies at &lt;5 ATA. Intracellular recordings and tissue PO2 measurements in slices of rat brain demonstrate how to differentiate the neuronal effects of increased gas pressures from pressure per se. Examples also highlight the use of hyperoxia (3 ATA O2) as a model for studying the cellular mechanisms of oxidative stress in the mammalian central nervous system.<br><br>anesthesia; carbon dioxide toxicity; free radicals; high-pressure nervous syndrome; membrane potential; nitrogen narcosis; oxidative stress; oxygen toxicity; polarographic oxygen electrode<br><br>Source: <a href="http://jap.physiology.org/cgi/content/full/95/3/883" rel="nofollow">Journal of Applied Physiology</a><br><br>One quote to describe some of the participants in this forum.<br><br>A fool can ask more questions in an hour than a wiseman can answer in seven years.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>This forum has gone to the dogs!!!</div>

This is his account:<br><br>"Thanks to Stompers for advice. We fixed car and contacted National Parks. We'll post the outcome, if any.<br><br>"Parking along roads within Wessex Estate is legal. Unless they can walk a kilometer or more, every visitor or tenant must park along the road.<br><br>"Webster dictionary defines "Act of God" as "a natural and unavoidable catastrophe that interrupts the expected course of events," and a falling branch (especially if it falls on us) is thus more tragedy than catastrophe.<br><br>"In most countries, insurance would pay without argument, and policyholders would not lose the discount for the first claim of this type.

Improved chamber designs and methods have made such experiments feasible in mammalian neurons, especially at ambient pressures &lt;5 atmospheres absolute (ATA). Here we summarize these methods, the physiologically relevant test pressures, potential research applications, and results of previous research, focusing on the significance of electrophysiological studies at &lt;5 ATA. Intracellular recordings and tissue PO2 measurements in slices of rat brain demonstrate how to differentiate the neuronal effects of increased gas pressures from pressure per se.

Time to take some good old English while you are in the UK now. This is kinda hard to believe coming from a person of your calibre. An accident will occur when either one party is negligent, failed to maintain ensure due care when switching lanes, failed to keep proper distance from the car in front, etc. One party of a motor vehicle will most need to prove the negligence of the other party, in order for him to pursue his claim for damages.<br><br>Seriously, the standard of your English is appalling despite you being in the UK. Just some personal advice you should get yourself more indemnity insurance for malpractice.</div>
