              <p>Despite the shock, the 30-year-old was able to keep in control of the truck and avoid hitting nearby vehicles.</p>
              <p>He managed to stop the truck 20m down the road.</p>
              <p>Mr Mohamed Nazir said he was driving on the left-most lane along Thomson Road, heading for the Pan Island Expressway exit, to deliver perishable goods to Changi Airport.</p>
              <p>Shortly after he passed an Electronic Road Pricing gantry, a thick, 1m-long tree branch crashed onto the truck.</p>
              <p>A small part of the branch broke and smashed through the windscreen.</p>
              <p>It hit Mr Mohamed Nazir's assistant Mr Nadarajah Ganesalingam, 50, in the chest, leaving him with some bruises and cuts.</p>
              <p>Mr Nadarajah also had trouble seeing after some pieces of glass flew into his eyes.</p>
              <p>The accident happened at around 1.30pm, at the stretch of road opposite the flower nurseries.</p>
              <p>When The New Paper on Sunday arrived at the scene an hour later, both driver and assistant still looked shaken.</p>
              <p>The front part of the truck was partly dented, and glass shards could be seen inside and outside the vehicle.</p>
              <p>A long trail of debris and tyre marks could be seen on the road.</p>
              <p>Mr Mohamed Nazir, who has speech and hearing problems, spoke through his supervisor, who wished to be known only as Melvin.</p>
              <p>The supervisor arrived at the scene after the workers called him.</p>
              <p>LUCKY</p>
              <p>Mr Mohamed Nazir said he was lucky that the larger part of the tree branch had slammed onto the front of the truck and not onto him.</p>
              <p>He said through his supervisor: 'The truck's body saved my life.</p>
              <p>'I'd have been seriously injured if that had happened.'</p>
              <p>The driver also said he was lucky that he managed to keep control of the vehicle.</p>
              <p>Just before impact, two cars were travelling ahead of him and a truck was on his right, he recalled.</p>
              <p>Mr Nadarajah said everything happened very quickly.</p>
              <p>At around 3pm, a police car and an ambulance arrived to take both victims to the hospital.</p>
              <p>A replacement truck was arranged by the supervisor to continue the delivery of the goods. The damaged truck was towed away.</p>
              <p>The supervisor said his two workers and the truck are covered under personal and vehicle insurance respectively.</p>
              <p>However, he said he was unsure if his company could make an insurance claim with the relevant government agencies.<br> <br> </p>

              <p>Government supporters will claim that it's an act of god (force majeure).</p>
              <p>If it was raining, they will say the rain caused the trunk to fall.</p>
              <p>If it wasn't raining, they will say that the wind was too strong, thereby causing the branches to snap off and land on the car.</p>
              <p>If it wasn't raining or breezy, they will claim that the heat from the sun was to intense and resulted in the subdermal destruction of the fibres which resulted in the trunk falling on the car.</p>
              <p>If it wasn't raining, breezy, or sunny, then they will claim that it's supernatural force from spirits which cause the branch to snap and fall. Some will even claim that it's retribution for the driver and passenger.</p>
              <p>Whatever it is, it is not the fault of negligence from governmental agencies to ensure the safety of these trees.</p>
