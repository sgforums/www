That's why most legal actions are constrained.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Berry v. Sugar Notch Borough</strong></span><br><br><strong>Brief Fact Summary</strong><br>Plaintiff was running his car on borough street in a violent wind storm. As he passed under a tree, it was blown down crushing the roof of his car and causing him serious injury. Plaintiff was running his car in excess of the speed limit as permitted by a borough ordinance.<br><br><strong>Rule of Law and Holding</strong><br>Plaintiff's rate of speed did not cause or contribute to the harm that he suffered. His actions did not increase the foreseeable likelihood that a tree would fall on his car. It cannot be said that plaintiff was contributorily negligent. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Thus, Plaintiff's recovery is sustained.</span></strong></span> <br><br>Source: <a href="http://www.audiocasefiles.com/cases/detail/case/9059/" rel="nofollow">http://www.audiocasefiles.com/cases/detail/case/9059/</a><br></div>

As they get older the frequency of such accidents will increase, the day will come when several trees will collapse on the same time if still they think the aging  trees are more precious than that of human lives.<br></div>

I have done so a few times in the past and was very pleased with their response. Just a short letter describing the location and state of the tree was sufficient.<br><br>As far as tree trimming is concerned, you can make a difference. Their resources are limited and while they conduct regular pruning/trimming, you can help them by highlighting to them any problem areas you see.</div>
