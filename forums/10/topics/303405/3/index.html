How can you be certain that a riot will occur because of the protest? There are many peaceful protest going around all over the world, doesn't mean that a peaceful protest will 100% lead to violence.<br><br>Only if members of the public complain then N. Parks is at fault, like as if everyone has those elevator cranes to sneak a peek at the branches up close. That's like telling customers who take ferris wheel ride that, only if they see a possible failure in the ferris wheel and report it, then the business owner will be liable for negligence if the ferris wheel falls apart. I am glad you are not operating the MRT system, because I have no access to the tracks to tell you that the tracks are damaged if they are.<br><br>If a healthy tree were to break and fall due to storm or earthquake. Then you have to ask yourself about reasonably forseeable, is it expected that the tree will fall during a storm (because a storm is common in Singapore), if it is then it's N. Park's liability because they forsee the occurence but did not take action. If you talk about earthquakes, what is the magnitude of earthquake, because there are no major quakes in Singapore as yet. If a 6.0 ritcher scale quake happens and the tree falls then it was unexpected, because quakes don't happen in Singapore, so it's not reasonably forseeable, so it's an act of god.<br><br>Take the case of,<br><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Berry v. Sugar Notch Borough</strong></span><br><br><strong>Brief Fact Summary</strong><br>Plaintiff was running his car on borough street in a violent wind storm. As he passed under a tree, it was blown down crushing the roof of his car and causing him serious injury. Plaintiff was running his car in excess of the speed limit as permitted by a borough ordinance.<br><br><strong>Rule of Law and Holding</strong><br>Plaintiff's rate of speed did not cause or contribute to the harm that he suffered. His actions did not increase the foreseeable likelihood that a tree would fall on his car. It cannot be said that plaintiff was contributorily negligent. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Thus, Plaintiff's recovery is sustained.</span></strong></span> <br><br>Source: <a href="http://www.audiocasefiles.com/cases/detail/case/9059/" rel="nofollow">http://www.audiocasefiles.com/cases/detail/case/9059/</a><br><br>Wasn't there a violent wind storm, yet the defendant wasn't discharged from the suit.<br><br>Ermm.....<br><br>I disagree with your statement that if my pot of plant were to fall, I would not be at fault, because a person can resonably forsee that the potted plant's fall will hurt someone. As for the earthquake causing the potted plant to fall, I think I would still be at fault because I can reasonably forsee that the plant can fall and hurt someone below. Does not mean just because it's an earthquake it's an act of god and can disclaim all liability. Same as the N.Park's case.<br><br>Well, not having enough manpower is not an excuse for negligence. With their knowledge of botany, they can implement a system to identify problem trees or areas where they think trees will be at risk. It's not all the trees in Singapore, only trees which are in publicly accessible areas.</div>

Singapore's legal system is based on common law, based on cases from the past, there is some legal precedence in some jurisdiction. It's possible to form some legal arguments based on the case and the judge's ruling.<br><br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_law" rel="nofollow"><br>In common law legal systems, the law is created and/or refined by judges: a decision in the case currently pending depends on decisions in previous cases and affects the law to be applied in future cases. When there is no authoritative statement of the law, common law judges have the authority and duty to "make" law by creating precedent.[1] The body of precedent is called "common law" and it binds future decisions. In future cases, when parties disagree on what the law is, an "ideal" common law court looks to past precedential decisions of relevant courts. If a similar dispute has been resolved in the past, the court is bound to follow the reasoning used in the prior decision (this principle is known as stare decisis). If, however, the court finds that the current dispute is fundamentally distinct from all previous cases, it will decide as a "matter of first impression." Thereafter, the new decision becomes precedent, and will bind future courts under the principle of stare decisis.<br></a><br><br></div>
