However, force majeure is not intended to excuse negligence or other malfeasance of a party, as where non-performance is caused by the usual and natural consequences of external forces (e.g., predicted rain stops an outdoor event), or where the intervening circumstances are specifically contemplated.<br><br>Source: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force_majeure" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force_majeure</a><br><br>If your definition of storm being an Act of God were true, then it would be a very sad day for alot of insurance contracts.<br><br>Meaning, if there were ever a storm and motorist gets involved in accidents, they won't be able to process any insurance claim, due to your fallacious definition of "Act of God" (aka force majeure).

            <div class='col-md body'>not only old trees.. young trees will oso topple over easily or break during storms or strong winds.. we cannot control broken tree branches n the toppling of the trees even if the govt or wadsoeva is gona trim their branches  because ......<br><br>1. Wet soil due to the rain reduces the ability of the root system to anchor the tree and high winds in such situations are more readily able to cause toppling.. ( dun tell me those ppl can control the climate in sg ) so no matter how u trim oso useless.. accidents are bound to happen<br><br>2. Trees infected with root rot diseases (which are commonly associated wif wet conditions) are oso more susceptible to topplin in heavy winds..<br><br>generally.. extent of dmg depends on soil type and wind speeds.. so if u wana blame sum1.. go blame the climate in sg instead.. thus NPB will not compensate<br><br>and u duno whether the tree tat had been toppled over is a native or a non native tree.. non native trees has low storm resistance...their low storm resistance causes these trees to break and split more easily..<br>so TS.. if u really wan to reduce such things from happening again.. u shud go write to NPB, ask dem to grow more native trees in sg -.-<br><br>so conclusion is.. u duno whether is due to climate or negligence of NPB tat causes the tree/branches to topple over.. jus because of this i dun tink NPB will compensate the victims.. an apology ? maybe.. try ur luck zz</div>

              <p><strong>CLOSE CALL FOR DRIVER ON THOMSON ROAD <br>FALLING BRANCH SLAMS INTO MOVING TRUCK  <br>By Kor Kian Beng <br> <br>February 18, 2008</strong>       <br> <br>DRIVING his freezer truck along Thomson Road was an everyday event - until part of a tree came smashing through his windscreen yesterday afternoon.<br> <br>A piece of theaction: Driver Mohamed Nazir Abdul Aziz (far right) and his assistant, MrNadarajah Ganesalingam, holding the piece of tree branch that crashed into their truck.  <br>In a flash, Mr Mohamed Nazir Abdul Aziz's face and body were covered with glass shards.</p>
              <p>Despite the shock, the 30-year-old was able to keep in control of the truck and avoid hitting nearby vehicles.</p>
              <p>He managed to stop the truck 20m down the road.</p>
              <p>Mr Mohamed Nazir said he was driving on the left-most lane along Thomson Road, heading for the Pan Island Expressway exit, to deliver perishable goods to Changi Airport.</p>
              <p>Shortly after he passed an Electronic Road Pricing gantry, a thick, 1m-long tree branch crashed onto the truck.</p>
              <p>A small part of the branch broke and smashed through the windscreen.</p>
              <p>It hit Mr Mohamed Nazir's assistant Mr Nadarajah Ganesalingam, 50, in the chest, leaving him with some bruises and cuts.</p>
              <p>Mr Nadarajah also had trouble seeing after some pieces of glass flew into his eyes.</p>
              <p>The accident happened at around 1.30pm, at the stretch of road opposite the flower nurseries.</p>
              <p>When The New Paper on Sunday arrived at the scene an hour later, both driver and assistant still looked shaken.</p>
              <p>The front part of the truck was partly dented, and glass shards could be seen inside and outside the vehicle.</p>
              <p>A long trail of debris and tyre marks could be seen on the road.</p>
              <p>Mr Mohamed Nazir, who has speech and hearing problems, spoke through his supervisor, who wished to be known only as Melvin.</p>
              <p>The supervisor arrived at the scene after the workers called him.</p>
              <p>LUCKY</p>
              <p>Mr Mohamed Nazir said he was lucky that the larger part of the tree branch had slammed onto the front of the truck and not onto him.</p>
              <p>He said through his supervisor: 'The truck's body saved my life.</p>
              <p>'I'd have been seriously injured if that had happened.'</p>
              <p>The driver also said he was lucky that he managed to keep control of the vehicle.</p>
              <p>Just before impact, two cars were travelling ahead of him and a truck was on his right, he recalled.</p>
              <p>Mr Nadarajah said everything happened very quickly.</p>
              <p>At around 3pm, a police car and an ambulance arrived to take both victims to the hospital.</p>
              <p>A replacement truck was arranged by the supervisor to continue the delivery of the goods. The damaged truck was towed away.</p>
              <p>The supervisor said his two workers and the truck are covered under personal and vehicle insurance respectively.</p>
              <p>However, he said he was unsure if his company could make an insurance claim with the relevant government agencies. <br> <br> </p>
