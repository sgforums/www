            <div class='col-md body'>It is a false assumption for people to say that we have elected the ruling party as our government and therefore the ministers can do almost anything as they like because they are perceived to have the mandate to do so.<br><br>We have already seen that they as ministers may not have the legal authority to take any pays or bonuses or life pensions as they like based on such a perception. In other words if some citizens are to take up a case in the law court somewhat like someone who takes up a case in our court to sue the church for exorcism the citizens might well have a good case to beginpolitics.<br><br>If there is constant taxing and backcharging of fees to recover all sorts of costs relating to essential government services normally funded by taxes then it is wrong for government to govern the country in this manner.<br><br>If there are so many NKF problems affecting the whole government now so deeply as subsequently discovered after many years of lack of accountable and open governing then it is time to sort out such internal problems with thorough reviews of not just at the top but at the middle and lower level of government machinery.<br><br>So it is quite wrong to carry on investing people's monies in Shin Corp or Tien Tsing or Russia or UBS without correcting such internal weaknesses.<br><br>Don't keep using the same old excuse that Singapore is unique or a small country to let the ministers ignore people's feedbacks and do as they like.<br><br>Show us you are the real talents who could serve the people to solve all their pressing problems created by past mistakes in policies instead of all the hypocrisy and denials or asking people's to change their mindset. How about leaders changing their mindsets first.<br><br>Remember ministers are no longer doing their jobs with sacrifice like in the 1960s or 1970s but are nowadays paid the fullest and above-market million-dollar pays and as such should fulfill all the reasonable expectations of people as highest-paid professionals and get their works done without claiming credit for past any glories.<br><br>Don't tell us citizens that you as leaders can just simply do as you like and always try to publish only your one-sided views and reports through your controlled press and media and ignore people's suffering or repeated NKF problems and all the malpractices or irregularities seen in latest policies e.g. unilateral increases of GST despite all the continuing surpluses and ministers' and civil servants' salaries without correcting any shortcoming.</div>

If government stops sucking all the people's monies with all kinds of direct and indirect taxes and profiteering schemes cooked up by its GLCs, people will have more disposable incomes and with higher disposable incomes more people will be able to go into businesses and keep the economic wheel turning instead of idling in the state idle surpluses which slow down the economy.<br><br>Go and ask an economist whether sucking up all the people's monies through big-ticket taxations like the double-charging on land by HDB or triple taxations on vehicle ownership will help in creating our own local investments.<br><br>The Hong Kong economy has the unusual fizz mentioned once by MM Lee precisely because its people have more disposable incomes to form greater saving and go into businesses to keep the economy vibrant.<br><br>Go and check the many authoritative studies and reports generated by past economic structuring and review committees during the last three recessions and you will no doubt get a more complete picture to see how the Singapore economy has contracted over the period 1980s - 1990s due to high taxes of all kinds and not just the corporate taxes. This lethargy of our own local investments is attributable to nothing else but the government sucking up too much monies from the people into idle its own state coffers thereby stifling our economic growth.<br><br>If Dr. Goh Keng Swee is still in the government instead of our new ministers he might have come up with a new solution and change direction to free up such idle monies so that the government will better generate growth of our own local investments through the people which will at the end enable it to collect even bigger tax revenues and score more success.<br><br>MM Lee must change his own mindset.

If they had built a transport system like Tokyo, where the MRT travels faster than the car (no kidding... their MRT have multiple lanes and the express service skips many stations) and also their highly extensive railway network, fewer people would consider buying a car.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>This i disagree with you. When a small handful of people have a problem, it could be due to individual failure. When a large majority have the same problem, its very likely the problem comes from a systematic failure of some policies.<br><br>Why didnt the former Transport Minister see the implication of raising car ownership? If they had built a transport system like Tokyo, where the MRT travels faster than the car (no kidding... their MRT have multiple lanes and the express service skips many stations) and also their highly extensive railway network, fewer people would consider buying a car. In fact, most people in Tokyo dont buy a car, when they well could afford to. </strong><br><br>Actually I disagree that it is a systematic failure of some policies by the government. It's just that parents pamper their children giving them everything they want and people grow up used to getting what they want and they don't even think about the cost factor anymore. It is a social problem but in the end it is caused by the citizens. It is a worldwide problem anyway. So ultimately it boils down to face and wanting the high life without thinking of the consequences and working for it. So what do you want the government to do? Make laws that it is illegal to spoil your kids and there is a fine if you don't instil the correct values in them?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Actually in Tokyo it is not a problem to buy a car. It is proving that you have a parking space to park the car that is the problem and parking lots cost more than the car  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  Btw you can't buy a car unless you can prove that you have a parking lot to park it  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br><strong>Wasnt that HDB purpose? To sell affordable flats on long term leasehold in return for letting the state acquire public land as it wishes? Being the largest supplier of land, being able to give housing space to "8 million people". the govt can influence and set the price of HDB flats with its large supply of land. </strong> Seriously HDB flats are still affordable. How many people are homeless here compared to other countries.<br><br><strong>This is quite a self contradictory statement when the govt tried to introduce annuities recently. They argue the old people would not know how to mange their money hence the need to force Singaporeans to buy annuities For those who are still in the workforce, people from all walks of life should be trusted to acquire knowledge on investments and make retirement plans.<br><br>I think the govt still believes the people cant manage the money on their own, but CPF and retirement has become a hot political potato due to its dismal returns that it want to pass the responsibility back to the people.<br><br>Annuities is to address another hot political potato - some the old and aged not being taken care and having to pick cans for a living. </strong><br><br>Actually I don't quite agree on the annuities myself that I am being forced to buy them since I do have my own retirement plan. Well, the CPF is not increasing according to inflation and they had the CPF reduction to attract employers to keep the older workers in the workforce and to make labour seem more attractive here. So yes if people don't plan they will be in so much trouble. I don't see how the CPF is going to increase unless there is investment or that the returns in investment makes by the government increase or there is an increase in taxes.<br><br>However, that aside I don't see anything wrong about having to plan for my own future. There will always be people who will fall through the cracks.<br><br><strong>Pensions problems arise when govts are in control of the money. Separate from the state,e.g. Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan which has average about 11 percent., there are no problems at all<br><br>One advantage of a pension is that those who lack investment knowledge can tap the expertise of fund managers. In Australia, even if one had zero knowledge of investments, one could still earn good returns for their retirement savings because the employer usually contribute the money to an industry pension funds.<br><br>The other advantage is the pooling of risks like annuties. Given a large sample of individual investors, some are going to earn 18%, some are going to earn 3%. The pension fund can even out and give a flat rate of 9%, minimizing the risks of retiring when the stock market is down. </strong><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br>Are you kidding me?
