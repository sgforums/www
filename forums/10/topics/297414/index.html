            <div class='col-md body'>Let's talk about another truth often denied and denied again and again with hypocrisy.<br><br>The people were told again and again way back in early years that in order to solve the traffic congestion problem, people must pay higher and higher taxes so the vehicle excise duty was increased gradually year after year to 170% of OMV i.e. S$15,000.00-S$100,000.00 for each vehicle depending on class and values of OMV.<br><br>In the early 1980s, people were told that such excise duty like 170% of OMV was not deterrent to car ownership so people should pay COE which means after paying the S$15,000.00 excise duty for the physical import of the vehicle they cannot drive the car unless they bid for a licence to put their vehicle on the road which cost anything from $15,000.00 to the mind-boggling S$100,000.00 at one time.<br><br>Ministers in introducing the COE said that it will eventually replace the excise duty. Year after year COE was paid by the people with no sign of excise duty being replaced. Is this the truth after the need to replace excise duty by COE?<br><br>Again after some years despite COE there was traffic congestion. So people were told by the ministers more truths and this time the ministers said the truth was COE was not enough people must pay ERP meaning usage tax.<br><br>Did the ministers fulfill their original promises to replace the old taxes i.e. excise duty or COE some years after ERP was introduced.<br><br>If COE and ERP succeeded in solving the traffic problem as announced why should we the people grumble.<br><br>The truth and plain truth is these additional taxes did not and will not solve traffic problems because the ministers simply did nothing to do what should have been done - the simple alternative of applying some portions of the excise duty, COE and ERP to providing needed improvements like alternative routes, widening and so on to keep up with all other necessary measures.<br><br>Raymond Lim had tried to explain these problems to the Sin Min residents recently but got a big whacking.<br><br>He probably will get or has got another big jump in his salary plus more than three months of bonuses this year for causing more traffic congestions despite so many rounds of ERP increases.<br><br>The government tries to given an impression that ministers are properly assessed with KPI before being given the bonuses and salary jumps.<br><br>If he is successful in his KPI it should show solving of traffic congestion with judicious ERP with COE, road taxes, petrol tax and excise duty replaced gradually by the more effective ERP. But no he would not stop the double taxing or triple taxing and he cannot convince his cabinet to apply reason. That is his courage or integrity KPI.<br><br>Now he even talked backwards trying to talk like it is the people who asked for COE and not his government or his predecessor Mah</div>

When you cannot answer to any point you will just go on insisting that people are frogs in the well. Who is? You or those who come up with a better take on an issue and problem and even suggested constructive solution. Li Ao is right it is this kind of people and you who provide the evidence for him to call Singaporeans as a whole you are referring as without spine.</div>
