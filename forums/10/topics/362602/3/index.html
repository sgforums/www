              <p>The current first quarters 2009, they made a loss of US$59 million, looks like they have to maintain the losses in order not to disappoint the market. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Goes with rule #1 of accounting my lecturers taught me. A company won't go bankrupt even if they make losses year after year for decades, provided there is a dumb stock holder behind who is willing to pump in more money to make good the losses.</p>

              <p><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>Singapore faces long haul back</strong></span><br> By R M Cutler</p>
              <div><strong><span><strong>Jun 5, 2009 </strong></span></strong></div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>MONTREAL - Hopes that surging share prices in Singapore over the past three 
              																	months point to an early recovery may be short-lived. A decline in exports, the 
              																	city's life-blood, is picking up pace even after 13 months of falls, and stock 
              																	declines this week may herald a longer pull back.
              																	<br> <br> Singapore's gross domestic product (GDP) fell 10.1% in the first quarter this 
              																	year from the same period in 2008. This represents a decline of 14.6% 
              																	quarter-on-quarter following a 16.4% fall in the fourth quarter of 2008. All 
              																	sectors experienced further quarter-on-quarter declines, with the exception of 
              																	construction and financial services. The broad weakness was especially marked 
              																	in electronics, biomedical manufacturing, precision engineering, chemicals and 
              																	manufacturing.
              																	<br> <br> Exports have fallen for 13 months straight and, at least for the time being, the decline in exports is accelerating: down 19% in April from the 
              																	year previous after a 17% year-on-year decline in March. Singapore's 
              																	exports-to-GDP ratio is over 1.8, meaning that capital expenditure cannot be 
              																	expected to recover significantly anytime soon either. This notwithstanding, 
              																	the country's Purchasing Managers' Index climbed to a nine-month high in May, 
              																	just above the 50 level, meaning that manufacturing is expanding, despite 
              																	earlier expectations that manufacturing output would contract throughout 2009.
              																	<br> <br> While there is some month-on-month improvement, however, levels remain far 
              																	below the equivalent period from 2008. Increased unemployment throughout 2009, 
              																	resulting from decreased global demand, will mean that domestic consumption 
              																	will also lead to further production declines in goods intended for domestic 
              																	consumption.
              																	<br> <br> The corporate sector will therefore continue to be under enormous stress while 
              																	access to credit will remain tight as well. Small and medium enterprises are 
              																	faring marginally better than the large corporations thanks to relaxation of 
              																	conditions of their access to credit under the stimulus package adopted earlier 
              																	this year.
              																	<br> <br> Despite the improvement, therefore, the country's national bank maintains its 
              																	forecast of a 9% decline in GDP during 2009, around which level the consensus 
              																	forecasts also falls. This follows a deceleration to 1.1% growth in 2008 after 
              																	a 7.7% rate in 2007. Insofar as recent growth had been led by the banking 
              																	sector and by exports, the country's central bank projects a slow recovery 
              																	dependent on the recovery of export markets.
              																	<br> <br> According to many observers, all this means that no meaningful economic 
              																	recovery will come in Singapore by at least the end of 2009. Citigroup, for 
              																	example, expects GDP to recover to pre-recession levels only by the end of 
              																	2010. Given the continuing weakness in the economic systems of developed 
              																	industrial countries (negative economic growth, still fragile financial and 
              																	banking institutions, rising unemployment, restrained consumer spending), it is 
              																	surprising that such analysts are so relatively optimistic.
              																	<br> <br> The journalistic commentary has lately begun, in order to avoid discussing the 
              																	"L" shaped depression (or worse), to adumbrate a "W" shaped recovery now that 
              																	the "V" won't happen and the "U" seems unlikely. The "green shoots" theme 
              																	recently in vogue has passed out of currency, and while the US situation 
              																	ameliorated slightly before showing its continued further weakness, neither 
              																	Japan nor Europe has shown even the slightest improvement.
              																	<br> <br></div>
              <div>The consensus inflation forecast for 2009 is slightly negative (about 1%), with deflationary pressures greater than inflationary ones due to the falling currency abetted by foreign exchange and monetary intervention by the central bank. Countervailing, inflationary pressures are likely to come from such sources as increased transportation prices for imports due to such factors as the recent rise in the price of oil.<br><br>Meanwhile, PetroChina has bid US$2.2 billion to buy half a refinery in Singapore, as part of a long-standing Chinese strategy for its parastatal companies to become more influential in global energy markets. Since most of Asia's oil prices are determined in the Singapore trading hub, the move provides not only a significant source of supply but also a still greater presence where the markets are made.<br><br>PetroChina has doubled its fuel trading volumes in Singapore over the past four years, participating more and more deeply in the price-setting mechanism itself. In the end, this will especially increase its leverage on spot prices in Singapore. According to Reuters, it will also give PetroChina a more equal ground with Sinopec in matters of trading expertise and market influence as well as a more dispersed economic geography of refining.<br><br>The country's equity market benchmark Straits Times Index (STI), which closed as low as 1,457 on March 9, has risen over 60% from that level to the high 2,300s in less than three months, is now set to retrace some of those gains, perhaps back as low as the low 2,100s. Indeed, the Singapore market has already begun this process in the past two days.<br><br>Generalized risk aversion in world equity markets has also hurt Singapore's stock markets as capital outflows have increased, raising long-term pressure on the mSingapore dollar. This comes as Asian markets in general also prepare for a generalized correction of their recent run-up.</div>

              <p>UNCERTAINTY may have been one of the reasons behind Temasek Holdings'
              decision to sell off its stake in British bank Barclays in December and
              January despite the huge loss it would make, fund managers said on
              Thursday.
              <br> <br>Reacting to reports that the state investment agency had offloaded
              its entire 2 per cent stake at an estimated loss of 500 million pounds
              to 600 million pounds (S$1.2 billion to S$1.4 billion), they said
              Temasek could have been concerned that Barclays would be nationalised
              by the British government. <br> <br> Nationalisation would have made the shares almost worthless and was
              'one of the fears that all investors had at the time', said Mr Wong Kok
              Hoi, chairman and chief investment officer of APS Asset Management.
              <br> <br> 'There was extreme concern about the viability of the banks. Most Western banks were technically bankrupt.'
              <br> <br>Other analysts noted that Barclays was facing potential cash calls
              at the time, which would have forced existing investors to pay up to
              keep the bank solvent.
              <br> <br>Fund managers offered other suggestions as to why Temasek sold the
              shares in the volatile December-January period, when the shares swung
              from 47.3 pence to 190.6 pence. On Wednesday, they closed at around 260
              pence.
              <br> <br>Temasek paid 720 pence a share or 975 million pounds for its
              Barclays stake in July 2007. The purchase was meant to help Barclays
              take over Dutch bank ABN Amro in a deal that would have created the
              world's No. 6 bank by market value.
              <br> <br>But Barclays eventually lost out to a consortium led by the Royal
              Bank of Scotland. A few weeks later, the sub-prime crisis surfaced, and
              Temasek lost &amp;pound150 million on its Barclays investment in just a
              month, reports said then.
              <br> <br>If Temasek had hung on, its paper losses would have been trimmed in
              the recent market rally. Reports say the Abu Dhabi-based International
              Petroleum Investment Co made a windfall profit of US$2.5 billion (S$3.6
              billion) on its Barclays investment after seven months.
              <br> <br> But it would have been impossible for Temasek to know back then that the markets would rebound, said fund managers</p>

              <h1>Why Barclays is unlikely to be nationalized: How Temasek got played out by Abu Dhabi investment corp</h1>
              <p><span class="time">June 5, 2009</span></p>
              <p><strong>From The Newsroom Room</strong></p>
              <p>The Straits Times has swung into full damage control mode to limit
              the fallout from Temasek’s disastrous sale of its stake in Barclays
              Bank which may cause it to lose up to 500 million pounds or more.</p>
              <p>This is in stark contrast to the Abu Dhabi-based International
              Petroleum Investment Co made a windfall profit of US$2.5 billion (S$3.6
              billion) on its Barclays investment after seven months.</p>
              <p>As usual, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #993300;">none of the Temasek executives, including its CEO and wife
              of Prime Minister Lee, Madam Ho Ching, are called upon to account for
              Temasek’s decisions</span></span>.</strong></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Instead, it is left to the spin doctors at SPH to extricate Temasek
              from its current quandrary, not that it will ever be made to pay for
              its mistakes.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p>According to external analysts the Straits Times spoke
              to, ”uncertainty” may have been one of the reasons behind Temasek
              Holdings’ decision to sell off its stake in British bank Barclays in
              December and January despite the huge loss it would make.</p>
              <p>Reacting to reports that the state investment agency had offloaded
              its entire 2 per cent stake at an estimated loss of £500 million to
              £600 million (S$1.2 billion to S$1.4 billion),<span style="color: #993300;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> they said Temasek could
              have been concerned that Barclays would be nationalised by the British
              government.</strong></span></span> (read article <a href="http://singaporeenquirer.sg/?p=4023">here</a>)</p>
              <p>What is the probability of Barclays being nationalized?</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>If this is indeed high, why did Abu Dhabi investment corp decide to
              pour in a few billion dollars into the beleaguered U.K bank 7 months
              ago in the midst of the economic turmoil?</strong></span></p>
              <p>Apparently, Temasek executives are not aware of this report by The Times on 22 January 2009:</p>
              <p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.wayangparty.com/wp-content/themes/church_10/images/thumbnails/barclays01.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="478"></p>
              <p>Abu Dhabi has cleverly purchased “insurance” for itself when a stake
              in Barclay to minimize the risk of nationalization by the British
              government.</p>
              <p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.wayangparty.com/wp-content/themes/church_10/images/thumbnails/barclays02.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="478"></p>
              <p>[Source: <a href="http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/banking_and_finance/article5563223.ece">The Times</a>]</p>
              <p><span style="color: #993300;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Even if the Barclays were to be nationalized, the British government
              would have to pay a price above the market value to acquire the shares
              from Abu Dhabi, thereby ensuring that the latter will not suffer a loss</strong></span>.</span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Did Temasek insist on this clause being added to the contract when it purchase a 2% stake in Barclays then?</strong></span></p>
              <p>Why did Temasek cash out so soon when it is obvious that the
              Barclays is unlikely to be nationalized as long that Abu Dhabi
              continues to hold stakes in it?</p>
              <p>The political fallout from any possible deal at the expense of
              taxpayers will certainly crippled the Labor government led by Gordon
              Brown which is facing a backlash from the voters.</p>
              <p>Then again, the political repercussions are of significance in the
              United Kingdom where a relatively free media, educated electorate and
              robust opposition ensure that the government is held accountable to its
              actions.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>In Singapore, Temasek can afford to lose BILLIONS of dollars without
              anybody taking responsibility for it. Somehow, its CEO can still
              “ya-ya”, claimed she has “no regrets” and is given a “May Day Award” by
              NTUC!!!</strong></span></p>

              <p>Maybe if they lose alot of money on the Citibank stake, they can state that they didn't lose as much as their Merrill Lynch turned BoA investment. Which might be a good thing depending on how you look at it, afterall you didn't lose as much as the other investment, it should be a good thing. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
