              <div>Lee, 84, warned Singapore voters against putting the opposition at the helm of government “in a moment of fickleness or just sheer madness” when they get “bored” at some point in the future.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <p><span>Should this happen, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>“I think all bets are off because in five years they (opposition) can ruin this place,”</strong></span> he told delegates at an international forum late Wednesday.</span></p>
              <p>He stressed that, unlike many other countries, Singapore did not have natural resources such as oil, gas, forests, timber and aluminum.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>“When you are Singapore and your existence depends on performance — extraordinary performance, better than your competitors — but that performance disappears because the system on which it is based is eroded, then <span style="color: #ff0000;">you’ve lost everything.”</span></strong></span></p>

              <p><strong>Lee Kuan Yew the boaster: We are long term investors with horizons of maybe 30 years.</strong></p>
              <p><img src="http://chromatism.net/current/images/leekwanyew.jpg" alt="" width="183" height="223"></p>
              <p>Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore's investment guru, chairman of GIC</p>
              <p> <br>You don't always make profits with all your investments. Knowing this, I have cut Temasek Holdings a lot of slack through the downturn. Even when they sold the Bank of America stake in the first quarter, but only revealed in May 2009, I held back from writing about the move that resulted in a realised loss of between US$2.3 to US$4.6 billion.</p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;"><img style="border-style: solid; border-color: #ffffff;" src="http://www.yawningbread.org/arch_2009/pic-1037c.jpg" border="10" alt="" width="260" height="171" align="right"></span></span></p>
              <p><br>But now, we hear that last December and January, Temasek had also sold its Barclays Bank stake, for a loss of more than £500 million.<br><br>As Lady Bracknell said in Oscar Wilde's The Importance of Being Earnest, "To lose one parent, Mr. Worthing, may be regarded as a misfortune. To lose both looks like carelessness."<br><br>To be fair, we should bear in mind that Temasek Holdings never intended to buy into Bank of America. It bought a 13.7 percent stake for US$5.1 billion in investment bank Merrill Lynch in late 2007, just when the financial crisis was starting. Within half a year, Merrill Lynch was going belly up and the US government leaned on Bank of America to take it over. That's how Temasek's stake in Merrill Lynch became a stake in BoA.<br><br>Almost immediately, BoA began to totter as the financial crisis deepened. Early this year, there was a real risk that the US government might have to nationalise it to protect the country's financial system. If that happened, Temasek's stake would be wiped out like all other investors'.<br><br>Temasek seemed to have decided to sell rather than see what unpredictable events might unfold, especially as they never had any interest in owning any part of Bank of America in the first place.<br><br>Defending the sell-off, Finance Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam told Parliament last month: "The investment thesis had changed, from the original focus on Merrill's specific businesses to BoA's linkage to the broader U.S. economy." In addition, "Temasek also assessed the risk-return environment to have changed substantially."<br><br>Unfortunately for Temasek, BoA stock started looking up in April and May. This despite the US Treasury Department's stress tests showing that BoA would need US$34 billion more in Tier 1 capital to weather two years of severe economic circumstances. The bank set about converting preferred shares to common stock and made (or is planning to make) asset sales. By 2 June 2009, BoA announced that it was nearing its goal of raising US$34 billion.[1]<br><br>As you can see from the chart below, BoA's share price began recovering from mid March, after Temasek had mostly sold. There's egg on Ho Ching's face. Ho Ching is both the Chief Executive of Temasek Holdings and the wife of Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.</p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><img src="http://www.yawningbread.org/arch_2009/pic-1037a.gif" border="0" alt="" width="480" height="303"></span></p>
              <p><br><br>I would give Temasek Holdings the benefit of doubt over this. Hindsight is always 20/20, but in the first quarter, it was hard to know how things would pan out.<br><br>Also, it was reported in late May 2009, that Temasek Holdings bought additional shares in China Construction Bank, raising its stake from 6 percent to something like 6.5 percent. The latest purchase cost it US$600 million, according to Bloomberg.<br><br>China Construction Bank is the world's second-largest lender by market value, and the Chinese market will present greater growth opportunities than the US market. It may turn out to be a smart move to bail out of BoA, even at a loss, in order to buy into CCB.<br><br>But the Barclays' case is a head scratcher. Unlike the BoA stake, Temasek did buy directly into Barclays -- a 2 percent stake for £975 billion -- in 2007 at a time when the bank was raising capital to fund its bid (ultimately unsuccessful) for ABN Amro. A year later, in late 2008, the British financial system was in a meltdown almost as bad as the US', and three large lenders ended up in effect nationalised. Barclays refused to accept government money, and has managed to stay independent.</p>

              <blockquote>
              <p>Like BoA's share price, that of Barclays' has since rebounded as the worst fears passed. Temasek however, sold at the bottom of the market, in December 2008 and January 2009, if reports are correct. Temasek itself has so far refused to confirm or deny the story.<br><br>As Singapore's Business Times reported,<br><br>    On Jan 23, Barclays dropped to a low of 51.20 pence. Temasek had bought its 135 million Barclays shares in 2007 at £7.20 apiece. Barclays, HSBC and Standard Chartered are the three British banks which did not accept government money.<br><br>    A source said that once Temasek decided to cut its losses, timing the sale was out of the question.<br><br>    'It was sold over a period - you never know the highest or lowest,' the source said.<br><br>    It's not clear if the £500-600 million hit on the investment includes foreign exchange losses.<br><br>    When Temasek bought its 2 per cent stake in Barclays back in July 2007 for about £1 billion, £1 was worth S$3.08; yesterday, it was S$2.386.<br><br>    -- Business Times, 4 June 2009, Temasek<br>    sold Barclays stake and took a hit<br><br>To add to the embarrassment,<br><br>    In contrast, the Abu Dhabi government-owned International Petroleum Investment Company (IPC) made a US$2.5 billion gain from selling on Tuesday its 11 per cent-plus stake in Barclays.<br><br>    IPC had invested in Barclays last October when the bank did a private placement to avoid taking money from the UK government.<br><br>    -- ibid<br><br>Aside from the nitty-gritty of financial transactions, what is worrying is how quickly assurances that "we are long term investors" are jettisoned.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong> Barely a year ago, when UBS, in which the Government of Singapore Investment Corp has a stake, and Merrill Lynch were wobbling, Lee Kuan Yew told the media we are long term investors with horizons of maybe 30 years. We have staying power, he bragged, pooh-poohing rising concerns about declining valuations.</strong></span></span><br><br>I personally didn't think he should have bragged thus. The fact is, even long-term investors do make quick exits if need be, and he should not have so blithely dismissed the prospect. It wasn't politically wise. However, many people would have taken him at his word. And that has made things worse.<br><br>The gap between the "no need to worry, it's only paper losses" rhetoric and billions in real losses is so wide, there is an urgent need for Temasek to explain itself. People will be asking if the sovereign wealth fund is incapable of reading market and economic trends, thinking something is a good long term investment, only to be caught by surprise within months, and then, despite boasts of staying power, promptly going to panic sell mode. This may or may not actually be the case, but to not a few Singaporeans, our losses must surely look this way: not misfortune, but carelessness.</p>

              <p style="padding-bottom: 15px; margin: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px;">The report first surfaced in Reuters which was in turn published in the Straits Times. Temasek had declined comments on the sale.</p>
              <p style="padding-bottom: 15px; margin: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px;">As expected, the Straits Times tried to play down the loss by quoting Finance Minister Tharman’s speech in Parliament a week ago in defence of Temasek’s ‘track’ record.</p>
              <p style="padding-bottom: 15px; margin: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px;">Mr Tharman said Temasek’s portfolio grew $56 billion from March 2003 to November last year even after taking recent sharp declines into account. It averaged returns of slightly over 15 per cent a year.</p>
              <p style="padding-bottom: 15px; margin: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px;">It appears that Mr Tharman is not aware of the two “golden rules” of investment by U.S. investment guru Warren Buffett:</p>
              <p style="padding-bottom: 15px; margin: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px;">1. Do not lose money.</p>
              <p style="padding-bottom: 15px; margin: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px;">2. Remember rule 1.</p>
              <p style="padding-bottom: 15px; margin: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px;">The often cited reasons, or rather, excuses for Temasek’s ill-timed investment decisions are:</p>
              <p style="padding-bottom: 15px; margin: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px;">1. Temasek’s ‘track record’ in the past where it had made ‘large investment gains’. </p>
              <p style="padding-bottom: 15px; margin: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px;">2. Temasek is a “long term” investor and does not make its decisions based on short term market changes.</p>
              <p style="padding-bottom: 15px; margin: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px;">3. Temasek is now tweaking of its long-term investment strategy to focus more on Asia and emerging markets such as Brazil and Russia.</p>
              <p style="padding-bottom: 15px; margin: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px;">Gains made in the past when the market is on a bull run does not exonerate one from incurring catastrophic losses now. If any fund manager used that as an excuse for the fund’s poor performance, he or she will be sacked a long time ago.</p>
              <p style="padding-bottom: 15px; margin: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px;">Mr Tharman claimed that Temasek’s portfolio had grown by $56 million between 2003 and 2007 before losing $58 million dollars last year due to the global economic downturn, which is beyond its “control”.</p>
              <p style="padding-bottom: 15px; margin: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px;">However, a well managed fund can still generate healthy returns in bad times as shown by the Chinese and Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth funds.</p>
              <p style="padding-bottom: 15px; margin: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px;">Morever, unlike private investment funds, Temasek has the backing of the Singapore government which provides it with a ready source of “cheap” funds and assets.</p>
              <p style="padding-bottom: 15px; margin: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px;">Temasek been tasked with the privatization of government-related companies, like Singtel and SMRT.  Government-linked companies (GLCs) identified for privatization or divestment were typically transferred to Temasek.</p>
              <p style="padding-bottom: 15px; margin: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px;">In 2001, Temasek received in its arms Singapore Power together with two electricity generators - PowerSeraya and Power Senoko. Over a period of 10 months in 2008, Temasek sold all three Singapore power generation companies under its charge for a hefty profit.

              <p style="padding-bottom: 15px; margin: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px;">It doesn’t take a genius to know that power supply, telco and transport companies are extremely profitable businesses especially in Singapore where they enjoy a virtual monopoly with few rivals.</p>
              <p style="padding-bottom: 15px; margin: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px;">Unless Mr Tharman revealed the price paid by Temasek for these assets, we will never know how much of “returns” gained by Temasek come from its external investments instead of sale of government-related companies.</p>
              <p style="padding-bottom: 15px; margin: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px;">The timing of Temasek’s sale of both its stakes in Bank of America and Barclays at the bottom of the market less than 2 years after their acquisitions is perculiar given that they are “long term” investments.</p>
              <p style="padding-bottom: 15px; margin: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px;">Shouldn’t Temasek be holding on to its investment for a 10, 20 or even 30 year period if they are indeed made for strategic purposes with a long term outlook?</p>
              <p style="padding-bottom: 15px; margin: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px;">The reason that the sale is made in order to “focus” more on Asia and emerging markets is baffling as Temasek should have enough cash in its kitty to make new investments without selling off BOA and Barclays which caused them to suffer a loss of a few billion dollars.</p>
              <p style="padding-bottom: 15px; margin: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px;">Temasek’s latest investment in the China Construction Bank cost US$600 million dollars which is “small change” compared to the several billion of dollars it still has at its disposal. It does not need to sell off BOA and Barclays in order to generate funds for its new investments.</p>
              <p style="padding-bottom: 15px; margin: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px;"> Let’s hear what Jeremy Warner of the UK Daily “The Independent” has to say:</p>
              <p style="padding-bottom: 15px; margin: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px;">“Temasek, the Singapore sovereign wealth fund,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">seems to have lost the plot</span></strong>. Unlike Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed al Nahyan of Abu Dhabi, who has just made a killing from his investment in Barclays, Temasek apparently chose the bottom of the market earlier this year to offload its stake in Barclays, thereby clocking up a loss on the investment of £500m. Temasek’s loss on a similar investment in Bank of America was an even<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">more jaw-dropping $3bn</span></strong>. If they haven’t been already,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">someone, somewhere, is going to get fired</span></strong>.”</p>
              <p style="padding-bottom: 15px; margin: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px;">[Source:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><a style="color: #a91b33; text-decoration: none;" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/comment/jeremy-warner/jeremy-warner-temasek-loses-its-touch-on-barclays-1696441.html">The Independent</a>]</p>
              <p style="padding-bottom: 15px; margin: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px;">I can’t agree more. Temasek, Tharman and the PAP have lost the plot altogether! The 500 million pounds or $816 million dollars lost can be used to fund a pension, retirement or welfare fund for needy, retrenched and destitute Singaporeans for a few generations.</p>

              <h1>Singapore: Buy high, Sell low (Part II)</h1>
              <p> Saturday, 06 June 2009</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><em>Asia Sentinel<br><br></em><img src="http://www.yoursdp.org/images/stories/Buildings/singapore-merlion.jpg" border="1" alt="" width="120" align="left"><em><strong>Bailing out on Barclay's with massive losses, Temasek forgets to tell Singapore's citizens about it <br></strong></em><br>Singapore
                  officials' sense of superiority has taken another beating. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>A
                  behind-the-curve bunch of sheep with MBAs may now be the truer image.</strong></span> While the sovereign wealth fund of Abu Dhabi has cleaned up on its
                  investment in Britain's Barclays Bank, Temasek Holdings, still headed
                  until October by Ho Ching, wife of Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, has
                  bailed out at a loss estimated at around US$850 million.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The news didn't come out of
                  Singapore, <span style="color: #ff0000;">where embarrassments involving the first family get the
                  minimum attention</span></strong></span>, but from analysts in London and New York studying
                  the movement of major shareholders in Barclays. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The citizens of
                  Singapore were apparently not worthy of being told of how their money
                  is being mismanaged.</strong></span></span><br><br>Not content with buying into Barclays at a
                  time when the banking sector was viewed as the way to easy riches,
                  Temasek sold out close to the bottom of the market. The Abu Dhabi
                  International Petroleum Investment Corp meanwhile bought in when
                  Barclays was desperate and sold out just this week when the Barclays
                  share price had recovered, netting a profit of £1.45 billion sterling
                  (US$ 2.2 billion) in just seven months.<br><br>The Temasek debacle
                  followed hard on the heels of massive losses on a Bank of America stake
                  mostly acquired near the top of the market and sold close to the
                  bottom. Temasek's loss is estimated at US$4.6 billion, or roughly
                  US$1,000 for every Singaporean citizen. After the sale, presumably in
                  March, the share price promptly rose by 66 percent. <br><br>Singapore
                  Finance Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam has claimed that despite recent
                  losses Temasek has made gains averaging a respectable 15 respectable a
                  year. However, this was during a sustained global bull market and also
                  reflected the fact that some of its assets were state-owned companies
                  whose shares had been transferred at non-market prices. These included
                  power stations which have been sold off over the past two years,
                  generating large gains which cannot be replicated.<br><br>Some aspects
                  of Temasek are also so obscure that no proper analysis is possible. One
                  black hole looks to be a leveraged investment in a series of private
                  equity funds at the top of the market.<br><br>Having bought into
                  financials near the top – making them 40% of its total portfolio -- and
                  sold off near the bottom, it is now focusing on commodities, most
                  recently buying a stake in locally listed agriculture company Olam
                  international. It got a 13.76 percent stake at an 18 percent discount
                  to the market, nonetheless it had already almost doubled in price this
                  year thanks to a rebound in commodities which may or may not be
                  sustained.<br><br>Not that it is completely neglecting financials. It
                  is considering a stake in a consortium to buy AIG's asset management
                  business. But potential partner in this is the high-profile Hong Kong
                  businessman notorious for losing shareholders' money – Richard Lee of
                  PCCW.<br><br>Nor can Temasek ignore the problems of Singapore state
                  enterprises which must compete internationally. It has just had to
                  inject equity to reduce the massive debt of money-losing ship-owner
                  NOL. Meanwhile it is trying to offload loss-making manufacturer
                  Chartered Semiconductor.<br><br><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>In short, Temasek's bad news is unlikely to be over. But don't expect to hear about it first in the local media. </strong></span></span><br><br><a href="http://asiasentinel.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1919&amp;Itemid=233"><em>http://asiasentinel.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1919&amp;Itemid=233</em></a></p>

              the way temasek invests appears to be rather amatuerish. rushing in to buy when price just drops and panic selling when price keeps sliding. seasoned investors would have waited for price to drop farther before buying and price to rebound before selling.
