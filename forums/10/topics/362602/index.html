              <p>LONDON, June 3 (Reuters) - Singapore state investor <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Temasek
              sold its stake in British bank Barclays Plc (<span id="symbol_BARC.L_0"><a href="http://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/overview?symbol=BARC.L">BARC.L</a></span>) several
              months ago at a big loss</strong></span>, people familiar with the matter said
              on Wednesday.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>After<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> spending over<span style="color: #ff0000;"> 1 billion pounds</span> on the shares in the
              last two years</strong></span>, unlisted Temasek [TEM.UL] may have <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>lost over 800
              million pounds ($1.3 billion)</strong></span></span> on the investment, according to
              calculations by Reuters.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Temasek sold its near 2 percent stake in Britain's second
              biggest bank in December and January, one of the sources said.
              The sources declined to be named due to the confidential nature
              of the investment.</p>

              <p>I have no idea what you are trying to say. Firstly, I don't think Singaporeans are laughing at Temasek for losing their own money. And I don't think it's rational for Temasek people or whoever to trade and lose billions of dollars just to pocket some commissions. It's apparent that they lost money due to the lack of financial acumen and not other hidden agendas. </p>
              <p>On another note, are there ever foreign news agencies reporting either Temasek or GIC making billions on any shrewd trades? I haven't seen one for a long time! </p>

              <p><br>Yes, true, all drain are covered, but some are covered with good stainless steel and some are covered with lousy low grade cast iron that bend and rust in a few days, however the contracted price of covering is the same, so, you should know who is taking the money, all bidders in govt contracts bid for a price, some contractors who came to my pub for drinks also wonder why they lose the bid to a competitor who can afford to bid so low. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But then, as a citizen, do you observe the drain cover material, mostly, nobody will can, just paint black or silver over it and you get new cover. That is one of the loop hole where money can change hand.</p>

              <p><br> Yes, true, all drain are covered, but some are covered with good
              stainless steel and some are covered with lousy low grade cast iron
              that bend and rust in a few days, however the contracted price
              of covering is the same, so, you should know who is taking the
              money, all bidders in govt contracts bid for a price,
              some contractors who came to my pub for drinks also wonder why
              they lose the bid to a competitor who can afford to bid
              so low. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But then, as a citizen, do you observe the drain cover material,
              mostly, nobody will can, just paint black or silver over it and you
              get new cover. That is one of the loop hole where money can change
              hand.</p>
