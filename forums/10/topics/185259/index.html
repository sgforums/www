            <div class='col-md body'>(posted to Feedback Unit on 6.4.2006)<br>At one of the Feedback Sessions I attended, I remember some one speaker once fervently pleading with one of the ministers on the panel for government to practise EQ in running the country pointing out many of the top Fortune 500 companies are successful because of adopting such people-oriented system.<br><br>Do our ministers accept such feedbacks at all or are such good feedbacks are simply ignored?<br><br>Instead we often see the ministers trying to give lectures to people to correct their faults or shortcomings. Do our ministers first want to correct their own shortcomings?<br><br>Over the past 40 years we keep coming across all kindso fo persistent increases of government fees and charges e.g. transport, medical or Housing. The extra profits made by the government from the tax-and-recover system of charging and all the double-charging of lands and triple-charging of vehicle ownership etc do not come back as endowments to help lower the high costs of living created. During prolonged recessions citizens have to sacrificed more harsh policies and even new incentives to foreigners to take away jobs from the locals.<br><br>Surpluses are used only so far for paying higher salaries and bonuses to ministers and their elites or election-time give-aways which are illegal in many countries.<br><br>The above-stated system tax-and-recover system of government is not helping the people and is anti-competitive, anti-progress, anti-business and anti-vibrancy.<br><br>The corporation and privatisation of traditional government services are basically done to allow governemnt to charge higher fees. Such a system of money-driven government has caused the whole economy to go down since 1990s. If we look at the economy over the past 10 years or so - it is punctuated by short recovery but long decline. Wages are progressively going down and property prices have dropped over 30 %. This loss of our economic competitiveness is not recognised by our leaders who seem to wait only for short-recovery to avoid the problems. Our unemployments will get worse.<br><br>Today we have become a country with third-world wages bearing the first-world costs as posted by many.<br><br>Why are we reaching such a state of shame - we have neglected the Fortune 500 EQ system of empowering people.<br><br>We can forsee that even if GIC and Temasek are to make more than 1% pa the people will have to continue to suffer paying higher and higher fees and charges.<br><br>If the government is able and capable it will use the surpluses to create endowment funds to defray the high government salaries and bonuses they have created. They will take the cue from NKF uproar and change their mindset about surpluses which are anti-progress and anti-motivation.<br><br>I hope the new MPs and Ministers being claimed as our best talents will be talented enough to practise EQ so that there will be new hope in solving our current problems e.g. the "20 major problems of the governemnt" as posted in another thread.<br><br>So I am asking them being the new blood to try taking a closer look at how Fortune 500 companies practise their pro-people management. People have given good feedbacks but they have been ignored or stonewalled with uncaring attitude and those ministers who persistently ignore such advice should step down and make way for new blood who might be able to convince our past leaders to change.<br><br>Why afraid to change ? Why still persist in the "Pay and Pay" autocratic system.<br><br>I would propose that our new MPs and Ministers should practise more EQ and try urgently to solve the following serious problems:-<br><br>(1) High costs of living;<br>(2) Anti-business policies and practices;<br>(3) Anti-local pro-foreign investment and employment policies and practices.<br>(4) NKF-type of presumptuous surplus-hoarding anti-EQ policy<br>(5) Double-charging on land (HDB sale pricing) and triple-charging on vehicle ownership or usage.<br><br>We will remind the ministers that in their original proposal to avoid welfarism, they have said they will charge sufficiently just to cover consumption.<br><br>Today too many ministers are tryng to make extrad profits by charging fullest market prices.<br><br>So are ministers going to listen to good feedbacks and change? People are waiting for our government to change. Government is the problem.<br><br></div>

Singaporeans may not appreciate how much they enjoy in housing subsidies, which are in various forms. Let me elaborate. Those who purchase a resale flat can obtain a CPF housing grant of $30,000/$40,000. Those who buy a new flat will enjoy an even higher subsidy. As announced by PM in the Budget Statement, we will also provide an additional CPF housing grant of between $5,000 and $20,000 to 1st-timer households earning below $3,000 per month. These are explicit and substantial subsidies. They can amount to $60,000, which is as high as 40% of the price of a 3R flat in a non-mature estate. In addition to the upfront subsidy, 1st-timer households also enjoy an additional subsidy by way of the HDB concessionary loan which they can apply for to finance their flat purchase. For a $100,000 30-year loan, a 1% interest subsidy would mean a subsidy of more than $10,000."<br>---- Mini Star Horse Treasure Mountain</span><br>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><strong>From the ST Dec 20, 2005:</strong><br><br>NKF said it saved patients more than $3.5 million by offering them lower drug prices and subsidies. This was not true. It made close to $1 million each year, in 2003 and 2004, in gross profit from the sale of such drugs.<br><br>The gross profit margin worked out to almost 40 per cent each year. And that was because NKF did not pass on the rebates it got on its bulk purchase of medicine.<br><br>For example, it said one drug cost $25. It gave patients a $13 discount and charged them $12.

The prices are not set by HDB. Prices can fluctuate, depending on factors such as the economic outlook, employment situation and sentiments in the property market.<br><br>What is important is that HDB prices its new flats so that the majority of Singaporeans can afford one. From 1993 to 2003, the prices of new four-room flats increased by 2.6 per cent per annum, below the annual increase of 5.3 per cent in average wages cited by Mr Hiong. New-flat prices did not rise as steeply as resale-flat prices, because HDB prices new flats below their equivalent market price, that is, at a subsidy.<br><br>Mr Mohamed asked why HDB's subsidy for new flats is related to the market price and not the building cost of a flat. Today, first-time HDB flat buyers can buy either resale or new flats. Those who opt to buy resale flats from the open market can take up a housing grant of $30,000 or $40,000, which allows them to enjoy a discount off the market price of the flat.<br><br>Those who opt to buy new flats from HDB also enjoy a discount off the equivalent market price of the flat.<br><br>The difference between what the buyer pays HDB for his flat and what it is actually worth in the market is a direct and real subsidy provided by HDB to the buyer.<br><br>Like the housing grant for resale flats, the provision of such a market-related subsidy in the case of new flats has enabled HDB to keep its flats affordable for the majority of Singaporeans.<br><br>DESMOND WONG<br>Deputy Director (Marketing &amp; Planning)<br>for Director (Estate Administration &amp; Property)<br>Housing &amp; Development Board</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Obviousman<br><br>It is obvious man, from the HDB reply that HDB has only confirmed beyond doubt that it is selling its new flats at market price and not at a subsidy which has the meaning that it is below cost.<br><br>Even if there is a discount of some thousands, the price is still market price as the net price is still way above construction cost which is around $80,000 for a 3-room flat.<br><br>If one is to read the HDB Act, I am sure he will find the Act says that HDB was promulgated to provide public low-cost housing. That is the reason too Land Acquisition Act was passed to enable HDB to acquire land at cheaper prices in order to cater to HDB to build low-cost housing to house the lower-income groups of the population. Citizens' monies are used to fund HDB and its land acquisition so effectively lands are paid for by the citizens.<br><br>In selling HDB flats under the low-cost housing program called "Homeownership for the people", if HDB is selling its flats at market price of S$120,000.00 for a 3-room flat it will be making profit and land cost would be charged again because the market price is way above construction cost + land cost.<br><br>Therefore based on HDB Act and Land Acqusition Act, HDB has no right to price the flat at market value less a bit of discount to look good. HDB has made a windfall profit of some S$14 billions over a period of some 12 years.</div>

New-flat prices did not rise as steeply as resale-flat prices, because HDB prices new flats below their equivalent market price, that is, at a subsidy.<br><br>Mr Mohamed asked why HDB's subsidy for new flats is related to the market price and not the building cost of a flat. Today, first-time HDB flat buyers can buy either resale or new flats. Those who opt to buy resale flats from the open market can take up a housing grant of $30,000 or $40,000, which allows them to enjoy a discount off the market price of the flat.<br><br>Those who opt to buy new flats from HDB also enjoy a discount off the equivalent market price of the flat.<br><br>The difference between what the buyer pays HDB for his flat and what it is actually worth in the market is a direct and real subsidy provided by HDB to the buyer.<br><br>Like the housing grant for resale flats, the provision of such a market-related subsidy in the case of new flats has enabled HDB to keep its flats affordable for the majority of Singaporeans.<br><br>DESMOND WONG<br>Deputy Director (Marketing &amp; Planning)<br>for Director (Estate Administration &amp; Property)<br>Housing &amp; Development Board </blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">In a country that is dominated by the POWER OF ONE, we would expect that trends will be set by the POWER OF ONE.<br><br>When it benefit itself, the POWER OF ONE will let Singaporeans to set the trend, and instead of playing the role entrusted to it - to re-align misguided excesses to prevent speculations and allow long term attainable progress - the POWER OF ONE will prefer to participate in the greedy excesses of Singaporeans.<br><br>With Public Housing provided by HDB being priced a notch below Private Housing, and with HDB Home Loans no longer available, is there any program left for the Young Singaporean Families to purchase their own Homes to start a Family ?<br><br>Controversial contradictions can be seen in the Public Policies of the Government aka the Ruling Political Party in the manner in which it governs Singapore - with its PROFIT ORIENTED POLICIES in providing governmental and essential services to Singaporeans.<br><br>Some may argue that Government should not operate into a deficit position, but can anyone justify the runaway surplusses that recur annually to boost the Government Treasury - that will be transferred to the GIC and Temasek for their overseas "shopping trips", and all done at the expense of hard pressed Singaporeans trying their best to cope with the high costs of living ?</span><br><br></div>
