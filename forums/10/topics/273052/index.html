            <div class='col-md body'>ADVICE ON WHAT AS UNITED PEOPLE WE SHOULD EXPECT OF GOVERNMENT<br><br>We the citizens have often been subjected to all sorts of propaganda praising the government for some policies and unthinkingly accepted them as truths.<br><br>We have achieved some initial success as a nation there is no doubt about this.<br><br>However as a people, we have not made much progress since the 1980s. Many problems have been created by wrongful policies calculated to benefit only the ruling elites and the rich in our society.<br><br>People have failed to stand up to the government and asked as a united people for the government to govern the country with objectivity and accountability, Instead they often quietly accepted its propaganda as dished out through its controlled press and media.<br><br>Only when people are of quality and able to reason what is wrong from what is self-interest or self-glorification by the part of the regime will they be taken seriously.<br><br>People must create the necessary conditions by strongly and objectively giving their views and make themselves heard without fear if they want to change the current closed door system.<br><br>It is critical that people must create this new political sphere of independence so that they can truly free themselves of indoctrination, top-down governance to suit the private agenda of the current ruling elites.<br><br>Try to understand this current political sphere is not healthy for onward progress of the nation instead of uttering only government propaganda or falling for its selective comparison always with worse conditions in other country like posted above.<br><br>So do think clearly as a citizen or people to uphold values and goodness for all or the majority of citizens currently suffering from dropping income and prospects due to wrongful policies.<br><br>It is your future and surely you donÂ’t want a future built on craps or propaganda but solid foundation with participation by citizens.</div>

In general, they are fearful of the gahmen and basically singaporeans are timid to voice out.  When they see and hear people voicing out, they give negative feedback about these people.  Day in day out they complain complain and refuse and fearful to do anything constructive for their good.    Sometimes, I give up on them.<br><br>To me, if we have our facts and are objective when we voice out, I see nothing wrong to do so.</div>
