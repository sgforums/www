            <div class='col-md body'>It is not very proper for ministers to have proposed the motion to increase their own salaries and retirements annuities based on their own biased studies said to be bench-marked to some of the highest boss pays (many of whom are paying themselves high salaries to avoid paying too much taxes out of their own business monies or capital investments).<br><br>In fact if a private or public listed company director is to pay themselves this kind of extra salaries or remuneration it will be deemed a conflict of interest and may be illegal under the Company Act. Why such motion was allowed to be put up by the ministers and not by outside independent panels in the first place? Can our ministers go to parliament to do what they like in the first instance.<br><br>The next government with any interest of the people at heart will probably do the best right thing by introducing another motion to declare such salary motions illegal or voidable on the ground of conflict of interest in contract against the interest of the public.<br><br>Private companies' directors who pay themselves this kind of salary increases can be sued by shareholders to pay back the extra gains.<br><br>At least under minority share holders' right, such a motion is wrong immoral and may be illegal.<br><br>Any opposition worth the salt should consider putting up such a motion so that anything that is self-reward or involving conflicts of interests in contract like in the NKF can be properly settled in our system.</div>
