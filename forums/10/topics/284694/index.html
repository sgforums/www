I think sometimes, it takes a non-Kia Su, non-KiaSi, Righteous minded, Responsible citizen to Blow that whistle.   I think he also non-KiaSai since he went to use the toilet.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Many people are laize faire when it comes to doing things that are not monetarily benefitial to them or it does not affect their family.<br><br>That plumber, tho just a plumber did what he thought is morally right . He spoke on behalf of the people, risked law suits and his business/job and went to complain a titan.<br><br>without this Righteous-spirited man, how long more and how much more will the people be cheated? No one knows.  Put it this way, can anyone in this world dare to step up and assure that there are no cases of corruption, even large-amount corruptions, that are never caught?   HP says anything is possible. I buy that. I think there are bound to be cases of huge corruptions that also went uncovered. Maybe many many years ago. Maybe. No one can say there is non.<br></div>
