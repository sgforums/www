              <p>LKY diplomacy tactics are learned from the British in 2nd world war,that is leaning from side to side between Super power nations.But this kind of tactics is out-dated, coz ppl now are much more smarter than before,n we are living in a fast pace world,n we tend to hate hypocrites or "Two-headed snake" like what LKY behave.</p>
              <p>Doesnt LKY realise that part of the reason why the British fall is becoz of their "2 headed snake" behaviour?And also India,last time they also implement leaning between Soviet Russian n U.S tactics.In the end,they also didnt accomplish much in their economy.</p>
              <p>Ppl are smart now,they dont like hypocrites who set up traps or do hypocritical talkings to trick others just for their own benefits.Coz when they find out the truth,they are going to be very mad n screw u n curse you to die,LKY!!!!</p>
              <p>So Mr.Lee,better to be more honest n stop playing tricks on other nations,and your own countrymen n women!!!</p>

              <p>Especially i hated the way our news media behave(who get instructed by LKY).That is whenever China government does wrongly,like their one-child policy,Tiananmen Square incident,our media simply turn these negative things into a "right thing",just to bootlick Mainland China.</p>
              <p>Now,look at what LKY get from China?</p>
              <p>LKY should give the media the rights to speak freely on what is right n wrong,whether it is U.S,China,Europe countries,or other Asean countries.Not to bootlick some "Big countries" even when they do wrong things,whether be it U.S or China,Europe.Or twisted the right thing into wrong.</p>
              <p>If LKY can be more honest to others,especially himself,he will then earn more respect from other ppl.</p>

              <p>Frustrated with Singapore always sucking U.S cock:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>US 'indispensable' in Asia: Singapore PM</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Singapore, Nov 3 (AFP)</strong> The United States plays an
                  "indispensable" role in Asia despite the rise of China and
                  India and should be part of any new regional group, Singapore
                  Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said today.<br><br> Speaking ahead of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
                  (APEC) summit, Lee expressed hope Washington will deepen
                  engagement in the region despite pressing domestic issues and
                  worries over Iraq, the Middle East and Afghanistan.<br><br> "We believe America plays an indispensable role in Asia
                  in many fields -- economic, political, strategic, security,"
                  he said at a news conference.<br><br> "We've been talking about a multi-polar world, but de
                  facto the US is the most powerful nation in the world and will
                  be so for some time to come."<br><br> US President Barack Obama, Lee and 19 other world leaders
                  will gather in Singapore from November 13-15 for the annual
                  APEC summit and dialogue with global corporate chiefs.</p>

              <p>I also doubt LKY will care about the critics,not only that,nowadays,he also dont care about all other critics from other countries like the U.S n Europe about Singapore Human Rights issues,or any other critics from Singaporeans n opposition party members,even his own colleagues.</p>
              <p>Perhaps he also know he is going to die sooner or later,so nobody will bother about him also.Perhaps this is called "Senile Sydrome" when a person getting old n mentally unfit.</p>

              <p><br>Damage control? what damage?</p>
              <p>Is Singaporean netizens afraid of China netizens? or is this a case of your enemy's enemy is your friend?</p>
              <p>The Chinese netizens have over reacted to LKY's speech which was twisted in the translation and played up by the media. </p>
              <p>It doesn't matter how his speech was read and understood, but if the mainland chinese do believe that with growing economic and military power, all the small nations in Asia would have to watch their reaction when we speak, it is a timely reminder for US to continue their presence in Asia, to balance the rising power of China.</p>
              <p>You may not like LKY, the person or his speech, but you have to recognise that he has the balls to speak what he thinks was right, whether the chinese like it or not, may be that is why he has the priviledge of such an audience.</p>

              <p>I don't agree with this view.</p>
              <p>I think it is more of China balancing USA's hegemonic role rather than USA balance China. I consider USA balance China to be USA propaganda.</p>
              <p>USA should fuck off their military forces from asia.</p>

              <p>Thank you for your view. Indeed food for thought. The issue is not the chinamen reactions, not who said what, but WHAT was said - the balance of rising cheap charlies'  party power.</p>
              <p>Could and would commie china finish what Hitler had failed to do - world domination thru 'peaceful overtures ruse', stealing, buying, negotiating resources as well that she needs now, while arming herself to the hilt, including space?</p>
              <p>The CCP is known to use the internet as a tool for political aims as well, and the netizens may not be the farmer's son reflecting true sentiments as he sees his father toiling under the sun and bullied by the corrupt province administrators. Thus when smaller states voice concern, they raise condemnation.</p>
              <p>Many may decry our country's democracy, but at least we still have the vote and is a republic of multi-racial equals. Hell if we must bow to cheap charlies's idealogies and domination, way of life. It would be over my dead body if it comes to that.</p>
              <p>Indeed a wake up call by MM Lee when we all had been busy and distracted by economic issues to see a bigger game being played out by the human rights rejectionists commie bastards.</p>
              <p>The Cheap Charlies Party have some explaining to do now and it better not be some Gobbels style propaganda.</p>

              <p>During the period of cold war, the communists led by China and Russia was balanced by the presence of the US and its allied. With the collapse of the USSR, communists became less of a threat to the region and US influence was dominant for a while, China wasn't much of a balance.</p>
              <p>Now with increasing economic power, China's influence can only become more dominant, while the US influence of the region, especially SEA, is dimishing over the years. Its military presence in Asia is only now limited to Korea and Japan. </p>
              <p>There should be a balance, who is balancing who is not important.  Propaganda doesn't work these days. Call it propaganda only tells us which side you are on, the fact remains.</p>
              <p>With north korea still trying to arm itself with a nuclear bomb, it is too early to tell the US to get lost, especially when China is not prepared to take on the role to contain the dictator.</p>

              <p>The world is happy the allied, including the US defeated Nazis and the jap in WW2.</p>

              <p>So who should win if the US is defeated?</p>
              <p>my mistake, yes, the US is in afganistan, iraq as well, but in thailand? those were the days of vietnam war, in the philippines? may be a few advisor on war against the terrorists in the south, that is not much of a presence.</p>
