              that the United States should remain engaged in East Asia have drawn
              criticism on the website of a state-owned newspaper in China.<br> <br> The Chinese-language Global Times, a sister publication of the flagship
              People’s Daily noted for its international coverage, said it reported
              on Sunday a speech Lee made in Washington last week, and within hours,
              it claimed to have received more than 500 comments online.<br> <br> In his keynote address delivered at the US-Asean Business Council’s
              25th anniversary gala dinner last Thursday in Washington, Lee said the
              US should remain engaged in Asia. “The size of China makes it
              impossible for the rest of Asia, including Japan and India, to match it
              in weight and capacity in about 20 to 30 years. So we need America to
              strike a balance.”<br> <br> He also warned Washington that it risked losing its global leadership if it did not remain engaged in Asia.<br> <br> Lee was conferred a lifetime achievement award for helping to foster US-Asean relations at the dinner last week.<br> <br> <strong><span style="color: red;">Many of those who responded were upset and said
              that Lee had treated the Chinese as outsiders although they had treated
              Singaporeans as “among their own”.<br> <br> “Lee Kuan Yew spoke for the feeling of those in the West who fear
              China’s rise would harm their vested interests,” said one netizen.</span></strong><br> <br> <strong><span style="color: blue;">Another described Lee as “a
              political animal”, saying that while he “relies on China to develop his
              country’s economy, he is ushering wolves here to deal with China”.<br> <br> A third posting said: “Just because he has achieved some success in
              Singapore, he dares to play the guiding light that shows US the way. If
              he has the stuff, he should go to Africa and offer tips on how to shake
              off poverty and achieve wealth.”<br> <br> Another posting brushed off his comments as insignificant as Singapore was a small country.</span></strong><br> <br> “Lee Kuan Yew had made such comments likely because Singapore is a
              small country that needs an interplay of balances in the international
              arena,” said the netizen.<br> <br> <strong><span style="color: blue;">“However, what significance do his
              words carry when the reality is that for a voice to be heard and the
              views realised, one needs to be truly powerful,” the netizen asked. </span></strong></div>

              <p>The true elitist talent of a parochial leader can only be seen when it exercise its talent on the World Stage.</p>
              <p>LKY has failed by a far measure as he had never been known to be diplomatic even in the early days in politics during the 1960s - as seen when he refused to step down from his plane after it landed in Kenya. </p>
              <p>Basking in the shower of accolades when receiving the "Life-time award" - MM LKY must have gotten soft in the head and called for US continued engagement in East Asia even as it is in a theatre outside his own turf.</p>
              <p>It would have sounded more neutral and more becoming of MM LKY to seek US engagement in Asia - and not only East Asia - which would have been appropriate response to the the US claim of seeing the power of LKY's intellect that "led millions in Asia to prosperity".</p>
              <p>Did MM LKY "lead millions in Asia to prosperity" as stated in the various testimonies from past US politial realities ?</p>
              <p>It seems that only those in Asia knows more about the truth then the Americans who pass judgment so quicky on first impressions.</p>

              <p>If we look at the history of Lee Kuan Yew, he has always served the interests of the west.</p>
              <p>He is basically a dog of the west.</p>
              <p>Actually he was trained from young to be an anglo dog.</p>
              <p>This is completely true. He studied in english school when young and he was brainwashed from there to serve the british empire. His father worked for the british and was pro-british.</p>
              <p>Lee Kuan Yew or Harry Lee is not chinese but peranakan.</p>
              <p>He is not chinese.</p>
              <p>Of course later when Harry joined politics he had to pretend to be anti-british otherwise the people won't follow him.</p>
              <p>But after he secured power he showed his real face - that he was a british dog.</p>
              <p>He suppressed the culture of the dialect chinese which he feared and imposed english and tried to westernise Singapore society so that he could secure his power.</p>
              <p>Some naive people still harbour illusions about this old dog of the british.</p>

              <p><strong>Serving British interests </strong><br> <br> "Now, from all the already released records in London as well as other
              historical researches, it is clear that in launching Operation Cold
              Store,<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> <span style="color: #ff0000;">Lee Kuan Yew was serving the then strategic interests of Britain</span> which wanted Singapore to continue to provide a forward military base
              in Southeast Asia," said Lim. </strong></span><br> <br> "It is also now<span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> an undeniable fact that Lee worked earlier for the
              Japanese military during the Occupation making Britain's English
              materials available in Japanese-language for the occupiers</strong></span></span>," he added. <br> <br> Lim was a graduate of Singapore's prestigious Raffles College and a
              medical doctor trained in University of Malaya, which was then located
              in Singapore. <br> <br> "I was also a founder of University of Malaya's Socialist Club which
              became the cradle for many politicians and intellectuals in both
              Malaysia and Singapore who fought for independence," he recalled with a
              sense of pride. <br> <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br> "In those days, anti-colonialism was a very powerful and popular
              sentiment even in Singapore … I helped found the People's Action Party
              (PAP) to fight for the freedom of Singapore from British rule </strong></span></span>and to
              reunite it with Peninsula to form an united, non-communal and
              progressive Malaya but <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>when Lee turned right wing and started serving
              British interests, the party split and I left to join the Socialist
              Front,</strong></span></span>" he explained. <br> <br> "We certainly opposed to Singapore being maintained as a military base
              for Britain and that was why Lee had to crush the Left in Singapore at
              all cost … The Left in Singapore also opposed to the 1963 merger
              because we thought it was an opportunistic adventure on the part of Lee
              who wanted to exploit Tunku Abdul Rahman's anti-communism to suppress
              the Left in Singapore … we wanted merger but not in the 1963 version
              which proved to be an utter failure just two years later in 1965. <br> <br> "I was completely English-educated," stressed Lim, which was obviously
              a sarcastic and subtle rebuttal to the now stereotyped and widespread
              notion that the Left in Singapore in the 1950s and 1960s was a
              "Chinese-educated" phenomenon.</p>

              <p>such is the great far sightedness of this man who is able to see far ahead as in 10, 20 years from now in a macro analytic way.</p>

              <p>Here is another good example of Lee Kuan Yew's farsightedness at work:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>MM Lee says Singapore at centre of world’s highest
                                          growth region</strong></p>
              <p>February 12, 2008</p>
              <p>Minister Mentor <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Lee Kuan Yew believed Asia
                                          will not go into recession, citing not only strong growth in China
                                          and India, but also the strength of commodity prices boosting
                                          growth in Malaysia, Brunei and
                                          Indonesia.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p>Speaking to some 1,200 people at the Tanjong Pagar Lunar New
                                          Year dinner on Monday night, Mr Lee said Singapore is at the centre
                                          of the world’s highest growth region, and <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>is in a period of steady
                                          growth.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p>Mr Lee is also positive that Singapore <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>can maximise its chances to
                                          reach a higher quality of development in the coming five to ten
                                          years.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p>“This is quite remarkable, for it will be the <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>first time that when the
                                          American economy slows down and reduce imports from Asia, Asia will
                                          not go into recession.</strong></span></span> The reason is the
                                          dynamics of the domestic growth momentum in China and in India –
                                          two very huge countries. Furthermore, our neighbours are doing
                                          well. Singapore is in the centre of the world’s highest growth
                                          region,” he said.</p>
              <p>While some may be lamenting the financial crisis, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Mr Lee said he sees a
                                          blessing</strong></span></span> as property prices have cooled down
                                          for the time being.</p>
              <h1><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">He added that
                                          <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Singapore’s Government of
                                          Singapore Investment Corporation (GIC) and Temasek have also been
                                          able to increase the value of their assets, especially during such
                                          downturns.</span></span></strong></h1>
              <p>The two companies recently invested some S$22 billion into UBS,
                                          Citigroup and Merrill-Lynch.</p>
              <p>“When the share prices of these banks recover (the) S$22 billion
                                          investments, it will be worth S$50 to S$70 billion. But never
                                          believe that assets will always go up. There will be downturns. And
                                          so we must have these reserves to see us through these troughs.
                                          Singapore has got to this level through hard work and thrift. We
                                          must continue in this mode,” Mr Lee pointed out.</p>
              <p>On the home front, Mr Lee said higher food and energy prices,<span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> and a widening income gap are cause for concern and must be
                                          addressed.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p>He also said that while there are massive investments, such as
                                          the Marina Barrage, to develop Singapore into a global city, those
                                          living in the heartland housing estates will not be left
                                          behind.</p>
              <p>All estates will be upgraded and beautified to ensure all
                                          Singaporeans can benefit from the growth, Mr Lee added. –

              <p> </p>
              <p>In response to a question by a SMU student on what Singapore could
              do to help its bottom 20 per cent, MM Lee answered that Singapore’s
              approach has been to create as many jobs as possible, while leaving the
              market to decide the right type of pay.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>“Never mind your Gini coefficient. If you don’t have a job you get
              zero against those with jobs. So our first priority is jobs for
              everybody,” he said.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p>The Gini coefficient measures the income distribution across a country and is often used as gauge of the income gap.</p>

              <p><br>If he had given sufficient consideration to those who knew better than himself - the Malayan politics of the 1950s and 60s - he would not have gone out of his way to fix a Referendum to fulfill his own vain ambitions of merging Singapore with Malaysia.</p>
              <p>If he had the vision "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">to see far ahead as in 10, 20 years from now in a macro analytic way</span></em>" as claimed - would Singapore have been straddled by a Family Planning Program desparately implemented in the 1970s - that caused the present deficiency in population growth, and need to depend on massive inflow of foreigners ?</p>
              <p>If he had the vision to see far ahead - why will he allow Singapore to be continuously dependent on MNCs that need low wage work force - even as they require a stable political and secure business environment ?</p>
              <p>If he had the vision to see the need to have firm roots in our culture, why will he so hurriedly destroy the languages and cultures of the unique Chinese dialect groups, and immerse the diverse Chinese into a mindlessly uniform Mandarin language to conform with China ?</p>
              <p>If he had the vision to see further ahead - why will he insist on monopolising the political scene and prevent even his own vision of a flourishing society - "<span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; font-size: 12pt;    "><em><span style="color: #0000ff;">where men can preach ideas - novel, unorthodox, heresies, to established churches and established governments - where there is a constant contest for men's hearts and minds on the basis of what is right, of what is just, of what is in the national interests</span></em>"</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; font-size: 12pt;    ">Unfortunately, he succumbed to his own ambitious vanity and fulfilled his own fears in the question that he had asked in 1964 in the Malaysian Parliament - "</span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; font-size: 12pt;    "> <em><span style="color: #0000ff;">or is it a closed society where the mass media - the newspapaers, the journals, publications, TV, radio - either bound by sound or by sight, or both sound and sight, men's minds are fed with a constant drone of sycophantic support for a particular orthodox political philosophy ?</span></em> "</span></p>
              <p>After 42 years of the monolithic orthodox rule under LKY and his PAP, Singapore has arrived into the 21st Century with a political scion that is bankrupt of ideas despite the acclaimed elitist bloodline, needing to continuously fix the Alternative Political Parties in the methods employed in Third World politics, and fulfill his own idiocy with gaffs that include "mee siam mai hum" and insisting that it is not the responsibility of the Singapore Government to look for jobs for Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>We can certainly depend on LKY's long term vision to see an unstable legacy for Singapore political theatre when HIS Army will step in to interfere in the political process when the National Reserves in used.</p>
              <p>Is the National Reserves of Singaporeans' Money the exclusive turf for him to jealously guard that will supercede the mandate of a NEW Government elected by Singapore citizens ?</p>
              <p>Which Army is MM LKY depending to interfere in the political process ?</p>
              <p>Is he leaving a legacy behind that will involve his preferred Gurkhas to interfere in the politcal process - when the Gurkhas are maintained by taxes collected from the citizens of Singapore, and he will have the Gurkhas prevent Singaporeans from voting an Alternative Political Party to form a New Government ?</p>
              <p> It is amazing that some can be so simple minded to be blinded by the seeming over inflated aura of an individual.</p>

              <p>This is classic, in the past his son went over to Taiwan and
              made some comments which infuriated the PRCs; subsequently he made
              another visit to China and made another comment which infuriated
              the Taiwanese. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Don't these people with their multi-million dollar salaries know
              anything about diplomacy? And this is the person which Henry
              Kissinger claimed he learnt alot from? Don't tell me he is learning
              from their idiocy? Maybe father and son should read Henry
              Kissinger's book on Diplomacy. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Kissinger praised Lee Kuan Yew in the past in talks with China.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Prime Minister Chou: It is the conservative nature of those Chinese.<br>And when the Australian Prime Minister came, he discussed with<br>me the Southeast Asian countries and their establishing relations with<br>China. We discussed if it would be possible to establish relations with<br>Singapore. I wonder if a communiqué or public declaration that none<br>of those Singapore citizens would maintain dual citizenship might set<br>him at ease.</p>
              <p>Secretary Kissinger: Would you like me to discuss this with Lee<br>Kuan Yew? I think he takes me more seriously than he does Whitlam.</p>
              <p>Prime Minister Chou: That is, we would be willing to establish relations<br>in a pattern which would set other countries at ease because a<br>large percentage of the Singapore population is Chinese.</p>
              <p>Secretary Kissinger: I will talk to him.</p>
              <p>Prime Minister Chou: And Singapore being a free port, we think<br>it would be better for them to maintain a neutral problem. The Soviet<br>Union is casting a covetous eye on them.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Secretary Kissinger: Lee Kuan Yew is primarily worried about the<br>organization of Communist groups.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Prime Minister Chou: To my knowledge there is none there. There<br>are perhaps some leftists but to my knowledge there are no Communist<br>parties in Singapore.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Secretary Kissinger: But he is not against the People’s Republic.<br>He is afraid you will engage in subversive activities there.</p>
              <p>Prime Minister Chou: We are not going to subvert them. We<br>haven’t even subverted Hongkong. Why would we go there. Why give<br>up Hongkong at our door step to go so far. Hongkong has 4 million<br>while Singapore has slightly over one and a half million.</p>
              <p>Secretary Kissinger: I will send a letter to Lee Kuan Yew.</p>
              <p>Prime Minister Chou: He has not been so bad to us. There is a<br>branch of the bank of China there.</p>
              <p>Secretary Kissinger: He is not against you. I know him very well.<br>He is one of the few leaders with whom it is worth talking. Aside from<br>his having power, he has a great understanding of England.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Prime Minister Chou: He is a very eloquent speaker. I believe he<br>was trained by McDonald.*</strong></span></p>
              <p>Secretary Kissinger: He was at the London School of Economics.</p>
              <p>Prime Minister Chou: Because McDonald had been Governor General<br>of Singapore.</p>
              <p>Secretary Kissinger: He always comes to Harvard once every two<br>years.</p>
              <p>Prime Minister Chou: You mean the son of Ramsey McDonald?</p>
              <p>Secretary Kissinger: Lee Kuan Yew comes to Harvard and shocks<br>my liberal colleagues by calling them fools. They are not used to Socialists<br>calling them that.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>* Malcolm McDonald, son of british PM Ramsey McDonald</p>
              <p>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_MacDonald</p>
              <p>............</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Chou En-lai: The Soviet Union has also directly approached Burma<br>about that. Slightly before General Ne Win paid a non-official visit to<br>Hungary the Soviet Union approached him.</p>
              <p><br>Dr. Kissinger: I didn’t know that.</p>
              <p><br>Chou En-lai: He rejected it. That is why he did not go to the Soviet<br>Union. He was planning to go both to Hungary and the Soviet<br>Union, and because of this he rejected the visit to the Soviet Union.<br>And they also probably approached Razak of Malaysia too, when he<br>was visiting Moscow. They probably also approached Lee Kuan Yew<br>who also went to Moscow.</p>
              <p><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Dr. Kissinger: I will see Lee Kuan Yew very soon. He is very intelligent.<br>Singapore is too small for his talents.</strong></span></p>
              <p><br>Chou En-lai: It is the problem created by Chinese blood. [Laughter]<br>It is because the percentage of those of Chinese blood in Singapore<br>are too numerous that makes Malaysia and Razak fear him.</p>
              <p>Dr. Kissinger: That is why they rejected him.</p>
              <p>Chou En-lai: Then they built Malaysia over him and around himand isolated him in the center.</p>
              <p>Dr. Kissinger: But still he has the most dynamic state in the area.</p>
              <p>Chou En-lai: But his production cannot support him. Their domestic<br>production cannot support them. They rely on trade going<br>through their country. They rely on transit trade and now they can only<br>just lease some of their small islands around them to other countries.<br>We have heard that the Soviet Union . . .</p>
              <p>Dr. Kissinger: The Soviet Union wanted to establish a naval facility<br>there.</p>
              <p>Chou En-lai: Yes, because a barren island can be used to first build<br>a factory, an oil refinery, and then used to build a dock and then used<br>to repair boats and so on gradually developing into a naval facility.</p>
              <p>Dr. Kissinger: Our information was they wanted to use some of<br>the existing facilities. They wanted to lease some of the dry dock facilities.<br>On a regular basis.</p>
              <p>Chou En-lai: That would be the first step.</p>
              <p>Dr. Kissinger: We prevented that.</p>
              <p>Chou En-lai: They have already done that in Hong Kong. Hong<br>Kong has agreed to their repairing ordinary boats but not naval vessels.<br>But it takes them three months to repair one boat, so they maintain<br>all around the year at least one or two naval vessels there that have<br>their intelligence facilities on those boats. Well, now every day they can<br>stroll around in the streets of Hong Kong. And they can also invite<br>guests onto their ships. And they use those methods to serve their intelligence<br>work. These are new activities on the seas which were recently<br>invented since the Second World War.</p>
              <p>Dr. Kissinger: Yes.</p>
              <p>Chou En-lai: They also use these opportunities, use the fact that<br>Hong Kong is a free port, to buy a lot of daily necessities, especially<br>food, and take it back with them. And they would like to take Singapore<br>the same and make it play a greater role than Hong Kong and<br>gradually project it into a naval base. Britain would probably know<br>about that. They will tell you about it.</p>

              <p>I think basically, in this agenda, LKY spoke for the Asean, not on Singapore alone. Most of the asean countries and even japan or korean would had supported his views, China govt also understood that if they want to succeed, they need American market , the america consumers and capital investment in China in order to succeed. In another words, China also want to see a vibrant America economy. Otherwise, both will go down the drain together. And that is why, China agreed to buy America bonds.</p>
              <p>As for news and comments, there will alway be such incident in China, afterall only 500 out of 1.3billions people commented, that is nothing.</p>
              <p>For empty talk, in fact, if china hated us, more better, less PRC coming.</p>
