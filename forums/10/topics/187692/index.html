            <div class='col-md body'><br>Haa,, i found this on the net, it is interesting to share i guess<br><br>http://www.np.edu.sg/~lpi/ww/CagedKampungChicken.htm<br><br>Caged Chicken, Kampung Chicken                          David PI Lim - MDE<br><br>There are two types of bird in this worldÂ… or I mean two types of chicken. Once you are employed, you are a caged chicken. You lost the freedom of a kampung chicken.<br><br>Kampung chicken has a tough and uncertain life, caged chicken has a more comfortable, predictable life. When a lot of things are provided for, caged chickens donÂ’t need to spend a lot of effort to get them, food, water, shelter, etc. they lost some of the lifeÂ’s necessary survival skills.<br><br>Caged chickens are supposed to be well looked after so that they can produce good quality meat and high quality eggs. The chicken minders should know how to look after them so that they are healthy and happy. Happy chickens produce more eggs and have better quality meats.<br><br>But this does not always happen because chicken minders are also caged chickens, just a bigger cage.<br><br>Big-cage chickens have different view of the world with different agenda. You will be surprised how many items on the agenda has nothing to do with the chicken industry. Â‘Look after the chickensÂ’ is just one of the items somewhere near the bottom of the list.<br><br>Some chicken minders believe that polishing the cage to make it shine to the outside world is most important. Some prefer to mum all chicken to create a quiet environment for the surreal feeling of peace and harmony. Many will simply do whatever their bosses (in even bigger cages) want regardless of whether they are right or wrong, for obvious reason. Some old-world chicken minders believe that caged chickens should be kept constantly hungry with minimum feeds and chickens can be squeezed to lay more eggs.<br><br>Without changing the fundamentals, they always try new things whenever there is a crisis, and changes always seem to work. Because some caged chickens will do anything, including cannibalizing, to survive. The greater majority will soon learn to bottle up, lie low, protect themselves and bide their time. But a place cannot be constantly sustained by having only a few pretty and happy chickens. Over time, slowly but steadily, overall quality of chickens will decline to the lowest level.<br><br>Chickens cannot be truly healthy and happy being caged. Smart chicken minders will encourage the chickens to go out of the cage to exercise, physically and mentally. Physical exercise is essential to cut down fat and grow muscle. Mental exercise will add to total health and productivity.<br><br>But not all chickens are born the same. Some caged chickens exercise everyday to prepare for the eventuality when they have to compete for food on the kampung turf. But some have been caged for too long that they lost the guts to walk out even when the cage door is open. Many are just too comfortable that they find the life of a kampung chicken is no life at all. Some chickens blame their good life for making them immobile.<br><br>All this will change only when disaster strikes, like the bird flu or Japanese B encephalitis. Who would survive?<br><br>Before the doomsday comes, when things are not looking good, some roosters must rise and make enough noise to arouse the attention of every chicken. They must prompt all chickens to wake up and exercise, and donÂ’t just scramble to eat from the hand-down plates not knowing when the sky will fall down.<br><br>Even when the doomsday comes, there are still choices to make: which chickens eat too much and lay no egg, which chickens eat little but lay many eggs, are the eggs large, medium or small, what about the taste?<br><br>So remember a few things while caged:<br><br>keep laying the same eggs does not make you lay better eggsÂ…<br><br>exercise your muscles while laying eggsÂ…<br><br>one day your muscles may have more use than your eggs Â…<br><br>of course you have nothing to worry about if you know you have been laying golden eggs ...<br><br></div>
