              China secures Myanmar energy route
              By Sudha Ramachandran
              
              BANGALORE - China and Myanmar have signed an agreement for the construction of fuel pipelines that will transport Middle East and African crude oil from Myanmar's Arakan coast to China's southwestern Yunnan province - short-circuiting the long sea voyage past Singapore - while also drawing from Myanmar's own gas reserves.
              
              Under the March 27 agreement, a gas pipeline will tap into Myanmar's reserves at the Shwe gas fields, and an oil pipeline will carry Middle East and African crude that is currently transported in tankers through the Malacca Strait to China.
              
              Construction of the US$1.5 billion oil pipeline and the $1 billion gas pipeline will begin soon and is expected to be completed by 2013. China's largest oil and gas company, the China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC), holds 50.9% stake in the project, with the rest owned by the Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise (MOGE).
              
              The roughly 2,000 kilometers of pipeline will cut through the heart of Myanmar, beginning near Kyaukphyu on the Arakan coast and running through Mandalay, Lashio and Muse before crossing into China at the border town of Ruili. The pipelines will terminate at Kunming in Yunnan province. A gas collection terminal and a port for oil tankers will be constructed on an island near Kyaukphyu. The entire cost of constructing the pipelines will be borne by China.
              
              Myanmar has the world's 10th-largest natural gas reserves, estimated at over 90 trillion cubic feet (tcf) in 19 onshore and three major offshore fields. According to Myanmar officials, the country's daily gas production will almost double to 2.235 billion cubic feet by 2015 from the current 1.215 billion cubic feet.
              
              The Shwe reserves in the gas field off the Arakan coast have attracted considerable attention following the discovery of deposits at block A-1 (Shwe field and Shwephyu field) in January 2004 and at block A-3 (Mya field) in April 2005. It has been estimated that the Shwe field holds a gas reserve of 4tcf to 6 tcf and the Shwephyu, and the Mya fields have a combined proven reserve of 5.7tcf to 10 tcf. The finds have triggered fierce competition between India, China, South Korea, Thailand Japan and Singapore.
              
              Thanks to its decades of proximity to Myanmar's military rulers, China has been successful in swinging decisions in Myanmar's energy sector in its favor. That it is a veto-holding member of the United Nations Security Council and in a position to prevent resolutions critical of the junta from being passed at the top UN meeting place has helped increase China's presence and profile in Myanmar's oil and gas sector.
              
              Stakes held by Chinese companies in 16 oil and gas blocks make China the largest foreign investor in Myanmar's energy sector, although it entered only as recently as 2001.
              
              In December 2008, China finalized an agreement with a consortium led by South Korea's Daewoo International and including MOGE, India's Oil &amp; Natural Gas Corporation, GAIL India (Ltd.) and Korea Gas Corporation, under which it was assured of 30-year supply of gas from the A1 and A-3 blocks beginning 2013. The pipeline from Kyaukphyu will carry this gas to Yunnan.
              
              Besides opening up a new source of gas in Myanmar for China, the pipeline project will strengthen China's bonds with Myanmar's military rulers and increase its already considerable influence over its neighbor. No less significant, the link will enhance China's energy security, helping to reduce China's excessive dependence on the Malacca Strait.
              
              The 900km-long strait, which connects the Indian and Pacific Oceans, is one of the world's busiest shipping channels. Around 65,0000 vessels pass through it every year, carrying a quarter of the world's traded goods. Roughly a quarter of all oil transported by tankers passes through the strait, mainly from the Gulf and Africa to China, Japan and South Korea.
              
              The Malacca Strait is crucial for China's trade and energy security. At present, roughly 80% of China's annual imports of 1.5 billion barrels of oil pass through the narrow seaway, which separates Malaysia from Indonesia.
              
              Over the past few years, Chinese analysts and leaders have been describing the strait, as a strategic vulnerability, drawing attention to the consequences for China if this shipping channel were to fall into the hands of "hostile powers" or pirates or terrorists. What if the US were to block China's access to the strait in the event of a China-Taiwan conflict?
              
              In November 2003, Chinese President Hu Jintao articulated this fear when he declared that "certain major powers" were bent on controlling the strait. Analysts have been discussing the country's "Malacca dilemma" since then and exploring options to overcome it. One proposal, partially undertaken, is to develop a port and pipeline terminal at Gwadar, in southwest Pakistan, from where Middle East fuel could also be pumped to western China.
              
              From 2013, Chinese oil tankers from the Middle East and Africa will be able to cross the Bay of Bengal to dock at Myanmar's Sittwe and Kyaukphyu ports from where their cargo will be transported through pipelines to Yunnan. The transport time of fuel that bypasses the Malacca Strait in this way will be cut by a week.
              
              The pipelines, however, will mean an increased Chinese presence and activity in the immediate neighborhood of India. The pipelines might have eased Beijing's anxieties somewhat, but they have added to New Delhi's.

              <p>Does anyone know the average supply volume of such a pipeline? I am skeptical of the volume that can be supplied in this manner. </p>
              <p>Anyway, the pipe ends at Kunming, which means its more likely to supply the Southwest Area. As it is relatively in-efficient to transport fuel from that area into the eastern coastal cities, I would suspect that this is more of a backup plan for China rather than to seriously solely depend on it. Can you imagine if the entire China or most of China's developing cities depends on a 2000km pipeline and then suddenly someone sarbotage or there is a natural disaster that damages the pipeline? The more likely event is that China will diverse a portion of its energy transport to the pipeline, but unlikely to completely foresake SIngapore.</p>
              <p>With regards to the Kras Isthmus Canal, I have confirmation from a Thai official that that is so not going to happen in the near future. </p>

              <p>The piracy issue is indeed a concern to them, but the literatures available suggest that the Chinese are more worried about the Straits of Malacca as a choke point that US can leverage on.</p>
              <p>I agree about its limited usefulness in times of conflict too, even if the pipeline is well protected, the tankers still have to pass by the Indian Ocean, which is not where the Chinese are exactly comfortable too.</p>
              <p>There are already talks and some plans about PLAN operating from Myanmar and Pakistan, but I think that will just agitate the Indians.</p>

              <p>Does anyone know the average supply volume of such a
              pipeline? I am skeptical of the volume that can be supplied in
              this manner. </p>
              <p>Anyway, the pipe ends at Kunming, which means its more likely to
              supply the Southwest Area. As it is relatively in-efficient to
              transport fuel from that area into the eastern coastal cities, I
              would suspect that this is more of a backup plan for China rather
              than to seriously solely depend on it. Can you imagine if the
              entire China or most of China's developing cities depends on a
              2000km pipeline and then suddenly someone sarbotage or there is a
              natural disaster that damages the pipeline? The more likely event
              is that China will diverse a portion of its energy transport to the
              pipeline, but unlikely to completely foresake SIngapore.</p>
              <p>With regards to the Kras Isthmus Canal, I have confirmation from
              a Thai official that that is so not going to happen in the near

So even if the folks at SPH find this thing they already reported way back in Nov worth reporting, its a bit too early to jump the gun and says that the "Propaganda Press" and "Damned Despots" are too "scared...woooo....." to tell us about it.</p>
              <p>And the fact that Chinese Media had to pick up the news from HK source which translated from an Indian source, suggest that even the Chinese govt doesn't find it very newsworthly.</p>
              <p>Oh, and CNA also has a forum which is discussing the very same topic. Kinda sucky for a propaganda press to allow its forum to discuss a topic which it is "too scared" to report, isn't it? :D</p>

              <p>This move to bypass the Straits, I suspect is a consequence of China's experience over the Gulf of Aden.  The Straits of Malacca and the Gulf of Aden are one of the top few piracy hotspots.

              <p><br>Unfortunately,Singapore oil refining facilities are designed to refined the sweet crude with low sulphur content that comes out from the Middle-east, and is not necessarily the cheapest place to process crude as there are other locations with the capabilities and capacities that Singapore may not have.</p>
              <p>From a quick review of - <a rel="nofollow" href="http://pingu.argusmediagroup.com/chinastudies/pdf/teakettle.pdf">‘A study of China’s independent refinery sector’  </a>- it showed that China has more then 100 independent refineries located all over China, and this list does not include the newer larger refineries on the western hinterland of China, nor the larger refineries based in north-eastern China.</p>
              <p>China has also invested heavily in a refining facility in Sudan.</p>

              on this today. So even if the folks at SPH find this thing they
              already reported way back in Nov worth reporting, its a bit too
              early to jump the gun and says that the "Propaganda Press" and
              "Damned Despots" are too "scared...woooo....." to tell us about
              it.</p>
              <p>And the fact that Chinese Media had to pick up the news from HK
              source which translated from an Indian source, suggest that even
              the Chinese govt doesn't find it very newsworthly.</p>
              <p>Oh, and CNA also has a forum which is discussing the very same
              topic. Kinda sucky for a propaganda press to allow its forum to
              discuss a topic which it is "too scared" to report, isn't it?
              :D</p>
              <p>So will you stop picking bones out of shells for once?</p>

              <p>Again, I can't follow the logic of your argument here. But anyway, I'm not saying that Sg's mainstream media is not propagandic in nature, but in this particular case, it is pretty obvious that they are not suppressing the news. Sure they didn't like splash it across the front page along with words like "We Are Doom!!!", but allowing news that you "fear" all over the internet is not exactly how a propagandic press works. (Again, not saying that the press is not propagandic, but merely that this piece of news is not a big thing to them.)</p>
              <p>The thing is, if you keep sloting "Damned Propanganda Press", "Damned Despots", "Honorable blar blar blar" all over the forum at every single opportunity (irregardless of whether it is justified or not), it is going to make people around here disagreeing the PAP govt on real issues look like your fellow retards. Which kind of contribute to the reason why some folks out there thinks local opposition and dissidents are just a bunch of nuts.</p>
