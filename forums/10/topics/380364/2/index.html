              <p>A romantic way of avoiding the issue. Social divide is an important issue. While it is inevitable, there should be measures to cushion such by-products of capitalism(or any form for that matter).</p>

              <p>Any political science student will understand that social divide is inevitable especially in a capitalist society, and worst if it is a elitism one. And this by product given in any test, is deem dangerous and potential for future revolve. It is up to the govt, if the divide is too far, with the larger mass being in the lower side of the division, a revolution can take at any time, you see that happening in the history of most countries, China for example, is typical social divide society before it become communist led by Mao and his poor farmer army who felt that they are much neglected and divided. Singapore being a modest history of only 40+ years is still a long way to go, it had yet to see a full scale revolution, it just take a special one to spark the light and god bless us.</p>

              <p>Good point on the 4% full employment criteria.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However, knowing how it works in sg, you might want to take the unemployment figures with a pinch of salt.  Do you believe that the figure is around 5% or perhaps even higher?   You will note that the calculation criteria of the unemployment rate excludes those who are not actively looking for a job - there could be many retrenched workers going back to school to upgrade their skills / knowledge or taking courses.  Hence, I believe this figure could actually be higher for the "true" unemployement rate.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A retrenched executive washing dishes at the kopitiam (if he is even lucky to get this job) is considered employed.   As with my earlier point, it seems to me now that the number of jobs created  recently (mostly low level / F&amp;B , service related ) can largely be attributed to the increase in population eg. why more kopitiam workers are needed - to cater to more people eating at the kopitiams. The creation of these low wage jobs actually masks the true situation in the economy - jobless managers / executives cannot be expected to take these jobs as permanent.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As it is, the government apparently is of the view that as long as everybody has a "job" regardless of whether it is suitable or relevant to the person doing that job, they have done their duty. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              lower side of the division, a revolution can take at any time, you
              see that happening in the history of most countries, China for
              example, is typical social divide society before it become
              communist led by Mao and his poor farmer army who felt that they
              are much neglected and divided. Singapore being a modest history of
              only 40+ years is still a long way to go, it had yet to see a full

              give the example of pre-Mao china. Please take note of the state of
              affairs in china at that point of time. China is a big country and the
              complexity of government probably means that the more outward
              provinces/counties/whatever from the capital will have less centralised
              governmental control. Does it apply to singapore?</p>

              <p><br>Singapore's primary goal is to create jobs to reach full employment. They have been adopting this policy since the 1970s. However, the workforce of Singapore has evolved dramatically over the years. There are more and more educated people  as compared to generation X in the 80s and they have higher aspirations and yet government continues to focus on creating low skilled jobs with no career development in them. It is time for them to tweak their old policy and not continue to believe that old policy still apply in the 21st century.</p>

              <p>Cost is definitely an employer concern, take yourself as a boss, what is the best, easiest and effective way to cut cost? with no doubt you have to agree it is labour cost. We are already an industrialised nation, from training to skill to knowledge to a global economy.  And we need FDI input to survive, as long as we can create jobs, we create it, but our population is aging and our people are getting lesser, how then can we support a vibrant global economy without foreign manpowers?? With no doubts, no body wants intruder into their house, but what choice do you have if your house need a lot of work to be done and you are not capable of doing it with not only small amount of manpower but also aging manpower. And of course, after coming up to this stage of economy, there is no way we are going to go back to basic, if that happen, we are killing ourselves. We take foreigners in a view that he is helping our economy, working hand in hand to help our singapore. Having said all, do you think foreigner like to come here, they would had preferred to stay with their family in their own country, but because they get no opportunity there, by coming here is a sacrification, if they make money, so be it, if Asia goes up, would it be nice for Singapore too.</p>

              <p>those girls are cheap in life, not in pocket, on a good day,
              they can make more than any CEO per day paid.</p>
              <p>Cost is definitely an employer concern, take yourself as a boss,
              what is the best, easiest and effective way to cut cost? with
              no doubt you have to agree it is labour cost. We are already an
              industrialised nation, from training to skill to knowledge to a
              global economy.  And we need FDI input to survive, as long as
              we can create jobs, we create it, but our population is aging and
              our people are getting lesser, how then can we support a vibrant
              global economy without foreign manpowers?With no doubts, no body
              wants intruder into their house, but what choice do you have if
              your house need a lot of work to be done and you are not capable of
              doing it with not only small amount of manpower but also aging
              manpower.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">The
              issue is never simply about foreigners working here. The issue is about
              the lack of safeguards for the locally-bred populance. And the "open
              the floodgates" policy towards immigration, thus increasing the supply
              of employees. driving down the wages and making an already employers'
              market even more pro-employer.I believe nobody would be against immigration if their position is not threatened. There are not many issues in the 1990s, only in recent years are people feeling threatened. </span></p>
              <p>And of course, after coming up to this stage of economy,
              there is no way we are going to go back to basic, if that happen,
              we are killing ourselves. We take foreigners in a view that he is
              helping our economy, working hand in hand to help our singapore.
              Having said all, do you think foreigner like to come here, they
              would had preferred to stay with their family in their own country,
              but because they get no opportunity there, by coming here is a
              sacrification, if they make money, so be it, if Asia goes up, would
              it be nice for Singapore too.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">Yeah
              yeah nice to read, good to say. If the economy can expand until there
              is an abundance of openings to be filled, your essay would hold true.
              Is that the case? Foreigners come here, sure got sacrifice, but if it
              doesnt work out, they can go home. Singaporeans, if crowded out of the
              market by these people with families in lower-cost-of-living countries,
              even if we jump sea also only can swim to sentosa, or sail to tekong to
              get shot? </span></p>

              <p>Who also know. Every govt's primary interests in staying in power. Or serving the interests of its sponsors/affiliated companies etc. And there are many ways to do it. Making the citizens dependent, suppression of information, state ideology etc etc. Democracy is nice to hear and stuff, but what is it actually? A popularity contest. what is war? To serve their own interests, traditionally, to continue being in power (of cos there is a theory that US went to war in irag for the oil but that is another story).</p>
              <p>What you mean by satisfied with the need to be ever struggling is beyond me. More like no choice mus endure it as you seem to be a proponent of, since most of your posts suggests "its like this one" and not "what is the solution" or "what can be done".</p>

              <p>Recently, i read a book on The German Nazi peoples. In it, it said, Hilter was taken as the mother of all evil in going into a war that killed many, but Hilter is not alone, the Germans were also one of the culprit evil whom in a way supported the War.</p>
              <p>If you apply that into Singapore, we had keep a blaming culture on the govt in whatever or whenever they set policy to move this or increase that...citizen of singapore will blah blah all the way cursing and complaining. When I was back in Taiwan, my taiwanese asked, "why singaporean like to curse their govt, afterall they can change it if they dun like" follow by "Singaporeans are really stupid and funny" I dun blame them, the outside world look at Singapore on it peoples, not the govt, the people mandated the Govt to rule and set policy, then if the peoples start to curse and complain about its Govt for years without changing, isn't it funny? In another words, we, same as the Nazi peoples, are the culprit of our own destiny.</p>
              <p>Our govt created a capitalist social economy that bring about ownership thru loans and financing. Nearly all singaporean are in debt, rich or poor, always buying and selling, always upgrading, always improving lifestyle...as such each individual will become more focus on each social economy status and forgo political intervention all together. When the govt make a policy, we never think of poltical intervention or retialation, instead we think of what we are going to do out of the new policy to maximise our social economy status.</p>

              <p>do you know in some western and developed countries  like switzerland and japan, first sign of recession coming, first to go are the jobs of foreigners, as they are competing for jobs with the locals. anyway foreigners cant vote in election, so the politicians there focus and channel efforts towards locals.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>yes foreigners do help our labour market, but employ foreigners only if cant find locals to fill the jobs mah. do you know that all our jobs are open to foreigners including customer service, retail, call centre, accounting, finance etc. why do you need to hire foreigners at call centre with foreign accent, where singaporeans are not shunning the job. easy, it has to do with the cheap pay of foreigners. so its no longer a question of locals shunning the job, its more of the employers hiring foreigners to save cost. if thats the case, why not hire foreign CEO and directors from Phillipines, Thailand, China, India, Vietnam etc if cost is a consideration. the pay of a director can hire dunno how many staffs.</p></div>
