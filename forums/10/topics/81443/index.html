            <div class='col-md body'>Can anyone please advise me on what should I do to expose backstabbers in my workplace?<br><br>Backstabbers are cowards. They only talk when I am not around. Especially after I left the office for home. There is a 'famous three' group made up of two men and a fat bitch who is a clerk. The other two men are between 26 - 31 years old and called them as engineers. I think one of them got the degree in carrying balls, which needs no theory but lots of lots of pratical.</div>

From what I heard, one of my closer colleagues heard them discussing about me behind closed doors.

My colleagues are all chinese and i am not. I am not implying racial discrimination here. Just to highlight that there is only 3 other races in my company of 100 odd workers. For me, I feel that they are trying to cover up a matter which I came across has loopholes and when highlighted to my manager, he was not happy at all. He was giving unnecessary reasons to cover up the situations. Furthermore, he is looked upon as a good worker in the upper management's views. The woman clerk is assisting him by giving first hand news on whatever that can benefit each other in both ways.</div>
