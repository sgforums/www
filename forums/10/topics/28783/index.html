How many times, have your friends, relatives or people that you know approach you or your family members and literally force you to join them or else? Â… (Okay, maybe not or else, but come on so strongly, they behave like pests and literally put you off) How many times? (For those who have tried before) have you joined a MLM or NM company that hypes you so much that you just got to join, only to be left to your own defenses, you versus the world at the end of the day?<br><br>For the rest of you lucky people reading this article and never joined a MLM or NM company before, hereÂ’s some insights into this much-misunderstood industry.<br><br>DonÂ’t get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with the industry or NM as a marketing structure, personally I think itÂ’s a wonderful idea, being paid for recommending a product or a lifestyle, (How many times have Hollywood producers and directors paid you for recommending a movie to your friends? Â… None, how many restaurants have even given you a free meal for recommending them to your friends? Â… ThatÂ’s right again, none. On the same note, no author or publishing house has paid you for recommending their books to anyone either.)<br><br>MLM is by no means a horrible industry to be in, but sometimes your journey with the wrong people or wrong group can be your worse nightmare. IÂ’ve even come across companies, which put you down if you donÂ’t even have a few hundred dollars to maintain. DonÂ’t these people understand, I am joining the industry because I need some extra money and hopefully a better lifestyle in future. I did not join this industry to sign an additional few hundred to thousand dollars to my credit card to be in debt again.<br><br>MLM is a get rich quick scheme. For those of you who think that it is, or have been told that it is, THINK AGAIN. It is very much a job as any other job; the only difference is that more often than not, you end up firing yourselves. You end up putting yourself back in a hamster wheel. You end up going back to making money for someone else (namely your Boss). If you had your own business, I bet you would put at least a 100% effort to not see your dreams flush down the toilet bowl. Â”<br><br>Do you know how many people in the industry drop out within 3 Â– 6 months? 90% thatÂ’s a scary thought, and you want to know why? Find out more by sending us your name and contact details to smart_mlm@yahoo.com for a look into the things that they never told you, to learn about the hidden truths and exploited myths of a much misunderstood industry.
