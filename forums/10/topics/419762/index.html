              <p>Nothing to laugh about cos its true and admitted to by Dragon Prince himself in: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krtGW-xUSH4&amp;#t=1m10s">'PM Lee says countries worldwide respect and admire Singapore's proven system'</a> [CNA 03May2006].<br> <br> That said, the truth in what you suggest is seen in how the PAP viz PA 
              needlessly created the unnecessary title of 'grassroots adviser', a 
              position created purely to usurp the grassroots and town council roles 
              of an opposition MP.<br> According to: <a href="http://forums.sgclub.com/singapore/adviser_over_mp_213362.html#post3037712">‘Adviser over MP’ raises many questions'</a> [ST, 22Oct2009]: <em>"PAP
               MPs are appointed as advisers to the grassroots organisations in  their
               wards by the People’s Association (PA). In the two opposition  wards, 
              the PA picked the PAP candidates who contested but lost in the  wards in
               the last two polls as the grassroots advisers."</em><br> <br> This show of blatant disregard towards the local roles and 
              responsibilities of opposition MPs despite their fervent protestations 
              [see <a href="http://theonlinecitizen.com/2009/10/no-basis-for-mp-not-to-announce-lift-upgrading/">link1: (LTK response)</a>, <a href="http://geraldgiam.sg/2009/10/hdb-should-be-neutral-and-stop-playing-politics/">Link2: (G Giam response)</a>],
               rings true the suspicion that the Prime Minister of Singapore is 
              increasingly insecure about his leadership and surreptitiously spends 
              much time conniving plans against the opposition about  the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krtGW-xUSH4&amp;#t=1m10s">"right way to fix them"</a>.<br> <br> This betrayal of the rights and responsibilities of an elected MP 
              unfortunately also is also lies in contradiction to the purported reason
               for the almost doubling of GRC constituency size.<br> <br> According to Elections Dept SG, [<a href="http://www.elections.gov.sg/elections_type_electoral.html#group">link</a>]:<em>"The
               GRC system was established in 1988  to ensure that the minority racial 
              communities in Singapore will always  be represented in Parliament"</em>.<br> <br> Records show however, that without any corresponding significant change 
              in neither the total numbers of GRCs nor parliamentary seats, the number
               of seats per GRC progressively increased from an average of 3 per GRC 
              in GE1988, to an average of 5.4/GRC by from 2001 onwards [<a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_aMxISxmw94Y/THTMjsVwbNI/AAAAAAAAAO8/uNlT3dUTQnk/s1600/100825-+Betrayal+of+the+original+intent+of+the+GRC+system+of+elections..JPG">chart pict</a>]. The corresponding fall in the number of SMC seats was from 42 (GE1988) to 9 (GE1997 and onwards). <br> This extraordinary GRC size inflation which was ironically associated 
              with a diluted original objective of 'ensuring minority racial 
              representation' [<a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_aMxISxmw94Y/THTMjsVwbNI/AAAAAAAAAO8/uNlT3dUTQnk/s1600/100825-+Betrayal+of+the+original+intent+of+the+GRC+system+of+elections..JPG">chart pict</a>] can purportedly be explained by the YPAP article titled <a href="http://www.youngpap.org.sg/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=158:thought-of-the-month-top-5-reasons-why-we-should-retain-the-grc-system&amp;catid=41:politics&amp;Itemid=34">'THOUGHT OF THE MONTH : Top 5 reasons why we should retain the GRC system'</a> by Fong Yoong Kheong and dated 11May2010 [<a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_aMxISxmw94Y/TPqxhPNRhCI/AAAAAAAAAQE/-fbOLOPaXRQ/s1600/THOUGHT+OF+THE+MONTH++Top+5+reasons+why+we+should+retain+the+GRC+system2.JPG">alt pict</a>],
               which puts 'economies of scale', 'grassroots work' and 'Town Council 
              commitments' as the additional justification for the hyperinflation of 
              GRC parliamentary seats since inception.<br> The relevant paragraphs  with the pertinent words highlighted are quoted as follows:</p>

              raised when candidates contest in a team because if the team loses, the 
              party will forsake 3-6 parliamentary seats. This forces individual MPs 
              in a GRC team to do his/her part to garner support from the 
              constituents. The team effort also translates into <span style="color: red;">MPs assisting one another in grassroots work</span>, especially when one or more MPs in the GRC are out of town for international visits.</li>

              (accessed 08Jan2011) </blockquote></div>
              <p>Thus the conundrum. The PAP government on one hand insists that the 'grassroots adviser(s)' in opposition wards shall be the <em>"PAP candidates who contested but lost in the  wards in the last two polls"</em>;
               whilst on the other hand premises the needless hyperinflation of each 
              GRC on the importance of economies of scale, grassroots relations and 
              town council work. This vast disparity of the importance of grassroots 
              relations work to an elected MP only serves to betray the PAP to be both
               a sore looser as well as a cold and cunning conspirator, one that 
              spends much time and effort bankrupting the opposition through cold and 
              calculated schemes.<br> <br> Perhaps democracy in Singapore has been subjugated to the pursuit of 
              profit; perhaps the PAP in its double speak is complicit of indeed 
              fixing the opposition by both usurping the relationship between an MP an
               his constituents, insincere reasons for expanding GRC sizes, not to 
              mention using <a href="http://www.petitiononline.com/merlion1/petition.html">national funds</a> to suit partisan hegemonic gain.<br> Perhaps the Prime Minister was indeed prophetic when he declared: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krtGW-xUSH4&amp;#t=1m10s">I'm
               going to spend all my time thinking what's the right way to fix them,

              <p>It is easy for Ben Franklin to say that since he was a wealthy man with a printing press. I think the situation is more complex than that. Democracy and the idea of freedom to govern themselves are a new kid in the block, ancient and wise Greek philosophers such as Aristotle and Plato dismiss democracy as a bad  political system and prefer the idea of philosopher-king or in modern term, a ruler who is well-educated, forward-looking and able to engineer massive social movement to improve the country or kingdom for better future.</p>
              <p>Even educated people in the USA in the 50's to 60's dabbled with socialism and communism since they were disillusioned with complete freedom. </p>
              <p>Does that mean I support authoritarian ruler? Ans: That depends. I prefer to be ruled by wise authoritarian figure/s who give the citizens what they want rather than elected idiots who broke their promises to the people. </p>
              <p>And do not hang your hope for better future with politics, personally after reading The Prince by Machiavelli, it is safe to assume all politicians are d***heads unless proven otherwise.</p>
