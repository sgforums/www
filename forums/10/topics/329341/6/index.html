              <p><br>errmm.... i think this is an extremely naive manner of define what is well informed and wht is not. i actually find this funny....</p>
              <p>fare hikes information are all over the so-called controlled media.... if the controlled media is not even reaching the masses, then what kind of "propanganda" is this?</p>
              <p>if, for example, there are some other source that gives a spin to the "true" reason for the fare hikes (and this reason is NOT found in the controlled media) (say, the fare hike is to pad the pockets of the politicians) than I'd say those who know are the well-informed and those who don't are ill-informed.</p>

              <p>My comment here is that public transport fare increase with regard to MRT and buses goes up upon a few cents by few cents, and with most commuters are using Linkcards, some are unaware of the increases, this is what i call tactical increment.

              <p> </p>
              <p>No doubt in the media, there are announcement that transport prices is going to be increase..however when and where is never a focus point, and when it really goes up,  no one feel it as they just scan their link card and top up as usual. And by the time people started to feel the pinch, it might have gone up 20 cents already.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Contrary to the above, the reason for the increment is usually oil prices increases and the cost of operation, but when oil goes now, why still increase??? It should be decreasing??? even petrol kisoks also decrease their prices, why public transport increase??? I think i know why?? because they want those not driving cars to pay ERP too.

              <p>Very good. Yes I agree with you.  LKY is a lawyer who know

              transportation, he is a very clever lawyer.  He one man alone

              <p>I agree.</p>
              <p>There must be a balanced view.</p>

              <p>Hey i don't really understand. What are the bad points of LKY? Overseeing Singapore's politics when he is way past his prime? No welfare for Singaporeans+rising costs of living?</p>
