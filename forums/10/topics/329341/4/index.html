              <p><br>again.... i don't believe there is such a thing as totally "brainwashed" or totally "well-informed".</p>

              <p>if we all can agree that there are so many avenues for one to go to, to be "well-informed" then there is really no issue on how we get our information.</p>
              <p>even a clown website from SDP is not banned, so anyone who wish to be "brainwashed" by chee can do so there, of course the reverse argument is also true, that one can received "well-informed" sources from The Democrat.</p>
              <p>as long as we are not Pyongyang, I really don't see how the garmen can clamp down anything much. If they want to control the press, control lah... I cannot foresee some inept cops knocking at my door tonight.</p>

              <p>collective intelligence IS superior to a single individual's intelligence insomuch  that the individuals that makes up the collective operate a selfless platform for the betterment of the group.</p>
              <p>unfortunately, i have a very pessimistic view that selfless individuals are far and few in between.</p>
              <p>especially so in the world of politics where it's survival of the fittest (and probably the most ruthless). even if there is no ruthlessness involved, the egos of the individuals will get in the way.</p>
