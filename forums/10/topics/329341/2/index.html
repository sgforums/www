              <p>i have written many letters to the press that were hardly edited except for the occasional grammatical error and maybe the length. were these letters written to praise the garmen? no!</p>
              <p>of course, i also have many letters not published either.... and these has nothing to do with whether i am partisan or not.</p>
              <p>....</p>
              <p>is a certain level of control over the media a fair thing? No, but if you are a good strategist, you will also do the same thing - controlling the lines of communication is imperative in winning any battle.</p>
              <p>no political parties worth his salt will yield an inch over what this party can control. fairness has nothing to do with it.</p>

              <p>Did you watch the interview with LKY when he spoke about press control?   He stated that once he became PM, he put press under his control.    The way he puts it, it is clear that the control is mainly for his and his party's good not for the public.    Media, press is his tool of propaganda. </p>
