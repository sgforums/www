            <div class='col-md body'>Women are not 'required' to serve in a combat vocation. With the closest they could come about is probably in their junior command role. After that, it's just.....plenty of paper pushing and PR.<br><br>Seriously, you don't expect a female officer to charge a hill with you right? let's face it, it's just physically too tough for them to do it!!<br><br>And i think they raise thru' the ranks because of courses they attended, manpower, logistics, stuff like that. Perhaps their career is already fixed when they enter the service, and if they are to have a COL and above female officer, where do you think she's gonna fit in the ORBAT?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I won't generalise about the capability of the women officer corp, but i will share with you guys my experince with women cadets who came up with my training frame to Brunei in '96/97. They were all pathetic in their physical fitness and half way through the navex and climbing Mt B, several of them collapsed and the other male cadets had to take over all their equipment; as well as to stretcher one of them up. Poor cadets. I had to carry one of their SBOs for them up, and they kept complaining that the course was 'not tailored for them as women' i mean...wtf, in war, since when did affirmative action come into place?<br>These women have to know that when they sign on, they are taking the entire programme as it is. There is no place for watering down training just for them, and if they can't hack it, then don't join the SAF. We can't afford to lower our standards just to be PC.</div>

There should be. Unless they can be 10 chin ups as upper body strength is a big obstacle for them.

            <div class='col-md body'>Yeah, have the female pilots fly our KC-135s.  So our pilots literally "tank" from them.  Unfortunately, the fluid transfer works the other way round in this case.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think the focus of this discussion has been on the role of women officers in the army. I agree with many of the post and feel that women officers have a disadvantage when it comes to serving in army frontline combat arms. The limitations have been mentioned earlier and like what someone says....bullets and mortar are gender blind. However i believe equal oppurtunities do exist in the RSN and RSAF - physical attributes are not prime considerations in these vocation. I have the privilege of serving with 2 female commanding officers and they are hard and firm ~I remember one of the nickname was &lt;titanium balls&gt;...but yet they do care for the men under them. The men respected them and their gender was never a factor in the command relation. In short, I think women do have the potential to be good SAF officers but perharps they should consider vocation in which their gender places them at the least disadvantage</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, perhaps specific to my vocation (and i don't mean to generalise here), a woman would be completely out of place. Even if had the utmost academic qualifications, and she came on board, I'd personally not respect her.<br>Unless she can go through what all me and my guys go through, no way I'd respect her.<br>Maybe some of you respect your woman officer bosses, but maybe it's cos they are all admin staff? (again, for fear of generalising and offending)<br><br>My point is (from earlier posts as well) is that men and women are unequal. Yes surprise, surprise, we are bigger and stronger. No shit einstein.<br>Hence certain types of jobs will always remain our forte. Unless of course the woman can hack it, then sure why not, but like i've always maintained, we must never lower our combat standads just to be PC.<br><br>On the other hand, there are many admin and non-combat vocations, and perhaps, 'less stressful' combat vocations like HQ staff (though in the front line) etc. which women should be conscripted to do - amongst other things like SCDF and police, medics, repairmen , etc , whatever.<br></div>

Just like to state the context of the example I bought up earlier, I am in the navy and the 2 female commanding officers are combat officers...CO RSS FEARLESS and CO RSS FREEDOM back in 2000.</div>

Good going RSN  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>It would be the largest insult to the pig-dogs up north to have a female (good ness those dity bitches who should be covered up and left in the kitchen, and stoned and left uneducated) from the RSN put a missile through their floating pieces of junks.<br>I would laugh myself silly watching their confused faces as they float in the water wondering how a woman (such an obviously dirty creture) could sink them.<br><br>Welcome to equality in Singapore numbnuts LOL<br><br>I also look forward to the day when i can see a female doing what I do.
