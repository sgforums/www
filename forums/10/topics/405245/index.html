              <p><em>The following transcripts are by Donaldson Tan of <strong><a href="http://newasiarepublic.com/">New Asia Republic</a></strong>.
               The video on Dr Lim Hock Siew has been banned on Youtube and on Martyn 
              See’s – the fimmaker – blogsite at <a href="http://singaporerebel.blogspot.com/">http://singaporerebel.blogspot.com</a> . It is however available on other host sites such as<strong><a href="http://www.vimeo.com/13292596"> this one</a></strong>.</em></p>
              <p><strong>Donaldson Tan</strong></p>
              <p><strong><em>On 12 July 2010, the Media Development Authority 
              announced its decision to ban the film (starting from 14 July 2010) 
              depicting Dr Lim Hock Siew speaking publicly on his experience being 
              detained under the Internal Security Act</em></strong>.</p>
              <p><em><a href="http://theonlinecitizen.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/lhsbanned.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-25227" title="lhsbanned" src="http://theonlinecitizen.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/lhsbanned.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="238"></a>A founding member of the ruling 
              People’s Action Party, Lim was accused of being a communist and was 
              arrested without trial in 1963, and had his detention prolonged by the 
              then Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew until his release in 1982.</em></p>
              <p><em> </em></p>
              <p><em>On 14th of Nov 2009, Lim made his first post-detention speech in 
              Singapore during a book launch. The day coincided with the arrival of US
               President Barack Obama in Singapore for the APEC Summit.</em></p>
              <p>My contribution to this book is very modest. Because of my 
              ill-health, I’ve not been able to write too much. It comprises mainly of
               a statement which I made when I was in prison in 1972, after 9 years of
               incarceration.</p>
              <p>As you know, I was detained in Coldstore Operation in February the 
              2nd 1963, and I was the last one to come out from the batch of detainees
               almost 20 years later. Now this statement mainly stated my stand on my 
              detention.</p>
              <p>After 9 years of incarceration, they wanted me to issue a statement 
              to firstly support the so-called democratic system of Singapore, and 
              secondly to renounce politics. I told them that these two demands are 
              self-contradictory, because if there is parliamentary democracy, then I 
              don’t have to give up politics.</p>
              <p>So they said, “You must say something to show repentance other wise 
              Lee Kuan Yew will lose face.” For me this not a question of pride, it’s a
               question of principle. In the first place, if a person has to save his 
              face by depriving somebody else of his fundamental rights, then that’s 
              not a face that’s worth saving.</p>
              <p>So the, the main democratic right is a fundamental constitutional 
              right of the people of Singapore. And no one should be deprived of their
               right, and held ransom to extort statements of repentance and 
              contrition. So the whole thing bogged down to having to issue a 
              statement of repentance, which I refused.</p>
              <p>Subsequently, I was detained for another almost 10 years, after that 
              statement was issued. So a total of 19 years and eight months, longer 
              than a life sentence. Life sentences will be released after 13 years, 
              after the initial one-third remission, but for no charge, no trial, I 
              was detained for longer than life sentences.</p>
              <p>A lot of hullabaloo have been said recently on the right of political
               detainees to appeal to an Advisory Board. I want to tell you about my 
              experience in this Advisory Board.</p>
              <p>After about one year of detention, I was asked to the prison main 
              gate at about 4pm, and a statement of notice to say that I had to appear
               before the Advisory Board the next day, and I was given a two fool-scap
               paper of so-called charge sheets.</p>
              <p>I said I wanted to keep these sheets of paper so I could prepare for 
              my next morning’s appearance. They said, “No, you cannot keep it. Just 
              read it and we’ll take it back.”</p>
              <p>I said I want to inform my lawyer about this. They said, “No, you 
              have the right to inform your lawyer, but you cannot telephone him now.”
               I said, “In that case, how do I contact my lawyer?” He said, “That’s 
              the law.”</p>
              <p>So the next morning I was called to the High Court in handcuffs and 
              all that to appear before an Advisory Board comprising three persons. A 
              judge called Judge Winslow and two other persons. One is a certain 
              Elias, I think he’s a lawyer, and the other one a Chinese gentleman 
              whose name I cannot remember.</p>
              <p>So, on these so-called charge sheets, there were a lot of blank 
              spaces. I asked Judge Winslow what do these blank spaces mean? He said, 
              “Oh, these are charges which are so sensitive that they can be shown 
              only to the Advisory Board but not to you.”</p>
              <p>I said, “How the hell can anybody defend himself against a charge 
              that’s not even revealed to him?” I asked him for advice, he just said 
              [shrugs shoulder]. I said, “Is this a mockery of justice or what?” He 
              said, “This is the law.”</p>
              <p>You see, the whole thing is a judicial farce. I mean, it’s incredible
               that anyone has to face this kind of mockery, this kind of so-called 
              justice, and the fact that a High court judge is being put as the 
              chairman of this Advisory Board gives the public an illusion that there 
              is judgement, there is justice. And I told him that if I were a High 
              court judge, I would not lend credence to this mockery by my presence.</p>
              <p>Then this Elias threatened me with contempt of court. I was very 
              happy when he with contempt of court, because after all I was already in
               prison, so threatening me with contempt of court and al that makes no 
              difference to me. By the way, in my 20 years in prison, I was detained 
              in practically all the prisons in Singapore, except of course the female
               prison.</p>
              <p>In the end, the judge said, “No, no, let the doctor have his say, 
              there’s no question of contempt of court.” So I gave a three-hour 
              statement to debunk all the so-called charges. One of the charges was in
               fact a false charge.</p>
              <p>I was charged for being one of the right Fajar students who were 
              charged for sedition. I said, “As a matter of fact, I didn’t have the 
              privilege to be one of the eight. In fact, I would be flattered to be 
              one of the eight, and that I was not one of the eight.</p>
              <p>So why should I be imprisoned for allegedly being one of the eight, 
              when these eight were acquitted without being called, and acquitted and 
              defended by Lee Kuan Yew himself, who is now detaining me?”</p>
              <p>He said, “This is the law.”</p>
              <p>Everything is the law. So recently you have heard all this so-called 
              rule of law. Now there is detention without trial by ISA [Internal 
              Security Act], a law which makes a mockery of the concept of rule of 
              law. It is a law that is outside the rule of law. Once you are detained 
              under the ISA, you have no legal defence whatsoever.</p>
              <p>I tried the habeas corpus twice. On one occasion I succeeded on the 
              technical error on the side of the government–they did not sign my 
              detention order. It was supposed to be signed by a minister, but it was 
              delegated to a civil servant. So on that account the court has to 
              release me on a technical point.</p>
              <p>So when I was released, there was the Special Branch waiting for me 
              outside Queenstown Prison. I was re-arrested one minute later. It was a 
              mock release. And for that habeas corpus, I was punished and sent to the
               most hideous of all detention centres, the Central Police Station head 
              office.</p>
              <p>That was a place that is not fit to keep animals let alone human 
              beings. The place was so dark, so stinky and so ill-ventilated that you 
              cannot stand inside for more than 24 hours, but I was locked in there 
              for 24 hours a day. And the whole place was infested with bugs. I had a 
              lot of bugs for company.</p>
              <p>No reading material and the light was so dim that I could hardly see 
              the crease of my hand. So immediately the five of us went on hunger 
              strike, and my ulcer bled and I had to be transferred to hospital. That 
              was the so-called habeas corpus right there you have. Try it at your 
              risk, or be severely punished.</p>
              <p>The second time I went for habeas corpus case was when they tried to 
              force me to do manual labour. That was in 1972. They said all detainees 
              should do manual labour as a programme of rehabilitation. I was supposed
               to do carpentry. So this superintendent told me that it was good for 
              you as a doctor, you try to become more dexterous with your hand.</p>
              <p>So I said, “You do not have the qualifications to enter a medical 
              college, and here you are telling a doctor what is good for 
              post-graduate education. Are you over-reaching yourself?”</p>
              <p>He said, “This is the law. You have to be paid 8 cents a day.” So we 
              all went on hunger strike, and some of us went on hunger strike for 
              three months in order to frustrate their attempt to make us labourers 
              like criminals. I went on hunger strike for three weeks before they came
               in and said, “Okay, we exempt you from that.”</p>
              <p>And the women detainees in Moon Crescent Centre went on hunger strike
               for 130 days, and they were forced-fed. Some of them vomited after 
              being fed milk by the tube inserted forcefully into their oesophagus.</p>
              <p>One girl vomited and the superintendent forced for wardens to carry 
              her and wiped the floor with her pants. This is the kind of treatment 
              meted to detainees. All these of course suppressed by the press, but 
              this is the thing we all had to go through.</p>
              <p>Now all of us had to go through detention in solitary confinement. 
              Solitary confinement according to Lee Kuan Yew himself is a very bad 
              form of torture. I will read to you what Lee Kuan Yew said of solitary 
              confinement: “The biggest punishment a man can receive is total 
              isolation in a dungeon, black and complete withdrawal of all stimuli. 
              That is real torture.” Lee Kuan Yew, January 2008.</p>
              <p>Although he knows it is real torture, he had no compunction in meting
               out this real torture to all detainees without exception. Some of us 
              had to undergo this real torture, not for one day, two days, but for six
               months. Now under the law, there is a protection for even criminal 
              prisoners from this kind of torture.</p>
              <p>A criminal prisoner when found guilty of infringing prison rules will
               be sentenced to solitary confinement for not more than two weeks, 
              because of the obvious mental health effects. But for political 
              detainees, there is no protection.</p>
              <p>And Lee Eu Seng, the general manager of Nanyang Zhao Pao, was put 
              into solitary confinement not once but twice, and it is to his credit he
               withstood that kind of real torture.</p>
              <p>TT Rajah, a lawyer who was detained for two and half years, was put 
              under solitary confinement for six months. Twice. Said Zahari was put 
              into solitary confinement four times in his long 17 years of detention.</p>
              <p>It is to our credit that we did not back down despite our difficult 
              ordeal. We stood our ground and held on to our integrity. Today, they 
              are asking us to be magnanimous. What does magnanimity mean? Only those 
              who have suffered have the moral right, the moral standing to be 
              magnanimous, not the culprit.</p>
              <p>The culprit can seek forgiveness, if they admit their mistakes and 
              apologise for it. Not for the victims of this torture to seek 
              forgiveness. We are the ones who have to be magnanimous, and we are 
              prepared to be magnanimous provided the culprits admit their mistakes 
              and seek our forgiveness.</p>
              <p>In my statement which I released to the press in 1972, through my 
              wife Beatrice Chen, and which was of course suppressed by the 
              newspapers, but was distributed a lot to all student organisations–I 
              said the proper way to settle our case is that you must release us 
              without conditions.</p>
              <p>Unconditional release. Moreover, you must compensate us for our long 
              detention and also apologise. I said I’m prepared to forgo these two 
              last conditions of having to compensate us and also having to apologise 
              to us because I don’t believe an arrogant man like Lee Kuan Yew would 
              concede easily.</p>
              <p>On that question of release unconditionally–that we stand firm, I 
              stood firm and had to suffer for two decades. That is the price that we 
              had to pay for our integrity.</p>
              <p>In Singapore, we have a situation where the government leaders said 
              they have integrity that has to be sustained by the highest pay in the 
              world, but yet they demand from political opponents and detainees an 
              integrity that has to be sustained by the longest imprisonment in the 
              world.</p>
              <p>This kind of two types of integrity, to compare them is to compare 
              heaven and earth. Why should anybody has to sacrifice so much just to 
              sustain his integrity and his beliefs? And the government have to reward
               themselves with so much high pay. This is the immorality of the 
              political situation in Singapore today.</p>
              <p>Now, detention without trial is not a peaceful action. It is an act 
              of violence. They come to see you not in the daylight with an invitation
               card. They come in the morning, 4am. That is the time when decent 
              people sleep, and when political terrorists and tyrants strike. And when
               you are detained, you are subjected to all kinds of mental and even 
              physical torture.</p>
              <p>This is not only unique for the 1963 batch, it was also practised in 
              many other batches of detention: 1972, and as late as 1987. When Teo Soh
               Lung and her group of so-called marxist detainees were subjected to 
              mental and physical torture. And women lawyers can be subjected to 
              torture. But when these women lawyers came out and issued a statement to
               describe how they have been tortured, they were again detained and 
              compelled to withdraw their accusation.</p>
              <p>What type of rule of law is that when the accuser can be punished by 
              the accused against the government, and compelled to withdraw their 
              accusation? Is it not a rule of law justice turned upside down? Now this
               is a situation where even the Law Society dare not utter a word of 
              protest. They are so impotent after what they had done to the Law 
              Society in 1987.</p>
              <p>Now, Poo Soo Kai has written a very good article on Operation 
              Coldstore. In it, he has revealed a lot of declassified British archive 
              documents, showing how the British and Lee Kuan Yew conspired and 
              collaborated to crush the opposition before the 1963 General Elections. 
              The whole aim of this merger was to crush the opposition before the 1963
               elections.</p>
              <p>And today, the PAP is standing on high moral ground, demanding human 
              rights in other countries, even demanding the realise of political 
              detainees in Myanmar. But precisely on what moral ground are they 
              standing to have this demand? In examining their past records, they are 
              standing on a pedestal that is leaking with worms and vermin, Let them 
              repent first their own dismal record of human rights and then you may 
              have the moral right to cast aspersions on other people’s lack of human 
              rights.</p>
              <p>Poh Soo Kai has also written the last chapter of this book [The Fajar
               Generation], about the future of Socialism. Many of you may ponder what
               is the relevance of Socialism in this era. after 50 years when the club
               was formed, Socialist movements all over the world has suffered a lot 
              of setbacks and even defeats, and some wonder whether we are still 
              relevant.</p>
              <p>The recent economic crisis, the recent financial crisis, has once 
              again exploded the corruption and immorality of the capitalist system, 
              and feel that human beings should deserve something better than a system
               that is generated by greed and by corruption.</p>
              <p>Now some of you may have heard that when you are young you are 
              idealistic, when you’re old you are realistic. Now this is the kind of 
              rubbish that is used by those who have either lost their ideals or have 
              sold their ideals for self-interests. Each should not wither one’s 
              ideals or convictions.</p>
              <p>If anything, it should only consolidate and make it more resolute. If
               age has anything to do with it, it is only by way of expression and 
              application of these ideals and convictions having the benefit of a 
              youthful experience. And a life without convictions, without idealism, 
              is a mere meaningless existence, and I’m sure most of you will agree 
              that as human beings, we are worthy of a life much more meaningful than 
              just that.</p>
              <p>Thank you.</p>

              <p>Gentlemen,</p>
              <p>It is not that peoples of Singapore do not know that some ex political leaders are unreasonably jailed and mistreated. Singaporeans knew is all along, you dun have to repeatly spell it out here. Now, since singaporeans all know how this ex political leaders suffering, why they still choose to vote for PAP!!! You got any anwer to it??</p>
              <p>For me, first and foremost, Politics is the most dirtiest, more dirtier than those pimps and pros outside my house, it is a dirty game, and if you are not up to the mark, you lose out and the winner takes it all. You can see that around the world, not only in singapore, and if you play the game well, you go up. To sustain that position, you need to destroy your foes, if you are soft hearted guy, forget about politic, be a cook or drivers or nurses. And to further enhance your position, you need to provide that stability, prosperity and opportunity for your peoples, and LKY did that very well.</p>
