Paul allegedly argues with friend at void deck outside school. Peter pushes and kicks him. Other friends allegedly join in.<br>All of them, including Paul, are Secondary 3 students.<br><br>On of the alleged attackers, Peter (not his real name), claimed that Paul behaved strangely and had provoked the group last week by using his camera phone to take pictures of them.<br><br>'I didn't know him well, although he was from the same school. But on Thursday, I was outside school after classes and waiting for two friends to go play basketball when I saw him in an argument with my friend.<br><br>'I was kaypoh (curious) and just stared at them. Suddenly he scolded me in Hokkien,' Peter alleged, adding that he did not understand what the boy was saying.<br><br>Incensed, Peter went up to the boy and pushed him. The boy landed on the floor, and Peter said he then kicked him once.<br><br>Some of Peter's friends allegedly joined in, raining blows on the boy. A few then allegedly took him into a lift and continued beating him on the fourth floor.<br><br>SEARCHED FLOOR TO FLOOR<br>2. He is allegedly taken into life to 4th storey to be beaten again. Other boys follow soon after.<br><br>'The rest of us didn't know where they were, so we looked for them from floor to floor and found them at the fourth floor,' claimed Peter.<br><br>'After that, they took him to a bus stop, and we left.'<br><br>A passer-by who saw the victim called the police. By the time police arrived, the group of 11 had left. Police then called for an ambulance.<br><br>Paul suffered bruises on his back and cuts on his face.<br><br>SCDF spokesman Captain Cera Tan said that when paramedics reached the scene, they found Paul at a bus stop. The boy was conscious, and was treated for a bleeding cut behind his left ear.<br><br>Cpt Tan added that Paul refused the paramedic's offer to take him to hospital for further checks.<br><br>Based on initial investigations and interviews, police managed to identify the 11 boys who were allegedly involved in the fight.<br><br>3. Paul is left at the bus stop, where he sends an SMS to his discipline mistress. He refuses paramedics' offer to go to hospital<br>By noon the following day, police picked up all 11 suspects, aged 15 to 17, at their school, and took them to Jurong Police Division for questioning.<br><br>They were held in custody until 2pm on Saturday, when they were released on bail.<br><br>Investigations into the beating are still on, police spokesman Karen Chen said.<br><br>The vice-principal of the boys' secondary school said Paul had sent an SMS to the discipline mistress from the bus stop after he was attacked.<br><br>By the time she reached the scene, police were already attending to the boy.<br><br>The vice-principal said: 'It is something that happened outside of school, although the source of contention may have started within school.'<br><br>She added that Paul did not have previous disciplinary problems. But on the day of the fight, he was supposed to have had a counselling session with the discipline mistress over a complaint made about his manner of communicating with others.<br><br>DISCIPLINARY PROBLEMS<br><br>She did say, however, that some of the alleged attackers have had disciplinary problems before, but declined to reveal the nature of these problems.<br><br>'As police investigations are ongoing, we will assist them in whatever way we can. We are also in contact with the parents of all the boys, and will do whatever is necessary and in line with our procedures, through detention and compulsory counselling,' she said.<br><br>Under the law, those who are found guilty of gang fights, which can be deemed as rioting, can be jailed up to five years and caned if they are tried as adults.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Arrests of fighting youths doubled<br><br>POLICE nabbed 512 youngsters for rioting last year - up from just 250 in 2001.<br><br>In the first half of this year, overall juvenile arrests have gone up to 2,428 with shoplifting and handphone thefts the most worrying trends.<br><br>A Subordinate Courts study published recently showed more youngsters are now committing robbery and snatch thefts.<br><br>Nearly one in five arrests in such cases in the last two years involved under 21s. Last year, 4,716 people under 21 were arrested, slightly lower than the 4,918 in 2003.<br><br>Almost half those arrested were below 16, and about 80 per cent of them were students aged 14 to 15.<br></div>

A 15-year-old student had been assaulted by a group of boys and as a result, suffered serious bruising to his back, and also bruising and lacerations on his face.<br><br>Based on initial investigations and interviews, the identities of 11 boys were established. They are students of a secondary school in Choa Chu Kang, and are the victim's schoolmates.<br><br>At about noon the next day (28 Oct), the 11 boys, aged 15 to 17, were detained by police and brought back to Jurong Police Division for questioning.<br><br>Upon reaching the Division, the boys were immediately allowed to make a call to their parents to inform them of the matter. Ten of the boys managed to contact their parents. However, the remaining boy was unable to reach his parents at home or in the office despite being allowed to make calls.<br><br>Our officers were informed that he did not know how to contact them otherwise. Although no further request was received from the boy to call his parents thereafter, our officers could have been more helpful to ensure that the parents were contacted.<br><br>At about 8pm that night, the parents of said boy enquired with Choa Chu Kang Neighbourhood Police Centre on their son's whereabouts and were referred to Jurong Police Division accordingly.<br><br>Our officer then explained to them that their son was believed to be involved in a fight. It was also explained to them that as the matter was still under investigations, we were unable to accede to their request to speak to their son at that point in time.<br><br>By 2pm on 29 Oct, the boy and his 10 schoolmates had all been released on bail.<br><br>Investigations are ongoing.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Other teen beatings<br><br>Three years ago, a 19-year-old girl was dragged to the top of Punggol Park by five girls aged 12 to 17 and beaten up.<br><br>The attackers even lured a group of five boys to join them by promising an R(A) show, and stripped off the victim's blouse and bra in front of the boys.<br><br>The attack was 'punishment' because the victim had ratted about one of the group's members for stealing a school bag.<br><br>In August this year, two of the girls were sentenced to two years probation, while another two were sentenced to reformative training for an unspecified length of time.<br><br>The fifth girl was dealt with separately as she is now only 15.<br><br>On an April Fool's Day, a 15-year-old girl was left with 30 bruises and cuts to her head, chest, legs and arms.<br><br>She was the victim of a beating by a group of 11 boys and girls, aged between 14 and 17 - because a member of the group found her 'arrogant'.<br><br>They beat her for almost an hour, even flinging chairs at her. They also threw water on her, and tried to strip and photograph her with their camera phones.<br><br>All three boys and eight girls were charged with rioting.<br><br></div>

It is to strengthen one's physique &amp; endurance. Martial arts should only be used for self-defence, not to fight with others &amp; it is definitely not for show off.<br><br>Let me quote an example. We only use the fire-extinguisher when there is a fire. You do not see anyone using the fire-extinguisher for no reason right??? Tio bo???<br><br>Now do you get it???</div>
