              <p>To me, given the low birth rate, the number of citizens working will be even lower than now, added with work place bias against locals, government will soon have to find another source to feed their cronies.</p>
              <p>Citizens' CPF are already locked out, and included in the government budget but if more losses and mismanagement occurs, I think they will be hard pressesd to find any more revenues. Robbing Citizens' CPF is already, in my opinion, breaking the back of citizens already. Citizens have nothing more for the government to fleece on.</p>
              <p>PRs will have to be next, I don't really see how government can squeeze anything more, citizens will dwindle and fade away eventually. New citizens will just use this as a stepping stone to other countries anyway.</p>

              <p>the tempo is too fast and too rigid without alternatives...i believe every system is not infallible...they do make mistakes....thats ok... but they need to balance without further financial pressures on the lower classes....means they need to offset from the top...  </p>

              <p>I have read that CPF will persuade citizens giving up Singaporean citizens not to give up their citizenship if they intend to be a citizen of another country, because Sinkapore does not allow dual citizenship currently.</p>
              <p>Depending on the years they worked in Sinkapore and their salary before going abroad, the amount of money that they will withdraw from Sinkapore is in millions, so that's a sizable amount and besides that, those that leaves have skills or assets that they are instead contributing to other countries for the rest of their lives, which will aid in the growth of their adopted country. Sinkapore is losing big time.</p>
              <p>I suspect that is one of the reason that the gov is holding onto our CPF, just look around and try to find how many locals are working to feed the gov's CPF. Low birth rate is already killing Sinkapore.</p>
              <p>We, the citizens can take the hard truth.</p>
              <p>The hard truth is the government got no balls to tell us the truth.</p>
              <p>The truth is the government have devastated this country in their over-zealeous protection of their own cronies and their precious idiotic dumb Leefamilies.</p>

              <p>You put your money in a bank and then when you want to withdraw it after 30 years, the bank says sorry, we don't want to return you your money because we think you might squander it on gambling or whatever.

              <p>our money are safe with the government. you see, we may spend it all or gamble it away. so the fantastic idea is to lock it up safely.</p>
              <p>no withdrawal except for housing - front gate lock</p>
              <p>buy best price public housing in the world - still locked, front door lock</p>
              <p>extend withdrawal age with compulsory annuity - extra hinge lock on the door</p>
              <p>put a casino outside the door - better reason to stay indoors</p>
              <p>But be assured, the government is putting it away safely outside the door. they need it to use it for something meaningful in their names, they need to instil confidence in the world banking system no matter how high the price of the stakes of the banks they bought.</p>

              <p>yes sad in fact that we started contributing to our æ£ºæ��æœ¬from our twenties onwards. but even some insurance has features that provides for å�Žäº‹. also, we can only accept whatever poor rates that comes with such a loonng life insurances 30-60 years depending on how long we live, since life insurances still come with death or illness cover other than the cash value. for cpf, the cover is eaten up.</p>
              <p>for such a large amount, both the rate of return (normally projected 3-5% pa) and death or illness cover can be substantial at the end.</p>
              <p>by allowing them to do what they want with ç™½é‡‘we gave to ourselves from younger, we are also resigned to poor rates for something that has NO liquidity. in insurance if we are willing to accept low liquidity (we don't touch the money), we can get rather  high rates, not to mention other forms of investments yet.</p>
              <p>by doing a wiki on real interest rates, we know how much we are shortchanged on our cpf. first, we are wiped out last year and this year with inflation coming in at about 4%, next regulatory risks which force us to accept whatever which may happen to our account like annuity should warrant higher rates too.</p>
              <p>______________________</p>
              <p>The "<strong>real interest rate</strong>" is approximately the <a href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Nominal_interest_rate"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">nominal interest rate</span></span></a> minus the <a href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Inflation"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">inflation</span></span></a> rate (see <a href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Fisher_equation"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Fisher equation</span></span></a> and below for exact equation). It is the rate of interest an investor expects to receive after subtracting inflation. This is not a single number, as different investors have different expectations of future inflation. If, for example, an investor were able to lock in a 5% interest rate for the coming year and anticipated a 2% rise in prices, he would expect to earn a real interest rate of 3%.<sup id="cite_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="http://sgforums.com/forums/10/topics/#cite_note-0"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></span></span></a></sup></p>
              <p>Since the inflation rate over the course of a loan is not known initially, <a title="Volatility (finance)" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Volatility_(finance)"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">volatility</span></span></a> in inflation represents a risk to both the lender and the borrower.</p>
              <p><strong>In economics and finance, an individual who lends money for repayment at a later point in time expects to be compensated for the </strong><a href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Time_value_of_money"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>time value of money</strong></span></span></a><strong>, or not having the use of that money while it is lent.</strong> <strong>In addition, they will want to be compensated for the </strong><a title="Risk" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Risk"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>risks</strong></span></span></a><strong> of having less </strong><a href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Purchasing_power"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>purchasing power</strong></span></span></a><strong> when the loan is repaid.</strong> <strong>These risks are systematic risks, regulatory risks and inflation risks.</strong> The first includes the possibility that the borrower will <a title="Default (finance)" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Default_(finance)"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">default</span></span></a> or be unable to pay on the originally agreed upon terms, or that collateral backing the loan will prove to be less valuable than estimated. The second includes <a title="Tax" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Tax"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">taxation</span></span></a> and changes in the law which would prevent the lender from collecting on a loan or having to pay more in taxes on the amount repaid than originally estimated. The third takes into account that the money repaid may not have as much buying power from the perspective of the lender as the money originally lent, that is inflation, and may include fluctuations in the value of the currencies involved.</p>
