              <p>April 14 (Bloomberg) -- Singapore said its economy may
              shrink as much as 9 percent this year, the most since
              independence in 1965, as a deepening global recession drives
              down exports and manufacturing.</p>
              <p>The <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=SGDYTY%3AIND">economy</a> may contract 6 percent to 9 percent, the trade
              ministry said in a statement today, reducing its forecast for
              the third time this year. The government previously predicted a
              decline of as much as 5 percent.</p>
              <p>The central bank said it would adjust the trading range for
              the Singapore dollar, effectively lowering the band for the
              first time since 2003 to revive growth. Exports tumbled for an
              11th month amid a slump that’s forced <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=CSM%3ASP">Chartered Semiconductor
              Manufacturing Ltd</a>. to fire workers and the government to reduce
              taxes and subsidize jobs.</p>
              <p>“The situation is really dire and the central bank’s
              policy will improve sentiment and help the economy,” said
              <a href="http://search.bloomberg.com/search?q=Vishnu+Varathan&amp;site=wnews&amp;client=wnews&amp;proxystylesheet=wnews&amp;output=xml_no_dtd&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;filter=p&amp;getfields=wnnis&amp;sort=date:D:S:d1">Vishnu Varathan</a>, an economist at Forecast Singapore Pte. The
              policy move “gives them the flexibility to weaken the currency
              now, and steer it to strengthen when things get better.”</p>
              <p>The worst global slump since World War II has pushed Asia’s
              trade-dependent nations into their deepest slowdown in more than
              a decade. Thailand’s <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=THGDPYOY%3AIND">economy</a> may suffer a bigger contraction in
              2009 than the 3 percent decline initially forecast after anti-
              government protests led to a state of emergency in Bangkok,
              Finance Minister <a href="http://search.bloomberg.com/search?q=Korn+Chatikavanij&amp;site=wnews&amp;client=wnews&amp;proxystylesheet=wnews&amp;output=xml_no_dtd&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;filter=p&amp;getfields=wnnis&amp;sort=date:D:S:d1">Korn Chatikavanij</a> said today.</p>
              <p>The <a href="http://www.mas.gov.sg/">Monetary Authority of Singapore</a>, which uses the
              exchange rate to manage price stability, said the local dollar
              had been trading at the lower end of its target range since
              October. The band will now be “re-centered” to reflect recent
              levels, it said.</p>
              <p>Effective Devaluation</p>
              <p>“The re-centering effectively translates to roughly a 1.7
              percent devaluation of the Singapore dollar on a trade-weighted
              basis,” said <a href="http://search.bloomberg.com/search?q=Wai+Ho+Leong&amp;site=wnews&amp;client=wnews&amp;proxystylesheet=wnews&amp;output=xml_no_dtd&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;filter=p&amp;getfields=wnnis&amp;sort=date:D:S:d1">Wai Ho Leong</a>, a regional economist at Barclays
              Capital in Singapore. That would be the first effective lowering
              of the currency band since July 2003, he said.</p>
              <p>Southeast Asia’s worst-performing currency this year rose
              1.1 percent today after the central bank said there’s no reason
              for an “undue weakening.” Singapore stopped favoring gains in
              the local dollar in October and the central bank said today it
              will continue to seek neither appreciation nor depreciation.</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=SICPIYOY%3AIND">Inflation</a> will continue to ease in the coming months on
              cheaper commodities and a weakening economy, the authority said,
              reiterating a forecast that consumer prices will fall as much as
              1 percent or remain unchanged this year.</p>
              <p>Forecasts Cut</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=SGDPQOQ%3AIND">Singapore’s gross domestic product</a> declined an annualized
              19.7 percent last quarter from the previous three months, the
              trade ministry said today. The contraction was more than double
              the 9.6 percent drop predicted in a Bloomberg <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=SGAVQOQ%25%3AIND">survey</a>, and the
              biggest since at least 1975.</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=DBS%3ASP">DBS Group Holdings Ltd</a>. and United Overseas Bank Ltd.
              lowered their Singapore GDP forecasts today. DBS predicts the
              economy will shrink 7.7 percent this year, from an earlier
              forecast of a 4.8 percent contraction, while <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=UOB%3ASP">United Overseas</a> expects a slide of 7.5 percent.</p>
              <p>“The global economy is expected to remain weak in the
              coming quarters,” the trade ministry said today. “While there
              are tentative signs of some stabilization in the housing,
              financial and manufacturing sectors in the U.S., they do not
              point to a clear turnaround in economic activity.”</p>
              <p>Singapore’s efforts to prevent job losses by handing out
              cash to companies haven’t stopped Chartered Semiconductor,
              music-player maker <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=CREAF%3ASP">Creative Technology Ltd</a>. and Swiss lender UBS
              AG from firing workers.</p>
              <p>Job Losses</p>
              <p>Companies probably fired more than 10,000 workers in the
              first three months of 2009, the Straits Times cited Prime
              Minister <a href="http://search.bloomberg.com/search?q=Lee+Hsien+Loong&amp;site=wnews&amp;client=wnews&amp;proxystylesheet=wnews&amp;output=xml_no_dtd&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;filter=p&amp;getfields=wnnis&amp;sort=date:D:S:d1">Lee Hsien Loong</a> as saying last week. <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=SIA%3ASP">Singapore Airlines
              Ltd.</a> has frozen pay and asked employees to take unpaid leave,
              and publisher <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=SPH%3ASP">Singapore Press Holdings Ltd.</a> has cut wages.</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=UBSN%3AVX">UBS</a>, Switzerland’s largest bank, said today it will
              eliminate 100 jobs in Singapore as it cuts about 240 positions
              from its wealth management division in the Asia-Pacific. Growth
              in financial services in Singapore slowed every quarter last
              year, and fell 8.1 percent in the final three months.</p>
              <p>“The recession is very real and we have been bracing
              ourselves for a slowdown in demand,” said Dhrubajyoti Das,
              executive director of Singapore-based Samudera Shipping Line Ltd.
              “We will remain open to the possibility of capacity
              rationalization.”</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=SIEXNON%25%3AIND">Exports</a> fell 17 percent in March from a year earlier, the
              trade promotion agency said today. Overseas shipments may drop
              as much as 13 percent in 2009, the government said, revising a
              previous estimate for a decline of 9 percent to 11 percent.</p>
              <p>“Visibility remains fairly poor,” said <a href="http://search.bloomberg.com/search?q=Chong+Chow+Pin&amp;site=wnews&amp;client=wnews&amp;proxystylesheet=wnews&amp;output=xml_no_dtd&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;filter=p&amp;getfields=wnnis&amp;sort=date:D:S:d1">Chong Chow Pin</a>,

              <p>Singapore’s $161 billion economy contracted 11.5 percent
              last quarter from a year earlier. Manufacturing, which accounts

              <h1>Singapore devalues its fading dollar</h1>
              <h2>A sharp decline in Singapore's economy in the first three months of the year 
                has triggered a de facto devaluation of the Asian country's currency.</h2>
              <p>By Nic Fildes</p>
              <p>In the three months to the end of March Singapore's gross domestic product 
                fell nearly 20pc compared with the previous quarter, a result that proved 
                much worse than most economists had forecast and was the largest quarterly 
                decline on record. Compared with the same quarter a year earlier, 
                Singapore's economy has shrunk 11.5pc.</p>
              <p>As a result of the "sharp deterioration" in GDP, the trade ministry warned 
                that the Singapore economy may contract by up to 9pc this year compared with its 
                previous forecast of a potential decline of between 2pc and 5pc.</p>
              <p>The fall was driven by an eleventh straight month of export declines, with 
                non-oil domestic exports down 17pc in March. The export-led economy has been 
                hit by a collapse in global consumer confidence, particularly in Europe and 
                the US, and a loss of trade to regional rivals. That had a knock-on effect 
                to other parts of the economy with manufacturing down 29pc in the first 
                quarter.</p>
              <p>The trade ministry said it expects the manufacturing sector to remain weak 
                during 2009 despite the Singapore government's £8.6bn stimulus package 
                announced earlier this year.</p>
              <p>The Monetary Authority of Singapore moved to reflect the poor economic data by 
                effectively devaluing the local currency by lowering the trading band in 
                which it is managed. The move, which echoes the action taken in previous 
                downturns in 2002 and 2003, devalues the currency by around 2pc according to 
                economists.</p>
              <p>Yet the re-rating of the currency was deemed to be far less aggressive than 
                had been expected and positive comments from Singapore's central bank 
                strengthened confidence in the local currency which has lost nearly 10pc of 
                its value against the US dollar over the past year.</p>
              <p>The Singapore central bank said that it could see no reason for "any undue 
                weakening" of the Singapore dollar which implied it does not plan to devalue 
                the currency further. "The Singapore economy continues to be anchored by 
                sound fundamentals and a resilient financial system," the government body 
                said in a statement. It described the devaluation as a "one-off".</p>
              <p>The exchange rate band is Singapore's key monetary device. The Monetary 
                Authority of Singapore does not disclose the limits of the trading range.</p>

              <h2 class="art_title">Singapore's Sinking Economy Over-Dependent on Exports</h2>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;"><em>By Chosun Ilbo columnist Lee June</em></span></p>
              <p>On
              his first trip to the United States in 1967, former Singapore Prime
              Minister Lee Kuan Yew attended a lunch gathering in Chicago hosted by
              American businessmen. One participant asked Lee how Singapore, once
              just a small fishing village, became a metropolis that houses two
              million residents. Lee offered a clear explanation: Singapore
              manufactured products that were the cheapest in the world, yet were of
              top quality. He said if Singapore was unable to do that, it would not
              survive. Word spread throughout corporate America: "Keep your eyes on
              Singapore."<br><br>When Lee was inaugurated as prime minister in 1959,
              Singapore's per-capita Gross National Income (GNI) was just US$400. The
              landscape was so barren that Singapore had to purchase even tap water
              from its neighboring countries. Singapore's economy, which had depended
              on its colonial ruler England for 80 percent of its support and trade,
              fell into panic after British troops pulled out in the mid-1960s. Trade
              with neighboring Indonesia and Malaysia also dropped sharply. Singapore
              resorted to opening its markets and attempting to boost exports in
              order to survive.<br><br>In just 20 years, Singapore grew to become the
              largest trading hub in Southeast Asia. Its strategy of nurturing
              exporters by cooperating with multinational companies paid off.
              Singapore became a link between Southeast Asia and the world, where
              multinational businesses dropped off products to be exported to
              Southeast Asia, while products manufactured in Southeast Asia converged
              in Singapore to be exported worldwide.</p>
              <p>Singapore is now an export giant
              that ships out products worth double its gross domestic product (GDP).
              Around 5,000 foreign businesses and 220 multinational corporations have
              their Asia-Pacific headquarters in Singapore, whose total land mass is
              slightly larger than Seoul<br><br>Singapore's economy contracted 11.5
              percent during the first quarter of this year, compared to a year ago.
              Exports are also down 20 - 30 percent so far this year. Changi Airport,
              where 63 carriers provide flights to 139 cities around the world, and
              the port of Singapore, which handles cargo headed to 600 ports in 123
              countries, are quieter. According to some projections, Singapore's
              economy could shrink between six to eight percent this year.<br><br>Singapore
              emerged relatively undamaged from the 1997 Asian financial crisis,
              which impacted more severely in Korea and other countries in the
              region. At that time, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Lee boasted that Singapore was still the leader
              of Asian values and the Asian manufacturing model.</strong></span></p>

              <h2>Singapore's Sinking Economy Over-Dependent on Exports</h2>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;"><em>By Chosun Ilbo columnist Lee June</em></span></p>
              <p>On his first trip to the United States in 1967, former Singapore Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew attended a lunch gathering in Chicago hosted by American businessmen. One participant asked Lee how Singapore, once just a small fishing village, became a metropolis that houses two million residents. Lee offered a clear explanation: Singapore manufactured products that were the cheapest in the world, yet were of top quality. He said if Singapore was unable to do that, it would not survive. Word spread throughout corporate America: "Keep your eyes on Singapore."<br><br>When Lee was inaugurated as prime minister in 1959, Singapore's per-capita Gross National Income (GNI) was just US$400. The landscape was so barren that Singapore had to purchase even tap water from its neighboring countries. Singapore's economy, which had depended on its colonial ruler England for 80 percent of its support and trade, fell into panic after British troops pulled out in the mid-1960s. Trade with neighboring Indonesia and Malaysia also dropped sharply. Singapore resorted to opening its markets and attempting to boost exports in order to survive.<br><br>In just 20 years, Singapore grew to become the largest trading hub in Southeast Asia. Its strategy of nurturing exporters by cooperating with multinational companies paid off. Singapore became a link between Southeast Asia and the world, where multinational businesses dropped off products to be exported to Southeast Asia, while products manufactured in Southeast Asia converged in Singapore to be exported worldwide.</p>
              <p>Singapore is now an export giant that ships out products worth double its gross domestic product (GDP). Around 5,000 foreign businesses and 220 multinational corporations have their Asia-Pacific headquarters in Singapore, whose total land mass is slightly larger than Seoul<br><br>Singapore's economy contracted 11.5 percent during the first quarter of this year, compared to a year ago. Exports are also down 20 - 30 percent so far this year. Changi Airport, where 63 carriers provide flights to 139 cities around the world, and the port of Singapore, which handles cargo headed to 600 ports in 123 countries, are quieter. According to some projections, Singapore's economy could shrink between six to eight percent this year.<br><br>Singapore emerged relatively undamaged from the 1997 Asian financial crisis, which impacted more severely in Korea and other countries in the region. At that time, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Lee boasted that Singapore was still the leader of Asian values and the Asian manufacturing model.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>But he probably has little to say this time.</strong></span></p>

              <h1>Singapore Economy in Free Fall Disaster</h1>
              <p><strong>Source: <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/sheldon-filger/singapore-economy-in-free_b_187864.html">The Huffington Post</a>, 18 April 2009</strong></p>
              <p>The city state of Singapore, Venice of the 21st century in terms of
                  its mercantile prowess, has as its national anthem the refrain,
                  “Onward, Singapore.” With the data that has recently emerged on the Q1
                  performance of Singapore’s economy, however, it may be time to change
                  the national anthem to “Backwards, Singapore.” The numbers are that bad.</p>
              <p>This tiny Island republic, sitting at the tip of the Malay
                  Peninsula, covers only 274 square miles, with a population of under
                  five million. Yet through innovation, industriousness and the
                  entrepreneurial environment facilitated by a pro-business if somewhat
                  authoritarian government, Singapore has become a powerhouse within the
                  global economy. Indeed, no less an authority than the World Bank has
                  graded Singapore as the most business friendly economy in the world.
                  However, amidst the tectonic shifts occurring as a result of the Global
                  Economic Crisis, Singapore has discovered that it is an exceptionally
                  vulnerable and fragile geopolitical space.</p>
              <p>Global trade is the engine that drives the Singapore economy. The
                  tiny nation has a vast manufacturing sector, which includes
                  electronics, petrochemicals and engineering. With its small population,
                  Singapore must export the products it manufactures. That export trade
                  has led Singapore to being the fourth largest port in the world. The
                  Global Economic Crisis, however, has sent international trade into a
                  tailspin. All major exporters are hurting badly; Singapore is bleeding.</p>
              <p>In the first quarter of 2009, Singapore’s GDP contracted at a
                  catastrophic rate of 11.5%, much worse than expected. In March,
                  non-petroleum exports declined by 17%, the eleventh consecutive monthly
                  decline. Unemployment is rising while business confidence is
                  plummeting. The once busy port of Singapore is now almost quiescent, a
                  reflection not only of Singapore’s decline but also a window on how
                  severely global trade has been impacted by the worldwide recession.</p>
              <p>As in America and other major economies that have been decimated by
                  the Global Economic Crisis, Singapore has its share of overly
                  optimistic economists, analysts and media pundits who are trying to
                  spin the bad news into glimmers of hope. Some have even suggested that
                  the severity of the country’s Q1 economic statistics are “proof” that
                  the recession has hit bottom and will soon begin to ease.</p>
              <p>However, such
                  appalling macroeconomic data cannot wear a happy face under any
                  circumstance; it is irrefutable proof that the synchronized global
                  recession now shattering the worldwide economy is unprecedented in its
                  depth and reach. I think the elder statesman of Singapore, former Prime
                  Minister Lee Kuan Yew, was more aligned with reality when he recently
                  suggested that it will take at least six years before Singapore
                  recovers from the effects of the Global Economic Crisis.</p>
              <p>Amid all the horrific economic news, Singapore can boast of an
                  advantage denied the deficit-driven economies of Europe and the United
                  States. During the good times, the Island nation prudently set aside
                  substantial foreign exchange reserves. Even with a recent $20 billion
                  stimulus package, Singapore still maintains a reserve fund of $170
                  billion.</p>
              <p>This will provide flexibility for policymakers to address the
                  immediate ramifications of the severe economic contraction now
                  occurring in their country. Nevertheless, there can be no doubt that
                  once prosperous Singapore is facing many years of economic and
                  financial hardship that will severely test the country’s capacity for
                  entrepreneurial innovation and hard work.</p>
              <p>If a nation that has been as prudent and fiscally responsible as
                  Singapore is enduring a free fall meltdown in vital areas of its
                  economy, what about the United States, which is also undergoing a
                  significant economic contraction, but with a massive debt load instead
                  of sizeable reserves?</p>

              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">The situation in Singapore is getting worse. Join the rest of Singapore and stop spending your money!!! Hoard it or save it or invest it but stop spending money, stop buying unless absolutely necessary.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">Defer purchases if you can for the prices will come down given that the economy is in such dire straits.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">It is so bad and getting worse because of government policy mistakes and the lack of economic contingency planning.</p>

              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">The jobs in the IR are going to foreigners. Singaporeans suffer from having casinos at their doorsteps but the benefits are going to foreigners! A double blow for the country.</p>
