              <p>Hi netizens.</p>
              <p>I'm thinking of a new thread to discuss whoever high profile big fuck who will be new PAP MPs in future.</p>
              <p>I read today's Sunday Times about high profile banker who is now Head in Morgan Stanley, Tan Su-Shan.</p>
              <p>I checked her out and she's a member of the PAP Women's Wing and so I think she has potential to be a new PAP MP by the next GE.</p>
              <p>If she ever does, then I think I shall urge the Reform Party to gun her down first as she will be a threat to the opposition.</p>
              <p>This shows that the PAP is still damn fucking elitist.</p>
              <p>Anybody else you think will be potential PAP MP in the next GE?</p>

              </p><p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">In 1989 political power in Singapore was in the hands of a small group of individuals who had been instrumental in Singapore's gaining independence.<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> The leadership core ruled through a second echelon of potential successors, who<span style="color: #ff0000;"> tended to be technocrats, administrators, and managers rather than politicians or power brokers. </span></span></strong></p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">The PAP leaders, convinced that a city-state without natural resources could not afford the luxury of partisan politics,<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> acted after 1965 to <span style="color: #ff0000;">"depoliticize"</span> the power structure.</span></strong> Economic growth and political stability would be maintained instead by the paternal guidance of the PAP.</p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">Politics, as a result, was<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"> only exercised within very narrow limits determined by the PAP.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">Singapore was thus<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> administered by bureaucrats, <span style="color: #ff0000;">not politicians</span></span></strong>, in a meritocracy in which power was gained through skill, performance, and demonstrated loyalty to the leaders and their policies.</p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">At the top of the hierarchy in 1989 were fifteen cabinet ministers, who were concurrently members of Parliament and the CEC, the PAP's highest policy-making body. Among these ministers was an inner core of perhaps five members.</p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">Below this group was a tier of senior civil servants who, in addition to their official duties, filled managerial and supervisory roles as directors of public corporations and statutory bodies.</p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">PAP members of Parliament without cabinet or government portfolios also tended to function at this level of the power hierarchy, providing links between the government and the populace.</p>

              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">Â </p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">Now you understand why politics is dead in Singapore.</p>
