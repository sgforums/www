Now, there's a neutronic politics in the background, a neutronic government form in the future. That's your base, a newer political platform.<br><br>When people see you, there gradually will no longer see a neutral as merely neutral, but see neutrons and its future of neutronic politics.<br><br>Only the neutrons can flood the scenes while incumbent and oppositions are digesting one and another. The main reason is neutrons can be anyone in the society, and opposition member needs to register as a party.<br><br>Neutrons can even go into elections via a party, incumbent or opposition, and push for a neutronic government.<br><br>You cannot always see neutrons eroding margins of oppositions. Because in reality, there will more neutral people who'd identify themselves to be neutral than to either side, when such a new platform is present.<br><br>At the start, only parties are in the lime-light because that's where everywhere else is. Singapore is small, not as in US. Condition is getting ripe for neutrons, which represent a more stable form of politics to appear in the scene.</div>
