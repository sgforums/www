              <p><br>Well, LKY can be humblely arrogant in a sense, he needs to be arrogant inorder to show the success of Singapore, you want him to look lousy, poor and sad?? then the world will look at him and want to cheat him lor.</p>
              <p>If you walk with arrogant, you can sense the respect given to you, but if you act like a beggar or norm...nobody cares and some peoples may kick you out or look down on you. So, start to look arrogant ya..but of course with some substances, if pockets no money, try not to be so arrogant.</p>

              <p><br>Well, LKY can be humblely arrogant in a sense, he needs to be arrogant inorder to show the success of Singapore, you want him to look lousy, poor and sad?? then the world will look at him and want to cheat him lor.</p>
              <p>If you walk with arrogant, you can sense the respect given to you, but if you act like a beggar or norm...nobody cares and some peoples may kick you out or look down on you. So, start to look arrogant ya..but of course with some substances, if pockets no money, try not to be so arrogant.</p>

              <p>But i do know GCT work his way up.If there is some help on him,i would say it is the University Certificate n the fact that he graduate from the English stream school.</p>
              <p>Coz i believe at that time,there are not many University graduates,not to mention graduate from English stream some more.So i believe,even though GCT might not have the experience of various working experience,especially those bottom jobs.But due to his high lvl cert,he must be placed at a high position when entering a company.</p>
              <p>But frankly speaking,it is not so good to start to high position when entering a company.Coz we wont be able to understand how bottom staffs or other department works.</p>

              <p>Vivian was not born with silver spoon, he was born with a stainless steel spoon, later he get scholarship from India Senda and studied humanity at ACS before PAP. At that time, it was pure luck for him, as PAP was looking for a minority young indian to represent the singapore indian in SIngapore, you can't have all chinese and malay in the govt right, so he was recommended by Prof Jeyakumar,  who think that beside Tharman, indian will be getting less in the govt.  LKY took Jeya advice and sent Viavan to UK and US on Prime minister's Scholarship to study political science, sport and arts management. in another words, LKY gives him a silver spoon, otherwise he might be selling indian rojak or prata at serangoon or Geyland serai</p>

              <p><br>Arrogancy is part and parcel of human, it is right to be arrogant once a while, it makes u more confident, to the extreme, is it call how lian, but if you got something to lian, i dun mind, but for those who got nothing to lian and yet want to be how lian, then, that is too extreme</p>

              <p>You needs majority Chinese and minority Malays and Indians to be there, so that it look as racial harmony base on justice and equality, understand!!! that is why some people like Vivan or Yacob are rope in, even tho they are not capable at all.</p>
              <p>And if PRCs are getting more here, next time you may see a PRC MP or Minister inside too. That's call racial harmony at it very best ya</p>
