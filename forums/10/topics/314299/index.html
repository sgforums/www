              <br> <br>For example, causing the economy to lose competitiveness due to
              over-taxing the citizens with profiteering schemes by all the
              government and ministries from HDB to LTA has brought about problems in
              starting businesses so the leaders in order to do something has to
              resort to throwing the door open and invite all the foreign workers to
              come in to compete with citizens for jobs but Minister Ng Eng Hen has
              up to now refused to report the truth about such causes and solutions.
              <br> <br>He knew that his opening of doors to all foreigners to take over
              the local workers' jobs is immoral and selfish but he did not want to
              admit that root and fundamental cause is attributable to wrong

              <p>Will the government of such countries follow our government invite foreigners liberally to come in to take over our people's jobs.

              <p>In the F&amp;B industry there will be upturn and downturn with workers unemployed and retrenched during downturn. In bad time they were retrenched or having their salaries cut etc. In good time must our Minister of Manpower try to tinker with the market forces and bring in more foreigners to lower their wages&gt;</p>
              <p>Moreover many of our workers retrenched in previous recessions are not catching up in their wages due to government openly opening the door for their own selfish short-sighted shaninagans. Some were channeled to be retrained as F&amp;B workers by organizations like Shatec etc. Can we have a more caring minister who being paid millions who will follow up with such retraining and see to it that these trained or retrained F&amp;B workers are allowed to enjoy higher salaries due to market forced turning to their favor when ministers and top civil servants are so well protected by some NWC and policies to ensure their career success with many internal promotional posts to push up their career and other benefits.</p>
              <p>It looks like the citizens are always being made the victim to bear recessions or unemployments with many policies set up aimed at freecing them while all the power that be are doing is to keep pumping propaganda to justify such anti-people policies to give themselves credit and better report cards.</p>
              <p>Just like its profiteering in our public housing and GLCs and many schemes all are calculated to serve its own narrow-minded selfish justifications but when it comes to incompetence like the escape of Mas Selamat the leaders simply use their power to protect their own connections.</p>
              <p>It is such a shameful leadership that they would use their power to cover up and justify wrong doings and people are always being sacrificed for some long or short term nonsense.</p>

              <p>         It is important as u said, the interest of the local need to</p>
              <p>come first. Unfortunately this caused a lot of locals to migrate</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>to other countries n MM Lee said that a lot of foreign professionals used this country as a stepping stone to other countries but he said that Spore still gained. Later in an interview he said Spore is losing about 1000 locals to other countries n this formed the top professional in our countries.</p>
              <p>PM Lee is more afraid that 100 local went to other countries to study n half of them never came back. How come there is so much talk about the brain drain when leader said there is a gain?</p>

              <p>like the stop at 2 birth control campaign, the government did not just encourage you to stop at 2. punitive measures are embedded to punish the strayers. took them a (long) while, and lky at that, to admit the mistakes and reverse its policies.</p>
              <p>the same here with the FT policy, the government will not readily admit to their fault of opening the floodgates to FTs. This inevitably drove the locals out. the problem compounds itself because to fill the gap, you need to then `admit' more FTs. unlike the former birth control error, this is not easily reversible. singaporeans who left will not return readily for many reasons. after our lifetimes, when the unthinkable happens, i.e. foreigners outnumber singaporeans, then our future generation will then question the wisdom of these bunch of government who set in motion the current `foreign talent' policy that drains and bleeds out the true red of singaporeans.</p>
              <p>in the year 2300, whether history will revere the generations of PAP leaders of today as `wise' for this will remain to be seen.</p>

                                      migrate</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>to other countries n MM Lee said that a lot of foreign
                                      professionals used this country as a stepping stone to other
                                      countries but he said that Spore still gained. Later in an
                                      interview he said Spore is losing about 1000 locals to other
                                      countries n this formed the top professional in our countries.</p>
              <p>PM Lee is more afraid that 100 local went to other countries to
                                      study n half of them never came back. How come there is so much
                                      talk about the brain drain when leader said there is a gain?UNQUOTE</p>
              <p>This kind of double-talk on the part of the leaders sadly has been going on for years without any honest or consistent in policies or decisions. On the one hand the leaders talk about "the need to attract  talents" they actually keep driving away our own talents without any care and call them quitters.</p>
              <p>Wen they talk about meritocracy it is such a slogan for them to use the few elites to control the population for political domination.</p>
              <p>When they talk about "no free lunch" or "no one will be left behind" or "HDB flats will be affordable" and one can easily seen there is a lot of bulls or craps in what they are talking.</p>
              <p>While denying citizens of services for which they have paid the heavy direct and indirect taxes, PM Lee in announcing GST increase from 5% to 7% conveniently failed to disclose the huge off-budget windfall land-sale HDB/SLA surpluses of $6.6 billions to squeeze the people further to below their poverty line.</p>
              <p>In fact Singapore could have done very well since the 1970s when we the people have been contributing to such surpluses from our own tax monies but the uncaring leaders are hoarding them for their own purposes like the NKF.</p>
              <p>It is people's own navety that we have been trusting this sort of government without speaking up or listening to the truths for years.</p>

              <p>the unfortunate truth about the situation in singapore is also that when she is doing well, not many will bitch about it, especially if the pie is spread out. however, people are more critical once tough times set in.</p>
              <p>in singapore's formative years post-independence, can you fault the commoners if singapore is entrusted to these group of PAP pioneers to make something out for herself? you have to acknowledge that when the pioneer PAP leaders set forth its housing, defence, economic and social policies, almost from stratch, it is no small feat.</p>

              <p>20 years ago, I believe many people have given credit to MM :ee's so-called benevolent dictatorship or authoritarian rule. People did understand the need for leadership and have supported his party strongly to prevent unnecessary political infighting among parties struggling for power so we believe in this type of benevolent dictatorship or authoritarian rule for at least it will bring us progress and prosperity and we traded off some of our personal liberties.</p>
              <p>20 years later we saw him as interested only in pursuing his self-glory and not really keen or capable to combat rising costs or solving citizens' problems or bringing about a more competitive restructuring of the economy through practical knowledge application or technology-driven value-adding economy.</p>
              <p>People are always at fault or to be blamed for any shortcomings of the government or the leaders..</p>
              <p>Every problem is being pushed to the people including the escape of Mas Selamat which was also twisted to make it look like complacency of the people.</p>
              <p>Under such circumstances it is not surprising that citizens have come to the conclusion that our million-dollar ministers are only yes-men who are there only to benefit from such an authoritarian rule whose survival is dependent on how well they serve the perceived interests of hidden agenda of the power that be.</p>
