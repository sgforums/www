              <p>i tink he probably felt he is good and yet even he is good, he felt that better treatment was going to those foreign 2nd rate talents who aint even better than him. So he probably questions "why are ppl lousier than me getting better stuffs"</p>

              <p>you are really sgdiehard!! LOL!! so instead of letting local
              arrogant idiots pick and choose, we let foreigners come in and pick
              and choose + get things free... end result is that arrogant or not,
              singaporeans still lost the chance. I think thats his gist of the
              article. A comparison b/w locals and foreigners. Not local and

              <p>In the middle of an interview for an academic scholarship? That's a big liability.</p>
              <p>At the very least it gives the impression that you're a person who cannot remember simple basic facts about himself. </p>
              <p>At the very worst it makes the interviewer think that your certs might have been falsified.</p>

              <p>they are many local talents there who are waiting for financial

              <p>you are really sgdiehard!! LOL!! so instead of letting local
              arrogant idiots pick and choose, we let foreigners come in and pick
              and choose + get things free... end result is that arrogant or not,
              singaporeans still lost the chance. I think thats his gist of the
              article. A comparison b/w locals and foreigners. Not local and
              local.</p>

              it just his assumption that since he didn't get it, it must have gone to a foreigner, was there no other locals?</p>
              <p>Only those who need 
              the scholarship and agree with the terms and conditions set out by the 
              sponsoring organizations need apply, even if you are getting the money 
              from your mammy and daddy, you must have their agreement. If you apply and reject when offered, you are wasting time
               and efforts of the other party, and deprived the others of the 
              opportunities! nothing to do with foreigners or locals.</p>
              <p>Secondly, 
              applicants who are arrogant and shows signs of flaw characters should be
               rejected straight away!! it doesn't matter locals or foreigners, and it doesn't mean if we don't give it to the 
              foreigners we should give it to you!!</p>
