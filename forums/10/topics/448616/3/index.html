              <p>I took an additional 20 Modular Credits at NUS over rquirements and still got the first class.

              <p>1) Are you learning and studying purely for the grades or are you learning and studying for interest and self-improvement?  Interest and personal development comes first for me. Grades just magically appear by itself after that. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>
