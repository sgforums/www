              <p>I chanced upon this article on <a href="http://www.tremeritus.com/2011/07/18/nus-denies-scholarship-to-top-local-talent/">TR Emeriteus</a>.</p>
              <p>&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;</p>
              <p>The recent flood of reports about discrimination against local-born 
              Singaporeans in our tertiary institutes comes as no surprise to me. 
              Local-born Singaporeans are being discriminated at every level from 
              students, to postdoctoral researchers and even to the teaching staff and
               faculty. Let me add on to this repertoire of reports and include my own
               personal experience of how a top local talent was denied scholarship 
              and who was replaced with second-rate foreign students.</p>
              <p>         Claiming oneself to be a Top Local Talent may be come across
               as more than arrogant, but I define myself as such in lieu of the 
              sliding standards of the “foreign talent” students in the recent decade.
               In the 1990s when I was growing up, the foreign students who competed 
              with local Singaporeans deserved the term “foreign talent”.  They 
              provided a good challenge to keep us on our toes, and their numbers were
               limited so that only the good ones made it to Singapore. The same 
              cannot be said for the situation today, in the post-2000s era, where a 
              large proportion of foreign students imported into NUS and NTU are 
              sub-standard and mediocre. It is bad enough that our local universities 
              are being flooded with these sub-standard applicants, but to add salt to
               the wound, our local universities are complicit in promoting the PAP’s 
              agenda of foreigners first and giving out free scholarships like toilet 
              paper. I am a victim of this scheme.</p>
              <p>         As a self-proclaimed local talent, I graduated from one of 
              the upper-tier Junior Colleges (but nevertheless a non-elite 
              institution) in Singapore, was valedictorian for my cohort, and scored 7
               distinctions in the A-levels if memory serves correctly. My portfolio 
              was competitive enough that I was offered a Public Service Commission 
              (PSC) scholarship that only a handful (like a dozen) is offered every 
              year. However, after much contemplation I rejected their offer because 
              my conscience and moral standards would not allow me to serve the PAP 
              government. Instead, I decided to apply for the bond-free NUS 
              scholarship. It should have been non-issue. Despite my impressive 
              portfolio, I was not even offered the “lowest tier” NUS scholarship, 
              which is curious because friends who were just 2 years more senior than 
              me easily got offers despite having a less competitive portfolio. 
              Interestingly, the year when I was admitted to NUS was also around the 
              period when the PAP launched their S-Pass system, opening the gate for 
              entry-level skilled foreign workers into the country, thus competing 
              away entry level jobs from Singaporeans and depressing wages, which is 
              the situation we have today. The timing of this “joint operation” to 
              screw local-born Singaporeans could not have been more coordinated. 
              Midway through my undergraduate studies, I learnt that NUS expanded 
              their scholarship system and now offers 5 scholarships of varying 
              monetary value (as opposed to 2 when I first applied), undoubtedly 
              throwing more free money to more second-rate foreign students.</p>
              <p>         Thanks for the foreigners-first policy of the FAP (oops I 
              mean PAP), and their collaborators in our tertiary institutions like 
              NUS, which despite all their claims as a private institution are still 
              under the influence from MOE, local talents like myself are being 
              marginalized in lieu of second-rate foreign students. As a marginalized 
              local talent I went on with my education and self-funded using my 
              parent’s CPF loan. Am I just a sore loser complaining? I will list out 
              some of my achievements and let them speak for themselves.</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Graduated with First-Class Honors (CAP 4.8 / 5.0), note that only CAP 4.5 is required to first-class honors classification</li>
              <li>Consecutive Dean’s List placement for every eligible semester</li>
              <li>Completed University Scholars Program (USP) and received all 
              eligible awards inclusive of – USP Honors Roll, USP Senior Honors Roll 
              and President’s Honour Roll (previously Vice-Chancellor’s List)</li>
              <li>NUS Student Achievement Award for Community Service</li>
              <li>Book Prize for Being Top Student in the Department (for Year 2)</li>
              </ul>
              <p>What did I get for all this accomplishment? About $25,000 worth of 
              student loans to repay and $25,000 of living expenses spent over the 4 
              years of my undergraduate studies. Meanwhile, underachieving and 
              second-rate foreign students are having a “free pass” in NUS. Perhaps 
              NUS should come clean and clarify as to the percentage of their foreign 
              students on scholarship who can even match the achievements of 
              non-scholarship Singapore-born students like myself.</p>
              <p>         As a marginalized local talent, I am so disgusted with NUS 
              that I did not even bother to attend Commencement, as means of personal 
              protest against the institution. If I had any regrets in life, deciding 
              to study at NUS is probably on the top of that list. To all young 
              promising Singaporeans out there, I would cross out our local 
              universities if I were you.</p>

              <p>It is obvious that the writer was a victim of a very vindictive 
              government. He was probably headhunted and given the PSC scholarship 
              based on his excellent academic results. His rejection of the 
              scholarship was considered a snub by the authorities. He was punished 
              when his application for bond-free NUS scholarship was rejected. In 
              short, he was fixed.</p>
              <p>PS:  There are probably more horror stories of such victimization. It remains only to be revealed.</p>

              <p>scary? indeed, to think that we have such arrogant idiot, self proclaiming "top talent" among Singaporean.</p>
              <p>Scholarships are offered by government, commerical organizations and academic institutions such as NUS. Few people want the PSC scholarships if you don't want to be a civil servant, (this is not about serving the PAP), most top scorers won't even apply for it. That is probably why he was offered. Those who don't want to join the industries won't apply for the scholarships offered by commerical and industrial organizations   Many would apply for the NUS scholarship which is bond free!!! so the competition is very very keen there. Who says since he is given the PSC scholarship, he would automatically qualified for the NUS scholarship. the competitions are different!!!</p>
              <p>they are many local talents there who are waiting for financial support 
              to complete their university education, why should we let the few arrogant idiots

              <p style="margin-bottom: 10px; border-image: initial; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-size: 1.2em; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; line-height: 1.3em; color: #333333; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: -webkit-auto; border: 0px initial initial;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">They assimilated with both the local Malays and the colonising British, whom they especially admired.</span></strong> The babas developed their own culture, cuisine and language - Malay liberally sprinkled with Hokkien.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 10px; border-image: initial; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-size: 1.2em; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; line-height: 1.3em; color: #333333; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: -webkit-auto; border: 0px initial initial;">The sinkeh were the traders, the coolies and the shophouse owners. The babas became the lawyers, the civil servants and the politicians; they attended the local English-language schools run in the tradition of the UK's public schools, and Oxford and Cambridge.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 10px; border-image: initial; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-size: 1.2em; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; line-height: 1.3em; color: #333333; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: -webkit-auto; border: 0px initial initial;">If the sinkeh received an overseas education at all, it was in Nanking or another university in China.</p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 10px; border-image: initial; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-size: 1.2em; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; line-height: 1.3em; color: #333333; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: -webkit-auto; border: 0px initial initial;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> In effect, a baba minority captured sinkeh Singapore, and that minority's attitudes were more those of Victorian England than China.</span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 10px; border-image: initial; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-size: 1.2em; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; line-height: 1.3em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: -webkit-auto; border: 0px initial initial;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">It was the babas who were the framers of Singapore's rules and institutions.</span></span></strong><span style="color: #333333;"> Many of Singapore's most prominent Chinese have had baba backgrounds. Lee Kuan Yew, who became prime minister of Singapore aged just 35, is the most obvious example. </span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 10px; border-image: initial; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-size: 1.2em; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; line-height: 1.3em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: -webkit-auto; border: 0px initial initial;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">He claims a Hakka heritage, although his upbringing was that of a baba: at home, he spoke English with his parents and baba Malay to his grandparents. "Mandarin was totally alien to me and unconnected with my life," Lee said of his childhood.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 10px; border-image: initial; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-size: 1.2em; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; line-height: 1.3em; color: #333333; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: -webkit-auto; border: 0px initial initial;">For Lee, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Chineseness was an acquired skill and later a political necessity. </span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 10px; border-image: initial; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-size: 1.2em; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; line-height: 1.3em; color: #333333; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: -webkit-auto; border: 0px initial initial;">He was not brought up as a Chinese with a focus on China,<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> but as a baba who looked to England.</span></strong> He followed the conventional career path of a baba and went to London to study law.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 10px; border-image: initial; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-size: 1.2em; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; line-height: 1.3em; color: #333333; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: -webkit-auto; border: 0px initial initial;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">And so Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore became Harry Lee of Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge.</span></strong></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>If you understand the fact that Harry Lee Kuan Yew is not a chinese but an anglophile hakka peranakan baba, you will have a richer and clearer understanding of Singapore politics, development and history.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Singapore history and politics cannot be properly understood without knowing the fact that Harry Lee Kuan Yew is hakka peranakan baba. I think that is completely true.</p>

              <p>explain what?</p>
              <p>when you apply for PSC scholarship, you should know you would be serving as a civil servant when you graduate, if you graduate. you never read the conditions huhhh??? why apply in the first place??</p>
              <p>If you become a civil servant, will you serve the people under the WP constituencies?? or you think you would be serving only the PAP?</p>

              <p>As I was speaking to my mom just moments ago over breakfast, as I take a break from all my work, many of these people who complain are nothing more than whiners.</p>
              <p>Firstly, they lost out deservedly. For those who claim these foreigners as second-rate, its because the person is 2nd-rate also! Birds of the same flock bunch together. Having been in discussions with the "true talents" at the moment, I found myself benefiting tremendously. Of course I'm no talent myself, but that's not gonna stop me from competing with people who invariably get twice the score I get at every test. I dont mind funding these people's education if I get to learn from them. Period.</p>
              <p>Secondly, chances are, if you really have such good results as claimed, and yet you are denied scholarships, I have reasons to believe that the govt has decided that this guy is just a prick. True. There are scholars who are like that, both foreign AND local. But it means that this guy can't even present himself properly at interviews. I know of many people who benefited from scholarship programmes, and also of people who tried to apply to MOE (dumping ground) with a CAP of 4.7 to be a teacher...and were rejected repeatedly. The said people have got character issues.</p>
              <p>In short, a post that reeks of a loser.</p>
              <p>Anyway what is wrong with working with the government? If I can get myself to MAS, EDB, MOF, GIC, MTI, I would be mighty chuffed. </p>
              <p>Oh wait, he can't. That's why. Heck, he can't even remember his A level score.</p>

Few people want the PSC scholarships if you don't want to be a civil servant, (this is not about serving the PAP), most top scorers won't even apply for it. That is probably why he was offered. Those who don't want to join the industries won't apply for the scholarships offered by commerical and industrial organizations   Many would apply for the NUS scholarship which is bond free!!! so the competition is very very keen there. Who says since he is given the PSC scholarship, he would automatically qualified for the NUS scholarship. the competitions are different!!!</p>
              <p>they are many local talents there who are waiting for financial support to complete their university education, why should we let the few arrogant idiots to pick and choose while others are deprived of such opportunities?</p>
              <p>Blame anybody he wants, he would be in for more trouble for he still doesn't know what hits him.</p>
              <p>Lets hope that he wait up someday realizing that if he were "top" then there is no "bottom".</p>

              <p>you are really sgdiehard!! LOL!! so instead of letting local arrogant idiots pick and choose, we let foreigners come in and pick and choose + get things free... end result is that arrogant or not, singaporeans still lost the chance. I think thats his gist of the article. A comparison b/w locals and foreigners. Not local and local.</p>

              <p>My point is that, if you can't show that you can match these people, getting a CAP 4.8 makes you an underachiever then.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
