              <p>I had an interesting discussion with some friends the other day.</p>
              <p>We were estimating the true wealth of Singapore. Some of us were wondering if Temasek was just the tip of the iceberg.</p>
              <p>After all, we have GIC, which according to our govt, holds a larger base of funds with a mroe conservative outlook.</p>
              <p>I thought we also have foreign exchange reserves held by MAS, which during my school days 14 years ago, was US$58 billion.</p>
              <p>How about our national reserves that were locked away? Do that include GIC and Temasek funds?</p>
              <p>We were estimating our wealth, and I was thinking if we could be close to $1trillion. Some of my friends believe the figure would be about $500 billion.</p>

              <p>This is not the time to come and say, '' we should not have invested in ______ ''. Temasek/GIC made investments, took risks, and have been proven wrong. Yes, we made losses of $58B (Temasek) but who's to say that these investments will not turn around and cut their losses one day? </p>
              <p>Nobody can perfectly time the market. Not even a double first class honours grad from Stanford. Even Berkshire Hathaway is suffering losses now. But that is not the issue I am contending.</p>
              <p>I am not as unhappy about our SWFs making a timing mistake.The future is uncertain and I am sure they have their reasons for investing into Financials at that point in time. I am however, displeased with the fact that we are being misled (deliberately in my opinion) by comparing ourselves with funds like the MSCI World Index, which to my knowledge is an ALL EQUITY portfolio. To say that we outperformed an all equity index and gloat about it is definitely not professional, and definitely seems like just another way of justifying that eltism works and higher salaries should be commanded for these talents.</p>
              <p>Temasek/GIC owns many GLCs, and these GLCs contribute to the mean return of Temasek's portfolio by way of retained earnings and dividend income. Temasek/GIC also have their fair share of fixed income investments. How can we compare their returns/losses to an all equity portfolio? Take Citigroup for example, we are currently NOT holding any equity in Citi; Temasek took out a convertible bond arrangement with the Bank, although it is one of mandatory conversion (Dec 2010).</p>
              <p>One other grouse, why say things like '' we have a long term view in _______'' ? These comments are aimed at confusing the layman who has no idea that share prices do not reflect an entire story when it comes to investments like these because securities can be potentially dilutive, especially the case for Financials at this point in time. For example, UBS has taken quite a few writedowns and have had some injection in capital. These capital injections DILUTE the current shareholdings of any investor but this is not something that everybody knows. All we know is that the share price has fallen by X% and we think that if it recovers to $Y, then we potentially have not made any losses. By the end of this crisis, how much have our shareholdings in the Financials we have invested in been diluted by?</p>
              <p>As a taxpayer and citizen of this country, it is natural for me to be upset when I see that my money has slipped out of my country and gone into some banker's pay packet. But ultimately, what I am concerned about is the lack of transparency and accountability that our 2 famed SWFs are using as a veil to shroud their losses.</p>

              <p>The damage has been done, what we can do is to prevent further damage from happening. we already lost $X (how much is X i dunno), and it doesnt make sense to pull out of these investments right now.</p>
              <p>I'm thinking if there were more transparency going around perhaps we citizens (the only people who truly care about our country) might be able to work out ourselves the thought process behind their actions.</p>
              <p>but granted la, it won't help much. but it might help us see better who would be a better party to vote for in the next elections..</p>
