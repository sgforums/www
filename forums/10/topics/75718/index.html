In the light of recent events, it is my personal opinion that this topic is much needed satrical relief in relation this very unique individual what can't seem to get enough of the soapbox.<br><br>And judging from the positive response so far, it appears that the general populace found this to be so. Of course, if you are still not happy, you could always appeal that this thread be closed, I have no trouble with that at all, unlike a certain flipped-flopped individual who considers taking kicks to the groin in a fight as victory.</div>

And of course, the way he responds to his opponents can be very funny in the sheer inappropriateness of the logic he applies in respond to his opponent's points, which at times made me read his points twice as I could not believe that anybody could actually post that and be serious, it had to be a joke. But it wasn't, and that made it funnier.<br><br>I remember his duels with adobe, in which he always got badly tossed about with his very own stats, but still manage to limp on somehow and carry on. Can't say much for skill and wit, but full marks for persistence. Yes, those were good days...<br><br>Panja_V's style is unique though, the persistence and flipped-flopped logic (abbet somewhat less developed) of SIS, with his own brand of emotional immaturity and blatant broadcasting of how the world apparently revolves around him, and the rest who oppose him are just PAP.<br><br>Sigh, I wonder if he's suspects that I'm the guy who is causing him his internet log on problems which he thinks is a PAP conspiracy, but if I told him I have to kill him.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>
