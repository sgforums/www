With the admission of misdeeds by their past leaders and the severance of Nazism, Germany has rejuvenated into the industrial powerhouse of Europe.<br><br>Angela Merkel is by far, a more conservative chancellor than Gerhard SchrÃ¶der, and less willing to compromise on the sharing of technologies between industrial powers, particularly China, during her visit to Beijing and talks concerning Mag-rev technology. Clearly, she is a proud German, as are most Germans, especially those generations after the second World war.<br><br>The japanese, unfortunately prefer to gloss over their past atrocities, due largely to a 'face' issue, and pride over their imperial past. However, one is perfectly within their rights to visit war shines to honour their home guard and brave civil defence personnel, who led a futile defence of Japanese cities largely against the firestorm bombings by Boeing B-29s of the USAAF. Their inadequate wooden huts of the times simply incenerated under the intense heat and delayed fuse charges by devious American bomb-makers, designed deliberately to overwhelm already helpless fire-fighters with after-explosions.<br><br>The fact that they refuse, in their own words, to apologize for mistakes made by their ancestors, is an eternal shame on their wounded pride, a scar they must bear for future generations, until a brave leader, unhinged and unhindered by Japanese custom and cultural taboos, is willing to take the leap to answer, unconditionally, their historical crimes.<br><br>Whether we see it in our lifetime remains to be seen.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I brought up Angela Merkel simply as a contrast between the two aggressor nations of WWII. NO WAY would any German leader bow to Hitler and his henchmen.<br><br>I hardly think Koizumi et al would bow in Yasukuni shrine just to honour the brave civil defence personnel during the firestorm raids by the B29s. Koizumi's party had vetoed the proposal to separate the war criminals from the "more innocent" Japanese who died during the Pacific War. That tells you a lot.<br><br>To Shutter Bug, I do not think using Japanese goods is totally incompatible to criticism of their behaviour, especially viz a viz WWII. Mildly contradictory perhaps, but that is being pragmatic. Still, I know of many old folks who would avoid buying Japanese goods if they can help it.</div>

Period.<br><br>Japan's stubborn refusal to accept unconditional surrender sparked off the Hiroshima Bomb. Their subesquent hesitation to negotiate after the inital drop sealed Nagasaki's fate.<br><br>Not that it would have mattered anyway. In the end, Emperor Hirohito arrogantly still 'refused' to willingly surrender, instead in a radio broadcast to his people to accept the terms, he claimed that the Japanese people had no other option because the aggressors had developed a weapon so powerful and so vile that to resist would have not only meant the extinction of the Japanese, but all life on earth.<br><br>Perhaps one can begin to understand the 'cursed' pride of the Japanese and how they have somehow become wholely enslaved by it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>More lives could have been saved if the Potsdam Declaration had been worded properly.  From a diplomatic perspective, the Allies knew that retaining the Emperor's power was to be either the key or the stumbling point to Japan's acceptance of the conditions set forth, yet they left it out.<br><br>Was the ommission accidental?  Considering the fact that Hirohito was left in place after the surrender, it seems very unlikely that such an crucial angle to the surrender could have been left out.<br><br>Bottom line is that there were options other than dropping the bomb.  Considering that the uneasy alliance between the West and Russia was about to come to an end, it is entirely possible that the bombs were not only dropped to end the war but to send a warning to Stalin not to try anything after the surrender.</div>

All the territories affected were colonial extensions except for China which was slowly carved up by the European and Japanese powers.<br><br>It is not surprising that the colonial thinking extended with the drafting of the <a href="http://www.ndl.go.jp/constitution/e/etc/c06.html" rel="nofollow"><span style="font-style: italic;">Potsdam Declaration</span></a> as a demand on the Japanese War Government to surrender - with racist overtones.<br><br>Following the defeat of Adolf Hitler, the <a href="http://www.trumanlibrary.org/teacher/potsdam.htm" rel="nofollow"><span style="font-style: italic;">Potsdam Conference</span></a> was called as a result of the realisation by the US Political Leadership that after all their efforts to liberate Europe, the chances</span><span style="color: indigo;"> <blockquote>"...... was that France would go Communistic, so would Germany, Italy and the Scandinavians, and there was grave doubt about England staying sane. "<br><br>"The Potsdam Conference, a meeting of the victorious leaders of the Allies in Europe, attempted to confront the <span style="font-style: italic;">delicate balance of power</span> of the opposing governmental structures, democracy and communism. Held in an unbombed suburb of Berlin, it commenced July 17 lasting to August 2.<br><br>Soviet Premier Joseph Stalin, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, and President Truman began the conference for their respective countries.<br><br>On the agenda was the partitioning of the postwar world and resolving the problems of the war in the Far East. This included hammering out the details regarding the division of Germany; the movement of populations from Czechoslovakia, Austria, and Italy; the creation of a Council of Foreign Ministers to administer the agreed upon zones of occupation; <strong><span style="font-style: italic;">and issuing a proclamation demanding unconditional surrender from the Japanese government</span></strong>. Truman, despite his relative inexperience in dealing with foreign diplomats, was holding a trump card that would give him confidence in making demands of the other leaders. . .the atomic bomb. The most powerful and destructive armament to date, the atomic bomb was solely in the hands of the United States government." </blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">On the Japanese side, there was ongoing internal debate between the War Cabinet and the Pacifist Members of Government - some of whom were advisors to the Japanese Emperor - resulting in recorded attempts at <a href="http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/hando/hando.htm" rel="nofollow"><span style="font-style: italic;">clandestine negotiations in Switzerland</span></a> between the US O.S.S and Japanese negotiators being made through the Russian Government, who had maintained a Treaty of Neutrality and Non-Aggression with Japan throughout WW-2.<br><br>Unfortunately, Stalin had his own political ambitions and agenda, and did not convey the early acceptance of the Japanese Emperor's acceptance to a negotiated surrender, and resulted in the <strong>first A-Bomb falling on Hiroshima of 6 August 1945</strong>.<br><br>On 9 August 1945. Russia broke its long held Treaty of Non-Aggression and declared war on Japan during the closing moments of WW-2, after the first A-Bomb was dropped on Hiroshima.<br><br>Co-incidentally, <strong>the second atomic bombing with an H-Bomb was dropped on Nagasaki on 9 August 1945</strong>.<br><br>The US Government had justified the use of the A-Bomb on a large civilian population center with a significant military presence so as to show the destructive impact to the Japanese War Government, and force it to accept an unconditional surrender, and at the same time save the lives of countless US soldiers in an invasion of Japan - with estimates of a million casualties.<br><br>Unfortunately, in the aftermath of the Japanese capitulation with the acceptance of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potsdam_Declaration" rel="nofollow"><span style="font-style: italic;">Potsdam Declaration</span></a>, <a href="http://www.wpunj.edu/newpol/issue21/shalom21.htm" rel="nofollow"><span style="font-style: italic;">the justification of the use of the A-Bomb and the suppression of the truth of the war crimes</span></a> from both the warring sides had helped in the perpetuation of the Japanese attitude to this day.<br><br>Out of self-interests, the US government compromised its moral position.</span><br><blockquote><br><span style="color: indigo;">"Truth-telling is important. The war-crimes trials following the Pacific War, however, departed from the truth in significant respects: U.S. officials suppressed evidence relating to the emperor's war guilt, to Japanese biological warfare (so that the U.S. military could gain access to Japanese experimental data), and to the war crimes of the Allies. Much data on Japanese atrocities was produced, but its impact on the Japanese public was surely lessened by the fact that the trials represented victors' justice. A few major Japanese war criminals were executed, but many of the guilty were soon back in control. " </span></blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">The manner in which Japanese surrender was accepted is probably the cause of the current attitudes of the Japanese Officials and Society towards their obligation to the International Community in giving a sincere apology, renouncing of its War Criminals, and to the sensitive subject of <a href="http://www.k2.dion.ne.jp/~rur55/E/epage3.htm" rel="nofollow"><span style="font-style: italic;">Post-war Compensation</span></a>.<br><br>With the pre-war structure of the Japanese societal elites - (including the Emperor) - remaining largely in place, it is not surprising that <a href="http://www.zmag.org/Zmag/articles/july95shalom.htm" rel="nofollow">even some Class A War Criminals</a> - and others who had supported the war efforts - continue in influential governmental positions to mould and guide the present day Japanese policies and attitudes.</span><br><br></span></div>

What are your thoughts?<br><br>It is terrible about all the innocent children slaughtered, being a father of two baby boys, I should know. But cannot say I feel much pity for the adults. Their fathers, sons, brothers and husbands have left corpses, raped women and destroyed buildings in their wake all over Asia.<br><br>And up to this day, their prime minister still pays his respects to the war criminals at their war shrine! Can you imagine if the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, pays her respects to Hitler, Himmler or Goebbels? They only worship the Americans because they were soundly trounced by them. Their history books deny their heinous acts, they kill whales for "research"(how they say this without breaking out into giggles is just beyond me) and they are the most racist nation in the world.<br><br>To the Japanese, might is right.</div></blockquote>Well, go figure their culture. They claimed to be more cultured than the Chinese and that Korea was heavily influenced by them in terms of culture.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ahhh, if you want to go there, why don't you tell the truth and, in particular, the whole truth?

While the US could have avoided using the Bomb, should we be too sorry about their civilians being deep-fat-fried after what they did to other civilian populations?  I think not.  If anything, they got off easy by being turned instantaneously into crispy critters instead of being peeled like bananas over periods of hours until they bled to death.<br><br>What are their cultural taboos compared to the horrors they perpetrated on the countries they conquered?  If natural justice were to be applied here, they ought to be nuked until they come to their senses.  Hell, gutting a Nip with a straight razor ought to become a national sport until they decide to behave decently and face their crimes.</div>

The anniversary is just a poor excuse to bring up this issue again.<br><br>The Japanese did not deny what they did was wrong. They have issued countless statements of apology admitting their wrongdoing. And contrary to popular perception, debate in Japan about what happened is not restricted or regulated. Different political parties would take on a different stance.

What's your point?<br><br>The facts are out there. Anyone can find out what really happened. School textbooks are not the only source of knowledge. The problem is in the interpretation. You want the facts to be intrepreted firmly as "Your grandfathers are mongrels." The problem is alot of people do not think any less of the people who commited these atrocities even if they knew the truth. They'll just say atrocities happen in every war, that the violence in the war made them irrational and inhumane.<br><br></div>
