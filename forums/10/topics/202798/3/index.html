How is first saying that yeah, "we caused a lot of pain and suffering, but we suffered too" not dodging the issue? Oh by the way, the west forced us down the path of war, because we really wanted an empire but the westerners refused to let us have it.<br><br>And if they really did not deny their part in the atrocities, what is the point if they do not sincerely apologise?</div>
