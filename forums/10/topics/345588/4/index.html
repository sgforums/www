              <p>As matters stand, Singaporeans will surely be interested to know what are the skeletons that LKY and his government have been hiding over the past 40 odd years that motivate them to monopolising political power at all costs.</p>
              <p>Only you will pretend to hide behind the bankrupt idea of anarchy - hide behind the worn out excuse of exposing security to the world - simply to prevent the truth from being told.</p>
              <p>Do you have anything original from your skewed brains, or are you trained as a parrot to repeat what has been taught to say without any thoughts ?</p>
              <p>Are you seriously interested in the truth or simply paying lip service to this thought while finding ways to protect LKY and his government ?</p>
              <p>Are you not interested to know how much of our Reserves have been mismanaged and lost under the watch of LKY and his appointees, or are you simply to afraid of people being disgusted with you and those that you worshipped as idols ?</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Marcos, president of Philipines, during his reign, philipinos enjoyed high income and the nation have GDP comparable to double digits, no philipine maids need to work outside of their country, and philipine become one of the top asia tourist spot. Then people start get jealous of him, dig out his weakness and now you see philipine, one of the poorest country in the world. So, if Marcos is around, guess philipine will be one powerful economy nation.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Next, Suharto, Indonesia economy and per capital enjoyed one of the best era under suharto reign, no terrorist, less crimes and indonesia was a haven place to do business and visit. And again people get jealous of him, dig up his bad deeds and all nonsense, he got kicked out and now you see indonesia situation, still own the IMF hell lots of money, crime rates top the chart, terrorist roam like home land.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Then you look at the recent Thaksin era, 1998 to 2005/6, thailand overturned it financial crisis and become one of the top economy powerhouse under him, baht was strong and stable, tourism was at it peak, crime rate and sex industry went down, people are living much better with work, peace and harmony, then again, someone get jealous and start to stir up the situation, now you look at thailand,,..day after day of street protest, closure of airport, poor economy, tourism drop, etc etc..more pros coming up again.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As far as i gather, if LKY is to topple, singapore may share the same fate as these countries, chaos will take over and my house may be on fire and i may end up being a maid or pros on the street. So, please hor, let PAP and LKY do their business, i understand that they may take more than us,  shortchanged us, but i rather get short changed than to live in poor hut kampong looking for job that never come.</p>

              <p> Dear 'mei mei' - if you want to get involve in politics, you got to go beyond the basics learnt in political history.</p>
              <p>Who wrote the history books that you have learnt your basic politics from ?</p>
              <p>Can you depend on just the basics alone, or would you not be prepared to go further and discover the political history of the periods that interest you most ?</p>

              <p>Did the Filippinos get jealous of President Ferdinand Marcos ?</p>
              <p>Was there anything to be "jealous" about other than the corrupt display of wealth by Ferdinand Marcos and his family despite the miserable wages paid to the Philippine President ?</p>
              <p>His weakness was his greed for power and the money that he can squeeze by dispensing his patronage on those who will ingratiate themselves on him - it was a "<em>quid pro quo</em>" kind of thing amongst the elites at the expense of the mass population.</p>
              <p>Who do you think benefitted most during his iron fisted control, which got tougher as the situation in the country became worst ?</p>
              <p>How did the Philippines deteriorate from the Lighthouse of Asia into the poorest Asian tin shack in <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,913829,00.html?promoid=googlep">less then 10 years, </a>and continue to struggle to this day despite 30 years after Marcos had been deposed ?</p>
              <p>Could the Philippines continue to prosper under Marcos, even as he turned the economy around during the first half of his 10 year term; and then ruled the Philippines with the iron hand of an Emperor - by throwing thousands of political opponents into jails - and with the last 5 years seeing economic hardship and political corruption becoming an artform that increased the social disparity of the Filippinos ?</p>
              <p>Was it not the audacious and blatant act of arrogance on the part of President Ferdinand Marcos - to arrange for his closest henchmen to assassinate his political opponent Benigno 'Ninoy' Aquino - in full view of TV cameras - as Aquino stepped down a flight of stairs from his aircraft ?</p>
              <p>Was it not this final act of dictatorial arrogance in assassinating a popular politician that finally got the Filippinos and the military to overthrow Marcos ?</p>
              <p>Was it jealousy or the sudden awakening of the politically conciousness of a mature nation that their future cannot depend on the acts of one arrogant man alone ?</p>
              <p>Read the following if you are serious about politics, and do not satisfy yourself with the mere basics of political history from secondary school days. </p>

              <p> If Suharto had been so successful - as you had claimed, why did the Indonesian financial system collapsed so suddenly like "<em>a house made from cardboards</em>" ?</p>
              <p>If what you said about Indonesian prosperity is true, why was its foundation so shallow when the financial crisis that began in Thailand could finds the next target in Indonesia ?</p>
              <p>Was it not a fact that it was discovered later that Indonesia had the same wrong economic fundamentals as had existed in Thailand - and with both suffering immediate loss in public confidence to their financial systems and their economies ?</p>
              <p>Was it not a fact that after the death of his wife, Suharto could not control the excesses of his children - that allowed their greed to surface in public with their glaring display of vulgar wealth in a country that has continuously had a wide social gulf between the haves and have-nots ?</p>
              <p>Crime has always been rampant in Indonesia since the days of Sukarno - the first President of Indonesia - except that perhaps you were too young to have any interest.</p>
              <p>The Chinese population in Indonesia had always been the target of economic strife, which so very often sparked into racial riots that spiral into rapes, murders, lootings, and arson.</p>
              <p>Suharto's downfall was practically engineered by his own ambitious Son-in-Law, who tried to repeat the scenario that brought Suharto into political power.</p>
              <p>Are you aware that <a rel="nofollow" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D06E2D6163CF936A1575BC0A96E958260">General Prabowo could be implicated in other acts of brutality that include instigating the riots, arson and rape in May 1998 that precipitated President Suharto’s downfall </a>?</p>
              <p>Was it jealousy that led to Suharto's downfall and the continued economic and social malaise that trapped Indonesia over the last ten over years ? </p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>In the first place, did Thaksin era began in 1998 ?</p>
              <p>Was he not elected as Prime Minister only in 2001 - in what was considered to be the most open and corruption free election in Thailand's history ?</p>
              <p>Secondly, if Thailand was an economic powerhouse, why did its financial system collapsed so suddenly and was simply not resillient enough to withstand an attack on its currency ?</p>
              <p>With its resources in abundance and more then Singapore's - why was this supposed economic powerhouse paralysed and unable to defend its financial system ?</p>
              <p>Did you find out the causes of the "jealousy" that led to the mass turnout against a popular Thaksin ?</p>
              <p>Was it not a fact that having sold his Shin Corp to Temasek Holdings, Thaksin did not pay a single cent of tax from the $3 Billion sale of Shin Corp to Temasek, and with the sale contravening every single Thai law against foreign majority ownership in Thai public listed companies ?</p>
              <p>In addtion to the non-payment of tax, the manouvres performed by Thaksin was incredulous in the manner that he arranged for the funds to move out of Thailand by having the ownership registered offshore and transaction concluded in a foreign tax haven state.</p>
              <p>The Thai military and Thai nationalists found it incredulous that Thaksin will treat the only Thai owned satellite as his Corporate asset and not as a State asset, and will trade the Thai satellite as a barter item with Temasek Holdings.</p>
              <p>Was the street protest an act that stemmed from 'jealousy' ?</p>
              <p>Or was the street protests intended to act as a social demonstration and social relief valve to get the citizens' message across to a unconcerned arrogant Government ?</p>

              <p>Sadly, your experience in democratic practices is so limited that you depend on the hearsay of a dictator that speaks to preserve his own political interests, and it is sad that the supposedly educated mind cannot discern the <em>chaffs from the seeds</em>.</p>
              <p>With the PAP and LKY doing their business over the last ten years, the unaccounted investments of the non-transparent Temasek and GIC - have now revealed that the bad decisions resulted in a 31% reduction in asset values of Temasek.</p>
              <p>Can Singapore afford to continue in the same old ways demanded by LKY, when the writings are already on the walls that we cannot depend on the old ways ?</p>
              <p>Do you know that in the 1950s - before LKY came into political scene - Singapore did quite well then, and did not suffer from any major economic dislocation, nor mass unemployment that we have been experiencing since 2002 through 2004 and till this date ?</p>
              <p>Can we accept the excesses of LKY and allow him and his PAP to continue in their deliberate arrogance with their unaccountable actions ?</p>
              <p>As matters stand, the rot has already started to set in with the 31% loss in Temasek's investments up to February 2009, and the arrogance - in refusing to admit mistakes but hiding behind a mask of unaccountable state secrecy - can only result in more greivous mistakes leaving a deeper scar into Singapore's history.</p>
              <p>In the midst of bad decisions and unaccountable acts that led to the losses at Temasek, the efforts at maintaining a straight face of normalcy would have looked more credible - if not for the sudden removal of Ho Ching from her CEO position at Temasek, and the recent implant of a pace maker to keep a sickly and weakened LKY going in the midst of all the turmoils that are forcing its way into the surface.</p>
              <p>How long do you think the Truth can be prevented from seeing the light of day ?</p>
              <p>Can Singapore continue in this path chosen by LKY that will allow unaccountable behaviour to take precedence over all else ?</p>
              <p>Can you even begin to understand the enormous threat that Singapore will face if every subsequent future politicians take the same route of non-accountability as a privilege of public office ?</p>

              <p>The people's mandate for the government of Singapore can only be seen via the electoral vote, anything else is farce of truth and justice. Presently,Dr Chee's call for an immediate change in government is deigned to be a gamble for power via a coup and nothing more. Else, why doesn't Dr Chee encourage the people to properly present their choice of government during an election and yet keep agitating for immediate political change when there is no election?</p>
              <p>I am but voicing out the cries of the common man in the lowest streets in Singapore about political chimpanzees who cannot get the job done and yet  want to make the most noise in Singapore and the gorillas who like to wear white about wanting to be paid in gold for producing peanuts. I believe sincerely in politicians who genuinely care for the common folks and wanting to give the best of their leadership for the pay of the common man.</p>

              <p>Why not? USA, England, France have cases of political reforms without power changing hands.</p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #ff0000;">Was it not due to the fact that the old regime refused to step aside to allow political reforms that resulted in the collapse of the "Tiananmen People's Power" demonstration ?</span></em></p>

              <p><span style="color: #000000;">I could not accurately post out the difference in the list of changes demanded by the TianAnMen demonstrators and the people who supported the WuHan uprising.

              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Further proof of agitation without reason. The laws came from the legistralative assembly and were voted in by the parliement in general and not vetoed by the President who has the interest of many Singaporeans. You want to change the laws, you have to go through the same proper procedure to add the laws. If SDP is not voted in, then it shows that the people have not confidence in SDP's new policies. Happens that WP has captured the hearts and minds of the people again.</span></p>

I believe sincerely in politicians who genuinely care for the common folks and wanting to give the best of their leadership for the pay of the common man. Quit being the bloody chimpanzee else no one wants to even pay peanuts to watch you perform...</p>

The protests were sparked by the death of pro-market and pro-democracy official – Hu Yaobang, whom protesters wanted to mourn. By the eve of Hu’s funeral, it had reached 100,000 people on the Tiananmen Square. While the protests lacked a unified cause or leadership, participants were generally against the government’s authoritarianism and voiced calls for economic change and democratic reform with the structure of the government. </a></p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>Did Dr Chee call for an immediate change in government, or is it your own preferred opinion and interpretation of his statements ?</em></span></p>
              <p>Oh really? Then what is CSJ agitating for day in and day out? Trying to show that he is a Rambo-class of hero? Who are you kidding? CSJ is just trying to gamble for power without considering the common man in the streets.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>If you do not know what CSJ is agitating for "day in and day out" - how can you even begin to state your preferred skewed image of CSJ being a Rambo-class hero ?</p>
              <p>There are two ways to get into Parliament - the easy way is the "Chiam See Tong's way" into parliament, and stay in parliament by not stepping the PAP's tail too hard.</p>
              <p>The other way is the harder to get into Parliament by making the citizens aware that they have been robbed by the PAP - politically, socially and economically.</p>
              <p>Can one's conscience be clear by taking the easy way into Parliament, or is one's conscience clearer from the honest statements made that exposed the hard facts that Chiam refuses to take up more vigorously ?</p>
              <p>Chiam has been elected into Parliament for at least 2 or 3 terms before he was evicted from his SDP by his own Executive and Ordinary Members - as they were already disillusioned with his ways in representing the interests of his Constituents and the larger Singapore population when dealing with the PAP.</p>
              <p>It was Chiam's mistake in not supporting Dr Chee's hunger strike - when Dr Chee was fixed by the PAP for the decision to join the SDP when an earlier offer was given to Dr Chee to join the PAP.</p>
              <p>If at all, Dr Chee's spirit has been made stronger whenever the PAP try harder to press him down - as the injustice can only strengthen one's spirit to right what is clearly wrong.</p>
              <p>We can sure be confident that this can hardly scratch the surface of your brain.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>Or did he not - at the expense of his own freedom - simply challenge the perimeters of LKY's by-laws that bastardised the Singapore Constitution completely, with the many newer laws practically contradicting the spirit of the text in the Constitution ?</em></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Further proof of agitation without reason. The laws came from the legistralative assembly and were voted in by the parliement in general and not vetoed by the President who has the interest of many Singaporeans. You want to change the laws, you have to go through the same proper procedure to add the laws. If SDP is not voted in, then it shows that the people have not confidence in SDP's new policies. Happens that WP has captured the hearts and minds of the people again.</span></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>The laws were 'rubber stamped' by the Legislative Assembly that were NOT allowed to vote according to their conscience to represent their electorate / constituents.</p>
              <p>The President has always been an ex-PAP person, do you think that he is allowed to act and think independently for the interest of Singaporeans ?</p>
              <p>The late President Ong Teng Cheong proved that LKY is not sincere in his plans for Singaporeans, when President Ong attempted to test the 2-Key system that was meant to protect our Reserves.</p>
              <p>The 2-Key system was cleverly created by LKY to ensure that any other Political Party that "accidentally" get voted to form the next Government will never get to spend the Reserve that LKY's government had accumulated.</p>
              <p>He never expected Ong Teng Cheong to test if the 2-Key system will work by questioning the Government about the Reserves that the President is supposed to look after - as LKY believe that only himself is sufficient to guard the Reserves.</p>
              <p>What has happened to the 2-Key system today - after the challenge from Ong Teng Cheong ?</p>
              <p>Did you see how easily the recent reserves were rubber stamped by Parliament and the President - with the amount supposedly to protect Singaporeans from the Recession ?</p>

              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Is the SDP trying to be the new Wayang Party? Why the agitation when it is useless and illegal? Unless of course, it is to incite the common Singaporeans to rise against the present government illegally.</span></p>

              <p>Can the actions of Singaporeans be illegal, when the Constitution that guarantees our freedom has been illegally changed without our approval ?</p>
              <p>What are your credentials to represent "<em>the cries of the common man in the lowest street in Singapore</em>" ?</p>
              <p>Who appointed you to voice the cries of anybody, when you can even hardly voice your own position in any manner that resemble an idea ?</p>

              <p><br>I had to "jump" in with my view - immediately - that "For sure you have read it wrongly." - as it was a statement of fact.</p>
              <p>Did I proceed to tell my interpretation of any facts in my last response to you ?</p>
              <p>I am surprised if I did.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You have acknowledged that - <em><span style="color: #0000ff;">" facts " are the events that had supposely happened and are recorded by someone in their viewpoint.</span></em></p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #0000ff;">The interpretations of the facts can only depend on the reader and their outlook.</span></em></p>
              <p>Even if you believe that <em><span style="color: #0000ff;">"proper"</span></em> <em><span style="color: #0000ff;">seems pretty subjective</span></em>, surely with good reasons that are based on some valued principle, or some sense of common proprietary, one can accept justifications in the <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #800080;">cause</span> to relook</span></em> at historical events recorded as facts.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, what had transpired from HZ was not even close to relooking at historical events, but plucking history in pieces to fit into his own arguments towards his own self-serving agenda - in the process, making a mockery of the historical event.</p>
              <p>Yes, I can certainly agree with your reasoning that - "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">interpretations are based on one's own experiences and way of thinking in the first place, and very naturally if something changes your position, the way you see things change. with new viewpoints comes new/different interpretations</span></em>".</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>While your reasoning is correct, unfortunately what you have read as "different interpretations of the same facts" remain as erroneous - simply based on your missing the crux of the arguments presented, and the directions taken by each side.</p>
              <p>Now, this is my interpretation of how you read wrong - as it was not done before, and it is remarkable that you were able to discern it at a tangent :</p>
              <p>If you were to read carefully the rebuttals - made to the wildly creative speculations of what HZ had written, flirting from one subject to another when his response had been debunked - it clearly showed that the statements made were frivolous, mischeviously erroneous to the point of purposefully misleading, and scandalous to those who lost their lives with his remarks that belittle the sacrifices made on those historical events.</p>
              <p>The remarks to the historical facts of the US History, and the events at Tiananmen is sufficient to show how the facts were twisted beyond facts, and his own admission that he was not even present at the scene of Tiananmen to appreciate the spiritual mood that engulfed everyone present physically or watching the drama unfold through the broadcast media.</p>
              <p>What experience could he possibly have taken from those events to qualify him to make a new assessment of the facts of the tumultous events that occurred on that day ?</p>
              <p>His thought process is almost tantamount to a reinterpretation that will justify the denial that the "<em>Rape of Nanking</em>" existed, or even that the "<em>Holocaust</em>" is a farce.</p>
              <p>Surely, you are entitled to your flight of fancy, as long as it does not scandalised the purity of the historical events that had taken place - by remaking of the events based on unclear or uncollaborated evidence, and based purely on speculative thoughts.</p>

              <p>Who do you suggest will form the majority of the Singaporean public ?</p>
              <p>The lower income group, the middle-income, the upper-middle income, the upper income group ?</p>
              <p>Or do you think that the professionals will form the majority of the Singaporean public, perhaps the White Collar Worker, or the Blue Collar, or those working in the Service Sector in the lobbies of hotels, restaurants, or the bus drivers ?</p>
              <p>The fact that you find little honest political opinion in Singapore will already show that there is a vast majority of Singaporeans who will be <em>by default</em> have silently supported CSJ - this statement is made in the same manner that LKY has offered the silent and spoilt votes to the Opposition.</p>
              <p>Can we measure the truth of this statment ?</p>
              <p>Yes, simply based on the massive PAP efforts to deny space to CSJ and his SDP to bring publicity to all the failures of the PAP.</p>
              <p>The desparate actions by the PAP has already shown the fear that the PAP has for the growing support that CSJ is garnering.</p>
              <p>Only your failure to notice the nuances of the PAP actions has caused you to pay attention to the drama of the lighting stroke of the heavy weight actions to put down CSJ and the SDP.</p>
              <p>Your mind is only geared to register the loud sound and actions but missed the background shadows that flit constantly in desparately to support the highlighted acts.</p>
              <p>In similar fashion, your present views towards CSJ is almost similar to LKY's misplaced views towards Obama's political fortune, and LKY simply misread the ground of the US politics - in the same manner as so many Americans had given little credit or cedibility to Obama's efforts towards the US Presidency.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, CSJ is not battling in the USA but in Singapore that has been carefully sewn up by LKY's hand over the last 40 odd years.</p>
              <p>Bit-by-bit, CSJ will have to remove the threads that sew up the fabric of Singapore politics that keep the larger society under a "wrap of fear" before he can make any headway.</p>
              <p>Is there any use for him to enter Parliament and become another Chiam See Tong or Low Thia Kiang ?</p>
              <p>With the existing laws as it is, even if CSJ can get into Parliament - can he honestly speak his mind or will he be smacked down in the same manner as JBJ trying to speak the truth in Parliament - when so much is at stake for LKY ?</p>
              <p> CSJ is a clown ?</p>
              <p>Only a fool will be gullible enough to swallow political venom from the other side.</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Did I proceed to tell my interpretation of any facts in my
              last response to you ?</span></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #800080;">Even if you believe that <em>"proper"</em> <em>seems pretty subjective</em>, surely with
              good reasons that are based on some valued principle, or some
              sense of common proprietary, one can accept
              justifications in the <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">cause to relook</span></em> at historical
              events recorded as facts.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #cc99ff;">Unfortunately, what had transpired from HZ was not even close to
              relooking at historical events, but plucking history in pieces to
              fit into his own arguments towards his own self-serving agenda
              - in the process, making a mockery of the historical event.</span></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #008080;">While your reasoning is correct, unfortunately what you have
              read as "different interpretations of the same facts"
              remain as erroneous - simply based on your missing the crux of
              the arguments presented, and the directions taken by each
              side.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff9900;">Now, this is my interpretation of how you read wrong - as it was
              not done before, and it is remarkable that you were able to discern
              it at a tangent :</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff9900;">If you were to read carefully the rebuttals - made to the
              wildly creative speculations of what HZ had written, flirting from
              one subject to another when his response had been debunked - it
              clearly showed that the statements made were frivolous,
              mischeviously erroneous to the point of purposefully misleading,
              and scandalous to those who lost their lives with his remarks that
              belittle the sacrifices made on those historical events.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff9900;">The remarks to the historical facts of the US History, and the
              events at Tiananmen is sufficient to show how the facts were
              twisted beyond facts, and his own admission that he
              was not even present at the scene of Tiananmen to appreciate the
              spiritual mood that engulfed everyone present physically or
              watching the drama unfold through the broadcast media.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff9900;">What experience could he possibly have taken from those
              events to qualify him to make a new assessment of the
              facts of the tumultous events that occurred on that day ?</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff9900;">His thought process is almost tantamount to a
              reinterpretation that will justify the denial that the
              "<em>Rape of Nanking</em>" existed, or even that the
              "<em>Holocaust</em>" is a farce.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff00ff;">Surely, you are entitled to your flight of fancy, as long as it
              does not scandalised the purity of the historical events that had
              taken place - by remaking of the events based on
              unclear or uncollaborated evidence, and based purely on speculative
              thoughts.</span></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">......... you don't usually tell people your interpretation, whatever you say is commonly taken as your interpretation unless you stated it otherwise. its why you would even consider to raise the issue in the first place. you raise an issue because you either agree, have a question about it or disagree.</span></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #800080;">so far I've found even
              "good reasons" that are based on some "valued principle", or some
              sense of "common proprietary", to be pretty subjective too. i was just reading a </span></strong><strong><span style="color: #800080;">memoir </span></strong><strong><span style="color: #800080;">on iraq and fuck me, one event can have so many people all with </span></strong><strong><span style="color: #800080;">"good reasons". i don't even know what to say after finishing the memoir. even in singapore, i have friends with really warped </span></strong><strong><span style="color: #800080;">"common proprietary". </span></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #cc99ff;">Thats why i did say we each have our own fancy, he's entitled to his own interpretations. i did say it was the same "facts". but you two see it differently so neither side can be correct since its a personal view point. </span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #008080;">Maybe? but i prefer to see it as my viewpoint being so far from yours thats its unacceptable. </span></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff9900;">He isn't wrong, if anything its he knows exactly what he's saying but he doesn't understand it. Just like what i said to you in another thread. I can say all i want but the moment you point a gun to my head, well then fuck me, i'll happily adopt your <span style="text-decoration: underline;">PERSONAL</span> view point  as my own no matter how much i disagree in the first place. talking about something and living it are 2 different things. regarding politics in singapore the two of you aren't even looking at the same ending or even the same problem and you're arguing over solutions?</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff9900;">history wise........ some of the terms used .... even the word coup in modern language usually reminds people of the army being involved but the way you two are going on, you're no longer interested in anything other than slaming each other down. even ignoring what the other guy actually means. just because he doesn't argue as well doesn't mean he doesn't have a point. slapping imaginary crimes on him doesn't help either<br></span></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff00ff;"> even the "purity" of the historical events that had
              taken place are subjected to the ones recording them, even as recent as whats happening in iraq. wouldn't that make "</span></strong><strong><span style="color: #ff00ff;">scandalised</span></strong><strong><span style="color: #ff00ff;">" subjective too?</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff00ff;"> even being at tiananmen in person wouldn't make your views more "correct" if correct doesn't exist in the first place. history is always biased on the side of the teller. </span></strong></p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff9900;">history wise........ some of the terms used .... even the word coup in modern language usually reminds people of the army being involved but the way you two are going on, you're no longer interested in anything other than slaming each other down. even ignoring what the other guy actually means. just because he doesn't argue as well doesn't mean he doesn't have a point. slapping imaginary crimes on him doesn't help either</span></strong></p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff00ff;">even the "purity" of the historical events that had taken place are subjected to the ones recording them, even as recent as whats happening in iraq. wouldn't that make "</span></strong><strong><span style="color: #ff00ff;">scandalised</span></strong><strong><span style="color: #ff00ff;">" subjective too?</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff00ff;">even being at tiananmen in person wouldn't make your views more "correct" if correct doesn't exist in the first place. history is always biased on the side of the teller.</span></strong></p>

              <p><strong>Can anyone change the event through any records ?</strong></p>
              <p><strong>The events that occurred in Iraq - whether under Saddam Hussein, or George Bush, or those whom Osama Bin Ladin sent to wreak havoc - are all events that are documented. </strong></p>

              <p><strong>Your efforts at remaking the term "subjective" into some form of new experience is as scandalising in itself.</strong></p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #000000;">Are your social circle big enough to form "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">THE</span> Public Opinion" about CSJ ?</span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #000000;">It seems that you are as bad as you make out CSJ to be.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is your kind of hollow smugness that continue to propagate the false image that the PAP has woven around CSJ. </span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #000000;">As much as it is seen that CSJ is not doing enough to effectively counter the PAP, it is amazing that LKY is putting all his efforts to ensure that CSJ is not given the space to grow any bigger.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #000000;">Even LKY's effort at putting a brave front to face CSJ's cross-examination - in LKY's own "court of law" - has to be cut short to prevent more publicity and leakages being benefitted by CSJ.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #000000;">Will CSJ lose in the long run, or will Singaporeans lose ?</span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #000000;">Time is on the side of CSJ, not with Singaporeans - as seen in the amount of money loss todate. </span></span></strong></p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff00ff;"> well i don't attribute that to him but you're well come to claim it if you like, it doesn't mean anything to people like me who aren't active politically.</span></strong></p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #cc99ff;">No and anyway thats your political view i can't say anything about that.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Of course, you have nothing to say - what can you be expected to say - especially when you have declared yourself to be "aren't active politically" ?</span></strong>  </p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #800000;"> Considering how the PAP last responded in the parliament i'm sure you can speak up to avoid being slam down. speaking honestly doesn't mean you have to be tactless and make every chance for speaking up turn into another challenge. as for how the other mps function they've already stated their own directions.</span></strong></p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">yes</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Your emphatic reply shows your bias enthusiasm with your own self-serving agenda that is based on your own warped values - that one can conclude as being formed largely by those around you, whom you associate and claimed to have warped values as you have printed and admitted.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Is there anything to be proud of ?</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #99cc00;">There's political venom from BOTH sides and i think both side sucks.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">In a situation where both side sucks, you will make yourself a bigger sucker by accepting the status quo instead of allowing yourself the opportunity to change, or at least even to effect change in a new direction that you can control.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Your resignation to the status quo is revealing in itself.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Do we need to indulge you any further ?</span></strong></p>

              <p>i still feel if you choose the words carefully it is possible to question the PAP  in parliament. questioning the govt doesn't mean you challenge it. rather you want an answer on the spot how the govt is going to deal with the issue. you don't accept "we'll look into it" as an answer. but you still remain friendly when you speak.</p>

              <p><br>As I said, you cannot accept the fact that another political party may knock both the SDP and the guys in white out of the race for the seat of the government.</p>
              <p>Firstly, what do the people of Singapore want? Stability is needed so agitation movements are a no-no. So a party has to think of a smarter legal way to out the present people in power.</p>
              <p>Next, the people at large want better economic opportunities. The books published by CSJ concentrates on anti-corruption and anti-cronism but hardly any word on plans for the economic future of Singapore. Going pure tech? Going for biomedical? Where will Singapore's future niche be?</p>
              <p>Presently, there are some laws which prevents certain industries from ever booming in Singapore, ie. cloning. Will CSJ dare take the plunge and revamp such laws so Singapore can find a nice little economic niche for itself? So far, CSJ cannot afford to lose the ticket from the different religious groups so certain poor people will not vote for SDP.</p>
              <p>Lastly, although an finiancial white paper for Singapore is needed, there must be strong censureship on int-sec and ex-sec issues. No need to tell everyone how much does Singapore spend on its spies. CSJ has intention to spill all the beans so as to prove how corrupt free the possible new government is.</p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Of course, you have nothing to say - what can you be expected to say - especially when you have now declared to be "aren't active politically" ?</span></strong></p>
              <p>that i think you're delusional when i hear those view?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Which part do you see as propaganda ?</span></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">The part that I wrote about LKY's view of Obama's hopeless effort to win the Presidential race - which was recorded in early 2008, or the part about LKY sewing up the fabric of political life in Singapore ?</span></strong> </p>
              <p>the entire part? especially the ending?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #800000;"><span style="color: #000000;">Which Parliament session were you referring to ?</span></span></strong></p>
              <p>i was actually thinking of someone from a non PAP party, although it was very disappointing to hear him speak up then shut his mouth like an obedient little boy when told to(haha and someone told me he's experienced?). i had expected him to stand up and question the govt and question the response.</p>
              <p>i still feel if you choose the words carefully it is possible to question the PAP  in parliament. questioning the govt doesn't mean you challenge it. rather you want an answer on the spot how the govt is going to deal with the issue. you don't accept "we'll look into it" as an answer. but you still remain friendly when you speak.</p>
              <p>we don't have these people here, its either 50-60 year old school boy types who can't speak up or lunatics who can't shut up.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Your emphatic reply shows your bias enthusiasm with your own self-serving agenda that is based on your own warped values - that one can conclude as being formed largely by those around you, whom you associate and claimed to have warped values as you have printed and admitted.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Is there anything to be proud of ?</span></strong></p>
              <p>yes?</p>
              <p>so you're disappointed i think he's a clown?</p>
              <p>as mentioned above its not my fault i think he's a clown. its not like i'm the only one here that used the word clown on him? so if thinking he's a clown <strong><span style="color: #000000;">shows my bias enthusiasm with my own self-serving agenda that is based on my own warped values.</span></strong></p>
              <p>does this mean it applies to the rest here who used the "C" word on him?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">In a situation where both side sucks, you will make yourself a bigger sucker by accepting the status quo instead of allowing yourself the opportunity to change, or at least even to effect change in a new direction that you can control.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Your resignation to the status quo is revealing in itself.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Do we need to indulge you any further ?</span></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>thats your thinking because of your own warped values. like the entire thread where you can't accept anyone not sympathatic to your political views. and resorting to personal attacks when reasoning fails</p>
              <p>with you its always been</p>
              <p>"either you're with us or you're against us"</p>
              <p>then anyone who don't support the C**** is an enemy, isn't it obvious why SDP's support is going down under the C****'s leadership?</p>
