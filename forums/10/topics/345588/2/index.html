              <p>Opening up the society or adding oil to the flames? Talking nonsense and not providing a viable alternative is just pure anarchy without proper governance. Any logic? What's the use of having a government who can only talk or complain without ability to provide any solution? If they say they need time but show no concrete plans of action to take, would the people trust them?</p>
              <p>A solution is a plan or action intending to resolve problems in a country. If there is a global recession, then what actions can the government do to bring the whole country through with minimal loses? Dr CSJ just say the present government is incapable and Singaporeans should vote him into power as he can kao-peh the loudest against despotism and cronism. Then when Singaporeans are suffering, CSJ got no concrete plans to alleviate the suffering.</p>

              <p>Are you sure? I was just poking fun at you for your futile and naive support of the worst politician in Singapore history. If you were to give support to David Marshall, it would sound more logical. Unfortunately, David Marshall is reposing in peace.</p>

              <p>Unfortunately, Singapore has been stuck in this cycle of bust
              and boom, and continuously dependent on the MNCs to provide
              employment opportunities for the only resource that Singapore has -
              its People.</p>
              <p>Since independence in 1965, this Singapore Government has
              gone through three changes in PM - and all three (including the
              present) remained dependent on the MNCs for employment.</p>
              <p>Have we change in the last 40 odd years ?</p>
              <p>The people's resources and wealth remained
              continuously sucked by a continuously greedy government
              desparately scheming to fill up the big holes caused by their
              unaccountable losses of our Reserves.</p>
              <p>With a large portion of the people's resources and personal
              wealth taken through a plethora of financial schemes that range
              from the insignificant to the mundane - but covering all aspects of
              our Life that is dependent on the multiple level of services
              provided by GLCs and government linked agencies - can there be any
              private fund left for Singaporeans to be entrepreneurial ?</p>
              <p>Singaporeans instead have been groomed to be a captive cash cow,
              laboring as an economic digit in an economic ponzi scheme
              developed by the Ruling Party that see the Government get
              geometrically richer, and Singaporeans progressively stuck in
              a flimsy and vulnerably sensitive economic well being.</p>
              <p>Without giving yourself and the Alternative Political Parties a
              chance - how do you know that the present Government is the best
              ?</p>
              <p>If the present Government know that they are the best for
              Singaporeans, why would they so jealously guard their
              position, and be paranoid about the challenges put
              forward by one Party led by one that they continuously portray as a
              mad man ?</p>
              <p>Is it not a fact that they find CSJ and the SDP a potential
              threat if given the space to engage with the heartlanders and to
              educate Singaporeans about their fundamental rights to a different
              and far better economic life ?</p>
              <p>They know that CSJ is good, and given the
              unfettered resources of better talents and to ground support
              in the Heartlands, CSJ and the SDP will be a credible and
              formidable force - as they are willing to challenge the PAP on
              various issues, compared to the WP and SDA. </p>
              <p>From the decades of the same self-serving propaganda, it
              will not be surprising if you will pull out the worn argument that
              you will be prepared to sacrifice your fundamental rights and
              continue with the present political stability to allow this
              Government to plod ahead with their failed policies that only serve
              their agenda; while enslaving Singaporeans to the present
              status quo.</p>
              <p>Alternative Parties can never be seen to mature until the
              Government is prepared to allow engagement to take effect.</p>
              <p>After 40 odd years since 1965 - a human would have matured to an
              adult.</p>
              <p>Why are the Alternative Parties continuously been taken to be
              immature ?</p>
              <p>Will you not consider yourself to be at 40 ?</p>
              <p>Or are you below 40 years of age, and immature with your outlook
              that depend so much on the propaganda pumped out by the Government
              ?</p>
              <p>Have you engage the Alternative Parties by attending their
              forums ?</p>
              <p>Are you prepared to engage actively in Politics for your
              own sake by attending these forums and allow yourself the
              opportunity to weigh the alternative views ?</p>
              <p>While you may not necessarliy agree on every issue that maybe
              discussed at these forums, it will at least provide you some
              measure of alternative views from the standard propaganda that is
              pumped out by the controlled medias.</p>
              <p>Can Singapore continue to develop when ideas for progress
              is dependent on a political party that entice "talents"

              <p>Did they display any foresight or experience, or provide leadership in handling the excesses of Temasek and GIC management of Singapore's Reserves ?</p>
              <p>Clearly it is not the Alternative Political that lack the foresight and experience, or not having the leadership to takeover the reigns of Government, but it is the inexperience and immaturity of Singaporeans like yourself that prevent Singapore's political development.</p>
              <p>Clearly, Singapore can never face up to the challenges from Hongkong, Shanghai and even from Jakarta, Kuala Lumpur, Bangkok, and soon Hochiminh City.</p>
              <p>Can you cope with challenges instead of hiding behind worn out ideas and fears ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Technically the WP is shaping up better than the SDP to prepare for the next election ?</p>
              <p>How do you define the technicalities in WP preparation ?</p>
              <p>Do you think that the WP can out manouvre the PAP manipulative strategies that dilute the total combined strengths of the Alternative Parties ?</p>
              <p>Do you think that the Alternative Parties will be in any position to win in any significant ways in the next election, when the rules are again dictated and "fixed" in favor of the PAP ?</p>
              <p>You should try harder to fix your dream for the WP.</p>

              <p><br>How do you propose to have a political change of power now without an election? The only way is for a coup to happen. That would lead to anarchy in Singapore.

So far, only Dr CSJ tries to portray himself as a campaigner of legal and human rights to the democratic countries but it is obvious that Dr CSJ also tries to subvert the rule of law in Singapore. Dr CSJ tried to go against the Penal Code which he viewed as unjust. He tried to challenge the rule of law by staging illegal protests instead of asking for a convocation of the Legal Council to modify or strike off the law(the correct procedure) . By doing so, Dr CSJ views himself above the rule of law and some kind of lone ranger.</p>

              <p><br>In the first place, was there any suggestion of forcing political change with a coup ?</p>
              <p>How did you so ingeniously deviate from this thread about attending a political forum organised by the Alternative Parties ?</p>
              <p>How immaturely pathetic you have shown your political ideas by relying on the worn out "scare tactic" in desuading Singaporeans from political activism - with talk of anarchy ?</p>
              <p>Did any part of my response suggest political change without an election ?</p>
              <p>Clearly you must be too naive with your devoted beliefs that the PAP is a law abiding political party to believe that they will follow the rules that they clearly defined for others, but will skirt around the perimeters of the definition to take advantage of their self-serving rules, and have the Judiciary System to <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>redefine the rules</em></span> when clear infringements have been observed.</p>
              <p>Where did you get the idea that the electoral boundaries needs to be clearly defined <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>three years</em></span> before an election ?</p>
              <p>If this is so, the next election is supposed to be in 2011, have you heard or seen any government gazette since 2008 - we are already into the last day of January 2009 ?</p>
              <p>The opposition parties have always been playing by the book during an election - has the PAP been doing so before, during and after elections ?</p>
              <p>Can alternative parties win in any election, when the self-serving "rules of the game" are designed to benefit the incumbent ( - before, during and after elections), while the same rules are cleverly designed to be stacked up against the alternative parties ?</p>
              <p>Given the present set-up of the Singapore political scene that has been cunningly created by LKY over the last 40 odd years, Singaporeans have been quietly neutered by the disenfranchising of political rights, cowed into silence by the ruthless attacks against civil society that show concern to the POLITICAL LIFE of Singaporeans, and with fear driven home by deliberate cunning abuse of the Internal Security Act against any Singaporean who step up for the alternative parties and being accused to be a Communist, or racial chauvinist, or extremist.</p>
              <p>Can the alternative parties succeed in the present political scenario which resemble a monolithic Communist ONE-Party State ?</p>
              <p>The present alternative parties have the same set of talents as those in the PAP, who were recruited WITHOUT any experience and had become Ministers.</p>
              <p>Looking back to 1957, LKY was even younger - at 30 odd years - when he was sworn in to be a Prime Minister, he had no experience in the workings of government, nor the massive support of Singaporeans then; and had largely depended on the support of political activists such as Lim Chin Siong and Company whom he had to work with but later betrayed.</p>
              <p>Can LKY be more mature at the age of 30 odd years compared with the present leadership teams in the alternative political parties today in the 21st Century - all of them already in their 40s ?</p>
              <p>SDP had even moved faster to take advantage of modern technologies to reach out to Singaporeans and circumvent the self-serving rules of the PAP Government that block the media from giving any publicity to the Alternative Parties.</p>
              <p>Amongst all the alternative political parties, it seems that only the SDP is actively looking forward and preparing themselves and Singaporeans to the day when LKY will pass on - when even the PAP itself will probably disintegrate.</p>
              <p>Is that not mature foresight ?</p>
              <p>What is seen as political suicide at present, and seemingly disobedient to the unjust rule of law - is political lessons for Singaporeans to know what is rightfully ours that have been unjustly taken away from us by the self-serving legislations passed illegally without any consultation with Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>The Penal Code has been legislated by the PAP Government to lock-down this island for their convenience, and have largely made nonsense of the Singapore Constitution that Singaporeans have been sworn to protect, but the PAP Government have very conveniently exploited at various occassions to follow or to ignore - and end up bastardising the Singapore Constitution into contradicting nonsensical legislations.</p>
              <p>Is CSJ subverting the Rule of Law, or has the LKY and the PAP controlled Parliament subverted the Singapore Constitution - and in the process the Rule of Law as any civilised First World Society understand it to be ?</p>
              <p>Again, you have unthinkingly and unashamedly plagiarise the self-serving bias opinions that have been propagated by LKY and his obedient PAP members. </p>
              <p>CSJ active opposition of the Penal Code is to show Singaporeans that the law when distorted to benefit only the PAP - and not the Citizens - cannot be a good law.</p>
              <p>Even the present <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.corpun.com/singfeat.htm">Chief Justice Chan Sek Kiong comments  </a>had suggested that present legislations have tied the judges to the point that they no longer dispenses justice with the aim of rehabilitation, but become mere mechanism to enforce justice according to legislations passed by Parliament.</p>
              <p>Your naive views in believing that CSJ can request for "<em>convocation of the Legal Council to modify or strike off the law(the correct procedure</em>)" is amusing.</p>
              <p>Which Legal Council are you referring to in Singapore ?</p>
              <p>Does one exist ?</p>
              <p>If one does exist, do you believe that it is independent to act against all the legislations that have been crafted so cunningly by LKY - with perhaps the support of a superior legal mind that support him throughout his life ?</p>
              <p>It is time that you awaken your mind from deep slumber and stop harping on the worn out idea of anarchy at the slightest call for civil disobedience.</p>
              <p>Did Hongkong fall into chaos and anarchy in their protest of Beijing's attempts at breeching their own "ONE Country - Two Systems" concept, when Beijing tried to interfere in Hongkong's local politics ?</p>
              <p>Did USA fall into anarchy when - 40 years ago - Dr Martin Luther King called for the masses to march against the injustice of segregation ?</p>
              <p>If not for the daring vision and actions made 40 years ago by Dr Martin Luther King - will Barack Obama succeed in his attempts to be accepted by the multitude of different ethnic groups in the USA to become the 44th President ?</p>
              <p>It is those that fear the clear Human Conscience of Right and Wrong that will falsely propagate the fear of anarchy, of instability, of chaos.</p>
              <p>Can Singaporeans ever overcome the fear of the unknown, be enterprising and strike out for a new and better future for ourselves, or are we to be forever bound by the fear of the unknown outcome and settle for half-measures that continue to bind ourselves from opportunities ?</p>
              <p>It takes maturity to face the unknown - as LKY did in his 30s.</p>
              <p>It takes maturity to accept responsibility - as LKY did in his 30s.</p>
              <p>It takes maturity to accept one's actions - as CSJ did in his 40s.</p>
              <p>It takes maturity to accept one's defined role to act for Singaporeans - as the various members of the Alternative Political Parties have committed themselves to, by offering themselves publicly as candidates.</p>
              <p>It takes maturity for Singaporeans to ignore the blatant propaganda that thrives on fear, ignorance, and stupidity.</p>
              <p>Wise up, if you cannot wake up from your slumber.</p>

              <p>Yes, there is an implication for a coup as there will not be any legal basis for a political change in the future of the next 2 weeks. You and Andrew were arguing for a change in the immediate future even by violent means as any political social action would not be liable for a legal change of government.</p>
              <p>This thread was hijacked by the pro-CSJ supporters instead of airing any views by the political alternatives. CSJ is part of the political alternative but does not represent all the alternative views. It is sad to see that CSJ has such immature supporters who cannot abide by the rule of law.</p>
