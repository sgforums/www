              <p>"alas.. they had such potential..." ?</p>
              <p>Why the expression of disappointment ?</p>
              <p>Was the disappointment caused by SDP's success in
              attracting the PAP's efforts at pulling all stops to knock the
              wind out of the SDP ?</p>
              <p>Or was the disappointment a result of SDP inability to be
              quietly accomodating to the PAP by being a silent party in
              Parliament as the WP and SDS ?</p>
              <p><br> What can anyone expect from a Drama Queen who is no better than a
              whore for all the accusations levelled at Singaporeans more able
              than his impotent self ?</p>
              <p>Is it any wonder that 'she' will hide behind the
              abbreviation "CMI" - when 'she' is no better than
              the hypocrite of having asked the opposition to
              "count me in" but has been rejected for being an obvious whore
              acting for the MIW ?</p>
              <p>What else can be expected for one to consistently behaving like
              an attention whore in seeking to be controversial in the views and
              opinions towards the opposition ?</p>
              <p>It is obvious that the passionate venom spitted at the
              opposition - and in particular towards those at SDP - must have
              been a result of having been treated like a whore by the SDP that
              result in such hatred displayed.</p>
              <p>Only a whore will behave like one, and attempt to return the
              compliment given.</p>

              <p>Yes, there is an implication for a coup as there will not be any legal basis for a political change in the future of the next 2 weeks. You and Andrew were arguing for a change in the immediate future even by violent means as any political social action would not be liable for a legal change of government.</p>
              <p>This thread was hijacked by the pro-CSJ supporters instead of airing any views by the political alternatives. CSJ is part of the political alternative but does not represent all the alternative views. It is sad to see that CSJ has such immature supporters who cannot abide by the rule of law.</p>

              <p><br>Was the mentioning of the WP and SDA in passing of any consequence ?</p>
              <p>The statements made are statement of fact, unlike the many frivolously derogatory statements made about CSJ and the SDP in this and other threads - which were based on unsubstantiated speculations and erroneous interpretation of facts.</p>
              <p>Those whom I have challenged on their statements - that continued to propagate a lie first planted by LKY and the PAP -  had preferrred to hold their tongue.</p>
              <p>If you have any issue with those two paragraphs stated, I will welcome a debate with you concerning the performance of the WP and SDA - (and their effectiveness at raising political consciousness) - at the National Level.</p>

              common manifesto, a common website and common activities. These were
              some of the ideas that were floated at the public forum held yesterday
              at the Copthorne Orchid Hotel. A panel of nine speakers took to the
              microphone and called for greater cooperation among the opposition
              parties.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Ranging from political party
              representatives to civil society actors and bloggers, the speakers
              grappled with the idea of opposition unity in a political environment
              dominated by the PAP.<br></p>
              <div class="img_caption left" style="float: left; width: 100px;"><img class="caption" title="Ng Teck Siong" src="http://www.yoursdp.org/images/stories/peopleII/dunno-six.jpg" border="1" alt="Ng Teck Siong" width="100" align="left">
              <p>Ng Teck Siong</p>
              </div>
              <p>The
              presentations started off with the political parties. The chairman of
              the Reform Party, Mr Ng Teck Siong, established by the late J B
              Jeyaretnam, branded the system in Singapore as totalitarian and mooted
              the idea of a common manifesto for the opposition.<br><br>Mr Sin Kek
              Tong took a swipe at the GRC system and labelled it a "Group
              Representation Conspiracy". The chairman of the Singapore People's
              Party said that apart from the opposition parties, civil society and
              the blogging community must share responsibility in helping to build up
              an opposition to the PAP.<br><br>Singapore Democrats chair, Mr Gandhi
              Ambalam, talked about the dictatorial system of the PAP and urged
              opposition to work closer together.<br></p>

              </div>
              <p>"Can
              we do a 'Malaysia'?" asked Mr Jufrie Mahmood, referring to the
              unprecedented gains the Malaysian opposition made in the 2008
              elections. He cited that parties as diverse as the Islamic PAS and the
              Chinese-based DAP had come together to offer the people an alternative
              platform.<br><br>"Why can't we in Singapore do likewise?" he asked.<br><br>Lawyer
              and activist, Mr Chia Ti Lik spoke next and said that opposition
              cooperation must lead to a more assertive alternative to the PAP. But
              he warned that when parties come together, there is a danger of
              collective inactiviity.<br></p>

              </div>
              <p>Blogger
              Mr Ng E-jay pointed out that the blogging community should think of
              ways to make their views avaliable to the mainstream public as the mass
              media were still very much in the hands of the PAP.<br><br>The youngest
              speaker in the panel, Mr Seelan Palay, said that he would mobilise the
              youth in Singapore and work towards democracy: "That's our promise to
              the opposition."<br><br>He added: "What we want is for  the opposition to promise that it will be more cohesive and focus on the common enemy."<br></p>
              <div class="img_caption right" style="float: right; width: 100px;"><img class="caption" title="Seelan Palay" src="http://www.yoursdp.org/images/stories/peopleII/seelan%20palay.jpg" border="1" alt="Seelan Palay" width="100" align="right">
              <p>Seelan Palay</p>
              </div>
              <p>Financial
              activist Mr Tan Kin Lian said that it was important for the opposition
              to adopt a common set of values based on honesty and accountability,
              justice and fairness, a commitment to work for the people instead of
              for ourselves, and an attitude to be positive and constructive.<br><br>He
              added that the opposition should focus on educating the public about
              their rights and responsibilities as citizens, as well as the goals and
              alternatives of the opposition.<br><br>The last speaker was Dr Wong Wee
              Nam who stood for elections under the National Solidarity Party in
              1997. He said that Singapore's politics comprised of "one loud voice
              and many squeaks." He echoed the view that fragmented groups cannot
              give rise to unity and urged opposition parties and NGOs to form a
              united front.<br><br>"If you come together, you do Singapore a great
              service. But if you keep separate, then you will not be of service to
              anyone," said Dr Wong.<br></p>

              <p>Following
              a short break, the session resumed with Q&amp;A. Most of the comments
              expressed the need for greater unity amongst the opposition components.
              Mr Ramli wanted to know how news about the opposition could reach
              people like him and his friends who did not have ready access to the
              Internet.<br><br>With limited resources and little access to the mass
              media, this problem continues to plague the opposition in Singapore, Mr
              Jufrie responded, adding: "I should do more to get down to the void
              decks and engage our youths."<br><br>Another questioner wanted to know how we could eradicate the fear among Singaporeans for voting for the opposition.<br></p>
              <div class="img_caption right" style="float: right; width: 100px;"><img class="caption" title="Wong Wee Nam" src="http://www.yoursdp.org/images/stories/peopleII/dunno%20one%202.jpg" border="1" alt="Wong Wee Nam" width="100" align="right">
              <p>Wong Wee Nam</p>
              </div>
              <p>Dr
              Wong acknowledged that fear was still a problem and said that it lay
              with the serial numbers appearing on voting slips. He recounted how a
              young professional couple had told him that they had intended to vote
              for him in 1997 but balked at the last minute when their names were
              read out at the polling booth. He called on Singaporeans to overcome
              that fear.<br><br>One floor member drew applause when he said that he
              could have emigrated but chose to stay because he wanted to see
              democracy come to Singapore: "I want to see the end of the
              authoritarian system here and we should all do our part."<br><br>The
              approximately 100 people who attended the forum were obviously keen to
              see greater cooperation among the opposition parties. The discussion
              was the first of its kind but it should not be the last.<br><br><em>Read additional reports and analysis at <a href="http://www.yawningbread.org/">Yawning Bread</a> and <a href="http://wayangparty.com/?p=4951">Wayang Party Club </a>and its <a href="http://www.wayangparty.com/SDP%20Forum/">videos</a>.

              <p>As matters stand, Singaporeans will surely be interested to know what are the skeletons that LKY and his government have been hiding over the past 40 odd years that motivate them to monopolising political power at all costs.</p>
              <p>Only you will pretend to hide behind the bankrupt idea of anarchy - hide behind the worn out excuse of exposing security to the world - simply to prevent the truth from being told.</p>
              <p>Do you have anything original from your skewed brains, or are you trained as a parrot to repeat what has been taught to say without any thoughts ?</p>
              <p>Are you seriously interested in the truth or simply paying lip service to this thought while finding ways to protect LKY and his government ?</p>
              <p>Are you not interested to know how much of our Reserves have been mismanaged and lost under the watch of LKY and his appointees, or are you simply to afraid of people being disgusted with you and those that you worshipped as idols ?</p>
