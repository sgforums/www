              <p>Only you will be gullible enough to depend on the gorrillas feeding you with an endless supply of bananas to believe that Singapore is dependent totally on external markets.</p>
              <p>With each of the 1987, 1997 and 2004 economic downturn, the PAP Government had set up Economic Review Committees with several sub-committees specialising in different areas of researches to find new ways to solve old problems that keep recurring. Each time in the last 20 years, a common call was for the Government to take less from Singaporeans and allow Private Capital to grow so as to result in the growth of entrepreneurialship. The call was made for the growth of the small and medium enterprises that are more flexible and agile in withstanding economic shake-ups, and will be able to support a large workforce if the spread is wider.</p>
              <p>This call was based on the Small and Medium Enterprises not necessarily targetting the World as a Global Market for all the goods and services produced, but for the Government to be less directly involved in the monopoly of such domestically oriented activities that would have been better served by Private Small and Medium Enterprises.</p>
              <p>With a second tier economy with built-in resillience against any external influences, any major economic disruption or fractures forced onto the world economies will not affect us in a big way - as the resillient Swiss economy has shown.</p>
              <p>Have we even made such preparation despite the reports from the last THREE Economic Recovery Committees formed after the LAST 3 Economic Downturns ?</p>
              <p>If you believe that no infinite amount of reserves can defend us from "financial destability" - what do you suggest to be done, now that we have lost $100 BILLION from our Reserves ?</p>
              <p>It is an amazing concept that your creative mind can produce the "1-way street" idea -  which probably is a result from being fed with too much bananas by the Gorillas.</p>

              <p>Is it not amazing that before your banana fed mind can cope with building our economy - or even hold LKY and Ho Ching accountable for the $100 Billion loss - you will want to involve yourself with the amount of peanuts secretly spent to gold plate the bananas for your pleasure.</p>
              <p>Not too smart to tell us that it must be kept a secret so that others will not use to attack or destabilize us, as when the secret information is out and others know how much peanut is used to produce a golden banana for your entertainment, we will all get no peanuts as well as no bananas - let alone golden bananas.</p>

              <p>Was the original 2-Key system to protect our Reserves not a good system ?</p>
              <p>Was Parliamentarians given the freedom to vote - by having the Party Whip lifted - and allow every MP to vote according to their conscience representing the choice and decision of their respective Constituents ?</p>
              <p>So far, no legislations have been passed freely by any Member of Parliament elected by Singaporeans; and half of those who are sitting in Parliament are not even elected by the People due to the Election System, Election Rules and Regulations, and Election Boundaries that are drawn and redrawn to dilute and confuse anyone who will want to challenge LKY and the PAP.</p>
              <p>The Print and Broadcast Media are controlled to propagate the political ideas and opinions of LKY and the PAP, and the people are threatened, cajoled, and bribed with the practices that will surely corrupt any electoral system in democratic countries.</p>
              <p>Is there any legal way - when the "Legality of the System" is false to begin with, and the system itself is based on illegal practices ?</p>
              <p>Laws are rushed through the various stages without due process being observed, and rubber stamped into law - and made retroactive - is that legal ?</p>
              <p>Were Singaporeans consulted about the changes to the Laws that affect our lives ?</p>
              <p>What happened to the SWISS Standard of Living that was so proudly and loudly promoted by SM Goh ?</p>
              <p>Is this the kind of SWISS Standard of Life with a Democratic System similar to the Swiss - where every Swiss is consulted on changes to ANY legislations that affect their political, social, economic well-being ?</p>
              <p>Given enough bananas, you will probably see a misplaced banana skin on the floor as a 'coup attempt' to destabilise the Singapore political system, and cause the Government to slip on the banana skin and fall.</p>
              <p>With the intellect of a chimp, you will probably ban all bananas from being imported with skin attached.</p>

              <p>Can a chimpanzee know that there are other things better then the bananas that has been fed with, and grown up with in a chimp's life ? </p>
              <p>It is remarkable that a chimp like you can swing your opinion about CSJ - with your present statement that <em><span style="color: #800080;">CSJ is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not making the mark YET</span></span></em>..... ???</p>
              <p>What woke you up that you will believe that CSJ has made sufficient progress to the point of not quite <span style="text-decoration: underline;">making the <strong>mark yet</strong></span> ?</p>
              <p>Have you decided to represent the majority of the people in Singapore in knowing about CSJ's antics - or has the chimp suddenly found his champ in CSJ, and is attempting to make a chimpanzee mark that supercede CSJ's antics ?</p>
              <p>It is doubtful that anyone can outperform your effort in trying to beat CSJ to the mark and win more bananas for yourself from the gorillas.</p>
              <p>With the amount of bananas that you have been feeding on - you are most welcome to the title as the Champ of all Chimps</p>

              <p> If you cannot read carefully what had transpired from Page
              2 to Page 4 of this text, and prefer to indulge in your own
              preferred pre-conceived views of what the clear words have
              indicated, you are most welcome to your miscued views.</p>
              <p>Do you seriously believe that what HZ's views that have
              been expressed by him will even represent anything from WP
              ?</p>
              <p>It is amazing how you will dare to adopt a condescending
              position when your reading ability has failed so miserably, and you
              will dare even raise an opinion to tell others what your false
              reading tell you to say.</p>
              <p>If everything is subjective, can there be any common values
              based on your criteria of the extent that subjectivity goes ?</p>
              <p>The problem with your attitude displayed todate is the
              typical smugness of the fence sitter - one who does not commit to
              anything or any principle, have no opinions of any event or any
              issues - except towards those who dare to
              have one.</p>
              <p>Can we believe that you do not read the Straits Times - not even
              a glance ?</p>
              <p>You are a poor liar - even when attempting to hide
              behind a false print.</p>
              <p>For one who is interested in finding faults, I am amazed that
              you only look for the petty ones from CSJ, but will not even
              highlight the more glaring issues that the PAP has - perhaps you
              have no opinions at all as you are no better then a PAP carpet
              beggar ? </p>
              <p>Delusional ?</p>
              <p>That is what you can only hope for every
              Singaporean who will find fault with the PAP. </p>
              <p> Make up your mind - are you asking a question or making a
              commitment to your position ?</p>
              <p>Are you not confirming what has been indicated about your the
              smugness of your decision to be a fence sitter ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you feel that way, why do you not even dare to form an
              opinion to state clearly what the PAP has done wrong, instead of
              nit picking on the mundane issues that is so characteristic of
              the PAP in degrading and belittling the Opposition
              Parties. </p>
              <p>You have done yourself and Singaporeans a disservice.</p>
              <p>Only a hypocritical humbug will accept a smug
              neutral reply and attempt to be friendly when the obvious
              honest reaction is a voice of loud protest.</p>
              <p>By your own standards in criticising those in Parliament, you
              are measured as much by your own standards as you dare to measure
              others with the same.</p>
              <p>Can you even know how - or even dare - to say
              what is on your own mind ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyone who will judge others by the standard of a clown,
              will best be prepared to be judge by the same standard
              of measure.</p>
              <p>Are you prepared to be measured in the same light ?</p>
              <p>Judging from your performance so far, you have not been holding
              yourself too well - and as much as you believe that CSJ is a clown,
              at least he is prepared to put his foot where his mouth is - and
              paid the price without any loss of pride.</p>
              <p>Have you the same quality of character ?</p>
              <p>Sadly, yours is only that of a careful fence
              sitter. </p>
              <p>Again, this conclusion is your own opinion based on your
              preferred way of interpreting issues that you have no principles to
              stand on.</p>
              <p>It again reflects what has been said about you in my previous
              response.</p>
              <p>The essence of what HZ had written from Page 2 to Page 4 is
              clear, his views and attitude has not been misconstrued, and I
              had tackled each one precisely that he prefer to drop them without
              any rebuttal - as they were based on false premise.</p>
              <p>Your position taken with your skewed interpretation is
              similarly based on your own false readings that lead you to your
              preferred skewed conclusions, and you prefer to continue with your
              smug arguments based on your self-indulging exercise at some
              pseudo-intellectual arguments.</p>
              <p>Will you dare to put your arguments on pure simple
              principles - whether on political or personal issues - instead of
              being a fence sitter, and criticise those with an opinion when you
              have none to begin with ?</p>
              <p>There are alot of nit pickings to take find faults with to
              tarnish the image of anyone, but do you know how to take on the
              major issues ?</p>
              <p>I am surprised that you will find so many faults with the SDP
              website, but yet have not even commented on a major issue that SDP
              or CSJ had brought up that is so relevant to the present political
              and financial events :</p>

              <p>In you own smugness, are you not displaying

              <p>i don't see why the obvious honest reactoin is a voice of loud protest. i believe silence speaks louder than anything else. you're obviously well read enough to know what that means. its a well known saying.</p>
              <p>and for someone who calls others <strong> hypocritical humbug</strong>, supports loud protests yet hides behind a nickname why don't you reveal if you're a sdp member and if so which one are you? or are you another "polite" one?</p>

              <p>instead shouldn't i be asking what the hell are you thinking comparing that clown to me? i'm certainly of a better quality where character is concern!<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"> hell  i'm better even compared to you! sure i do go around posting sacastic remarks in some threads but i definitely don't go around calling people names.</p>

              <p>no not really.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>I am surprised that you will find so many faults with the SDP
              website, but yet have not even commented on a major issue that SDP
              or CSJ had brought up that is so relevant to the present political
              and financial events :</strong></p>
              <p>relevant? major?  from who's position?</p>
              <p>politics: i'm just a commoner. its unlikely in foreseeable future for me to become a candidate. plus i'm not suitable being poorly educated. hardly a poster boy.  i can't imagine going around screaming at other people about missing money either.i'm unlikely to ever be in a position powerful to hold anyone accountable. all thats left is for me to decide who gets my vote and i can tell you its definitely not sdp. But its pretty much a walkover here all the time so truth to be said politics don't feel relevant in my life.</p>
              <p>financial events: big events? look if big financial events really means anything i wouldn't be wasting time posting in a forum. do you happen to know anyone important in the financial world who actually posts here because i honestly don't. anyone i know personally who actually touches amounts of money i can't even imagine <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">regularly</span></em> don't waste time here. i'm supportive of anyone who can create jobs to stop the exploiting of singaporean workers i've seen so far and i'm not talking about your average white collars. and creating an enviroment easy enough for one to start his own business. and i really can't link these things to sdp. not that the sdp haven't talked about these issues but their actions don't match the talk.</p>

              <p>how? he's not 18, he's 80++ he's going to die and still his head is clearer then csj's</p>
              <p>you're not more powerful than him, the people don't support you, the courts apparently don't like you sending you to jail so many times. really, is there a point in this? or its just talking to let the balls <em>song</em> only? if sdp retained their seat and they're talking in the parliaments now i might reconsider my position but this?</p>

              <p><strong>In you own smugness, are you not displaying
              a dishonest part of yourself ?</strong></p>
              <p>which dishonest part? which part are you assuming is dishonest? or is there something you know about me that even i don't know?</p>
              <p>as for smugness, how can the word be used on someone as unworthy as me when you have someone who thinks only his path is correct and is willing to put his mouth in his foot to proof it.</p>

                                      their minds ?</strong></span></p>
              <p><strong>With GIC and Temasek losing $100 BILLION in some NON-Transparent

                                      destabilise our Singapore Dollar ?</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Can any political party win any election that is controlled by
                                      the PAP - when they control the ways the legislations are
                                      drafted and passed into laws, the electoral boundaries manipulated,
                                      the print and broadcast media being monopolised, the Civil Service
                                      mobilised to support the PAP machinery, and the entire Singapore
                                      population placed in a state of close-watched seige ?</strong></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>how about both? if singaporeans are willing to sacrifice political stability the opposition would have already won more seats.</p>
              <p>and think about this from another angle, if the pap has to <strong>manipulate </strong><strong>electoral boundaries, </strong><strong>monopolise</strong><strong> the print,broadcast media and the Civil Service to support the PAP machinery</strong> it means they're not that powerful yet. which itself is another interesting question. if they're so horrible, and he's been called a despot so often to have people really thinking he's one why the extra action?</p>
