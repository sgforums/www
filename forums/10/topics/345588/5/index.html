              <p>Yes, if the new incoming party is as bad as the present government, I must really ask you why bother to make the change? The correct way is when the voters know that the incoming party can and will make the changes. Wait 50 or 60 years, end up with a power change but yet with no difference in the system. You come and tell me lah.</p>

              <p>think about it this way. 10 years ago no one ever had a govt official telling people we can stop rain with chillies and onions. how long do you think someone who talks like that would last without very strong support?</p>
