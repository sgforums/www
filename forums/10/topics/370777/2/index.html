              <p>smart, good foresight. I won't say moving from 5-rm to 4-rm is downgrading, his standard of living is probably much higher, now that he doesn't have to pay instalment and how his money become expandable cash! Good lesson to learn.</p>

              <p>For those who doesn't appreciate the value of their Singapore Citizenship... I suggest watching the show "Crossing Over", how people work hard to achieve a better future for themselves and their loved ones.</p>
              <p><img src="http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMjAyMDQ3ODU4NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzU2MTAzMg@@._V1._SX95_SY140_.jpg" alt=""><br>Crossing Over is a multi-character canvas about immigrants of different nationalities struggling to achieve legal status in Los Angeles. The film deals with the border, document fraud, the asylum and green card process, work-site enforcement, naturalization, the office of counter terrorism and the clash of cultures. Written by Wayne Kramer<br><br>Max Brogan (Harrison Ford) is an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent (ICE) with a dangerous flaw - he has a heart and sympathy for the very people he must track down and deport. His partner, Iranian-American Hamid (Cliff Curtis) awaits his father's naturalization ceremony and appears dedicated to his job only to prove to his family how important it is to be American. As the duo runs routine busts on illegal immigrants, several other stories are revealed a defense lawyer (Ashley Judd) negotiates for a new family for an orphaned child and must also orchestrate the deportation method of a family whose 15-year old daughter is accused of having ties to terrorism; a young Jewish man (Jim Sturgess) tries to use his unpracticed religion to secure a job; and Cole Frankel (Ray Liotta) uses his position as a green card approval supervisor to force a beautiful Australian model (Alice Eve) into some compromising positions.</p>
