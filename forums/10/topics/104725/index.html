Once it is scheduled, officers will definitely have to cover the duty or do the beat in a timely manner.<br><br>A Postman is efficient because duties are time-activity-zone scheduled. Difficult illegal hawking problems in certain areas were once successfully solved after having officers stationed or patrolling on the above-mentioned prescribed time-scheduled routine. Random or discretionary duties will be complex and inefficient.<br><br>Any duties performed on well-established schedules will be more efficiently performed. Until and unless duties are scheduled, problems would only persist lah.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
