            <div class='col-md body'>Ok, I'm not advocating a 'Us aginst them' theory here, but I can sense double standards in this issue. Lately, the mata had been cracking down hard on hookers solliciting in areas like Geylang and Joo Chiat, hookers who catered to the needs of horny local men, but on the other hand, the mata seems to be turning a blind eye to the ones on Orchard Road, who specifically targets horny tourists and Caucasian men. So our white colonial masters can gain access to hookers, but the local men can't? This is what 150 years of colonial rule has done to us.(sounds familiar?)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Prostitution is not an offence in Singapore. That is why there are brothels lining small alleys and streets in the Geylang area. However that is that. Only the Geylang area.<br><br>There are strict rules enacted to ensure that prostitutes are registered and screened every few months, to ensure safety for the local patrons. Any act of prostitution outside Geylang is uncontrollable and therefore is banned.</div>
