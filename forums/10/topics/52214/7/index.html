You are the one who lets money control your life, not me.I believe in social cohesion, you believe in money.That is the thing that differentiates between you and me.i take money as a tool to let me live, while you let money control your life.I don't see NS as serving the PAP, i take it as serving my country.As for you, you don't have a sense of belonging here.You are like a parasite, after wiping off the resource you scram to search for more.That is the basic difference in our views.You won't care if this country is crushed or conquered wile i care.Call me a slave or whatever, but i see it as a duty.

Are you sure? Hello, human beings are known for 'loving' wars. Since ancient civilization till now, when has humans ever stop fighting?<br><br>Especially the modern world where you cannot trust anyone simply. (Modern world is a world of $$. Thats it.)<br><br>You read up some history of the past. Those famous ancient warlords blah blah..(Greek armies, Roman armies etc)...to Adolf Hitler, to Saddam Hussein, to Osama.<br><br>Humans like to fight wars, so you can never say we will not go to war one day. Yes, nobody wishes to go to war, but what to do if the people 'up there' declares war? Stage a revolt?<br><br>What if people come attacking you? They maybe will just send 100 men to topple a country without an properly trained army. Just like playing Command and Conquer where you send a hero unit into a defenceless base.<br><br>As for you question "Is there any way to stop this". You refering to stop NS or stop war? If you are talking about stop NS, its not possible unless Singapore falls.<br><br>If you are talking about stop war, very easy. Hack into military systems, blast off all the nuclear missiles what so ever, destroy all humanity. As long as there is no humans, there won't be any war.<br><br>Just my personal opinions.</div>

I will not even dispute the fact if you ever said that you were a normal/acad school dropout.<br><br>do you even think that nuclear deterrence will do it? if singapore will ever even get nukes, they'll end up making you stay in NS for another five years.. training you how to defend against a bid by Malaysians to steal our nukes. Do you think that having nukes is that easy? It's clear that you've been playing too much computer games.<br><br>Plus your badly-phrased quotes and pretences of being "wise" by rambling on about "society doesn't make you, you make yourself". You quote them worse than a suicide bomber could quote the Qu'ran.<br><br>We all know that NS sucks... but it's still required. I don't like studying... but I still have to do it. There are some things in life which you'd really hate to do but you've just got to do it. If you just whine and cry out for nukes to defend the country, why don't you just go for early retirement and sit around in an Old Folks' Home all day?<br><br>I have nothing more to say about imbeciles like you.<br></div>

Think of this, you will lose more if we don't stand together and build up a credible deterence against our neighbours that most likely will take the opportunity to harm Singapore at the first sign of weakness...<br><br>Last of all, I'm not ask those people who are against NS to agree with me. I am pleading you to just looking around your neighbourhood and imagine that there are many armed "aliens" (ie. foreign nationals) roaming around and taking whatever they like from your house...
