            <div class='col-md body'>i wonder why we are still talking abt this age old topic... ns will never satisfy everyone although there are logical and compelling reasons for it. we all have no one else to blame other than the person who created us - if we didnt start to fight one another long long long ago when humans started to live on this planet, we prob wont need an army in every country now. hell, mabbe we will all be living in one big country called earth den many countries. u can, of course, dismantle all your defence mechanisms. but be prepared for the consequences. unless u trust your fellow men so much.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Can we abolish NS right now?<br><br>It's alright to think differently, but it's another thing to think irresponsibly and selfishly.

We can think and reason, and we disagree with the govt at times. And once again, please distinguish between the nation and the govt.<br><br></div>
