China was in a state of mess with the KMT and Communist fighting each other and Yuen Shi Kai had devoted his efforts to fighting the Communists, feeling that the communists were the bigger threat and believed that China was too big for the Japanese to fully conquer.<br><br>Unless there's another revolution within China i doubt Japan would try anything.<br><br>And now Asia is a collection of countries whose armed forces are far more likely to fight to the end instead of being led by a foreign power who would not fight tooth and nail for soil that is only their property, not their home  If the Japanese attempt another war, it would be far more bloodier.</div>

All i learnt is the important of office politics n mind u i'm not some clerk... becos ur officer or specs have more say in the office tat will mean u have less work to do lol... apart from that u get to see the ugly side of ppl<br>all that i have learnt is what i think  i will learn when i start to work.<br>thus NS for character building ..... to a certain extent if u are a determined person u will come out as a more determined person ya this for other cases lazy become more chao keng...<br>Can i do without NS to build my character [my personal opinion]  is no<br><br>Just to tie back to the topic.... yes we need a functioning army whether u like it or not....</div>

You are insulting them knowing nuts about serving in this sense. They only knows about taking. is that the bottom line then?<br><br>Bring down their salary to the minimum and you see them betraying the country. As wat they had said, their high salary prevent corruption. Isn't Singapore a $$$ minded society? There's no free lunch in singapore. Does that sound familiar? Charity also talk about $$$. Nothing is for free. Bottom line is eveything talk about $$$. Wise up.</div>
