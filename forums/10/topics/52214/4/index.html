            <div class='col-md body'>Who i am is forged by the society around me, i treat NS merely as a means of returning that favour. A social obligation.<br><br>I don't treat NS as some compulsory law, i treat it as a social club when i get to learn some discipline and perhaps gain some life long friends.

I don't think any one of us who speaks here have any interest in being a hero. But how do you know if we have no choice if you do not bother to try out and see?<br><br><blockquote>this country should not be built by men who relied on one way to take care of it...<br><br>It should built by men who belived on themselves, who dared to shape their own lives....<br><br>who had enough courage to blaze new trails....<br><br>enough confidence themselves to take the necessary risks...<br><br>and i believe ns should not be the only way</blockquote>Is not building this country considering one of the ways you mentioned then? Are not men who believed in themselves and dared to shape their own lives believers that their way is correct? Thus, do they not rely on one way to take care of it? Then, what differences are there?<br><br>A step is only taken when a foot is raised and put somewhere other than its original position. Otherwise, one would just stand there and go no place at all.<br><br>NS isn't the only way yes, but it would for sure open your eyes to more things and give you the experience, discipline and knowledge neccessary for you to pursue the way you want.</div>
