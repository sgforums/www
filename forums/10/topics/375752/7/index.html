              <p><br>Shut up, harlot.   YOu think by talking this way you are cute, you are worse than shit!  Your appetite for attention is insatiable and you never give up doing anything to stop grabbing for attention.   Your other counterparts are much better than you.  At least they work to earn money and leave the others to have peace.</p>
              <p>\You are like the oppressive, evil, insatiable for attention and money idols you support!</p>
