              <p>to angel:</p>
              <p>i once saw an old woman by the bus stop in geylang at 1am....she  was in great pain an agony.as i was the only one there.....i told her to hang on and made a call to the police to get an ambulance as she was in pain and unconcious.i even went to the nearby 7-11 to tell the guy what happened outside his outlet.as there was another man nearby from china ,he helped me see to it that the ambulance came.i told him to wait while i went back n took care of the problems in the production line 10 mins away.i was werkin on shift and had finished my meals by some 24hr coffeeshop at 1am.</p>
              <p>now what would happen if that woman was YOU?would the sea cOast or tallest building be yer ultimate solution?</p>
              <p>YOU DONT NEED TO EXPLAIN ANYTHING TO ME.....although im a free thinker ....i always believe i have to account for my actions and thoughts to some greater force other than the PAP.army lhl.lky.gestapo etc.</p>

              <p>The "hum" will surely love the sea, and even if it is dropped from the tallest building - only the shell will crack, and the usually dazed "hum" will flop out of the broken shell.</p>

              <p>Going by your ignorance - all Singaporeans may as well pull out and look for jobs out of Singapore and leave this island to be runned by foreigners.</p>

              <p>hey ox mushroom,</p>
              <p>i already did that decades ago.....dun need u to say what i already know or whats yesteryears stuff.</p>
              <p>i have no idea why u need to goto hell but i can tell you hell isnt paradise.some say its hot some say its cold or both.then they say that theres lots of mutated creatures running around and trying to eat the meat off you when you drop down.</p>
              <p>ok....as for the jobs in spore......it was ok.....just not much increment or not enough salary etc.so whats your problem of u wanting me to go destroy someones livelihood overseas???im not you!perhaps u destroy peoples' lives but surely you dont hope to get away with it.its a small world and a short life on this planet.someone smokes a cigarette and the whole neighbourhood knows who is doin what.</p>
              <p>if you go to another solar system....there are bigger planets 100 times the size of planet earth....and there are black holes within the solar system thats able to pull apart the entire planet earth in less than 5 seconds.</p>
              <p>what is your function on this planet ox mushroom?</p>

              <p><br>"won't be able to retire" is a layman mindset game, most peoples can retire by 55 or 60 yo, just stop work lah, but most old peoples are greedy, scare of death thru boredom, wanted to stay active and  believe that they are still very mascho and powerful, and then, they kind of challenging each other, you dun retire, i also dun retire and see how long we can last.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Retirement is a personnel beholder decision, u can just drop your work, move to a 3rd world countries like my Uncles here does, they move to thailand and get a thai wife who loves their money more than them and to me, they are exploiting them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Today, u ask a person who retired at 55yo in the earlier years, they would tell you, u are lucky that the laws today provide and official retirement at 62yo.</p>
