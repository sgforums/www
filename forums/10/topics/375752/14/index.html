              <p><br>Hit, you could be right.    You know, some of us do believe that angel7030 could also be a guy - with nick longinchjohn.    Mr Chew and I used to surf YMB and come across longinchjohn there.    Both longinchjohn and angel7030 behave the same way.  angel7030 claimed that longinchjohn is her brother.   hahahah, to me what she said is questionable.</p>

              <p>Fanta, but I still believe she is woman, judging from her first few postings. Later it was hard to tell if she is woman or man. But very clear that there were two persons behind the nick Angel7030. Maybe Longinchjohn was/wasn't her really brother afterall but there were two diff styles of posting behind the nick. </p>

              <p>You made some fine and accurate observation here.In one of her first participating thread and the topic of the thread .....was something about giving a seat to a pregnant woman in MRT.She was witty especially carefree about her English but later with each criticism she began to change little by little like someone getting smart overnight and coming back the next day to post so I would say she definitely got outside help from a person close to her.What is she trying to prove? I really dont know but I don't think she really meant any harm.There was a thread about angel 7030 yesterday and from there I know that she is still present and will be active again soon.</p>

              <p>You made some fine and accurate observation here.In one of her first participating thread and the topic of the thread .....was something about giving a seat to a pregnant woman in MRT.She was witty especially carefree about her English but later with each criticism she began to change little by little like someone getting smart overnight and coming back the next day to post so I would say she definitely got outside help from a person close to her.What is she trying to prove? I really dont know but I don't think she really meant any harm.There was a thread about angel 7030 yesterday and from there I know that she is still present and will be active again soon.</p>

              <p><br>angel7030 never mean what he she said.   I am sure its absence is only temporary.</p>

              <p>Fanta, but I still believe she is woman, judging from her first few postings. Later it was hard to tell if she is woman or man. But very clear that there were two persons behind the nick Angel7030. Maybe Longinchjohn was/wasn't her really brother afterall but there were two diff styles of posting behind the nick. </p>

              <p>Yes, especially when she he was talking in military nut and in serious tone in Speakers' Corner.</p>
              <p>Well, it will be back.    I don't believe her absence is permanent.  To me these attention seekers are attention seekers with negative motives and does not matter how they bid farewell.  </p>
