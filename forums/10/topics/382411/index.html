              <p>The problem with this Lau Hum Ku Atobe flash is that you like to go into personal detail about peoples, like to use nicks on peoples too, anything that is not consider good to your eyesight and goondo brain, you will smear at it non stop...Hello, are you on medication or not?</p>

              <p>There goes the piece of shit called Atobe again with her 'hum'. At least 'hum' is only dished out by the commie white washer with the nick called Atobe but admitted by none, but a piece of shit is Atobe's own title self crowned, and acknowledged and even proven by her numerous shitty posts. </p>

              <p>This is a surprise to see the X-rated Fraud being so strident in making a reply that it will not even attempt to redress its own exposed butt in the other threads that has shown its bankrupt views ?</p>
              <p>Has the X-rated Fraud decide to abandon its worthless idea that the Isthmus of Kra has a geological characteristic of hard rock formation that require 24 nuclear bombs to blast a canal through ?</p>
              <p>Why will the X-rated Fraud not address the many other issues that has seen its false positions and bombastic views all exposed to be no more then its usual hot gassed deception created for its typical grand standing performance ?</p>
              <p>Who can dispute with a X-rated Fraud with its immense knowledge of nature's end products that it is so besotted with ?</p>
              <p>One can count on the X-rated Fraud for its pseudo-intellect that will only defecate each time it attempt to think hard to create another of its hot gassed grand ideas.</p>
              <p>When will a X-rated Fraud learn to keep itself out of trouble by being just a little honest with its own modesty ?</p>
