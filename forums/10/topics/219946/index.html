They are only glamourised positions for co-option and depolitization of the people.<br><br>So scrap the mayor posts as HDB or Town council could easily carry out such mundane duties of managing common property like the council members of Management Corporations who are not even paid a cent.<br><br>Some voluntary Management Corporation's council are doing even better than the Mayors as in recent bad times they have succeeded in reducing maintenance contributions and increasing their levels of services.</div>

Worldwide, there is a wide variance in local laws and customs regarding the powers and responsibilities of a mayor, as well as the means by which a mayor is elected or otherwise mandated</span></blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">Why should a city-state such as Singapore have two tiers of political management ?<br><br>This can be seen in the many statements from the POWER OF ONE in which it can be seen as a clear attempt to strengthen its grip on political control:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">'Politics is for Politicians'</span>,<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">'if Singaporeans have a desire to control their future, let it be for Singaporeans to decide on the neighborhood which they live in, and let the government govern'</span><br><br>The introduction of <span style="font-style: italic;">'Mayors'</span> into the Singapore Political Scene was intended to differentiate <span style="font-style: italic;">'National Politics'</span> from <span style="font-style: italic;">Neighborhood Politics'</span>.<br><br>This has been done with the objective of distracting Singaporeans from the larger NATIONAL ISSUES that has heavier political weights if poorly managed.<br><br>The <span style="font-style: italic;"><a href="http://www.london.gov.uk/londonissues/" rel="nofollow">City of London'</a></span> covers a territory bigger than Singapore, and has a <a href="http://www.pubquizhelp.34sp.com/geo/popcity.html" rel="nofollow">population count</a> of approximately 7.5 MILLION people in the urban city limits, and if the larger London suburbs are included into the metropolitan area, the total  population of London will be 12.4 MILLION.<br><br>It seems that UK Citizens are getting more value for their taxes paid, when the combined salaries paid to the UK Prime Minister and the Mayor of London do not even come anywhere close to half of the amount paid to the Singapore PM.<br><br>Yet, in their respective areas of responsiblities, each of them govern their respective territories and population sizes larger than Singapore.<br><br>Still, after receiving a hefty MILLION DOLLAR ANNUAL SALARY, the Singapore PM will need to have six Ministers without Portfolio to assist him in his PM's Office, PLUS several Mayors to help him managed this island of 4.5 MILLION Singaporeans.<br><br>This surely is a waste of public funds by adding another tier of over glorified and high salary position; when the management of the neighborhood - its development and maintenance - are largely the responsiblities of the various Town Councils supported by the various Miinistries, Public Statutory Boards and Government Linked Companies.<br><br>Members of Parliament are supposed to be responsible for their constituency, and are already paid a state stipend to perform their duties.<br><br>Why should the Member of Parliament receive another payout for his role as Mayor ?<br></span><br><br></span></div>
