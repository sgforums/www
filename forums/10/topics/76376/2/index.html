And they get condemned.<br><br>Is something wrong here?<br><br>Terrorists and their leaders can be tolerated?<br><br>But hitting out on the terrorists is not?<br><br>What is the priority here?</div></blockquote>you see, its a very ugly power play here. i mean if they were really concerned with terrorists then whatabout Arafat.<br><br>i tell you what i think. firstly they are killing off the Hamas leadership not because they are bombing people but rather they might become the leaders of the Palestine state if formed. you see, i guess that Arafat after being holed up in Ramallah, has become subordinate to Israeli and American control. That is not the case for rantiassi fella. he would probably pursue different objectives, objectives which are non compliant to American-israeli objectives.<br><br>i quote chomsky's understanding power, pg 169-172.<br><br>The 1st Iraq/Gulf War, was planned well in advanced. the result was a forgone conclusion. it was a show of American military might to the Arabs,it was  the means to achieve an end. the ends being moving towards the destruction of palestian national rights. And yes, there was the American Oslo Accord, signed by PLO (arafat) Israel endorsed by USa, what happened to UN resol 242.<br><br>The voting for Un resol 242 was 144- 2. Israel and American (vetoed) voted against. It was more or less unilateral. So dont you think its hyprocrisy for them to get Un help? even the 2nd gulf war was voted against. with the same exceptions.<br><br>fast forward to the 2nd Iraq war. It ended quick, with implications. but still it more or less displayed the American War machine, and guess what, Bush met Sharon and a UNILATERAL decision was met. coincidentally Rantiassi was assainated. My guess is Arafatwould probably be the head f the next govt.<br><br>Bear, there's nothing wrong with the palestinians, they are people who want to have their country and independence but are supressed by other powers.<br><br>America's involvement has its underlying overtures.  Its the fight for Power at workin this world with a Hyperpower. The very same country that gave you democracy also gave you the words"surgical strike" and "regime change" They are also the largest sponsor of state terrorism, not Osama. look at the Chinese civil war, Nicaruga, granade, haiti and so on.<br><br>i still remember when Bill clinton was President, he was condemning china's human rights record. But have you seen america's?<br><br>our role as forumites is to understand this dynamics and thats the very first step towards political consciousness. And once you develop this consciousness, you can live with it (internalise) whatever you see in this world.</div>
