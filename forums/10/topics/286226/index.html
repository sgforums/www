            <div class='col-md body'>Death penalty is the most serious punishment which can be sanctioned on a criminal. It should not be resorted too lightly based on legalistic wrangling of laws to make the job of crime investigators or police easier or save the state monies in dealing with criminals.<br><br>Finally when the state which consist of and represent collective human beings want to take someone's life it has to be subjected to the highest moral, social and ethical considerations and not play god because human beings are not god. God even forgive a criminal of the highest guilt if he repents.<br><br>Let all human beings examine the punishment system and penal codes to make what is presumptuous factual and make what is assumed proven and what is unacceptable acceptable and not try to be overly pragmatic, vindictive on assumptions or worse to try to save monies on feeding the criminals for life imprisonment cases.<br><br>There is a need to have a system which cannot by chance wrongly punish some who might be innocent because of some procedures or legal or investigation being faulty.<br><br>Now what kind of system do we have ? Do we not have a system today which gives too much discretion to allow the police to investigate and prosecute a crime whereby the police practically could decide on their discretion whether a human being should be guilty even when there is a possibility of miscarriage of justice.<br><br>In our system the accused does not have the full right to access police evidence. The accused is not entitled to jury trial and circumstantial evidence, involving sheer guesswork and conjecture may be used without jury to convict a person to death when there is a possibility that such a person may be innocent but unfortunately unable to produce evidence to prove otherwise.<br><br>Is this police power too overwhelming there is a possibility that the police may under public pressure due to horror of the case yield to pressure and convict a person based on inconclusive facts and evidence.<br><br>Is there a possibility in Ah Hou (convicted to death for murder of the little Huang Na) there is such a possibility no matter how remote.<br><br>Where there is a doubt no matter how smote, can't the state sentence such a person convicted on circumstance of life imprisonment.<br><br>Has the fullest evidence been arrived at to find him guilty or is it a case of circumstantial evidence again like in Sunny Ang.<br><br>Remember as human beings we should not try to play god and use our power in such a manner to make the innocent guilty. Do be aware that we ourselves may be subjected to harshness or unfair treatment ourselves in the hand of the powerful police if we are not careful in our own behavior and presumptuous error-prone penal code or criminal investigation procedures.<br><br>Which one of us are perfect ourselves and may always be free from investigations. What if we are implicated while driving across JB unfortunately having some drugs planted into our vehicles by the real criminals without our knowledge and we are unable to defend our innocence due to circumstances which police may then presumptuously use against us.<br></div>
