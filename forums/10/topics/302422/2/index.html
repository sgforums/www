You might want to consult a lawyer on whether the clause on the 1993 contract can be superseded by the 2004 offer, which actually cannot be offered based on the 1993 contract.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>We understand a mistake has been made but why did they take so long to find out? And they should give us alternatives, instead of just the letter of demand."<br>.<br>In response to Today's queries, however, the HDB said that since 2004, it had sent several letters and gone to Mdm Lee's home to inform her to return the $18,000, an ex gratia payment given in respect of the loss of her stall. "However, all the attempts to contact Mdm Lee were futile," said a spokesperson.<br>.<br>The HDB only finally managed to get in touch with her in September last year.<br>.<br>The board also said Mdm Lee had not indicated any difficulty in returning the money when its officers visited her.<br>.<br>"She can contact us for assistance if she has difficulties in returning the money," it added.<br>.<br>Ms Lau said she and her siblings can put together the $18,000 and they "don't mind paying" Â— but there is a twist.<br>.<br>She hopes that the NEA, at the same time, can help secure a new stall for her mother at the refurbished hawker centre, "as my mother's friends are all there".<br>.<br>The reason? Mdm Lee still enjoys "selling things", even though she does not need to work. Her five children earn enough to support her and home is a semi-detached house near Bartley Road paid for by a relative years ago.<br>.<br>"I don't like to stay at home. I didn't want to give up the stall in the first place," said the widow.<br>.<br></div>
