            <div class='col-md body'>I am surprised at the audacity of the HDB.<br><br>Someone's head should row, and it should be the ku-ku who sanctioned the deal. Were the deal done with an MNC, good luck to HDB recovering their money. The fact that it's a stall owner does not change the fact that their own goofing caused the current predicament.<br><br>Why should the lady pay back the 18k? It doesn't matter what's stated in her original contract because the 18K give-up-and-compensate letter of offer must surely come with it's own fine print. The lady can counter sue HDB for alternative forms of compensation.<br><br>HDB's other excuses that they tried to inform her earlier are also invalid. Why was an officer only sent knocking after 3 years? Letters of intent filed usually have a livespan of 2 weeks, at which time the compulsory deadline will elapse.<br><br>There's clearly a lack of common sense in our govt bodies. Ineptitude seems to be a common trait of our civil servants.</div>

Mdm Lee still enjoys "selling things", even though she does not need to work. Her five children earn enough to support her and home is a semi-detached house near Bartley Road paid for by a relative years ago.<br>.<br>"I don't like to stay at home. I didn't want to give up the stall in the first place," said the widow.<br>.<br>According to lawyers whom Today interviewed, money paid out by mistake is claimable by law.<br><br>In cases where an innocent mistake is made and "there is an unexpected beneficiary to the mistake, the usual process is for the paying party to explain the situation and to make a claim", said lawyer Kirpal Singh. But a discount or a longer period for payment may be given, particularly if the "innocent receiving party did not exercise any criminal intent in acquiring the monies in the first place", he added.<br><br>A recent high-profile case of mistaken compensation was the court battle between the Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore (IDA) and SingTel in 2002, when IDA sued SingTel for the return of $388 million. The money was part of a $1.5 billion compensation sum for the early opening of the telco market to competition, and was for a tax that SingTel never had to pay.<br><br>The judge ruled that SingTel was entitled to keep the entire sum of IDA's compensation.<br><br>In a case like Mdm Lee's, Mr Singh said that one possible defence in court is change-of-position.<br><br>"If the woman can show she is no longer in possession of the monies or is no longer in a position to return the monies Â— for example, if she is bankrupt Â— then the claim would be defeated," he said</div>
