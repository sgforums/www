In that HDB made a mistake and to a certain extent so did the hawker. Simple as that. Nobody is absolving HDB of blame ok ? Maybe this article also reported that the hawker and family are fine with paying back and they had made a mistake as well etc etc and to the disappointment of certain quarters here they can't launch an full assault on the government...and its the fault of media..etc etc..I don't think so..facts are facts..no matter what how they criticize HDB the facts are there.</div>

When she was signing the agreement, the HDB officer-in-charge would probably had told her at that point in time she would receive a compensation of $18,000 for the closure of her stall. I'm sure anyone who is told the same thing wouldn't look out for a clause in the agreement stating the contrary. Because the government will never lie to us.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Yes, it's our taxpayers' money and it should be "returned" to us. But on the other hand, do you think the lady on the other side deserve a loss of what she could have earned in 4 years with a stall in exchange for zero compensation? If you really think that money should be returned, I think it should come out from the pocket of the entity responsible for the mistake, not from those who are innocent.<br></div>
