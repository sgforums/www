HDB made a mistake and so did the hawker as both neglected the contents of the 1993 contract. HDB has the right to pursue the money but at the same time, i feel that they should out of goodwill and in acknowledgment of their mistake try to help the hawker in anyway they can. The hawker made a mistake but nobody really expects an elderly hawker to remember every detail on a contract she signed, especially when a person from HDB tells her she is eligible for compensation.<br><br>It'll be fair to say that if not for the mistake, she wouldn't have had forfeited her business.
