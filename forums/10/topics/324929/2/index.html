              <p>So you are telling us only supporters of PAP are with high level of intelligence and comprehension ability.    You are the one who lacks high level of intelligence and comprehension ability.   You don't have it, don't point fingers at others and accuse them they don't have it.    There is no mention in my reply to you I support opposition, your lack of high level of intelligence and comprehension ability cause you not to understand English.  As such, you put words in my mouth.    Kid, you very unhappy here, I understand.   There are far too many people who don't agree with PAP here.    To be happy, you go PAP's website and be a happy little kiddy angel there.  </p>
              <p>Be smart, you are so stupid and PAP don't accept stupid people like you.  They have all the scholars working with them.  </p>

              <p>People who support any political party <strong>blindly</strong> are dumb, especially those who based their judgement on biased sources of information.</p>
              <p>In my opinion, those who are not dumb and yet vote for PAP have no other choices, simply because none of the opposition parties are able to tell the people how reliable and credible they are, sufficient for them to place the entire fate of our nation on their hands for five years. Would you vote for someone who rather spends his time protesting in public than coming out with plans to improve the lives of our people?</p>
              <p>Each opposition party has five long years in between each election - why can't any of them just spend that time to sit down and draw up policies that can truly help our people (try telling a foreigner that raising GST helps the poor), spend that time to prove to us that once you guys are on the seats, you won't screw our nation up any worse than PAP now does, spend that time to convince us that you guys are worthy of our votes? You see, the problem here is, we can't simply vote for the opposition just because we want to get PAP out; we don't know whether we'll be replacing a can of worms - with a can with more worms.</p>
              <p>It's not surprising that more and more people are migrating out of this country - they simply don't see any hope in either of the political parties here to be able to improve our lives. I hope I, and anyone else here, don't have to be one of them soon.</p>
