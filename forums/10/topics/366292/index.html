              I am gratified that so many Singaporeans know minute details regarding
              the price of water (raw and treated) and the negotiations that took
              place.<br><br> 2. True, I did not negotiate successfully the increase of the 3 sen per
              1000 gallons of raw water. You know why? If we demand an increase to 6
              sen (100%), Singapore would increase the treated water price to RM1.00
              (100%). Of course if we increase to RM6.00 Singapore would demand an
              increase to 50 x 2000% = RM100.00.<br><br> 3. Yes, Malaysia profited by buying treated water at 50 sen. Malaysia's
              entitlement was only 12% of the raw water it sold to Singapore. The
              cost of treatment is not RM2.40 as alleged. It was only RM1.20.
              However, since the Singapore dollar has appreciated against the
              Malaysian Ringgit from being at par to RM2.40, the same cost to
              Singapore would now be about 2.4 times the original RM1.20.<br><br> </span></div>
              </div>
              <p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'lucida sans unicode';">4.
              By the same token, when Singapore pays 3 sen to Malaysians, in
              Singapore dollars it is only 0.42 sen (less than 1 sen for 1000
              gallons).<br><br> 5. At the original cost agreed upon Malaysia benefited by 70 sen per
              1000 gallons of treated water but only on 12% of the raw water sold.<br><br> 6. Assuming that Malaysia sells 100 million gallons to Singapore, it
              would pay RM3,000. Malaysia's purchase of 12,000,000 gallons would be
              RM6,000. Despite the discount, Malaysia would have to pay Singapore
              RM6,000 while Singapore would pay Malaysia RM3,000. It looks like
              Singapore would pay Malaysia with the money it earns from selling water
              to Malaysia and still have money to spare.<br><br> 7. The negotiations failed because Singapore wanted more water beyond
              2060. We could not agree to commit the future generations of Malaysians
              to something that could be to their disadvantage.<br><br> 8. The price of treated water to the citizens of Singapore is very high
              compared to the 0.42 of one sen paid by Singapore for 1000 gallons plus
              the cost of treatment.<br><br> 9. It is clear that for every day the water agreement remains in place,
              the Singapore Government stands to gain a huge sum of money from
              selling water to the people of Singapore.<br><br> 10. By 2011 the first agreement would lapse. But the second agreement
              would lapse only in 2060. Singapore can enjoy 0.42 of one cent per 1000
              gallons for another 51 years.<br><br> 11. Since the present Malaysian Government has generously decided to
              stop discussions with Singapore on all outstanding issues, Singapore
              would continue to benefit from all the outstanding issues with
              Malaysia. Yet Malaysia willingly gave up its naval base at Woodlands
              without asking for any compensation for the facilities owned by
              Malaysia there.<br><br> 12. Lee Kuan Yew is right. By Malaysian Government's consent Malaysia
              is Singapore's hinterland and subject to Singapore Government's
              largesse. Singaporeans need not worry. You will continue to pay 0.42%
              of 1 sen for 1000 gallons of raw water until 2060. It is Malaysia's
              gift to Singapore.</span></p>

              <p>blogs like this are only going to cause a war to happen. Furthermore from a highly religious country, this isn't going to go well.</p>
              <p>Answers pour in as to why Singapore's military expenditure is so high after realizing that.</p>
              <p>I respect Msia's potential to be Truly Asia. It has all the resources most of Asia wants and needs but its often met by useless and unsightful leaders. It is a truly beautiful country, non-urban wise.</p>
              <p>There are countless proofs that his calculations are WRONG and that indeed Singapore is on the losing end of this agreement. Spinning stories just ain't gonna benefit both sides.</p>
              <p>Sigh...I will stay and fight for Singapore, anytime, anyday.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Read the blog's comments. One Malaysian even suggested selling Johore to Singapore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I wonder if its possible for Singapore to heavily invest in Johore to a state whereby Johore would be heavily dependent on Singapore and Singaporeans will slowly flow in and occupy the state's population and then if by any chance, a sale or a war could take place and Johore will fall to Singapore?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I read up one of the comments on a comment poster on his blog regarding the crooked bridge.</p>
              <p>I quote "</p>
              <div class="comment-content">
              <p>To those who insist to build the bridge, pls consider these:</p>
              <p>1. Ships still cannot sail in, there is already the second causeway
              blocking at the West. Take a look at any MY/SG Map
              (http://www.maplandia.com/singapore/)</p>
              <p>2. The Johor Strait is very shallow and narrow, it does not allow most ships to sail</p>
              <p>3. The Johor Strait is a LONGER distance to sail from West to East
              or vice versa, the shallow and narrow water makes sea vehicles sail
              slower. Doesnt make economical sense for ship owners. Check the map
              again.</p>
              <p>4. Under international law, a country cannot unilaterally run a
              bridge across another country. It needs consensus from both parties.</p>
              <p>5. You cannot unilaterally join your new bridge into Singapore, if you cut the water pipe, Singapore has right to declare war.</p>
              <p>6. Having the bridge will not improve traffic flow. The problem is with customs management.</p>
              <p>7. How on earth will having the bridge improve economy? Please explain."</p>
              <p>Makes sense doesn't it. Then why are the Malaysians still so keen on building it?</p>
              <p>Sg wins in terms of Military power. Surely the Msians won't dare to declare war?</p>

              <p>HDB needs to go into Johore for cheap land. Build flats and sell to Singapore citizens at 'subsidise' rates.</p>
              <p>I think Singapore can cramp more than 20 million citizens into Johore.</p>
              <p>Imagine how much the neighbouring countries can benefit from this.</p>

              gratified that so many Singaporeans know minute details regarding
              the price of water (raw and treated) and the negotiations that took
              place.<br> <br> 2. True, I did not negotiate successfully the increase of the 3 sen
              per 1000 gallons of raw water. You know why? If we demand an
              increase to 6 sen (100%), Singapore would increase the treated
              water price to RM1.00 (100%). Of course if we increase to RM6.00
              Singapore would demand an increase to 50 x 2000% = RM100.00.<br> <br> 3. Yes, Malaysia profited by buying treated water at 50 sen.
              Malaysia's entitlement was only 12% of the raw water it sold to
              Singapore. The cost of treatment is not RM2.40 as alleged. It was
              only RM1.20. However, since the Singapore dollar has appreciated
              against the Malaysian Ringgit from being at par to RM2.40, the same
              cost to Singapore would now be about 2.4 times the original
              RM1.20.<br> <br></span></div>
