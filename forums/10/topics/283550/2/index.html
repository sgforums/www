The rest of the minions ...crumbs.<br><br>If the government is telling Singaporeans to open their arms to the foreigners because of "globalism" , then they have no right calling Singaporeans quitters. Why? They restrict wages to keep Singapore "competitive" , well other countries are offering higher wages to "attract" workers in demand like engineers, doctors and nurses .<br><br>Sorry Singapore, your wages cannot compete with the first world countries, that is why I left for Australia.
