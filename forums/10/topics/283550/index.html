I'm pointing out that it started with the UK unis and might very well follow with Australian unis because of the similarities of the legal systems and because of the sheer number of Singaporeans who go to such unis. Would it not make sense to try attracting your own citizens back?<br><br>Also, this current incident with the medical school seems to affirm this trend. It is fairly indicative of the amount of effort they devote to examining the quality of these schools. It isn't as clear with the legal profession possibly because Singapore isn't a litigious society, hence there isn't as great a need for lawyers as for doctors. But I'm purely speculating.<br><br>Besides, I'm already one of those sub-quality students reading law in a country where the workload is supposedly lesser and the pay is higher, relative to Singapore. Why would I care about trying to get myself into a place where the pay is low and the workload immense? I may not be as bright, but surely I can read the warning signs?<br><br>With the utmost respect, university rankings are controversial as I'm sure a person who's done his research like you would know. I'm afraid to disappoint, but only 1 of the Australian universities is in the top 40 according to the Newsweek rankings you cited while 4 from Australia made it into the top 40 according to Times Higher Education rankings or was it Time Magazine? Besides, the two can't agree on the rankings, with NUS for example being listed as 36th on the former and 19th on the latter.<br><br>But I'm sure you already knew all that.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>With regards to Othello's post above,<br><br>I do agree that it makes sense to attract your own citizens back, because (1)they are more likely to stay (2)they have the innate cultural, language etc. advantages as compared to foreigners.<br><br>Unfortunately, by also inviting non-Singaporeans to work here, you end up displacing not only (1)returning Singaporeans, but also (2)existing locally-graduated Singaporeans.<br><br>I have seen this phenomenon with my own eyes, both in the medical field (friends gone to Australia, UK and US), and legal profession (gone to HK). These are local NUS grads mind you.<br><br>For the simple reason that, as Otello pointed out, pay there is high and workload is low.<br><br>Not only are Singaporeans not stupid, the imported 'foreign talent' is also not stupid. Do you seriously think they plan to stay here for ever? Singapore is just a stepping stone on their eventual quest to get to UK and US.<br><br>At the end of the day, it is the free market in operation. You want to best, you have to be willing to pay for the best. If the Ministers can recognise that about their own pay, they should be willing to recognise that for other jobs.<br><br>Otherwise it will be an endless cycle of the best leaving for overseas, and constant dumbing down of standards in order to attract ever-less qualified and inexperienced graduates who merely treats Singapore as a stepping stone and Singaporeans as people to practice on.</div>
