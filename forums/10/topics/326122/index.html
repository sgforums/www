              <p>After too many years
              of unopposed governing, through use of power in legalistically tweaking
              laws and its controlled parliament and media to do as it likes, it is
              not possible to change any wrong doing now. <br> <br> A government that is addicted to power is very much like a drug addict so drugged that it can no longer kick the habit. <br> <br> It is doubtful if such a government so addicted to its power will see reason or ever give up its drug addiction. Not so easy.<br> <br> So the only way such a government will behave will be to keep telling
              craps to the citizens like the previous NKF CEO and board with the
              connivance of the power that be.<br> <br> Reasons did not count with the former NKF CEO or board or the power
              behind lending support to its wrongful policies of hoarding donation
              for surpluses and its own extravagance at the expense of dying patients
              or donating public.<br> <br> The root cause is power as corrupts and absolutely power corrupts absolutely.<br> <br> Citizens could not do anything even with better and sounder logic in
              opposing such power behavior of those in power who will go on
              contending with such power reasoning to protect its power with craps
              for years until a fortuitous change of climate or dynasty.<br> <br> This is the situation Singapore is in today totally addicted to and
              corrupted with power and this will go on with a government in power
              contending with its citizens through power reason and craps like the
              NKF has been doing for years until it was forced to change course due
              to change of dynasty. <br> <br> Say sorry? Admit tardiness in not admitting that it is government
              protectionism which leads to such misconduct or misbehavior of the
              whole board and its CEO? <br> <br> Again this is another real-life example showing how power corrupts and
              how absolute power corrupts absolutely. The world has another lessen to
              learn from our way of a government refusing to change its wrongful
              policy due to its addiction to power.<br> <br> Such a power-addicted government will never say sorry or use reason to deal with people.<br> <br> When will power reasons give way to rational conduct and behavior ?
              History has shown that a minister in power will never say sorry. It is
              when a minister is likely to lose his seat that he is prepared to
              change and say sorry for mistake or incompetence. We have seen such
              behavior in the recent Mas Selamat lame escape from duty. With power
              what inquiry or good reason do we need to justify wrongfulness as
              almost any reason is good enough to mull over the worse of incompetence.<br> <br> A change of climate or dynasty or a pending embargo from a superpower
              or external force like a big brother US president about to impose
              sanction for breach of human rights is the only way out to change
              wrongful behavior.

              <p>Generally people must decide the kind of governing system they wish to have. Is what they want democracy? Is it Westminster model of democracy complete with three realms of the government namely the executive, legislature and judiciary with each functioning independently yet instutitional coordination overseen by parliamentary laws and processes?</p>
              <p>If people are still vague and political parties uncertain about such governing processes and system that they want they will be at the mercy of propagandas of all sorts which at the end only cause more problems and more suffering of the people.</p>
              <p>I would say from my observation Westminster model if not hijacked by the executive to serve its own selfish control and clinging on to power should serve us well for many years to come. The urgent task now appears to be to free up the one-man control and manipulations of the whole parliament and judiciary and return such control back to parliament. The secretary general should only stand on his record of being able to stand up to scrutiny by a parliament fully respected to perform its bigger role and function of coordinating the whole of the three realms of parliament. Under such western model backed up by the constitution which is updated to prevent tweaking or interpreting by anyone of the executive there is hope the westminster model will still serve us well for years ahead. Without such safeguard the PM will be too powerful and no one will be able to raise issues and questions but be subjected to governing by power and fear tactics of the kind witnessed. There will then be no need to talk about freedoms leading to unrest or instability or power being abused since there is a proper balance with is sustainable for the long term with all the proper safeguard to prevent abuses. Citizens will then respect laws and rule of law and government and be willing to cooperate for any laws and governing party to do their proper jobs.</p>
              <p>Our political parties must lay clear what democratic institutions and processes should be put forward to the people in the next election in its agenda or manifestos.</p>
