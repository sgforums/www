              <p>And that is based upon your very keen observation? that everything is a okay for Singaporeans? Doesn't mean you see people shopping or eating in hawker centers means everything is fine and dandy. There are those who are suffering under the weight of this recession. I do appreciate the steps taken by the government to aid these individials and their families, but the comments made by the MP are insensitive, regardless of the context, he should have known better.</p>

              <p>Only the Members of Parliament from the PAP can have the audacity of twisting the truth on its head to make such a condescending remark towards those whom they have cheated at the last Election.</p>
              <p>It is in the typical self-ingratiating style of the PAP Members of Parliament to talk down at Singaporeans so as to win the recognition of the Master of the PAP who had chosen them for the positions that they hold in the PAP system.</p>
              <p>Each of them will seem to be tested in their ability to create some public impact or controversies, and are then observed for their ability to manage the storm, which will either propel them to higher office or swept aside.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans - whether picked into the PAP or left behind in the mass - are constantly manipulated by the PAP Master in his political experimentation - to filter the best by applying pressure to extract from the mass.</p>
              <p>It is His version in the Art of <span style="font-style: italic;">Espresso</span> - where the best selected beans are roasted, then ground to the right powder texture, with the right amount of powder being pressed by a tamper into a '<span style="font-style: italic;">portafilter</span>', and the quality of water controlled to the right heat being passed through this correctly measured powder - to achieve the final small cup of strong <span style="font-style: italic;">caffeine</span> drink that are enjoyed only by the "<span style="font-style: italic;">bitterest masochist</span>".</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Are Singaporeans "mollycoddled" by the political and social system created by the infamous MM LKY through 52 years of continuous manipulation ?</p>
              <p>Can such a "mollycoddled" situation arise in Singapore, where MM LKY and his PAP will refuse any form of social welfare support to Singaporeans - where even the poorest Singaporeans are expected to fend for themselves with whatever meagre help that are given by Private Charity and Non-Governmental Organizations ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The only Singaporeans who are "mollycoddled" are those PAP MPs - who are constantly protected by LKY in his schemes to protect the politics created to perpetuate the PAP political and financial fortunes.</p>
              <p>It seems that the PAP politicians are the only Singaporeans who benefit from all the "mollycoddling" in a self-serving PAP system that has been created to allow non-performing MPs some assurance of success at the elections.</p>
              <p>In a GRC system that has been designed to "mollycoddle" the political success of those PAP election candidates that are rejected by Singaporeans, the only ones turning to the PAP for help - and actually getting any help - seems to be the PAP Members of Parliament.</p>
              <p>With this condescending statement that criticize Singaporeans, it clearly reveal the shallowness of PAP MP Sam Tan to bite the hands of those who have given him any votes - as well as an insult to those who have rejected him - at the last Election.</p>

              <p>And that is based upon your very keen observation? that everything is a okay for Singaporeans? Doesn't mean you see people shopping or eating in hawker centers means everything is fine and dandy. There are those who are suffering under the weight of this recession. I do appreciate the steps taken by the government to aid these individials and their families, but the comments made by the MP are insensitive, regardless of the context, he should have known better.</p>

              <p><br>Singaporeans are well known as thrifty savers, u think they just like to go out eat and spend anyhow, maybe the minority group lah, for chinese, most are very calculatives, talk until the lowest than buy or patronise, actually hor, malays are spenders, they careless about what tomorrow brings, just enjoy what you have today.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Jobs is essential in life, even the rich works, it kind of natural even to all animals group, they have to hunt, work, move to find food. But when jobs get less, people in Singapore tends to go out often, and when you go out, you spent. So, without income + more spending, doomdays is just around the corner.</p>
