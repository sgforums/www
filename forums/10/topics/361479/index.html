                  <br> May 25, 2009 | 8:00 PM
                  <br> <span style="font-weight: bold;">We're too mollycoddled </span> <br> <br> MANY Singaporeans see Government help as an entitlement, something they
                  would tap on as a first port of call rather than as a last resort, said
                  a backbencher in Parliament on Monday.
                  <br> <br>Mr Sam Tan, MP for Tanjong Pagar GRC, is worried that Singaporeans
                  might have been so mollycoddled by the Government that they have become
                  'practised at the craft of recession cushioning', and so accustomed to
                  the government largesse.
                  <br> <br>'Each time the economy shows signs of slowing down, we've the NTUC
                  and the e2i coming out to the forefront to job match, provide training,
                  reduce retrenchment,' he said in his speech on the President's address.
                  <br> <br>'We've Ministry of National Development pump-priming with
                  infrastructure projects. We've, of course, the Ministry of
                  Communications, Youth and Sports and its numerous help schemes.'
                  <br> <br>Making clear that he is 'not diminishing the efforts' of civil
                  servants and unionists, Mr Tan added: 'I am, however, wondering what
                  the true impact of all these efforts are.
                  <br> <br>'Suppose you're the father of an eight-year-old boy who wants to
                  learn how to cycle. Do you line the streets with cushions so that he
                  would not hurt himself if he loses his balance?
                  <br> <br>'Do you brace his knees, and every conceivable part of his
                  exposedbody with padding? You might, if you were an extremely
                  protective father. But a commonsensical approach would be to let the
                  boy have a go at it himself, and take the knocks and spills as they
                  come.
                  <br> <br>'A boy who's mollycoddled is a very different person from the one
                  who is physically tough and take the spills without fear, and whining.
                  The latter, I think could be the approach that we take towards helping
                  Singaporeans during tough times.'
                  <br> <br>Citing an example to back his point, Mr Tan said recently he has
                  seen many residents, especially the elderly, come and see him at
                  meet-the-people sessions.
                  <br> <br>'The difference is that while in the past, many of them would be
                  hesitant to do so, and would rely on their children first. Today, many
                  see the government help as an entitlement, something that they should
                  tap on as a first port of call, rather than a last resort.
                  <br> <br>'I want to spare my children the burden of caring for me', they
                  tell me. I am frankly astonished and dismayed, for my traditional
                  Confucius values tell me that it is the natural obligation for children
                  to look after their parents, and for the parents to be cared for by
                  their children when they grow old.
                  <br> <br>'I would sometimes tell them 'You should let the children care for
                  you, not the state, not because this is a good public policy (although
                  it is), not because society expects it (although it might), but because
                  it is the right thing to do.
                  <br> <br> 'It is filial piety, one of the most fundamental values of the human race.'</p>
