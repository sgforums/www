Tim went to work and discovered that Blue Cross and Blue Shield * which did not pay agent commissions * had the perfect coverage. "It didn't matter. It was the right coverage for Art," Tim says. <br><br>Tim's office contacted the carrier and had them mail the necessary materials directly to Art's house. In December, they completed the forms together, and because the company preferred that no check be mailed with the application, Art returned home to wait the bill for his new coverage. <br><br>When Tim called in January 2000 to make sure Art had received his policy, he learned that Art had recently lapsed into a coma and had undergone four operations in ten days. Because of his medical state, no one knew whether or not he had sent the check to the carrier.

Art's $110,000 medical bill was covered. <br><br>Today, Art has recovered and continues working from home as a craftsman, hand-painting model train engines.
