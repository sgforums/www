              <p><strong>Bloomberg.com, 29 Jul 2009, Shamim Adam</strong><br> <br> <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Temasek to Hang on to ‘Family Jewels,’ Allow Public to Invest</strong></span><br> <br> July 29 (Bloomberg) -- <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Temasek Holdings Pte vowed to hang on to the “family jewels” as a long-term investor </strong></span>and said it may allow the public to invest in Singapore’s state-run fund.<br> <br> <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>The value of the company’s assets dropped by more than S$40 billion ($27.8 billion) in the 12 months ended March,</strong></span> Chief Executive Officer Ho Ching said in a speech in Singapore today. The investment firm will act to enhance value over <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>as long as 30 years</strong></span></span> and will not sell stakes “for divestment’s sake,” Ho said.<br> <br> <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>“We don’t intend to raid the larder nor sell the family jewels for short-term gains,” </strong></span>Ho
              said. “We will jealously guard our interest and will invest,
              rationalize, consolidate or divest where it makes sense, where we can
              achieve clear, sustainable value.”<br> <br> Ho, wife of Singapore’s Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, drove an
              expansion outside Singapore and increased financial assets to 40
              percent of a portfolio that has declined as the credit crisis drove
              down the value of stakes in Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., Barclays Plc and
              Standard Chartered Plc.<br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>Temasek would consider over the long term creating
              one more group of stakeholders, and may invite the public to “co-
              invest” with the company, </strong></span>Ho said. It may seek
              “sophisticated investors” in five to eight years and retail investors
              in the next eight to 10 years, she added.<br> <br> “It is important to test this over at least one market cycle during the
              next five to eight years,” she said. “If this pilot is successful, we
              may then consider a co-investment platform for retail investors in
              perhaps eight to 10 years’ time.”<br> <br> ‘<strong>Pretty Huge Investments’</strong><br> <br> Temasek was also looking for long-term investors, Ho added.<br> <br> “You’ve got to balance the conflict between the interests of
              shareholders and that of the state, which may not always be the same,”
              said David Cohen, director of Asian economic forecasting at Action
              Economics in Singapore. “I imagine that Temasek could attract some
              pretty huge investments.”<br> <br> Temasek is the biggest shareholder in five of Singapore’s 10 biggest
              publicly traded companies by market value, including Singapore
              Telecommunications Ltd., Southeast Asia’s biggest phone company, and
              DBS Group Holdings Ltd., the region’s largest bank by assets.<br> <br> Ho said financial sector investments will still form part of Temasek’s
              core holdings. Temasek is still “fairly comfortable” in the financial
              sector.<br> <br> The fund, in the first quarter, sold its 3.8 percent stake in Bank of
              America Corp., which bought Merrill Lynch, at a loss that may have
              totaled $4.6 billion. Temasek sold its stake in London-based Barclays
              at a loss in December and January, Reuters reported on June 3, citing
              people familiar with the matter.<br> <br> Temasek was founded in 1974 to foster development of the island’s
              banks, airlines and ports. It owns shares of the island’s biggest bank
              and its largest telephone company. <br> <br> -----------------<br> <span style="color: navy;"><strong>Other News @ <a href="http://singaporenewsalternative.blogspot.com/">Singapore News Alternative</a>:</strong><br> <br> 1.

This meant a 16 percent probability for our portfolio<br>value to drop more than S$40 billion by March this year.<br><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Indeed, it has turned out to be so, and more," Ho said in a<br>speech.</strong></span></span><br><br> Temasek had S$185 billion in assets as of end-March 2008,<br>which fell to S$127 billion as of November 2008. For a factbox<br>on Temasek, which has stakes in Standard Chartered (STAN.L) and<br>Bank of China.<br><br> Goodyear was widely expected to trim Temasek's financial<br>holdings and move aggressively into commodities and energy and<br>into emerging market infrastructure and consumer retail<br>sectors, analysts and bankers have said. <br><br> Ho said Temasek would continue to look at internal and<br>external candidates for her replacement.<br><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br>Goodyear's departure came less than six months after he was<br>named by Temasek as the sovereign wealth fund's first foreign<br>CEO. He would have replaced Ho on Oct 1.</strong></span></span></p>
