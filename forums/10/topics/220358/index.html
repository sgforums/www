But remember the 'Total Defence' of Singapore...? Singapore is FAST losing out on the psychological defence... If what Malaysia is proposing works on some of us, that would possibly have certain effects on Singapore's stability....<br><br>Hmm. I wonder if there would come such a day when some top MIWs just run off with our fund and leave an empty shell behind? Afterall, it seems that not many Singaporeans know exactly what is happening to our own money, nor do we have much ability to do anything over it... Top MIWs with the $, the bottom MIWs screwed by the people... This kinda story had happened over and over again in history... Not to mention that Singapore is no longer much run like a country but more like a business..?<br><br>The 'nature law' would be NATURAL SELECTION. When a government / system / policy is no longer supported by the public, it has most likely got to go... If people is demoralised and not trusting anymore, but you INSIST on STAYING ON TOP... Telling people that "hey! I'm still the BEST!!" You really no difference from the 'naked king with his invisible coat on....'.</div>
