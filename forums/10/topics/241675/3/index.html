How about U be the chairman of HDB and USE ur own money to build flats for others at subsidized rate...<span style="color: red;">Hloc and I will immediately "hail" to ur generosity.</span><br>HDB is a company and it HAS to earn money. Have u ever think of their bad debts? Charging 5% is too dangerous and stupid for a company to do that.<br>Last point, [b]price it exorbitantly </strong> do u exactly know what is the cost price of a flat? Do u know how much more expensive it is to own property in Japan?<br>In short, DO U HAVE FIGURES TO SUPPORT UR CLAIM?<br><br>[/b]</blockquote>This part i agree the most...... I vote for anyone who could do this twice over. Just find me someone who could do it..... and I confirm vote for him....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
