How would you feel if tomorrow the Thai government comes over to buy Singtel? The Singapore government might think it's ok at this moment in time, but how does the general population feel about it. Goes to show that this current government is clueless about investment decisions.<br><br>The investment behaviour stems from the highly compliant Singaporeans. They think that they can just waltz into someone's home and pay for that property without considering the other family members opinion. This kind of behaviour comes from ruling Singaporeans, nobody in Singapore would dare stand up to them, but in Thailand, it's a different story. They don't read the ground in Singapore, likewise they didn't read the ground in Thailand too.<br><br>We definitely will be getting alot less than what we paid for it. We won't get back our invested capital. But I don't have a doubt that the media will report that either we made a gain or we breakeven from the sale.</div>
