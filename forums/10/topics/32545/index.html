It really revolves around lots of political level such as the stuanch "left wingerrs" the new genrations of politicians whose view and foresight really differs to the cronies and nt forgetting the royal family. "gao du hao" who knows at the end of the day all these accusations or fingerpointing was ochestrated by our government and theirs! " hey mr Lee my people kao bei kao bu leh...cos this that .....abit show la on surface mah people are actually quite naive and contended as diverting their unhappines through other sources such as accusing your country lor."

            <div class='col-md body'>The reason for MalaysiaÂ’s constant negative attitudes towards Singapore is due in part to the different tolerance towards different political practises, as much as due to the historical reasons.<br><br>Some of the events in life that the Singapore Political Leaders are most afraid of is the thought of <strong>EDUCATED, CRITICAL, AND SOPHISTICATED </strong>people Â– who deserve to lead society (<strong>the Top Ant</strong>) Â– should be threatened by the <strong>Un</strong>educated, <strong>Un</strong>critical, <strong>Un</strong>sophisticated people (the <strong>Worker Ants </strong>in any society); who can be manipulated, taken control of, and motivated to action by some similarly uneducated, uncritical, unsophisticated, but ambitious persons (the <strong>Agitators</strong>).<br><br>Hence, the need to differentiate the supposedly classless Singapore society in a supposedly Socialist-Democratic political system, by having the Graduates becoming the <strong>Leaders of Society</strong>, and the NON-Graduates being the <strong>Followers </strong>(not Participants) - which resulted in a political system that is more Socialist than Socialist-Democratic.<br><br>Unfortunately in Malaysia, that still practises the "<strong>feudal system of Patronage</strong>", anyone with Â“half a mindÂ”, but who espouses to be a Thinker, is allowed to take over the Â“PlatformÂ”.<br><br>To qualify as a Â“Top AntÂ” in Malaysia, Singapore's Qualification to be a "Top Ant" is not used to measure a person's suitability.<br><br>To be a 'Top Ant' in Malaysia, one has to be more vociferous, more radical, more venom in their Â“thinkingÂ” towards Singapore, USA, UK, and all supporters of the Â“Politics of the Western WorldÂ” and Friends of Israel.<br><br>The Uncritical, Uneducated, and Unsophisticated Â“AntsÂ” of the Malaysian societies will listen in mouth-gaping awe to the fiery speeches filled with Â“Half TruthsÂ” by the Thinkers who have only Â“Half a MindÂ”.<br><br>The problem is that when as many Opinion Leaders in the Malaysian Society speak the Â“Half TruthsÂ” often enough,, these Â“Half TruthsÂ” will be taken as the Â“TruthÂ”.<br><br>Unfortunately, this strategy is also directed at most of the Opposition personalities in Singapore, so as to neutralize them before they can threaten the Ruling Party.<br><br>The very vocal Malaysian venom that seems to be always directed at Singapore is due in part to the fact that the Pan-<strong>MALAY</strong>sian Dream was broken by SingaporeÂ’s departure or expulsion from Malaysia.<br><br>During those days in Malaysia, Singapore was the "Opinion Maker" with the unwavering insistence to a MALAYSIA for MALAYSIAN principle.<br><br>Singapore continuation in Malaysia would have been possible, only IF the Malaysian National Policy DID NOT follow the thinking of "Satu Bangsar, Satu Bahasa, Satu Negara" - (one RACE, one Language, one Country) - as espoused by the late Tunku Abdul Rahman Â– the Father of Malaysia.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's called Malaysian foreign politics. Read today's TODAY under the Preda Brenca write-up by professor Warren Farrell. He pretty much sums it up nice and sweet.<br><br>And the truth is Malaysian ministers will claim to say one thing and mean another...then conveniently accuse their own media of mis-quoting them.<br><br>What else is new? Like most of use here would feel - we ain't impressed.</div>

As usual, lah, Singapore wants to discuss all these sensitive matters in public,Â” said Datuk Kepala. Â“ThatÂ’s not very neighbourly. Good neighbours should just accept what we say without complaining. Betul, tak?Â”<br><br>Datuk Kepala said that Singapore had always behaved in an un-neighbourly and insensitive manner. Â“Singapore was very insensitive to Malaysia by becoming economically successful after Malaysia kicked you out. Tunku Abdul Rahman was very upset, you know. He everyday had to get someone to tumbuk him to relieve his stress. How can you behave like that to an old man? Very insensitive!Â”<br>The Singapore Ministry of Foreign Affairs has said that they have reviewed Datuk KepalaÂ’s comments. Said MFA spokesman Yew Lai Ler, Â“We are deeply concerned about MalaysiaÂ’s allegations and we want to do our best to help them. So weÂ’ve asked the World Health Organisation to investigate Malaysia, because we think theyÂ’re showing symptoms of hypersensitivity.Â”<br><br>Datuk Kepala responded: Â“Alamak, now Singapore wants to discuss our medical problems in front of the whole world. I ask you: are they being insensitive or not?Â” </span><br><br>For the whole "article"<br><a href="http://www.talkingcock.com/html/article.php?sid=984&amp;mode=thread&amp;order=0" rel="nofollow">http://www.talkingcock.com/html/article.php?sid=984&amp;mode=thread&amp;order=0</a></div></blockquote>taokingcock.com is a joke website lah...all articles are fake......made to laugh......dun take it seriously</div>
