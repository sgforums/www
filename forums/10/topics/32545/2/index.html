            <div class='col-md body'>"...Singapore has said that it is fully prepared to canvass all these alleged disputes over sovereignty before the International Court of Justice in the Hague.<br><br>Â“Adoi, argue in the Hague! As usual, lah, Singapore wants to discuss all these sensitive matters in public,Â” said Datuk Kepala. Â“ThatÂ’s not very neighbourly. Good neighbours should just accept what we say without complaining. Betul, tak?Â”<br><br>Datuk Kepala said that Singapore had always behaved in an un-neighbourly and insensitive manner. Â“Singapore was very insensitive to Malaysia by becoming economically successful after Malaysia kicked you out. Tunku Abdul Rahman was very upset, you know. He everyday had to get someone to tumbuk him to relieve his stress. How can you behave like that to an old man? Very insensitive!Â”<br>The Singapore Ministry of Foreign Affairs has said that they have reviewed Datuk KepalaÂ’s comments. Said MFA spokesman Yew Lai Ler, Â“We are deeply concerned about MalaysiaÂ’s allegations and we want to do our best to help them. So weÂ’ve asked the World Health Organisation to investigate Malaysia, because we think theyÂ’re showing symptoms of hypersensitivity.Â”<br><br>Datuk Kepala responded: Â“Alamak, now Singapore wants to discuss our medical problems in front of the whole world. I ask you: are they being insensitive or not?Â”<br><br>For the whole "article"<br>http://www.talkingcock.com/html/article.php?sid=984&amp;mode=thread&amp;order=0<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>I find that if u look into the words.........they are suaying malaysia.....</div>

What i dont get is why are the citizens of BOTH countries so pissed off with each other. There's no point to this hate( and i do see a lot of hate).<br><br>The politicians will sort everything out, with or without hate. Thats the whole reason they are there. So i say let them talk and posture all they want. You hating the other isnt going to get things done any quicker and it just causes a lot of bad karma. Its just like i said, peace makes people complacent. Its scary how the more peaceful things are, the more people seem to like the idea of fighting and hate. Its almost as if men were programmed to turn on each other if it can be done without pain...<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> I think anyway...</div>
