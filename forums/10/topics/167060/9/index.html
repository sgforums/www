It comes from your life experiences. So u really don't have to pretend that u're all wise while anyone young is ignorant because sadly, and ironically, in your own words, life doesn't work that way.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  Its even funnier still when the real ignorant ones speak up and condemn others for being ignorant.

Wait and see what they are. I have urged mandatory custodial sentences and I have a feeling that might well come about. I would much prefer it if offenders are imprisoned in the SAF Detention Barracks, but Changi Prison will do as the next best thing.<br><br>I only wish Teo Chee Hean could have admitted that the government made a mistake, unlike Khaw Boon Wan, who is the first cabinet minister to admit an error as far as I can remember. His honesty only increases my respect for him.</div>

U can say that A-Du, JJ Lin serve their nation by helping to bring a piece of Singapore to other countries, and let other countries know Singapore singers can make it big too, but remember they HAVE served their NS already. The reason why there is a outcry is because of the fact that most MEN have done their NS the hard way. Blood, sweat and tears were shed during the 2 to 2 1/2 yrs in jungles, out at sea etc. People chiong the land, air and sea during these NS years, yet there is this guy who went overseas and only came back many donkey years later, only needing to pay a meagre fine. And remember, the fact that he can't remember the amount of fine he paid shows u how insignificant he thinks the whole matter of NS is to him. That is a slap in the face to people who did their NS before pursing their dreams 2 to 2 1/2 yrs later.<br><br>My own cousin's family migrated to Canada when he was 11 because he didn't wanted to serve NS.  I envied him for being smart enough to get out of Spore before serving his NS, but now, having served it myself, I felt that it was a cowardice way. Maybe Melvyn Tan didn't purposely go UK to escape NS, but as a Singaporean male, it is his obligation to serve the nation. We are not the only country who have a compulsory draft, and most males just grind their teeth through. If we can do it, why can't people like my cousin?</div>
