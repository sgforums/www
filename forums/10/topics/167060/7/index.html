Why wait until now?<br>The few cases that happened yearly should prompt government to review &amp; revise legislations to remain current many years ago.<br>Such delay seem strange for a government that always boast about being far-sighted.<br>Must people make known their displeasures and views before government will act?<br>Or people must take to the streets in future when abuses are uncover?

            <div class='col-md body'>NOWHERE in pianist Melvyn Tan's open letter to Singaporeans regarding the furore over his national-service evasion did he mention how he felt about dodging conscription - was he contrite? Unrepentant?<br><br>It would have been more palatable had he expressed some tinge of remorse or regret for failing to do his national duty, so as to appease those who sacrificed a good part of their youth serving the nation and who felt that Tan got away too lightly.<br><br>He surrendered to the authorities not because he was sorry for what he did or that he wanted to make amends by contributing to the art scene here but more for a less selfless personal reason.<br><br>It appears the sole reason for his homecoming was to see his aged parents who are in their 80s rather than due to any residual fond memories of Singapore or nationalistic fervour to serve the country he was born in. After all, he has renounced his citizenship and is now a British citizen.<br><br>Is it pure coincidence that the pianist surrendered himself only after the age where he cannot be made to pay back national-service time not done?<br><br>However, Tan has got one thing right - keeping a low public profile and cancelling local public engagements for the time being.<br><br>(Straits Times, Dec 6, 2005)<br><br>Contrite? He is too much of a coward to apologize. Arrogant and cowardly, he should pack his bag and get out on the next flight.<br></div>
