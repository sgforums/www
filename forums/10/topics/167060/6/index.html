No where in my thread did i say that laying down 2.5 years is courageous. To me laying down 2.5 years is a friggin waste of my time which could have better be spent pursuing a degree or working.

Anyway i am too lazy to write a detailed post and make a reply to every post than condemns Melvyn Tan. Besides, now that Teo Chee Hean has made a statement, more comments is pointless. Sometimes I wonder what has Melvyn Tan done in his past life to deserve such hate to the point that they wanted his family dead.<br><br>If only Singaporeans bothered to speak up for alimony cases and the poor dude who got jailed 11 yrs for shoplifting</div>
