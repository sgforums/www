No one would blindly walk back into a jail sentence, especially not someone as established and successful as him.</div></blockquote>I still beg to differ. Outside of the classical music world, he is quite unknown. Till his story went into the media, most singaporeans don't even know who he was. So I don't think the govt needed to have under the table dealings with him. Why should they even allow it to be reported in the media if they did? It would make more sense to just keep it quiet right? By allowing it to even be reported, they've shown that in this case, there was more likely than not, no discussions beforehand.</div>

I am not privy to the going ons behind the scene, but i can hazard a guess that the conditons for  his return and subsequent punishment would have already been discussed.

But since you're so full of conspiracy theories, can you explain how Melvyn Tan would have even the slightest indication whether or not he would be thrown in a cell for defaulting? Given that our CJ periodically ups fines into jail sentences and randomly doubles the sentences of appeals, can you explain how he could have 'predicted' the outcome of his hearing?<br><br></div>

He broke out of the traditional Singapore mould of "don't be stupid, u can't make a living out of/become world famous in sports/music/culture/arts" He is my hero, not because he is a musician, but because he did what I only wish more people have the guts to do. He showed those of us who wish to pursue our dreams that there IS hope that just because u have the ill fortune of being born in singapore, it doesn't mean you have to kill your dreams, that u're doomed to a life of nothingness, of unfulfillment. He showed us that it is still possible to dream, to pursue your dream, and to make it ultimately, even tho being born a singaporean is a handicap like having both your hands tied behind your back in a prizefight.<br><br>because i've been in his shoes about pursueing a dream, i know whats it like chasing a dream, and im sick of singaporeans who can only feel indignant that he wasn't punished heavily enuf simply because they served, and have a warped sense of justice. They don't complain about the injustices they don't know or don't care about, they only complain about their perceived injustices, that exists only in their heads because they've been fed so full of bullsh|t by the govt.<br><br>I have even more reasons but I won't list them here. If u want I can PM u those reasons.</div>
