There are probably lots of white horses who have gotten away with more, including manslaughter or murder(those of u who know, will know exactly what n who im talking about). But these things don't make the paper so nobody kicks up a big fuss. Just so happens his case made the papers so everyone feel they must make a big hoo ha over his case, which in my opinion, was really quite fairly judged in the courts for once. Why don't u people go make noise over something really worthwhile? Like whitehorses who get away with manslaughter/murder while they're serving their NS?</div>

In any case, I don't think if u want a career in classical style music, u can get any training in singapore. Name me one world renown college or institute of music in singapore. I doubt if u can. 2ndly. He dodged his NS. Of couse he had to end up a resident elsewhere because he didn't want to end up in jail for something he didn't believe in. The only alternative left is to seek out citizenship in other countries. Its all very understandable is it not?

It only got reported because SOMEONE in the media felt it was "unfair" or a deviation from the usual policy, so it wouldn't even be reported if he got a jail sentence, so its USELESS as a deterrance.

            <div class='col-md body'>The psychological aftermath of our government's intentions has left us in a quagmire.<br><br>After all the years of developing 'HUMAN RESOURCE' as Singapore's sole marketable product, the arts and cultural sectors have taken a huge knock. To the extent that they are neither well-documented nor publicised.<br><br>To take up performing arts or 'lesser' fields such as music or dance is seen as a niche market with little or no hope of making it big. As a result, the perverted traditions of engineering and finance have been rigidly inculcated in us drones, too straight to even contemplate variations in our future.<br><br>Even parents discourage their children in furthering their interest in these fields. Ditto for sports.<br><br>Then along comes Melvyn Tan, who proved that branching into such a 'condemned' field can reap dividends. He, like so many of us, was chasing a dream, a dream few dare to realise and his parents duly supported him. He was a first, a man who dare to take a different and uncertain route and found success along the way.<br><br>Even better, he had the courage to return to face the courts, aware of a potential jail term just so his parents could watch his performance in SG.<br><br>Instead of being given critical acclaim, he was crucified by locals over an admin mistake, which is arguably the fault of both sides, not Melvyn's alone. Teo Chee Hean did no favours by lending weight to the public outcry by saying he favoured jailing defaulters after the judgement was delivered.<br><br>Why are our own ministers so biased and one-sided simply because a person defaulted on NS? He left at the age of 12 to pursue his dreams and not 18, the ripe age for enlistment. And given the choice of career over national service, surely such a untenable position becomes unenviable and understood?<br><br>He made a choice. We as a people may not have agreed with it. But we should respect his position and difficulty before jumping on the 'flame-him' bandwagon.</div>

Thats why i respect and like this guy so much, even tho i only learnt of him thru this incident. One does not have to listen to classical music to be cultured. One just has to respect people whom deserved to be respected.</div>

U are 18 and they offer u a chance to play at the Royal Albert Hall in London, as a relative unknown, and u know that this will catapult u into fame amongst the classical music world. the only problem is, this performance is only scheduled for next summer, when BBC holds their prestegious Proms concerts all thru summer. Of course by then u should have graduated already, and should be back home in Singapore to serve your NS. Serving your NS and then going back to do a performance is an impossiblity, since after 2 years, if u're an unknown, then people will forget u and u will never get that launch into stardom within the classical music world u so desperately wish for. As a result, u decide, with a heavy heart, to follow your dreams, to listen to your heart.<br><br>I hope this helps u understand why he did what he did.<br><br>Anyways if such arrangements can be made for our hopeless soccer players who cannot achieve anything much, I don't see why not for people with talents in other fields.</div>
