People outside singapore are not likely to care if he dodged national service, so his reputation is likely to remain intact. There are also groups out there that are anti-conscription, so they might have a new poster boy. Ironically, his adopted country also abolished national service during the 60s. So I think his reputation is safe.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>

This is a serious matter we are talking about here, not some trivial and trifle thing. This is desertion from being drafted and evading serving the country and defending it. I dont know about others but I am not kpkb and merely expressing my opinion backed up by facts and logical arguments and views, which is my right as a citizen of this country. Other citizens who have dutifully served their NS also have the right to express their views and opinion, and mind you I do think we have a strong case on this Melvyn Tan issue.<br><br>You say there is no equality in this world, while I agree that the government is not perfect and completely fair and this world is not completely perfect and fair, we should fight for a more fair and just world. After all, does it not say in our national pledge that we are building a society based on justice and equality? While everything cannot be perfectly fair, there should be equality of opportunities in Singapore (and indeed the world) and equality before the law, meaning the law should be applied equally. I am not completely certain but I suppose there must be some who have also dodged NS and ended up jailed and imprisoned.<br><br>You say if there is equality I would be sitting at the same table as LKY and eating the same food as him. While most including me are not as bright and brilliant as our great MM, the likelihood remains that if I was as brilliant as him or close to his intelligence, I would most likely be in his position or occupy some high ranking big shot post in Singapore cos I use my brain and acumen/intelligence to move into those positions! In that sense there is no fairness because some are born bright or not as bright but there should be equality of opportunities, meaning if I am bright as LKY I have a great chance to be in his position or at least a high ranking position. Similarly if I am good at something else I can also do well and achieve success in other fields and other areas and perhaps move into a position that is more in tune to my abilities and talent.<br><br>You say the bottomline is that he also got punished by the law and dont KPKB about it, but the point here is that the penalty is too light! The amount will most probably be peanuts to an established musician like him. Probably others who have also dodged NS have been jailed too and soldiers who AWOL even one day can get sent to the Detention Barracks. And of course one can go DB for other kinds of offences as well like absence from official duty.<br><br>Thats where equality before the law comes in, can the government explain satisfactorily why Melvyn Tan was only given a fine for defaulting on NS?<br><br>As citizens of this country and some or mostly NS men or present NSFs and future NSFs, it is our right to make our views known, to express our opinion and to lobby the government for more fair and equal treatment. In this way we also promote a just and participatory society. Kudos to those who spoke up on the Melvyn Tan issue!!!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by THE ANALYST:</div><div class="quote_body">To some people especially HENG, I have some things to say to you.<br><br>Firstly, I am NOT kao peh kao bu about the Melvyn Tan issue. This is a serious matter we are talking about here, not some trivial and trifle thing. This is desertion from being drafted and evading serving the country and defending it. I dont know about others but I am not kpkb and merely expressing my opinion backed up by facts and logical arguments and views, which is my right as a citizen of this country. Other citizens who have dutifully served their NS also have the right to express their views and opinion, and mind you I do think we have a strong case on this Melvyn Tan issue.<br><br>You say there is no equality in this world, while I agree that the government is not perfect and completely fair and this world is not completely perfect and fair, we should fight for a more fair and just world. After all, does it not say in our national pledge that we are building a society based on justice and equality? While everything cannot be perfectly fair, there should be equality of opportunities in Singapore (and indeed the world) and equality before the law, meaning the law should be applied equally. I am not completely certain but I suppose there must be some who have also dodged NS and ended up jailed and imprisoned.<br><br>You say if there is equality I would be sitting at the same table as LKY and eating the same food as him. While most including me are not as bright and brilliant as our great MM, the likelihood remains that if I was as brilliant as him or close to his intelligence, I would most likely be in his position or occupy some high ranking big shot post in Singapore cos I use my brain and acumen/intelligence to move into those positions! In that sense there is no fairness because some are born bright or not as bright but there should be equality of opportunities, meaning if I am bright as LKY I have a great chance to be in his position or at least a high ranking position. Similarly if I am good at something else I can also do well and achieve success in other fields and other areas and perhaps move into a position that is more in tune to my abilities and talent.<br><br>You say the bottomline is that he also got punished by the law and dont KPKB about it, but the point here is that the penalty is too light! The amount will most probably be peanuts to an established musician like him. Probably others who have also dodged NS have been jailed too and soldiers who AWOL even one day can get sent to the Detention Barracks. And of course one can go DB for other kinds of offences as well like absence from official duty.<br><br>Thats where equality before the law comes in, can the government explain satisfactorily why Melvyn Tan was only given a fine for defaulting on NS?<br><br>As citizens of this country and some or mostly NS men or present NSFs and future NSFs, it is our right to make our views known, to express our opinion and to lobby the government for more fair and equal treatment. In this way we also promote a just and participatory society. Kudos to those who spoke up on the Melvyn Tan issue!!!<br><br></div></blockquote>u want something to be irked over? come i PM u something. I give u a really good case of injustice to be irked over. This kind of small thing blow up until so big. U say fine light, then go and yell at the state la. Melvyn's fault that he got a fine ah? EVEN say he specially call back n make arrangements with the govt to get of lightly, if our government is not corruptable, how would that be possible then? Everything, starts with the govt, end with the govt. Go rant at them then. Meanwhile, read my PM.</div>

IF I did, then I want to ask, why is it I can still find forgiveness for his "crime" when others can't? Esp since we all know who the real culprits here are, and who should really be blamed?</div>
