Like I said, good for him that he did good.  I harbour no jealousy or ill-will against the guy and applaud the fact that he took the risk, beat the system and pursued his dreams.

The same system that subjects everyone else to 2-3 years of wasted youth has to name the price of dodging national service.  $5,000 fine in exchange for 2-3 years of your life?  That's a joke.  And a slap to the face of everyone who has served NS.<br><br>So the point is that people feel that the system is not being fair and who can blame them?<br><br>As for not complaining about cases that are not reported... well that is precisely it.  Singaporeans can't whine about what has been concealed from them.  But that's a whole other issue.</div></blockquote>then why direct their whines at him? direct it at the system.</div>

Nobody said he did not break a law. He broke a law, he got punished by the law, all this is fact. We're saying in his case, it is quite understandable, even if its not right, but these sort of grey area topics can never be fully clear cut can it?

            <div class='col-md body'>extracted from ST forum.<br><br>Unbecoming of pianist to back out of concert<br><br>CRASS, callous, childish. And as a performing artiste, totally unprofessional.<br><br>That was how I felt after reading about pianist Melvyn Tan backing out of his Esplanade concert scheduled for Dec 21 and his role as adjudicator in the National Piano and Violin Competition.<br><br>The pianist, who evaded national service, should realise that in any controversy, especially one so sensitive as evading NS, there will be those who are for it and those who are opposed to it.<br><br>As he was prepared to face the music, surely opposing views to the controversy started by him must also be viewed as 'part of the music' and faced graciously too.<br><br>The concert is a separate thing altogether. As a professional pianist, his commitment and duty must first and foremost be to his audience - even if it is a free concert, let alone one that is a sell-out.<br><br>I feel sorry for those who had purchased tickets and must now be inconvenienced to obtain refunds. Surely, among them many are pure lovers of his music and are able to separate the two issues objectively - otherwise they would not have bought tickets - whether or not they privately disagree with his evasion of NS.<br><br>It is widely acknowledged that, among other things, a stint in NS helps build and mould the character of our servicemen. By not undergoing NS and backing out of his scheduled concert, it appears that the pianist had missed out on this benefit.<br><br>Clinton Lim Eng Hiong<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>extracted from ST forum.<br><br>Wrong not to say sorry, right to cancel show<br><br>NOWHERE in pianist Melvyn Tan's open letter to Singaporeans regarding the furore over his national-service evasion did he mention how he felt about dodging conscription - was he contrite? Unrepentant?<br><br>It would have been more palatable had he expressed some tinge of remorse or regret for failing to do his national duty, so as to appease those who sacrificed a good part of their youth serving the nation and who felt that Tan got away too lightly.<br><br>He surrendered to the authorities not because he was sorry for what he did or that he wanted to make amends by contributing to the art scene here but more for a less selfless personal reason.<br><br>It appears the sole reason for his homecoming was to see his aged parents who are in their 80s rather than due to any residual fond memories of Singapore or nationalistic fervour to serve the country he was born in. After all, he has renounced his citizenship and is now a British citizen.<br><br>Is it pure coincidence that the pianist surrendered himself only after the age where he cannot be made to pay back national-service time not done?<br><br>However, Tan has got one thing right - keeping a low public profile and cancelling local public engagements for the time being.<br><br>Dr Lim Boon Hee<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>extracted from ST forum.<br><br>Uproar over NS defaulter reflects badly on society<br><br>I am saddened and dismayed to learn that pianist Melvyn Tan has decided to cancel his concert and will not judge a national piano and violin competition.<br><br>However, I understand his decision and I am embarrassed by the behaviour of my fellow Singaporeans.<br><br>Economically, we may be a First World nation, but culturally, we are still in the dark ages. There are some of us who appreciate Mr Tan's desire to contribute to the growth of the local arts scene.<br><br>I am touched by his willingness to risk a jail term to see his parents, as filial piety has become somewhat of a rare commodity in our modern society.<br><br>I myself have lived abroad for many years, and I will be returning to Singapore next year. The recent events have caused me a great deal of distress, as it reflects badly on the kind of society we have become.<br><br>I apologise for the anguish that this furore must have caused Mr Tanand his family. I am, however, optimistic that we will eventually become a more gracious society.<br><br>If and when that day comes, I hope Mr Tan will be able to leave this unfortunate turn of events behind him and return to give a recital. I look forward to attending his concert someday.<br><br>Ben Leong<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>extracted from ST forum.<br><br>Wrong to roll out red carpet for draft dodger<br><br>I used to adopt an attitude of benign neutrality towards the arts and would smile as musicians and painters indulged in their pastimes while I enjoyed my sports.<br><br>But developments in the Melvyn Tan saga, in particular, the statement by Ms Michelle Yeo, the Esplanade's programming officer, may change my stance from neutrality to contempt.<br><br>Ms Yeo said the Esplanade was 'saddened by Melvyn's decision (to cancel his concert)', which would have been 'a treat for music lovers'. The Esplanade and the National Arts Council both said they understood and respected his decision.<br><br>All forms of art appeal to the soul. They are about sensitivity, emotion and values. Is the management of the Esplanade sad that its halls will be empty that night and that its regular patrons will miss an evening of enjoyment?<br><br>Can it not sense the outrage of the thousands of men who griped and grumbled but reported dutifully for national service? And does it place such little value on character, duty and nation building?<br><br>Letter writers have lambasted the Ministry of Defence (Mindef) for not doing enough. But the fault may not lie there; those who run the arts scene here must share the blame for rolling out the red carpet for a national service defaulter.<br><br>Mindef officials can only work within the constraints of the law. And for all we know, that law might have been drafted almost 40 years ago. Then, national service was new, and a $5,000 penalty represented a full year's pay for a second lieutenant.<br><br>Defence Minister Teo Chee Hean has hinted that things may change at the next sitting of Parliament. I look forward to that.<br><br>Not too long ago, Singapore was embroiled in a heated discussion on the difference between an elite and elitism. The official stance was that we needed an elite to lead people forward. But this elite must lead by example, never forgetting its responsibilities and, most importantly, never hiding behind elitism as an excuse to shirk its duties.<br><br>This message seems to have been missed by the National Arts Council, which invited Mr Tan to judge an important competition. As competitors naturally look up to the judges, would others feel that his example is worth emulating?<br><br>Would they think it all right to default on duty to further one's career, and would they expect that all should be forgiven?<br><br>I do not think any of us will be so uncharitable as to slam the door on Mr Tan if or when he comes back. But I would like him, and those who use the arts as an excuse for evading the harsher aspects of everyday life, to remember that if the majority of us had not been soldiers, there might not even be an Esplanade or, for that matter, Singapore for him to perform in.<br><br>Lee Chiu San<br></div>
