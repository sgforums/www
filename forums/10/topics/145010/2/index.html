            <div class='col-md body'>Anyone read the ST abt this guy Bak? A bloody refugee leeching off the British gahmen, but welcome the bombings against the British.<br><br><strong>Bakri The Bid</strong><br>GIVEN that insurance doesn't usually cover force majeure, it's unlikely anyone who bought a ticket to hear Yusuf al-Qaradawi speak in Manchester this August will be able to get their money back.<br><br>As the Express says in its front-page news ("BANNED"), the paper's "crusade" has deterred the Egyptian-born Muslim cleric from speaking in the UK.<br><br>It can be no mere coincidence that just 24 hours after the Express "demanded" that Qaradawi be barred entry to the UK he has decided not to appear.<br><br>But the paper could not have done it alone, and appreciates the 95 per cent of its readers who called for Qaradawi to be banned in the paper's opinion-forming poll.<br><br>The reason why most papers only publish the result in percentages is because it would be too embarrassing to admit that only a handful of people actually bothered to phone in. But this is a vital issue - one in which the Express's crusade has seen off the jihad - and we hear that callers "flooded" the paper's phone lines.<br><br>Buoyed by that success, the paper produces another poll today: "Is Blair doing enough to halt Muslim fanatics?"<br><br>Such questions are usually more loaded than a 21-year-old George W Bush at a frat party, but we spot room for some confusion given that Blair is the surname of our beloved leader and of the Metropolitan Police Commissioner Ian Blair.<br><br>Of course, neither of them is doing enough. So the Sun has pulled on its chain mail and joined the fight. Splashed over its cover page is a picture of the unlovely mad mullah, the "Muslim fanatic" Omar Bakri Mohammed and the cry: "SEND HIM BAK."<br><br>The Sun is angry that the "poisonous cleric" has spouted the opinion that we Britons are all to blame for the terrorist atrocity in London.<br><br>But before you hand yourself over to the authorities, take a look at Bakri's words. "I blame the British government," says the Syrian-born polemicist, "and I blame the British people."<br><br>Thanks to various human rights acts Bakri is entitled to give full throat to his odious opinions - and thanks to the British system he's also entitled to ?00-a-week income support and to have the rent on his London home subsidised.<br><br>The Sun also thinks it's important for us to know that Bakri's house is worth ?00,000 - although how its price has been affected by the recent bombs perhaps the Mail can work out. He has his council tax paid and drives a Ford Galaxy on which he pays no insurance, gets free specs and NHS prescriptions.<br><br>Quite right that Tory MP Julian Brazier tells the Mail ("CLERIC: BOMBS ARE OUR FAULT!"): "He's abused our hospitality in the most outrageous fashion. He should be put on a plane."<br><br>Clearly, Bakri is a malevolent and contemptible presence, however the big worry is not that he voices his offensive opinions but that anyone listens to such vitriol and pays it any credence. But, sadly, as recent events have shown, some do...<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm..much food for thought.<br><br>The interesting(and scary to some) thing is that whatever country that muslims are migrating to and settling down in will eventually have a sizable muslim population which may even become the majority, due to their breeding patterns (they're doing it non-stop like rabbits). This during a time when birth rates are generally falling. The demographics in these countries, including Singapore are going to look very interesting after  a few generations.  I sometimes wonder if that is why our gahmen are trying to artificially increase the number of chinese in singapore by letting any tom dick and harry in and offering them citizenship like free gifts.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>An interesting point of note that Sookhdeo has not properly elucidated is that Islam does not actually have a formal comand and control system.  The Catholics have their Pope, the Buddhists have their Dalai Lama, but Islam does not have an Imam who would be the final authority on what's what.<br><br>So what is the implication of this fact?  Sir Gerald Templer, High Commissioner in Malaya at the time of the Emergency, said that the solution to the problem "lies not in pouring more British troops into the jungle but in the hearts and minds of the Malayan people".  It's a lot more difficult to win the hearts and minds of Muslim people if you do not have any one person or body that they would listen to - they can either choose to listen to a moderate Imam, or they can choose to buy into the rantings of a radical Imam, since both hold equal standing within the structure of Islam.<br><br>As Sookhdeo noted, the imperative is to turn the whole world to Islam.  Any alternative system would be viewed by these radicals as an attempt to Levi's, McDonalds's and Hollywood good Quran-following Muslims to death.<br><br>On the other hand, the individualistic structure of Islam is a double-edged sword.  If Islam is open to interpretation with no checks and measures presented by a central authority, what's to say that we can't convince non-radical muslims to take the moderate path?<br><br>Along those lines, this approach may have to apply at different levels.<br><br>At the aggressive end, radicals tend to take part in terrorist activities upon the promise of the glory of martyrdom.  In the current American approach to nabbing these terrorists, they're delivering such martyrdon in crowing whenever they catch one terrorist.  The more effective solution would be to make the little bastards simply disappear.  How can the radical Imams proclaim someone as a martyr when the poor sod could well have been run over by a pork-laden garbage truck and stuck into the mortuary as a Mohammad Doe?<br><br>On the softer end of the spectrum, persuasion could be used.  For example, according to the 9/11 commission report, the attacks were funded through hawalas, because OBL's funds were frozen.  The question is, how many of these hawaladars were actually conscious of the fact that their activities were being used to fund the attacks?  I would wager that the vast majority of them would have carried out the transaction on the good faith that a labourer was simply using the cheapest and surest means of remitting money to his wife and eight kids.  What if Western banks could offer a viable alternative to put hawaladas out of business?  After all, the banks make the majority of their profit from loans interest and investments, rather than surcharges levied on individual customers.<br><br>I disagree with Sookhdeo's assertion that there is no such thing as moderate Islam.  The nature of the religion is so decentralised that no interpretation of Islam can be ruled out as a myth.  We need to take advantage of that decentralised system and use that clever invention called marketing to best support the message of the moderate Imams and make the moderate path most palatable to the followers of the religion on an individual basis, which is exactly what the religion operates on in the first place.</div>
