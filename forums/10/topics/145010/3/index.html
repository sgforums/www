            <div class='col-md body'>So the author of the article appears to have read the Koran and is to the view that he is saying, "The extremists are a relatively honest bunch who are merely passing the bigoted Koran unadulterated to the Muslim masses." The assertion is that the Koran is the source of their doings and the terrorists are relatively innocent, the by-products. Muslims have knowledge of this bigoted Koran and just somehow developed this ability to ignore human values and become life-size fart bombs. Meh. I'm pretty miffed he has painted the situation that way.<br><br>I don't agree with everything that was said there, but I certainly agree with much of it, and much has already been said. It is what it is and I lack any capability to explain more, unlike what Gendaken has done.  However, I still maintain that the prevailing fanatic idealogy is a misrepresentation of Islam that arises partly from the literal intepretation of the Koran as the absolute word of God and that doesnt mean I'm absolving Islam of its faults and troubles. For the literalist, Islam seems to invoke a lot of violence and wrongdoing. As a Muslim myself, there are verses in the Koran that I feel very uncomfortable with. But literalism shouldnt be placed much emphasis in the first place. The Holy Books were meant to be thought about. The lady saint Rabia used to cross out verses from her Koran which she didn't agree with because "her God" could not have said those things.<br><br>I am also for the religious reformation and actual education for the indoctrinated community. The activity of understanding the Koran according to the context in which they originated, etc etc (except some in the article) - actually, has been the practice of Sgrean Muslims all along as far as I know.<br><br>That is how an Sgrean Muslim reconciles, lwflee? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised"><br><br>--------------------<br><br>I hope now to address some issues concerning Islam's tenets put forward by the article that are the two main causes for extremism. The rule of abrogation and the dividence of the world into two parts, Dar al-Islam (abode of Islam) and Dar al-Harb (abode of war) .<br><br><strong>1. Rule of abrogation.</strong><br>The concept was invented as a result of a poor understanding of the Koran. It has been negated far long ago. The scholars base their claim on a corrupted translation and intepretation of the verse, which is below.<br><br>"Whichever revelations We abrogated or cause to be forgotten, We substitute something better or similar: Knowest thou not that God is capable of all things?" 2:106<br><br>This is the abrogation verse which is from a chapter in continuation on the topic of past prophets and their Holy Books, for example the Torah, Psalms and the Gospels. Here its stated that God substitutes them with something better or similar, indicating the Koran. <span style="font-style: italic;">It wasnt about the verses within it.</span> Therefore, the earlier peace verses arent abrogated and still are very much upheld. And still on the past Holy Books, they must be honored as ever, for in another later passage, "Why do they ask you to judge among them, when they have the Torah, containing God's law, and they chose to disregard it? They are not people of Faith." | "Subsequent to them, we sent Jesus, the son of Mary, confirming the previous scripture, the Torah. We gave him the Gospel, containing guidance and light, and confirming the previous scriptures, the Torah, and augmenting its guidance and light, and to enlighten the righteous." | "The people of the Gospel shall rule in accordance with God's revelations therein. Those who do not rule in accordance with God's revelations they are the wicked."<br><br>That is as far as I understand.<br><br><strong>2. Dar al-Islam and Dar al-Harb</strong><br>There is no mention of this concept in either the Koran or Sunnah. They were products of the Jurispundence (called Fiqh) in the middle ages when the Islamic state expanded and faced several issues about their concise borders which were often very bloody. More definitions were coined, Dar al-Â‘Amn (abode of security), Dar al-Sulh (abode of treaty), etc. This classical theory bears the stamp of those times, and it was never universally accepted even then, for not only it sounds imperial in tone and triumphalist in vision, the assuming of an eternal conflict between them are morally problematical and politically untenable. It has been made long defunct too by the successive jurists and scholars, for circumstances and structure of life has changed.<br><br>That is as far as I understand again.<br>Old and obsolete components of history are being propogated and sealed back into the religion. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, Atobe, the situation becomes really tricky when there's no single acknowledged leader.<br><br>Now maybe Gauze can correct me on this, but I understand that the overall body of Islamic followers is known as the ummah, and from the year 632 till 1924 the Caliph was the acknowledged leader of the ummah.  However, the Caliphate ceased to exist with the fall of the Ottoman Empire, and since then leadership within Islam has taken place at national, if not grassroots, level.<br><br>On a national level, the islamic leader is the Mufti or Grand Mufti, and one rank down in the hierarchy is the Imam, who leads a mosque.<br><br>However, the structure is flexible is that in the absence of an Imam, religious services can be conducted by any member of the congregation who is knowledgable in the ways of Islam.<br><br>Because of this structure, some issues may arise when you consider the direction that the ummah takes.  While it takes a Mufti to issue a fatwa (Islamic legal pronouncement), the fatwas issued by different Muftis can contradict each other.<br><br>Of course, some people also abuse the flexibility of the system.  Osama bin Laden, despite not being a Mufti, has taken it upon himself to issue fatwas.  This is in itself not a problem except that a misguided few have actually taken his fatwa seriously.<br><br>In turn, the Spanish Mufti issued a fatwa against OBL, but I believe (can't remember where I read it) that some new developments following the London bombings may in fact invalidate the Spanish fatwa.<br><br>The above illustrates the issues involved in attempting to win the hearts and minds of the ummah.  While the ummah is a concept of a unitary entity, and while the only satisfactory conclusion to the current problems is for peace to be made between the ummah and the rest of the world, one would have to question if the concept of unnah can be treated as a practical reality that concrete actions can be based upon.<br><br>The alternative, as you pointed out, is to decide on courses of action on a case-by-case basis, but that approach has its own problems.  After all, what's to say that if you take a hard line with one community, you won't offend the members of a community that you have already reached out to and made peace with?<br><br>Rather than a game of pick-up sticks, this job's as tough as building a platform out of those sticks standing on their ends - move one stick wrongly and the whole lot could come crashing down.</div>

If the community of Islam is "leaderless", how does that allow "ONE Person or a Group of Persons, to dominate over others"? This "leaderless" approach allows the Muslims the choice to follow the path of Islam they think is right, which of course leads to other types of problems.<br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Atobe:</div><div class="quote_body">It is in the environment of ignorance, superstition, self-doubts, weakness, and confusion that allow Religion to thrive, and which allow opportunistic MEN to seize a potent vehicle as a short cut to POWER.<br><br>This is the type of situations that more sophisticated Men and Communities are afraid of, where entire society can be put into imbalance by opportunistic men, who can seize power by capitalizing on human deficiencies.<br><br>The only way to eradicate such threats to this world is through the spread of global education, political, social and economic development, with the full participation from every political entity on this globe.<br></div></blockquote>So sophisticated men don't believe in religion? There are countless of examples proving otherwise.  You are however right in that what is needed is education, more specifically the ability to think critically. The reason why the extremists follow Osama is because they abdicate their right to think critically and too readily accept Osama's word. The problem is therefore not the religion itself but is within us humans. The question then arises on whether religion impedes on our ability to think critically. I do believe that it depends hugely on how it is taught.<br><br>Religion is akin to technology; just because it it can be abused, doesn't mean that it shouldn't be used at all.

The problem is therefore not the religion itself but is within us humans. The question then arises on whether religion impedes on our ability to think critically.
