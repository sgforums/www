Net profit was S$7.4 billion (US$4.4 billion) on revenues of S$56.5 billion for the financial year closing on March 2004. Its 2003 profit was S$241 million on revenues of S$49.65 billion in the previous financial year, while its 2002 profit was S$4.92 billion on revenues of S$42.56 billion.<br>The 2004 report states that Temasek manages S$90 billion in assets.

The move comes after Mahindra &amp; Mahindra and Ford Motor ended their partnership in India by selling their cross-holdings.<br>Vietnam's Pacific Airlines will sell a 30% stake to Temasek Holdings Pte. in the second half of 2005. A Ministry of Finance official said Pacific Airlines is now valued at $167 million, and Temasek will invest $50 million to acquire the 30% stake.

NIB is Temasek's sole investment in Pakistan, whose economy grew by 8.35% in the last fiscal year ending June 30; the fastest growth rate in 20 years. In a statement, Temasek said it is grateful to NIB shareholders for giving it the "opportunity to take a majority stake in the bank, and for their confidence in allowing us to work with the board and management to fulfill our common vision of building NIB into a leading bank in Pakistan." Temasek is hopeful about the growth prospects of Pakistan, particularly the financial sector and believes that NIB is well positioned to capitalize on this growth, it said. It was first revealed in January that Temasek had bought a 25% stake in NIB, a small commercial bank, through Bugis Investments, a wholly owned subsidiary of Asia Financial Holdings, or AFH. On June 30, AFH was allotted fresh shares by NIB's board of directors, raising Bugis' ownership of NIB from 25% to 72.6%, Temasek said. AFH is a wholly owned unit of Temasek Holdings.

While some of the interested parties had put in their bids for the $100 million private placement, others were holding talks with Air Sahara for picking a higher stake.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmmm... whatever monies put into GC better make strategic sense.  I think we have 2 board seats in GC but not too sure if these guys can make any difference to the way we will use the GC assets.  The 2 guys background seems to be from the accounting.  So I guess they were put there to make sure that the no creative accounting hanky-panky takes place.  After the right the wrongs, the next thing is probably put 2 guys from the Telco and Defence to decide what to do with the strategic assets.</div>

Thaksin has been a schemer and has exploited our leaders' pride and we are now paying a heavy price with Thaksin having taken out all the profits through tax-free contraptions which our scholars have failed to spot out in the investment evaluations.
