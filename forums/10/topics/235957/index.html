            <div class='col-md body'><br>DISPLAYING ABSTRACT - Financial relationship between group of Singapore investors and two Global Crossing directors became more extensive in days after Global Crossing filed for bankruptcy protection; relationship of directors with Singapore investors, whose full scope has not been disclosed, is significant because investors have links to Singapore Technologies Telemedia, which has made offer to buy Global Crossing; Global Crossing delays reporting its full financial results because it says its auditor Arthur Andersen has not concluded its audit for 2001; says it expects to report significant loss for quarter, including write-downs of about $8 billion to reflect drop in value of some assets; Global Crossing's chairman Gary Winnick and another director Steven J Green became part owners of last fall in Singapore investment firm KI Ventures Ltd; KI Ventures is ultimately controlled by Singapore's Temasek Holdings, which also controls Singapore Technologies; Winnick, who has resigned from KI's board, and Green say their involvement with KI Ventures was not related to effort to buy Global Crossing; closer look indicates that Winnick and Green's involvement with Singapore investors deepened after bankruptcy protection filing on Jan 28; KI Ventures on Feb 7 said it paid $14.2 million for minority stake in American wireless company; announcement did not mention that wireless company, PrimeCo Personal Communications, is partly owned by Winnick's investment firm, Pacific Capital Group<br><br><a href="http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10717FB3F550C748EDDAB0894DA404482&amp;n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fPeople%2fW%2fWinnick%2c%20Gary" rel="nofollow">http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10717FB3F550C748EDDAB0894DA404482&amp;n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fPeople%2fW%2fWinnick%2c%20Gary</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Indeed, GC wasl a loss-making firm and many companies who buy telco services from GC are still questioning whether it has completely recovered from Chp 11.  I hv not researched enough into GC to come to a conclusion whether they are still in the red.  But I do understand that STT bought GC becos of its large undersea cables inventory.  It may be a strategic reason to acquire control of the cables so that S'pore may exercise some control on the communications around the world in the future.  So the senior people in STT may have considered that the price they paid for is a bargain for the strategic reason.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Seems that there were alot of improprieties with the company's operations, there are quite a few legal actions against Global Crossings.<br><br>The alleged charges includes:<br><br>1) The complaint alleges five causes of action: (1) breach of federal tariffs; (2) breach of state tariffs; (3) unjust enrichment (in the alternative to the tariff claims); (4) fraud; and (5) civil conspiracy.<br><br>2) Following the CompanyÂ’s April 27, 2004 announcement that the Company expected to restate certain of its consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2003, eight separate class action lawsuits all purporting to be brought on behalf of Company shareholders were commenced against the Company and certain of its officers and directors in the U.S. District Courts in New Jersey, New York and California...................On February 18, 2005, lead plaintiffs filed an amended consolidated class action complaint against the Company and two of its past and present officers.<br><br>3) A claim was filed in the CompanyÂ’s bankruptcy proceedings by the U.S. Department of Commerce (the Â“Commerce DepartmentÂ”) on October 30, 2002 asserting that an undersea cable owned by Pacific Crossing Limited (Â“PCLÂ”), a former subsidiary of the Company, violates the terms of a Special Use permit issued by theNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration..................An identical claim that had been filed in the bankruptcy proceedings of PCL was settled in principle in September 2005 and was subsequently approved by the court as part of the PCL plan of reorganization confirmed in an order dated<br>November 10, 2005............................In August 2003, the OFT extended its investigation in respect of allegations of price fixing and information sharing on the level of fees that the subsea entities would pay landowners for permission to land submarine telecommunication cables on their land in the U.K................ In a decision dated October 19, 2004, the Court of Appeals reversed the approval of the settlement and lifted the injunction. The case has been remanded to the District Court for further proceedings.<br><br>4) In May 2001, a purported class action was commenced against three of the CompanyÂ’s subsidiaries in theU.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois. The complaint alleges that the Company had no right to install a fiber-optic cable in rights-of-way granted by the plaintiffs to certain railroads.<br><br>5) A tax authority in South America has concluded a preliminary audit of the CompanyÂ’s books and records for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 and has made certain initial findings adverse to the Company including the following: failure to disclose discounts on certain goods imported into the country, failure to include the value of software installed on certain computer equipment, and clerical errors in filed import documents.<br><br>Wonder if it's a wise decision to acquire the company in the first place.<br><br>Goes to show, when your plumbing is choked, you don't look for a doctorate in economics to fix the choke.<br></div>

In a decision dated October 19, 2004, the Court of Appeals reversed the approval of the settlement and lifted the injunction. The case has been remanded to the District Court for further proceedings.<br><br>4) In May 2001, a purported class action was commenced against three of the CompanyÂ’s subsidiaries in theU.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois.
