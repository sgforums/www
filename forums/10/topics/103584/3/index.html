If a rape victim can't produce 4 male witnesses, that's the penalty she pays.</div></blockquote>Argh.. careful when you post something about other's religion?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> Though i admit, there is a lack of understanding of Islamic law everywhere, including in the community itself. The verdict passed to both breaking fast deliberately and producing 4 male witnesses for rape is very wrong, according to Islamic rulings. How that punisment in the news is called for, is definitely crazy.<br><br>Breaking fast is a personal thing between the practitioner and his creator, something the state or governing authority does not have the right to deal into because as mentioned, its a private affair. Who knows, that person might be in a state of illness, giving him the legality to quit fasting.<br><br>The proper penalty for it is to make it up for a day after Hari Raya. Or to feed some poor people an average of one meal each.<br><br>Next, rape.  The misconception is that a woman has to produce 4 witnesses to prove her claim of rape. The need for the 4 witnesses is not to prove rape but to prove adultery. Rape in Islamic law of evidence can be proven using DNA testing, medical records, witnesses and even circumstantial evidence. This is because Islam understands that the women is potentially a victim and will not impose unnecessary hardship to prove her case. Whereas someone who wants to be a morality police and look into the affairs of others would have to give a high burden of proof to prove adultery (4 male witnesses), especially coz that has serious repercussions on the accused.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The best religion is to have no religion... If really forced to have a religion, choose one which have the least number of rules and maintainence and can give u the idea tat they can help u even in times of need.<br><br>If u ask me... there is a lot of cosmetic rules for some religion... There is no real explanation for banning or doing it but they just do it because it is written as such. An example is from the muslim scripture, eating pork is not allowed because it is dirty... however from the viewpoint of common people, there is nothing wrong with eating pork. Chinese and european had eaten pork all their lives and in the past and they r still healthy and well. Why do they ban it is just because it is written as such... I am not going to start a religious debate because I had no time but just hope tat people will at least think through some of their rulings and see if there is any sense in following it rather than just blindly following it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Okay... sorry, this is gonna be quite long. @____@.<br><br>Why people choose their own religion, each has their own reason. Those restrictions you speak of in Islam, to the praticising muslims, they are not means to constraint you, they are guidelines to social conduct. Something to lead us in maintaining a decent character, health and outlook. We don't follow it blindly, we are aware on most of the reasons why. Anyway, Islam recognizes your needs as a human being and does not set impossible ascetic moral ideals for you.<br><br>In anything, there will be some things that are Â‘dislikedÂ’ by some. Some things will seem harsher than others, but as for me, it is a very fine way of life. Ok, enough.<br><br>Now, pork. Many Far Eastern traditions also discourage the eating of pork. The 3,000 year old Confucian Book of Rites says, "A gentleman does not eat the flesh of pigs and dogs." Although many Chinese are avid eaters of pork today, physicians of ancient China recognized pork-eating as the root of many human ailments. Buddhists, Jains and Hindus usually avoid eating any kind of meat.<br><br>The Qur'an clearly prohibits pork, and informs us of its uncleanness. As believers, we believe and affirm, that the pig is unclean. It is possible that this includes the presence of harmful microbes, but this does not rule a spiritual uncleanness, such that even if one hypothetically postulates a pork free of all microbes, that would not justify making it permissible. God's knowledge is greater and deeper than ours, whereas science is changing -- new discoveries are made, old theories are abandoned. Hence, even if we cannot discover the wisdom behind a particular divine injunction, this does not exempt us from following it. Like when you fall sick, you go to a doctor who prescribes certain medicines and tells you to eat some special diet and that you should refrain from eating certain food. You usually do not argue or or even doubt the judgement of that specialist, dun you? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>----<br>"They question thee about strong drink and games of chance. Say: In both is great harm and utility for men; but the harm of them is greater than their usefulness."<br><br>"He has only forbidden you dead meat, and blood, and the flesh of swine, and any (food) over which the name of other than Allah has been invoked. But if one is forced by necessity, without willful disobedience, nor transgressing due limits, then Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful."<br>----<br><br>In my opinion, the reason for this is the greater potential threat. Take a holistic view of the all 4 articles I present below about the harmful effects of pork, perhaps you will understand.<br><br>Phew so tiring reasearching all these again. @__@.<br><br><strong>Article 1.</strong><br>http://www.biblicalresearchinstitute.com/freedom/give_babe_a_miss.html .Although this is a Christian website, it has an extensive research on pork. Please do read this site if u are sincerely interested. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>And, of course, the old argument surfaces at this juncture: "What about Australian pig farming conditions? Are we not more advanced in the 'science' of pig-culture? We take care of the pig's diet for it! They get fed with a special diet of hormones and rich grains, not just slops and recycled garbage! Surely this makes a huge difference?"<br><br><strong>Article 2</strong><br>Source: Madele, John. World Health. March 1984 p10(3), WHO.<br><br>..............Yet very few of the patients had any history of epilepsy. Their epilepsy had been caused by a disease of the nervous system called cysticercosis, which is common in many developing countries. In other parts of south-east Asia, in central and southern Africa and in Latin America the disease is also a scourge--"one of the major causes of death in certain countries", says Dr Z. Pawlowski of WHO's Parasitic Diseases Programme. Not long ago, at the end of the 19th century, it was a very common disease in central Europe as well.<br><br>Cysticercosis is particularly prevalent in countries where people live in insanitary conditions and in close proximity to pigs. In non-pork-eating Muslim countries it is almost nonexistent.<br><br><strong>Article 3</strong><br>Source: Medical Update. March 1994 v17 n9 p5(1). Benjamin Franklin Literary &amp; Medical Society, Inc.<br><br>The National Pork Producers Council has long touted pork as "the other white meat"--referring, of course, to chicken and turkey. Their latest claim? "A boneless pork loin chop is lower in fat, calories, and cholesterol than the same size chicken thigh."<br><br>Fewer calories? Five, more or less. Less fat and cholesterol? The chances are that you're not going to trim that chop with the surgical precision of the technicians at the NPPC lab--which means that you'll probably end up with more fat than in the chicken thigh.<br><br>According to the Nutrition Action Health Letter, the average cut of trimmed pork has about 25 percent more fat than the average piece of skinned chicken--and those fatty spareribs are not included in the average.<br><br><strong>Article 4</strong><br>http://www.alternet.org/story/9263<br>Source: Gillette, Becky Â‘Pork Production Is Linked to the Risk of Flu Epidemics and InfectionsÂ’ May 2000 v11 i3 p40. Earth Action Network, Inc.<br>Bacon in the morning may still smell great, but eating pork raises concerns about more than just the impact of all that fat and cholesterol on your arteries. Recent research indicates the "other white meat" is a passageway for a number of serious illnesses, which can jump from animals to human hosts. And the intensive, factory farm conditions by which most pigs are raised increases the risk and acts as an incubator for bacteria. There's also proof, for the first time, that using antibiotics to treat pigs can lead to outbreaks of dangerous human diseases like salmonella.<br><br>..............<br><br>Considering the clear links to an influenza pandemic, antibiotic-resistant bacteria, adverse health impacts to minority populations, and widespread environmental damage from effluent waste, the cost of morning bacon is mounting steadily.<br><br>LASTLY..........<br>Every creature was created by God for a purpose. The Prophet always encouraged being kind to animals. Although we should not eat the meat of the pig, it doesn't mean that we should hate pigs. We should show them the same kindness as any other animal, and not abuse or torture them. Pigs score high on tests devised to determine animal intelligence; in other words, they are very smart. It used to be that Europe people believed that pork would taste better if the pigs were kept in a state of filth, but this is not the natural inclination of the pig. When left to their own devices, it is said that pigs do not like to soil their sleeping quarters. As for their tendency to wallow in mud, that is done mainly to keep cool.<br><br>Feel free to question more about Islam without any prejudement please. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

Some things will seem harsher than others, but as for me, it is a very fine way of life. Ok, enough.<br><br>Now, pork. Many Far Eastern traditions also discourage the eating of pork. The 3,000 year old Confucian Book of Rites says, "A gentleman does not eat the flesh of pigs and dogs." Although many Chinese are avid eaters of pork today, physicians of ancient China recognized pork-eating as the root of many human ailments. Buddhists, Jains and Hindus usually avoid eating any kind of meat.<br><br>The Qur'an clearly prohibits pork, and informs us of its uncleanness. As believers, we believe and affirm, that the pig is unclean. It is possible that this includes the presence of harmful microbes, but this does not rule a spiritual uncleanness, such that even if one hypothetically postulates a pork free of all microbes, that would not justify making it permissible. God's knowledge is greater and deeper than ours, whereas science is changing -- new discoveries are made, old theories are abandoned. Hence, even if we cannot discover the wisdom behind a particular divine injunction, this does not exempt us from following it. Like when you fall sick, you go to a doctor who prescribes certain medicines and tells you to eat some special diet and that you should refrain from eating certain food. You usually do not argue or or even doubt the judgement of that specialist, dun you? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>----<br>"They question thee about strong drink and games of chance.

But if one is forced by necessity, without willful disobedience, nor transgressing due limits, then Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful."<br>----<br><br>In my opinion, the reason for this is the greater potential threat. Take a holistic view of the all 4 articles I present below about the harmful effects of pork, perhaps you will understand.<br><br>Phew so tiring reasearching all these again. @__@.<br><br>[b]Article 1.</strong><br>http://www.biblicalresearchinstitute.com/freedom/give_babe_a_miss.html .Although this is a Christian website, it has an extensive research on pork.

Their epilepsy had been caused by a disease of the nervous system called cysticercosis, which is common in many developing countries.

Earth Action Network, Inc.<br>Bacon in the morning may still smell great, but eating pork raises concerns about more than just the impact of all that fat and cholesterol on your arteries. Recent research indicates the "other white meat" is a passageway for a number of serious illnesses, which can jump from animals to human hosts. And the intensive, factory farm conditions by which most pigs are raised increases the risk and acts as an incubator for bacteria. There's also proof, for the first time, that using antibiotics to treat pigs can lead to outbreaks of dangerous human diseases like salmonella.<br><br>..............<br><br>Considering the clear links to an influenza pandemic, antibiotic-resistant bacteria, adverse health impacts to minority populations, and widespread environmental damage from effluent waste, the cost of morning bacon is mounting steadily.<br><br>LASTLY..........<br>Every creature was created by God for a purpose. The Prophet always encouraged being kind to animals. Although we should not eat the meat of the pig, it doesn't mean that we should hate pigs. We should show them the same kindness as any other animal, and not abuse or torture them. Pigs score high on tests devised to determine animal intelligence; in other words, they are very smart. It used to be that Europe people believed that pork would taste better if the pigs were kept in a state of filth, but this is not the natural inclination of the pig. When left to their own devices, it is said that pigs do not like to soil their sleeping quarters. As for their tendency to wallow in mud, that is done mainly to keep cool.<br><br>Feel free to question more about Islam without any prejudement please. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">[/b]</blockquote>so... whats the summary  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hello again. Thank you for your challenging comments. I will try my best to reply well enough for my religion to be understood more by the readers.<br><br><blockquote>If they r just outline of social conducts, why go to the point of bashing them with a cane ?</blockquote>Firstly, Islam isnt just a religion, it is a full way of life. It covers aspects of social, economic, political and so forth.<br><br>Isnt caning a punishment in our society too? Well, you probably have read or heard of the harsh sentences decreed upon muslims in the middle east and elsewhere. These are misrepresentations of the Qu'ran, but it is understandable why some would perceive Islam as being brutal. Those are one of many cases in the Muslim world, where Shari'ah (Islamic Law) is praticed primitively. They include <span style="font-style: italic;">cultural practices</span> that exists in Arab (which has also seeped their way here) and some Muslim societies. They may not necessarily reflect the teachings of the Qu`ran and <span style="font-style: italic;">often are in stark contradiction to the Shari'ah.</span> Like you know, overdoing things like stoning, lashing, death bla bla.<br><br><blockquote><br>They had set too much rules detailing to too much things. They prefer u to keep a beard, they want u to wear tudung, muslim cannot eat pork, canot drink, they have to circumscise, pray 5 times a day etc. It is just too much rules on things tat have no real importance to the religion at all. U can go around saying tat circumcising is good for health or blowjob but then again, it should not be fixed but as an option where the people can choose for themselves.</blockquote>Too much rules.... arent the praticing muslims so fine with it? It may seem stern to you, but it goes along well with our daily lives. You cannot say those rules have no importance to the religion, they are all part of it, as i've mentioned, Islam covers almost everything in ur life.<br><br>Beard - Growing beards was encouraged by the Prophet, mainly for the reason that he wanted Muslims to look different from the non-Muslims of his time to build a sense of community of believers that was needed at that phase of history. Now of coz no need.<br><br>Tudung - Part of the hijab, to cover herself herself except for the face and hands (palm). Yes, we are all asked to dress modestly with clean clothes as it is part of the faith. If one woman has the right to wear a bikini *whistles* in public, why doesnt another have the right to cover herself in public? Why is it looked upon oppression if she chooses to be modest?<br><br>Eating pork and alcohol - I've explained in my previous post. In my opinion it is basically because of the greater harm than good.<br><br>Circumcision - This one i dunno much. My parents says its cleaner and easier to clean my pee pee after pee-ing. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> All the grown adults don't have a problem with it nor regretted, even converts who did it. Also, more guys go for it as far as i know.<br><br>Praying five times a day - There are many wisdom behind this. I shall not put it here because it'll make the post much much longer. Its about not forgetting God, being closer to him, a reminder that he is always watching, it is a kind of meditation to take a break from the stresses of life, and so on. Besides, it only takes an average of five mins each, what is so hard? Cant even spare that with twenty four hours one lives through? And if praying clashes with work/school life, when it is utterly important for you to attend to them, you can forgo praying as necessary.<br><br><blockquote>Pork is as clean as mutton........... surely u should start looking at statistic.</blockquote>I feel you are expounding on a tiny matter. Whats the big deal about not eating pork?<br><br>When Islam forbids something, ill repeat, im my opinion, it is because that causes greater harm than good both at a personal and social level. Gambling, alcohol, surely you have heard of souls broken at those vice's mercy. Now lets take forbidding pork into the context of the sentence it was derived.<br><br>"He has only forbidden you dead meat, and blood, and the flesh of swine, and any (food) over which the name of other than Allah has been invoked. But if one is forced by necessity, without willful disobedience, nor transgressing due limits, then Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful."<br><br>Dead meat - Carcasses of animals, obviously they are not fresh, inheriting germs from its rotting process.<br>Blood - Animal blood, possible carriers of viruses, diseases etc.<br>Piggies - I have explained myself in the previous post.<br><br>So there, thats all. Arent there much much more varieties of food to eat? Cows, sheeps, goats, duckies, fishes, chickens, naughty little children. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br><blockquote>Pork is as clean as mutton. They r all bred in the same conditions under farms etc.</blockquote>I expected this statement. Therefore, i had explicitly given you an article addressing to that in my post above.

I only put forth those scientific sources for you to read. It is the result of them studying the problem throughout the years. Mainly, those articles wrote that pigs are more prevalent to diseases, and where they are bred, diseases come near. I've told you to take a holistic view on this point, meaning, to see the overall analysis.</div>

We drop by the doctors. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br><blockquote>whahaa stupidissmart is tryign to compete with seed see whus essay longer... wah seed u veyr easily offended lei... jus comments... y get so worked up... oh so tats ur religion... no ones is offending ur religion.. everyone jus voicing out theri point of views.... so easily offended for wad.... leave u alone? if everyword ppl say here twitch ur nerves so much, i suggest u better dun carry on reading... im afraid this might led to cramps and muscle aches everywhere on u.. lac la bro...<br>sgForums<br>singapore's online DISCUSSION network!! hahaha peace~</blockquote>Ok lah, sorry lah.

            <div class='col-md body'>is this an argument about pork? sheesh. get with the topic la ok?<br><br>truthfully, although most muslims will credit the health reasons for them not eating pork. thats not the main reason la.. first thing that comes to their mind is it is unclean spiritually. the health reasons are "by the way" reasons.<br><br>which reminds me. i had this friend, retarded, during primary school, he brought alot of bbq pork to sch to share with his friends. kids are so young, so innocent. so his malay friends asked what was that.<br><br>my friend said it was something delicious, and invited them to try, being a nice fella. so his malay friends happily helped themselves with the bbq pork, and enjoyed themselves very much. said it was really tasty, but never tasted this flavour before. so they asked what is it.<br><br>being so innocent. he was chiding them, "you never eat this before?! its pork!"<br><br>they all stared at him and rushed to the toilet to throw up.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
