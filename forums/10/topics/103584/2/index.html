            <div class='col-md body'>It's more of a cultural thing than a religious thing.What is happening now is that world has progressed on without them, and their cultural and social mores still lie in the 8t or 9th century.We cannot stand such acts because we have a more liberated and empathic mind, which they lack.And any attempt to bring them into the modern world is viewed with suspicion by people who believe that any form of social progress is evil and must be stopped at all cost.Why?Because they have interpreted their religion in a twisted way to allow for a religious backing for the things they do, most of which may not be palatable to God.<br><br>I believe the free world will win this conflict,The world will move on and change more.I once read a novel, containing a phrase, "Let the Arabs do what they please, when the rest of humankind has colonies on the moon and Mars, they can have the whole bloody Earth to themselves..." Something to that sort.I'm not against all Arabs, just the ignorant ones who think they can impose their way on the world which has already turned their backs on them and is getting on with their life.<br><br>The day we fully exploit hydrogen as our most common form of energy is the day the Middle East will wake up from their hubris.Is there a conspiracy between the gulf states and the parties who owe their funding and wealth to them?I annot be sure, but you just have to take a look at Halliburton and Zapata Oil, formerly GWB's, to find out.</div>
