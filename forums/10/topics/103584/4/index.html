            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Firstly, Islam isnt just a religion, it is a full way of life. It covers aspects of social, economic, political and so forth.<br><br>Isnt caning a punishment in our society too? Well, you probably have read or heard of the harsh sentences decreed upon muslims in the middle east and elsewhere. These are misrepresentations of the Qu'ran, but it is understandable why some would perceive Islam as being brutal. Those are one of many cases in the Muslim world, where Shari'ah (Islamic Law) is praticed primitively. They include cultural practices that exists in Arab (which has also seeped their way here) and some Muslim societies. They may not necessarily reflect the teachings of the Qu`ran and often are in stark contradiction to the Shari'ah. Like you know, overdoing things like stoning, lashing, death bla bla. </blockquote>Do u know tat overdoing things such as stoning, lashing or death is really written in the quran ? They do state tat for certain actions they require these certain punishment<br><br><blockquote>Too much rules.... arent the praticing muslims so fine with it? It may seem stern to you, but it goes along well with our daily lives. You cannot say those rules have no importance to the religion, they are all part of it, as i've mentioned, Islam covers almost everything in ur life. </blockquote>The thing is, they should be given a choice in the first place. Not all those who drink become alcoholic. Not all those who eat pork will die of dieseases. I don't want to write too much but doesn't god give u free will for a reason ?<br><br><blockquote>"He has only forbidden you dead meat, and blood, and the flesh of swine, and any (food) over which the name of other than Allah has been invoked. But if one is forced by necessity, without willful disobedience, nor transgressing due limits, then Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful." </blockquote>In short, I am right about the matter such tat muslim follows the rule of not eating pork just because it is written as such. There is really no scientific evidence tat point to the fact tat pork is deadly or unclean.<br><br><blockquote>I expected this statement. Therefore, i had explicitly given you an article addressing to that in my post above. The website goes deeper and deeper into the effects of pork, giving several sources too. It also touches on many of piggies breeding, eating, and its make up. </blockquote>I had read the things and I had posted a short reply to it.<br><br><blockquote>Hmm, i cannot reason anymore. I am not well wersed in this issue. You say i am assuming things, where was i? I only put forth those scientific sources for you to read. It is the result of them studying the problem throughout the years. Mainly, those articles wrote that pigs are more prevalent to diseases, and where they are bred, diseases come near. I've told you to take a holistic view on this point, meaning, to see the overall analysis.</blockquote><span style="font-style: italic;">Yet very few of the patients had any history of epilepsy. Their epilepsy had been caused by a disease of the nervous system called cysticercosis, which is common in many developing countries. In other parts of south-east Asia, in central and southern Africa and in Latin America the disease is also a scourge--"one of the major causes of death in certain countries", says Dr Z. Pawlowski of WHO's Parasitic Diseases Programme. Not long ago, at the end of the 19th century, it was a very common disease in central Europe as well. </span><br><br>I had read the article where u say tat tat is a certain diesease where muslim people in their region do not have it. The only reason u say tat it is link with pork is just based on this theory. Therefore u r assuming pork is the culprit where it could have been due to other reason. The report does not state tat pigs r more prevalent to dieseases nor statting tat rearing pigs is the cause of their diesease. Why don't u paste the whole article here for peopel to read ? I can't see why u came out with tis conclusion and frankly I can easily find some common health problems of arabic men and claims tat they have tis illness just because they do not eat pork.<br><br><blockquote>But where those quality standards are not exercised... *shrugs*</blockquote>Chicken, beef or mutton also faces health problem if they r not bred with quality standards.<br><br><blockquote>I wasnt saying God is a specialist, it was an analogy. Weak reason? I've stated my arguement above again. I agree with you on science. I didnt disapprove it. I merely said that there are always new discoveries to be made, things unheard of before. As for priest versus doctor, muslims don't go to their priest for health matters. Nor are they allowed to see faith healers or those who some know as bomohs. We drop by the doctors</blockquote>Your analogy directly link god to be the specialist. Your above argument does not support the fact tat pork is unclean or unhealthy as well. Since u agree and trusted science, why do u doubt it only when it had clashes with your religion ? U do not doubt tat medical science is faulty and see a doctor for treatment, u do not doubt science so much so tat the computer u r typing will not give u an electricity shock or suddenly explode, in fact u trusted science so much tat u take it for granted. Why do u doubt it when science states tat pork is healthy or tat evolution is true ?<br><br></div>

You are right again about your first statement. But what i feel is that you are insinuating this ruling doesnt make sense, therefore losing credibility to the religion. Ok. I've given my case in the past page to read.<br><br>As for the scientific evidence, i've told you once again to take <strong>an overall look into this piggie issue, not just one piece of lean meat.</strong> i guess you are selective in your reading.<br><br>"Way back in 1946 Newsweek magazine carried this report: "For more than three decades, health authorities have warned the American public to avoid "pink pork" and to cook pork thoroughly. Yet the United States continues to have the highest trichinosis rate of any country in the world. This fact was emphasised anew by Dr S.E. Gould of Eloise, Michigan, reporting last week in the JOURNAL OF THE MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. At least 16% of autopsies have revealed pink pork infection, Gould said. Where autopsy methods are thorough the percentage has been as high as 36%. This painful and sometimes fatal ailment is caused by the tiny worm trichina, a parasite in live hogs, transmitted to human beings through uncooked pork. Less than 1/32nd of an inch in length, and invisible to the naked eye of both butcher and consumer, trichinae can lurk in any cut of pork from the most expensive loin roast to the more dubious frankfurter. Nor is it a respecter of persons" (Newsweek, January 14, 1946, p.80)."<br><br>"In fact, the Chief of the Bureau of Animal Industry released these startling figures: Out of 63 million livestock animals inspected prior to processing, 18 head of cattle were condemned, along with 1 calf, 11 sheep and 2,793 pigs! An interesting ratio! These figures seem to imply that disease is more rampant in pigs than in any other form of livestock. Indeed, no goats were listed as being condemned by the inspectors at all. Not only is this the case, but in one given year we discovered that 46,688,860 pigs were slaughtered in the United States but that only 65% of these animals were even inspected for T.B. (tuberculosis). Well over 5 million pigs had the disease but only 42,381 were deemed unfit for food!!!"<br><br>"After many years of living with hog cholera, a virus disease causing a $50,000,000 loss annually, the United States decided to eradicate the disease. Passage of public law 87-209 set in motion an eradication program that got a good start in 1961-2. As the program progresses, its main points will be: To achieve a high level of vaccination; To make all cases reportable to authorities; To quarantine affected hogs and premises; To require cleaning and disinfection of vehicles and facilities; To dispose of infected and exposed swine; To require heat treating of all garbage fed to swine; To prohibit the use, as a vaccine, of material capable of causing hog cholera; To control all shipments of hogs; and to inform the swine industry of hog cholera. This will be one of the largest animal disease eradication programs ever attempted in North America" (Encyclopaedia Britannica Book of the Year, 1963, p.841).<br><br>Look out, "Babe" -- they're after you big time! At least they were back in 1963. Well, this all sounds well and good. How far did the Americans get in this altruistic endeavour? Not very far at all. They found it "extremely difficult" [read subtext "impossible"] to get the producers to comply with new regulations. And only a few years later we all read about the extraordinary outbreaks across the US of a swine-flu fever!"<br><br>"Pigs are notorious for hosting dysentery-producing protozoa, coccidia, tape worms, pork bladder worms, the hydatid, roundworms, the intestinal threadworm, the thornheaded worm, nodular worm, the swine kidney worm, lug worms and of course trichinae (US Department of Agriculture Farmers Bulletin No. 1787). Add to this list hookworms, schitosoma japonicum, paragomines westermaini, paciolepsis buski, clonorchis sinensis, metastrongylus apri, giganthorinchus gigas, balatitidium coli, T.B., fusiformis necrofurus, salmonella cholera, paratyphoid, bruceellosis, swine erysipelas, smallpox, Japanese B-enceppahlitis, influenza, foot-mouth disease, and gastroenteritis for newborn babies."<br><br>"Certainly, major concern is presently mounting over completely new pig diseases, including a form of AIDS -- PMWS: Post-weaning Multisystemic Wasting Syndrome -- already recognised as spreading through the USA, France, Spain, the Netherlands, Italy, Germany, Ireland and the U.K. Like AIDS in human beings there is no effective cure. In the case of the U.K. where the disease was first diagnosed in 1999, 120 prime pig farms have so far been decimated. Concurrent with PMWS is circovirus (spread by pig consumption of same species faeces and nasal secretions; the name comes from the peculiarity that this family of viruses have their DNA in the form of a ring) and PDNS (Porcine Dermatitis and Nephropathy Syndrome, discovered in 1993) which closely resembles Classical Swine Fever and African Swine Fever, and like PMWS there is no cure on the horizon."<br><br>(Of PMWS) "Serum surveys in Europe and North America have shown that infection has spread widely through the pig population but only a small proportion of seropositve herds have a history of clinical disease. It seems that most infections are sub-clinical. It is not known why some infections result in disease."<br><br>"And, as has been recently discovered, pigs contain viruses built into their genes. One report stated: "Genes from an animal virus could mingle with those of a human virus in an organ recipient, creating a hybrid virus with unpredictable behaviour. Keeping animals isolated from infection may not be enough. Some viruses scientists are concerned about aren't caught: they're inherited. They're just part of being a pig... that's because, eons ago, these viruses infected the ancestors of modern pigs and planted their DNA in sperm and egg cells. As a result, the virus genes mingled with the pig genes and are now passed on through the generations" (Los Angeles Times, 15/6/97).<br><br>It must be admitted that cooking or "curing" pork thoroughly can, of course, destroy bacteria. What health authorities fail to mention, however, is the fact that in pig products other forms of bacteria actually thrive on excessive temperatures! A current U.S. Department of Agriculture booklet stated that "In a series of 24 cases of trichinosis reported recently, 22...resulted from 'cooked pork.""<br><br>This is a few extracts from http://www.biblicalresearchinstitute.com/freedom/give_babe_a_miss.html and http://www.thepigsite.com/DiseaseInfo/Default.asp?Display=86 besides the other articles i gave you.

One report stated: "Genes from an animal virus could mingle with those of a human virus in an organ recipient, creating a hybrid virus with unpredictable behaviour. Keeping animals isolated from infection may not be enough. Some viruses scientists are concerned about aren't caught: they're inherited. They're just part of being a pig... that's because, eons ago, these viruses infected the ancestors of modern pigs and planted their DNA in sperm and egg cells. As a result, the virus genes mingled with the pig genes and are now passed on through the generations</blockquote>ALL MEAT sources have tis problem, not just pork<br><br><blockquote>In fact, the Chief of the Bureau of Animal Industry released these startling figures: Out of 63 million livestock animals inspected prior to processing, 18 head of cattle were condemned, along with 1 calf, 11 sheep and 2,793 pigs! An interesting ratio! These figures seem to imply that disease is more rampant in pigs than in any other form of livestock. Indeed, no goats were listed as being condemned by the inspectors at all. Not only is this the case, but in one given year we discovered that 46,688,860 pigs were slaughtered in the United States but that only 65% of these animals were even inspected for T.B. (tuberculosis). Well over 5 million pigs had the disease but only 42,381 were deemed unfit for food</blockquote>If it is such a big deal, u will see american dying of dieseases.

The verdict passed to both breaking fast deliberately and producing 4 male witnesses for rape is very wrong, according to Islamic rulings. <strong>How that punisment in the news is called for, is definitely crazy.</strong><br><br>Breaking fast is a personal thing between the practitioner and his creator, something the state or governing authority does not have the right to deal into because as mentioned, its a private affair. Who knows, that person might be in a state of illness, giving him the legality to quit fasting.<br><br>The proper penalty for it is to make it up for a day after Hari Raya. Or to feed some poor people an average of one meal each.<br><br>Next, rape. The misconception is that a woman has to produce 4 witnesses to prove her claim of rape. The need for the 4 witnesses is not to prove rape but to prove adultery. Rape in Islamic law of evidence can be proven using DNA testing, medical records, witnesses and even circumstantial evidence. This is because Islam understands that the women is potentially a victim and will not impose unnecessary hardship to prove her case. Whereas someone who wants to be a morality police and look into the affairs of others would have to give a high burden of proof to prove adultery (4 male witnesses), especially coz that has serious repercussions on the accused.<br><br>Well, you probably have read or heard of the harsh sentences decreed upon muslims in the middle east and elsewhere. These are misrepresentations of the Qu'ran, but it is understandable why some would perceive Islam as being brutal. Those are one of many cases in the Muslim world, where Shari'ah (Islamic Law) is praticed primitively. They include cultural practices that exists in Arab (which has also seeped their way here) and some Muslim societies. They may not necessarily reflect the teachings of the Qu`ran <strong>and often are in stark contradiction to the Shari'ah.</strong> Like you know, overdoing things like stoning, lashing, death bla bla.<br>-----<br><br><strong>Today Muslim societies are not model societies, they are infested with ills or evils.</strong> Okay?<br><br>I am not going into this pork thing anymore because obviously i'm not knowledgeable regarding this.

And just after that saying comes, "If one repents after committing this crime, and reforms, God redeems him. God is Forgiver, Merciful." So.. what is the correct theft punishment in Islam? Tis to give chance for the thieves to acknowledge their crime and give back what was stolen. They might even get a reward. If they do not come forward, proof should be found who are the theieves. Then they should work to pay the fees involved for the whole thing. What was stolen, if found, should be returned to their owners.

Tis is simply because I do not believe the above line meant tat hands r to be cut off only if u had 3 hands or more. Cut off their hand doesn't meant tat it had to be 3 or more hands, but as long as if u had one hand, it had to be cut. Don't u agree tat this line is completely senseless if it only refer to people with 3 hands or more ? Who has 3 or more hand and also a thief ? So u guys r biased against people with 3 or more hands ?</blockquote>Huh? Didnt i explained? <strong>Which average human has 3 hands or more?!</strong> @__@. What do you use hands for? They are means to work and get a living.<br><br>I got the quote from, "The male thief, and the female thief, you shall   as a punishment for their crime, and to serve as a deterrent from God. God is Almighty, Wise."<br><br>The Arabic word  means "cut" while  is the plural (three or more) of  (hand) used in dual form. As we know, each one of us has normally two hands, including theives. How can we possible cut off the hands (three or more) of a theif? In addition  in that quote is given its figurative meaning of refering to wealth, possession of responsibility and resources.<br><br>Therefore, the quote means "The male thief, and the female thief, you shall cut off from their resources and power as a punishment for their crime, and to serve as a deterrent from God. God is Almighty, Wise."<br><br><blockquote>15. If any of your women are guilty of lewdness, Take the evidence of four (Reliable) witnesses from amongst you against them; and if they testify, confine them to houses until death do claim them, or Allah ordain for them some (other) way.</blockquote>Firstly, this verse is related to possible habitual fornicators, prostitution despite being muslims. Consequently, <strong>for somebody who wants to be a morality police</strong>, in this case, the court wants four reliable eye-witnesses to testify and if the accuser fails to produce them, it regards him as at fault. As we can see, it is also almost impossible to prove a women of lewdness as again, you'll need <strong>four reliable witnesses.</strong> Islam recognizes the woman's honor as something very serious and holy, and it must not be tampered or joked with. The women is innocent until if the witnesses are presented.<br><br>"Upon those who accuse honourable women [of fornication] and bring not four witnesses as evidence [for their accusation], inflict eighty stripes, and never accept their testimony in future. They indeed are wicked transgressors. Unless they repent thereafter and mend their ways, then Allah is Oft-Forgiving and Most-Merciful. (24:4-5)" This unsupported slander has been treated by Islam with such severity in hoping no one even dares to cast scandalous allegations against any chaste women. Anyway, the striping can be cancelled upon the man's subsequent conduct if he repents, showing he is sorry.<br><br>Secondly, if found guilty, the punishment to be confined to their home, it is to protect society from their lewd activities. (As a side note, confined is translated wrongly, it means <strong>keep them</strong>, not to imprison them.)<strong>This is a temporary injunction.</strong> At this time, it is the <strong>family's responsibility to WORK IT OUT</strong> with them, "confine them to houses until death do claim them, or Allah ordain for them some (other) way. (4:15)", to try reform them and put in some sense and reach a conclusion.<br><br>The last part of the quote, "or Allah ordain for them some (other) way." rules out any death punishment because it tells us that after the repentance and amendment, then good, things are solved.<br><br>Finally, this is only for cases brought to court.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by pkchukiss:<br>I am very curious: Muslims all around the world keep denying the link towards Muslim extremists as the antagonists in terrorist acts around the world.

What i was taught is what i have said above. The temporary injunction - This girl is caught for prostituting herself. Shes kept at home. Now her family must teach her dats wrong of her to do that, influence her to stop giving away her body. The girl doesnt want. The family has to keep reforming her, giving her support until shes promised not to do so again. She doesnt want still? The family have to keep on with that, until shes whenever. But till whenever its like impossible, for which girl will still choose to prostitute when she has her family beside her now? So.. whens shes amended, that is when Allah has saved her in a way.<br><br><blockquote>Wat is the difference between u and the other muslim extremists who add in anything they like into the scripture ?

You can easily twist the meanings in other languages. Did you know the word "no" could mean "yes" in some sentences and speaking of the past could actually mean you are speaking of the present? Thats why, it is kinda easy to get confused. And thats why, anybody will need proper guidance from the proper authority.<br><br>Well now, i'm know not qualified to talk about these issue.

Tat is why they r allowed to marry up till 4 wives. The only argument u said is it mention about women... and tat is it ! Tis just shows tat the quran, as in many other religion, is sexists and come out with rules strictly for a certain sex. Just because u say it mention only women doesn't means it have to be prostitution ! As said before, it may meant a lot of things such as premarital sex, masturbation etc etc. Again u do not take in the literal meaning of the verse and u force in your ideals into the translation.<br><br><blockquote>The temporary injunction - This girl is caught for prostituting herself.

From the desciption u had written above, I have tis idea  tat u think people prostitute just for the fun of it. nobody like to be a prostitute, especially in arab region ! They do it because of economic circumstances ! U say as though all prostitutes love to have sex, they experience some sort of psychological problem, need counseling and not because they need the money !<br><br>And the punishment is imprisonment for life ! Unless u r going to tell me u r a better translator than Shakir, Yusufali and Pickthal as the most they suggest is they can only be freed if the legislation had changed. Is there anything written in it tat ever suggest they be freed as long as she is "counselled" ?

From the above statement u r doubting the translating ability of the translators. R u trying to say there r no better men who can translate arabic to english ?<br><br></div>
