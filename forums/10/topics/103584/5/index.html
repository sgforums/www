            <div class='col-md body'>Since i have some time.. let me just make a last reply. @__@.<br><br><blockquote>I am wondering if u do know the meaning of the word aydiyahuma as in all of the translations from quran websites, it suggest tat both of the hands of the theives had to be cut off. I had said before tat aydiyahuma is the plural for 2 when it is use in hands. If u insist tat it meant 3, meaning u r the best translator among these quran translators, and the word hand meant anything u like, then I can only say u r forcing the quran to your ideals.</blockquote>You have ignored part of what i said. Even if it so, again, aydiyahuma in that sentence is given its figurative meaning strength of hands, power, property, wealth, blessings. Many Arabic words contain such multiple meanings. So cutting of hands is ruled out. Besides, this saying comes just after that, Â“But if the thief repent after his crime, and amend his conduct, Allah turns to him in forgiveness; for Allah is  Most forgiving, Most Merciful.Â” How could this be applied if someone has his hands cut off?<br><br><blockquote>In muslim, lewdness in men is never punished. Tat is why they r allowed to marry up till 4 wives.</blockquote>There goes your hasty assumptions again. There are verses concerning that elsewhere in the Qu'ran and Hadith. You are very selective in your reading. Next, how is having four wives lewd? Isnt it better to acknowledge a women as his wife rather than being a mistress, a kept woman whom society looks down upon? If you need to know, you must have the permission of the first wife before you can take another.<br><br><blockquote> Tis just shows tat the quran, as in many other religion, is sexists and come out with rules strictly for a certain sex. </blockquote>Nopez.. its like i've said it above.<br><br><blockquote>. Just because u say it mention only women doesn't means it have to be prostitution ! As said before, it may meant a lot of things such as premarital sex, masturbation etc etc.</blockquote>I've mentioned it concerns habitual fornication, like prostitution, premarital sex included. For watching porn, dressing sexily <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">, masturbating, those are are personal, not social wrongs. Therefore, they are not included.<br><br><blockquote> Again u do not take in the literal meaning of the verse and u force in your ideals into the translation.</blockquote>Its not me, it was what i was taught. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br><blockquote>Is there anything written in it tat ever suggest they be freed as long as she is "counselled" ?</blockquote>I need to repeat once more? Haiz.. After they were counselled and repented, turned back to theri religion, that is when God has saved them in a way, "or Allah ordain for them some (other) way." So yay.</div>

All the translated version points to the fact tat it points to the physical hands, not the things u want it to mean. If the thief repent after the crime, he can still go to heaven. And tat is it. He can also plead for forgiveness before his hands were cut off too. There r a lot of punishment tat u can never amend back as well, such as being caned or being jailed etc. Why should tis be different from them ? Don't u think it is shallow if u allow people to turn in for "forgiveness" just because he want to escape punishment ?<br><br><blockquote>There goes your hasty assumptions again.

If you need to know, you must have the permission of the first wife before you can take another. </blockquote>How is having 4 wives lewd ? It certainly is more lewd than having 1 wife. It certainly is better to have a person have a single wife and no mistress or kept women etc. If the first wife don't give permission, then just divorce her lor... the male has the power to divorce his wife just by saying it out to her isn't it ?<br><br><blockquote>Nopez.. its like i've said it above</blockquote>There is nothing to be shameful about it being sexists. Jewish, Christian, catholic and muslim teachings r sexist to a certain extent. Surely u got to agree tat according to these scriptures, men r treated differently compared with women.<br><br><blockquote>I've mentioned it concerns habitual fornication, like prostitution, premarital sex included. For watching porn, dressing sexily , masturbating, those are are personal, not social wrongs. Therefore, they are not included. </blockquote>According to muslim teachings, these r indeed social wrongs. It had explicitly mention just lewdness and it can means a lot of things. I am pretty sure thousands of years ago in <strong>all </strong>muslim communities, masturbation, dressing sexily. watching porn etc r prohibited for women. Your social wrong comes after being in being in a modern society for so long.<br><br><blockquote>Its not me, it was what i was taught</blockquote>Maybe u should be more pro active in your learning than just being taught straight from your religious leaders. They r human after all<br><br><blockquote>I need to repeat once more? Haiz.. After they were counselled and repented, turned back to theri religion, that is when God has saved them in a way, "or Allah ordain for them some (other) way." So yay.</blockquote>I said before, u treat prostitution as a mental diesease or something tat need some psychology counselling. It is not ! in muslim community, if there ever was a prostitute, it is more likely she do it because of the great need of money and not because she enjoy so. As said by the translator, such means from allah can only come with legislation, not on any whim and fancy.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>OIE BALLS TO ALL OF YOU LAH. You think i transparent izzit? Told you all liaow, people have the rights to choose the religion they want and how they want to practice it. If you can't accept that, all of you are damned shallow minded. If people want to follow their believes you have no rights at all to say my god is greater than thou or free thinking is greater than your religion or whatsoever. You are just being very immature. So stp trying to act cool or smart and start criticising another religion. i am going to close this thread within 24 hours.  Shame on you people who talk so much about rights and yet you criticise one's religion.</div>
