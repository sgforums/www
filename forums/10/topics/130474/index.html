            <div class='col-md body'>US$200,000.00 per annum is the true market value of world's best employee-category of workers. The US president is paid as an employee and not the boss-worker who are normally business owners or investors who with the supports of profits of the ventures can afford to pay any amount to themselves they like.<br><br>For example, Bill gate in his position as CEO of Microsoft is a boss-worker and by virtue of his own business making billions per year may decide to pay himself S$20 billion per year. Wee Chaw Yao may pay himself too say S$12,000,000.00 per annum. Anything wrong?<br><br>Other presidents or prime ministers do not dare to equate themselves with CEO boss-worker because they know the distinction between employee/servant and boss-worker. However our ministers in recommending their own pays and benchmarking against pay levels in the private sector seem to have forgotten that they belong to the employee-worker category.<br><br>Our ministers seem to be comparing themselves with the like of Bill Gate or Wee Chaw Yao who are in a different category - boss_worker. Certainly our ministers are only public servants who do not invest their own monies in Singapore incorporated and are not boss-workers like Bill Gate. If they have then it is understandable to pay themselves as Bill Gate or Wee Chaw Yao are permitted to do as then our ministers might lose millions of their own monies.<br><br>Any self-approval or self-equating of pay level to business CEOs or Boss-workers is also wrongful. Our ministers should get them endorsed by independent people not their own kinds and MPs.<br><br>There is a conflict of interest which is strictly prohibited under civil and company laws. The next government may have to put this matter right.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
