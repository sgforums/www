              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">In the 1970s, NUS Student Union leader <a rel="nofollow" href="http://swordofdemocles.blogspot.com/2005/07/price-of-truth.html">Tan Wah Piow  </a>- whose passport was confiscated after serving time in prison, and was immediately sent to serve his NS in the Singapore Artillery after his release from prison - was able to escape and find his way to London.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">If the Singapore security is so tight that even a 22 year old Student Union Leader can slip through - can it prevent a determined terrorist like MSK from effecting his escape ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Surely, our million dollar elite ministers have been cloistered in their ivory towers for too long, and unaware of the real situation on the ground.</p>
              <p>The location where MSK was reported to have departed from the north shoreline - near the Singapore Woodlands Checkpoint - is totally unguarded.</p>
              <p>There used to be a detention center for drug addicts, with guard towers manned by Gurhka guards - all of which have probably been moved to new facilities at Changi.</p>
              <p>An unused oil refuel terminal for the defunct Malaysian Naval Facility - K.D.Malaya -remain there and is also left unguarded.</p>
              <p>The closest that a Singapore Coast Guard Patrol Vessel is seen near the Causeway - will normally hover midway between the Causeway and Senoko Power Station, which is about 3km away from where MSK was reported to have swam away.</p>
              <p>He practically could take a leisurely swim without anyone noticing despite the heavy traffic on the Causeway, as everyone is too busy getting home in either directions.</p>
              <p>It is impossible to view the water close to the Causeway due to the three large water pipelines obstructing the view of a small head bobbing in the dark.</p>
              <p>The Police conduct regular foot patrols that take a leisurely walk to the center of the Causeway, and is conducted on the side with the pedestrian pavement - while no foot patrol is conducted on the side with the railroad-water pipeline.</p>
              <p>Even if the foot patrols were conducted, the instruction given was probably to watch for anyone walking on the railroad or pipeline to get in or out of Singapore.</p>
              <p>All in all, it was simply due to a total lack of imagination on the part of those in the leadership that allowed MSK to slip through all the layers of administrative measures that were supposed to have prevented such an escape.</p>
              <p>During the middle of November 2008, I had the opportunity of visiting a boatel facility located along the northern coastline, and spoke to one of two police officers on duty.</p>
              <p>While one was taking a turn to rest by reading the papers, the other was boringly wandering around in some tiresome manner, not exactly attentive to any possibility of someone slipping through their location.</p>
              <p>Can we blame the frontline personnel assigned to an unforgiving place with temporary measures protecting them from the rain or heat and humidity, and expected to be there on a daily 8 hour shift until the next relief shift occur ?</p>
              <p>The whole operation was executed with a total lack of imagination.</p>
              <p>It is obvious that a determined terrorist like MSK can slip through the cordon.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Are the self-assuming meritocratic elite political leadership truly worth the million dollar wages paid to look after Singapore's security ?</p>
              <p>They have already failed in looking after Singapore's financial affairs by losing US$100Billion in one year.</p>

              <p>In an earlier news feature, it was reported that 3 persons were arrested - a 32-year old Indonesian named Agus Salim arrested on March 5, and two Malaysians Abdul Matin Anol Rahmat age 60, and Johar Hassan both arrested on April 1.</p>

              <p><br>That's how ordinary people think.  PAP think differently.  Say this is an office and if you make a serious mistake at work that might bring down your entire organisation, and other people including those outside your organisation help you to correct this very serious mistake, do you think you should be the one accepting congraulations for rectifying a situation that should not have happened in the first place (which you never took responsibility for)?  For a moment, lets put aside the fact that you were too cowardly to take responsibility or maybe it was greed since it must be really hard to give up $m pay cheque.  Because your boss said you are paid $m to avoid temptation and I guess, he didn't think of the the temptation of clinging on to that pay at all costs! </p>
              <p>And that childlike innocence on that cherubic face is so "sweet".  Imagine, WKS actually thinks that all is well now that the toilet break is at last over!  Its so sweet that he thinks his pal Mas Selamat would be so happy to see him again and maybe over a cup of tea tarik, they can play catch-up and he will tell him the full extent of what he has done while he was on the run!   </p>
              <p>In the real world, where you have to work hard for the money, if you correct your mistake you'd most likely hear that its about a bleedy time! instead of receiving a deluge of congraulatory messsages.  But then again, WKS is PAP, so he is special.  Maybe they do go around patting each other on the backs for the recapture of Mas Selamat.  Heaven knows there are many Singaporeans who can be sacked or demoted if something else goes wrong.  They will just stay above temptation collecting their $m pay cheque.</p>

              that the toilet break is at last over!  Its so sweet that he
              thinks his pal Mas Selamat would be so happy to see him again and
              maybe over a cup of tea tarik, they can play catch-up and he will
              tell him the full extent of what he has done while he was on the
              run!   </p>
              <p>In the real world, where you have to work hard for the money, if
              you correct your mistake you'd most likely hear that its about a
              bleedy time! instead of receiving a deluge of congraulatory
              messsages.  But then again, WKS is PAP, so he is
              special.  Maybe they do go around patting each other on the
              backs for the recapture of Mas Selamat.  Heaven knows there
              are many Singaporeans who can be sacked or demoted if something
              else goes wrong.  They will just stay above temptation
              collecting their $m pay cheque.</p>

              What if MSK had managed to carry out plot against Spore?                  
              
              The Kent Ridge Common, 12 May 2009, Christopher Ong
              
              What IF Mas Selamat had actually managed to carry out his plots against Singapore during the time of his escape?
              
              That is the question that should confront us now, rather than the dishing out of incessant accolades on his successful arrest. While not denying that investigators on both sides of the causeway have played a commendable role leading up his arrest, a huge sigh of relief should come at this juncture than the popping of champagne and the patting of each otherâ€™s back.
              
              The circumstances describing his escape to a remote village in Johor seems tattered at best. Maritime experts that were consulted after Mas Selamatâ€™s arrest opined with an almost disturbing ease that he swam across one of shortest distance between Singapore and Johor with the help of an â€˜improvised flotation deviceâ€™; one that a schoolboy who could muster 20 laps at a swimming pool could swim, not to mention a limp legged fugitive. Minister Wong had also claimed that Singapore is a country with a â€˜long coastlineâ€™ and being almost â€˜porousâ€™, is â€˜easyâ€™ for people to bring goods in and out of Singapore.
              
              Given that these facts were not new discoveries, and were presented as almost commonsensical knowledge, why is it so that the maritime security of Singapore could not have easily concentrated their survelliance on these likely locations of Mas Selamatâ€™s escape and thus prevented his 8-months gardening stint at a remote Johor village?
              
              Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak disclosed to the Malaysian media that Mas Selamat was â€˜plotting hitsâ€™ on Singapore, and that although hiding in Malaysia, his targets were primarily of our country. This fact should disturb us. It is only due to Mas Selamatâ€™s inability to leverage on his network and the lack of availability of resources that hampered him from carrying out his plots during the period of his escape that stretched close to 1 and a half years. Had the JI network been more well-connected, stronger and efficient, and carried out an attack which Mas Selamat had plotted upon his escape, perhaps Singapore would not be commending themselves so much now.
              
              Mas Selamatâ€™s arrest without him successfully carrying out any of his plots is a fortunate piece of news for Singapore. Indeed, credit should be claimed for his arrest, but the eagerness by which this was claimed bore a stark contrast to the shouldering of responsibility in the aftermath of his escape. Being all-too-ready to claim the trophy for their prize catch does not diminish their role in allowing for his escape in the first place.Singapore must be glad that history has not allowed the escape and subsequent re-capturing of Mas Semalat to descend into a pyrrhic victory.
