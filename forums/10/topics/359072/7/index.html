              delayed the announcement but just attritbute it to "secrecy

              <p>well, alot of unacceptable stuff happens in the USA, with the CIA.</p>
              <p>They can delay the announcement in an effort to catch more bad guys, by getting info of of MSK, and not letting the other bad guys knows that MSK already captured. tactical reason.</p>
              <p>Again wild guess. no source.</p>

              <p><strong>Hishammuddin confirms Mas Selamat's capture</strong></p>

              <div class="content_wrapper">
              <p><strong>PUTRAJAYA:</strong> Home Minister Datuk Seri Hishammuddin Tun Hussein Friday (8 May) confirmed that Mas Selamat Kastari, the suspected leader of the Jemaah Islamiah militant group who escaped from a Singapore detention centre last year, has been caught in Malaysia.</p>
              <p>"Yes, I can confirm that he is under our detention and is being investigated right now. But I can't go into the detail because this is a sensitive issue which involves three parties namely Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"It also involves intelligence agencies of the three governments and it is something that I do not want to jeopardise," he told a news conference here.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Malaysian authorities would ensure that Mas Selamat would not escape for the second time, he said.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Meanwhile in JOHOR BAHRU, sources told Bernama that Mas Selamat was arrested in an operation by the Johor police about a month ago.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Bernama was informed that special branch police officers arrested Mas Selamat near Skudai, about 25km from Johor Bahru city.</p>
              <p>"We know that he has relatives staying in Skudai," the source, who is familiar with the operation to nab the JI leader, told Bernama.</p>
              <p>Mas Selamat had been the subject of a massive manhunt after he slipped out of the Whitley Road maximum security detention centre in Singapore on Feb 27 last year.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He was alleged to have masterminded a plot to hijack a jetliner and crash it into Singapore's Changi Airport.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He fled Singapore in 2001 but was captured by the Indonesian police on Bintan Island in 2006 and sent to the city-state.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Bernama was also informed that Mas Selamat was arrested under the Internal Security Act but he was still in police custody and had not been sent to the Kamunting Detention Centre in Taiping, Perak where ISA detainees are held. <em>(Bernama)</em></p>

              terrorist since his escape had gathered intelligence from their
              counterparts that Mas Selamat was hiding in Johor and was planning to
              create unrest in several countries in the region.<br> <br> A massive operation was launched by the Special Branch with the help of other police departments here.<br> <br> The month-long operation paid off when Mas Selamat who is said to be
              the leader of the Jemaah Islamiah (JI) in Singapore was arrested.<br> <br> Police also seized documents and other paraphernalia that allegedly revealed their planned operation.<br> <br> Inspector General of Police Tan Sri Musa Hassan confirmed the arrest.<br> <br> "We are in touch with our international counterparts who were informed about the arrest as well as about what we have learnt.<br> <br> "Our officers are still investigating their activities and networking," he added.<br> <br> Mas Selamat was arrested in February 2006 and was sent to Singapore for investigations before he escaped in February last year.<br> <br> -----------------------------<br> <span style="color: navy;"><strong>Latest updates at Singapore News Alternative:</strong><br> <br> 1.

              <p><strong>Was Wong Kan Seng kept in the dark?</strong><br> <br> Friday, 8 May 2009, 10:20 pm | 20 views        <br> <br> <a href="http://theonlinecitizen.com/2009/05/was-wong-kan-seng-kept-in-the-dark/php6oumkn/"><img src="http://theonlinecitizen.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/php6oumkn.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a> <br> <br> IF Home Affairs Minister Wong Kan Seng knew about Mas Selamat’s arrest on April Fool’s Day, he did not show it.<br> <br> In a speech he made on 15th April this year at the ISD
              Intelligence Service Promotion Ceremony, he implored the organisation
              to continue the hunt for the terrorist, as if he was still hiding in
              the jungle.<br> <br> Below is an excerpt of the speech (full version can be read <a href="http://www.mha.gov.sg/news_details.aspx?nid=MTQwNg%3d%3d-SOITePml5jQ%3d">here</a>), where he spoke explicitly on the issue of Mas Selamat:</p>
              <blockquote> <span style="color: blue;">I
              know that the past year has been a particularly difficult one for ISD.
              You had to face the reality that security lapses led to the escape of
              Mas Selamat Kastari. I know that ISD officers, more than any one else,
              were deeply pained over this. Years of hard, gruelling work that led to
              the successful disruption of terrorist plots and the capture of
              numerous terrorists were set back by that lapse. Years of quiet work in
              the background successfully dealing with potentially explosive race and
              religious incidents, espionage and other security threats, have been
              overshadowed.</span><br> <span style="color: blue;"><br> </span><br> <span style="color: blue;">It has been and continues to be a
              testing time for the Department. I understand that at one time or
              another, officers from all the various commands have been deployed to
              work on the case which for some, involved taking on an entirely new
              type of assignment for the first time in their career. <strong>I have been regularly updated on the Department’s efforts to track Mas Selamat Kastari down</strong>.
              I have no doubt of your determination. I have confidence that with
              patience – which has always been a virtue of the Department – <strong>we will recapture him</strong>.
              The keen sense of fellowship and camaraderie among ISD officers, of
              being one family through thick and thin, that I have seen particularly
              during this trying episode, will see you through this, and make all of
              you even stronger.</span><br> <span style="color: blue;"><br> Most importantly, I am happy to see that ISD officers have not allowed
              the setback to dishearten or distract you from your mission of
              countering the multi-faceted security threats we face. <strong>Even as you continue to hunt for Mas Selamat Kastari</strong>,
              you have been equally unrelenting in monitoring and tackling other
              security threats, at times, I know, stretching yourselves beyond the
              limits. </span><br> </blockquote>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>So did Minister Wong Kan Seng know
              about Mas Selamat’s capture? And if so, why did he deliberately give
              the impression that the hunt for the fugitive is still on? Does this
              imply that he is deliberately misleading the entire ISD?</strong></span><br> <br> Or worse still, is this truly an indication that even the Home
              Affairs Minister himself has been kept in the dark about the arrest?<br> <br> <br> -----------------------------<br> <span style="color: navy;"><strong>Latest updates at Singapore News Alternative:</strong><br> <br> 1.
