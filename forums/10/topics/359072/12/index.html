              <p>A terror attack on Singapore in the near future is possible and
              must be taken seriously....What was Mas Selamat planning about? He
              had 3 'JI buddies' to talk cock with him about it for over 8 mths
              and we dont really know how close he was to even get a hold of
              a 'stink bomb' from a novelty shop.Now that he is finally caught we
              can all go have a good night sleep but stop this paranoia.</p>

              <p>An attack on Singapore need not necessarily occur on Singapore soil.</p>
              <p>As in the other attacks on US and Israeli interests, it had occurred many times on foreign soil - from Argentina to Lebanon, from Kenya to Yemen.</p>
              <p>The US Embassies were bombed in Kenya and Lebanon, a Jewish synagogue was destroyed in Argentina, the US Destroyer Cole was bombed in the harbor in Yemen.</p>
              <p>Was MSK targeting Singapore Island itself when caught in Skudai in Johor State, or was he targeting Singapore's interests that exist in the State of Johor ?</p>
              <p>There are quite a few rich targets that are owned by the State of Singapore - one of which is the Skudai Water Works operated by Singapore Water Department, and the other is the Johor City Square owned by Temasek.</p>
              <p>Can we ever stop being a little paranoid ?</p>
              <p>To do so is to drop the sense of imagination that will be needed to be one step ahead of the thoughts of a terrorist's devious minds that constantly search for imaginative ways to score political points against Singapore.</p>

              So many commendations on MSK' arrest although the security forces took nearly 14 months whilst he was just a stone throw away in Skudai (JB).  I would like to see that justice is done so charge him in court especially there is new evidence that he was planning to attack Sg according to statement in the newspapers coming from Malaysian PM.  We should not use the excuse that intelligence and information will be compromise if MSK is charged in open court.  
              We should show the world that justice is done according to law.

              <p>So many commendations on <span>MSK</span>’ arrest
              although the security forces took nearly 14 months whilst he was
              just a stone throw away in Skudai (JB). I would like to see that
              justice is done so charge him in court especially there is new
              evidence that he was planning to attack Sg according to statement
              in the newspapers coming from Malaysian PM. We should not use the
              excuse that intelligence and information will be compromise if
              <span>MSK</span> is charged in open court.<br> We should show the world that justice is done according to law.</p>

              <p>If Chia Thye Poh can be locked up for 32 years without being charged - and released without any document or conditions made, why should MSK be charged.</p>
              <p>It has always been the Government's position that in such trials, the safety of the witnesses is paramount, and the Government cannot assure the security of witnesses from being targets of hit-squads.</p>
              <p>We should be more generous towards our Political Prisoners, and less towards these terrorists - who will not hesitate to execute wanton destruction of innocent lives and precious properties.</p>

              I think it is unwise to charge Mas Selamat in an open court. 
              
              Similar to the reporters, the police also have sources that they cannot reveal. This may create more problem as there may be things that the police cannot reveal. If in open court, more would be revealed to the public. It would be of interest to most of us but also to the criminals or terrorists.
              
              You want them to know the possible targets that could be attacked and have a rough idea how to do it? You want them to know how the police track down criminal so that they can aviod it much easier next time?

              Hello, Mas Selamat Kastari is Malay name ok. If your wife can pronounce Nasi Lemak, then she shouldn't have any problem with MSK.

              <p>The so-called 20th hijacker Moussaoui was hauled to court, likewise Al-Qaeda terrorist mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and Abu Zubayda if i am not wrong. What is Mas Selamat compared to this kingpins?</p>
              <p>Crucial intelligence how-to or SOP need not be revealed to the public. Just hightlight his involvement and plans to conduct terrorist incidents. Combating terror is one thing, but desecending to their level is another.</p>
