              <p>It is better that <span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial;" lang="EN-GB">lee hsien loong </span>don't say a word about it at all.    Question the credibility of his crap.  </p>
              <p><cite class="auth">Channel NewsAsia - <span><strong>Sunday, May 10</strong></span></cite></p>
              <p class="first">SINGAPORE: Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has said Singapore’s security challenge is to keep up its guard without getting fatigued or complacent.</p>
              <p>In his first remarks on the capture of Mas Selamat Kastari, Mr Lee said Singapore must not think that the re—arrest of the Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) leader is the end of its problem.</p>
              <p>He said the terrorism situation in Southeast Asia is under control, but the threat is far from over. He added that the price of security is eternal vigilance.</p>
              <p>In a statement to the media on Saturday, the Prime Minister also said information about the capture of Mas Selamat on 1 April was not made public earlier, because of a prior agreement with the Malaysian authorities.</p>
              <p>Mr Lee said he was told about the arrest by his Malaysian counterpart Najib Razak on 11 April during an impromptu four—eye lunch in Thailand’s Pattaya after the ASEAN meeting was called off due to demonstrations.</p>
              <p>He thanked Datuk Seri Najib for Malaysia’s generous support and help and told him Singapore’s Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Wong Kan Seng had earlier told him of the arrest.</p>
              <p>Mr Lee said he was happy and relieved that Mas Selamat had been found and arrested before he could do any harm.</p>
              <p>But Malaysia had asked Singapore to keep this information quiet for the time being, so Singapore respected this and held the information very tightly in order not to jeopardise the operation.</p>
              <p>But on May 7 afternoon during a weekly pre—Cabinet meeting lunch, Mr Wong received a phone call informing him that the Internal Security Department (ISD) had received a request from the The Straits Times to confirm a scoop that Mas Selamat had been arrested by the Malaysian authorities.</p>
              <p>As the news had leaked, the Singapore government had no choice but to confirm the story.</p>
              <p>Ministers who were present at the lunch were completely taken by surprise when Mr Wong told them that Mas Selamat had been arrested.</p>
              <p>In his statement, Mr Lee also thanked all officers involved in tracking down Mas Selamat over the past year.</p>
              <p>He said he never had a doubt that Mas Selamat would be found because he knew the quality and commitment of the ISD officers working on this.</p>
              <p>He said the ISD had recovered quickly from the mistakes which led to Mas Selamat’s escape from the Whitley Road Detention Centre in February last year.</p>
              <p>Mr Lee also thanked the ISD and its Malaysian counterpart, the Special Branch, for working closely together.</p>

              Yes. You can try to piece the bits and pieces together, but the media from either sides are also reading each other's reports and may or maybe counter each other's claim subtly (depending on the issue then). How sure are you about the facts then?
              
              We cannot compare the discrepencies from reports from both sides (as it would mean the facts do not tally) but can only confirmed what had happened based on the common facts that had been written.

              <p>Here is the Malaysian version of Singapore's PM press statement concerning the delay in publicly releasing the news.</p>
              <p>The reason for going public was due to the Malaysian Straits Times call to Singapore ISD for confirmation that MAS has been arrested by the Malaysian authorities.</p>
              <p>It seems that the Malaysian Straits Times had the resources to sniff out the news before the Singapore Straits Times, but could not get any confirmation from the Malaysian Authorities.</p>
              <p>Now Singapore's PM had said that the Singapore Government had no choice since the newspaper had a news scoop on this MAS affair and was waiting to go public.</p>
              <p>Questions need to be asked is -</p>
              <p>Had the silence continued by both the Malaysian and Singapore Authorities, could this news have been delayed further ?</p>
              <p>Was the Malaysian side consulted before the news was released publicly on both sides of the Causeway ?</p>

              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; font-size: 14px; color: #333333; font-family: Arial; margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 21px; padding: 0px;">Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said his deputy Wong Kan Seng had told him that the Malaysian authorities had arrested the suspected Jemaah Islamiah militant group’s leader, but the news could not be made public as it would jeopardise follow-up operations.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; font-size: 14px; color: #333333; font-family: Arial; margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 21px; padding: 0px;">“Kan Seng told me that the Malaysians had asked us to keep this quiet for the time being,” Lee said in a statement yesterday, adding that he then told his deputy that Singapore had to respect Malaysia’s request although he knew that Singaporeans would be anxious to know the news.</p>

              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; font-size: 14px; color: #333333; font-family: Arial; margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 21px; padding: 0px;">Malaysian authorities, which also confirmed the arrest yesterday, said Mas Selamat was captured by Special Branch early last month in Skudai, Johor, and was being detained under the Internal Security Act.</p>

It led to the first ever massive hunt by the city state authorities.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; font-size: 14px; color: #333333; font-family: Arial; margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 21px; padding: 0px;">Lee said he came to know about the leak in the press on Thursday afternoon when Kan Seng, who is also the Home Minister, received a phone call from The Straits Times while the rest of the Cabinet ministers were having lunch prior to their weekly meeting.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; font-size: 14px; color: #333333; font-family: Arial; margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 21px; padding: 0px;">His deputy said The Straits Times had called to ask the Internal Security Department (ISD) to confirm the newspaper’s scoop, which came from its Kuala Lumpur correspondent, that the Malaysian authorities had arrested Mas Selamat.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; font-size: 14px; color: #333333; font-family: Arial; margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 21px; padding: 0px;">“As the story had leaked, we had no choice but to confirm it,” said Lee. “It was only then that Kan Seng told the ministers that Mas Selamat had been arrested. They were taken completely by surprise.”</p>

              was greeted with relief by all and sundry. A head of the Singapore
              branch of the Jemaah Islamiyah, he was suspected to have harbored plans
              for acts of terror by crashing seven bomb-filled trucks within
              Singapore, and a plane into Changi Airport. He escaped from the Whitley
              Detention prison in February last year. According to official sources,
              it is the Internal Security Department (ISD) who gave Malaysians the
              lead on Mas Selamat’s trail, and “the ISD has redeemed itself” in doing
              so. The pertinent question is - what then are the political
              implications of his re-arrest?<br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>It has been reported that opposition parties have
              been eyeing Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC for the next General Elections (GE).
              The GRC is currently helmed by Mr Wong Kan Seng, the current minister
              for home affairs. Mas Selamat’s escape from Whitley last year was
              predicted to be the main topic of contention. Apparently, Mr Wong might
              have received some sort of boost or saving grace from the ISD’s
              so-called role in leading to Mas Selamat’s re-arrest. </strong></span>One
              thing for sure is that during such debates, both Mr Wong’s opponents
              and the audience at large should not be expecting Mr Wong to reveal the
              specifics of ISD’s involvement in Mas Selamat’s re-arrest. The modus
              operandi of tracking terrorists by an intelligence agency is usually
              kept classified away from the public’s eye. Making such secretive
              information public would compromise its work.<br> <br> During such a debate, dwelling on the specifics of Mas Selamat’s
              re-arrest is as good as missing the wood for the trees. The bigger
              picture should be a focus on potential lapses in security procedures in
              place at both sides of the causeway. There exist possibilities that
              individuals without passports could make it through the security
              barriers at both sides of the causeway.* <span style="color: red;"><strong>In
              the beginning of 2009, Madam Voon Chit Yin, a grandmother who suffers
              from mild dementia, managed to make it back into Singapore without her
              passport</strong></span>. The implication is that the security at both sides
              is not watertight, and individuals harboring nefarious plots of terror
              could have slipped through, and this is a cause for concern. <span style="color: red;"><strong>Took Leng How, Huang Na’s murderer managed to escape into Malaysia via the causeway before he was caught.**</strong></span><br> <br> Outstanding homeland security issues aside, political debates during a
              showdown at Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC should also touch on bread and butter
              issues. A member of the PAP team at Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC is Dr Ng Eng
              Hen, Minister for Education and Second Minister for Defense. Besides
              bread and butter issues, other debate topics could revolve around
              education and National Service (NS). For instance, NUS is ranked
              amongst the costliest universities in Asia. Dr Ng can be quizzed on any
              concrete plans by the education ministry to help students cope with
              their expenses, especially those who come from low income households.<br> <br> <strong>Edits</strong><br> *Contrary to an earlier point stating that Mas Selamat crossed the

              <p><strong>Mas Selamat capture: Who gets the credit?</strong></p>
              <p>http://www.littlespeck.com/content/security/CTrendsSecurity-090508.htm</p>
              <p><strong>Littlespeck.com, 9 May 2009, Seah Chiang Nee</strong><br> <br> That the dangerous Mas Selamat Kastari is back in custody is good news
              for Southeast Asia, and a testimony of Singapore-Malaysia cooperation.<br> <br> But it seems to have resulted in the controlled media of the two
              countries giving different slants of the arrest, so we'll have to wait
              for the official versions to know the truth.<br> <br> Here are some of the conflicting versions reported in their largest
              newspapers - The Star and The Straits Times – apparently after talking
              to official sources.<br> <br> <strong>(1) Joint operation?</strong><br> Straits Times: Sources told The Straits Times that Mas Selamat was
              tracked down based on intelligence provided by Singapore’s Internal
              Security Department (ISD), and a joint operation by Malaysia and
              Singapore’s security agencies eventually led to his arrest.<br> <br> The Star: The fugitive, who escaped from a Singapore maximum security
              detention centre (with two other suspects) was arrested in Johor by
              Malaysian Special Branch officers with the help of other police
              departments here. No mention of a joint operation with Singapore.<br> <br> Who is right? Was it a joint operation or a Malaysian one? For
              consideration: it is possible that the Malaysians do not want to tell
              their people that Singaporean Special branch was operating with them in
              Johor - if indeed it did happen.<br> <br> <strong>(2) Intelligence gathering<br> </strong>Straits Times: Sources told The Straits Times that Mas Selamat was
              tracked down based on intelligence provided by Singapore’s ISD.<br> <br> The Star: The sharing of information between three countries -
              Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia - has led to the arrest of Kastari
              who was hiding in Johor.<br> <br> <span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Translation: Unlike the Straits Times report, intelligence had not come from Singapore alone, but from Indonesia as well.</strong></span></span><br> <br> In addition there’s also the reward of S$1 million - offered for
              information leading to Kastari’s capture - to consider. Who will get it?<br> <br> <strong>‘Return to Singapore’</strong><br> There are potential obstacles to remove before Kastari can eb returned to continue his detention in Singapore.<br> <br> <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>While Singapore's
              government-controlled Channel News Asia (CNA) reported that Kastari is
              likely "to be returned to Singapore soon" the Malaysians are giving no
              indications of this.<br> <br> Instead their Home Minister, Hishamuddin Hussein, said it would depend
              on bilateral talks, implying that it is something to negotiate over.</strong></span><br> <br> Mas Selamat is now under Malaysia's own Internal Security Act (ISA).
              "He is under our detention and is being investigated right now. He was
              planning something which allows us to arrest him," he said.<br> <br> The implication is that Kuala Lumpur may have grounds to detain him for its own security reasons.<br> <br> If - only a remote if – the investigation were to turn up evidence that
              the 48-year-old suspect was plotting terrorism in Malaysia during the
              past year, he might possibly remain under Malaysian detention.<br> <br> <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>That would put Singapore in an embarrassing situation of seeing escaped detainee remaining outside its grasp.</strong></span><br> <br> The Singapore government, especially Home Affairs Minister, Wong Kan
              Seng, whose is blamed for Kastri's incredible escape 13 months ago,
              obviously wants Kastari back as quickly as possible.<br> <br> <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>The Malaysians, on the other hand,
              appear not to see any urgency in releasing their prize catch. Unless,
              of course, they can extract some benefits from it!</strong></span><br> <br> -------------------------<br> <span style="color: navy;"><strong>Latest updates at <a href="http://singaporenewsalternative.blogspot.com/">Singapore News Alternative</a></strong>:<br> <br> 1.

              who gets the credit is not as impt as who gets the million $ reward.
              
              The capture:
              Who gets the credit?
              Kastariâ€™s arrest and the claim for top credits: Who provided the crucial intelligence, and when will he be returned to Singapore? 
              By Seah Chiang Nee, littlespeck.com
              May 8, 2009
              
              That the dangerous Mas Selamat Kastari is back in custody is good news for Southeast Asia, and a testimony of Singapore-Malaysia cooperation. 
              
              But it seems to have resulted in the controlled media of the two countries giving different slants of the arrest, so we'll have to wait for the official versions to know the truth. 
              
              Here are some of the conflicting versions reported in their largest newspapers - The Star and The Straits Times â€“ apparently after talking to official sources. 
              
              (1) Joint operation?
              
              Straits Times: Sources told The Straits Times that Mas Selamat was tracked down based on intelligence provided by Singaporeâ€™s Internal Security Department (ISD), and a joint operation by Malaysia and Singaporeâ€™s security agencies eventually led to his arrest.
              
              The Star: The fugitive, who escaped from a Singapore maximum security detention centre (with two other suspects) was arrested in Johor by Malaysian Special Branch officers with the help of other police departments here. No mention of a joint operation with Singapore.
              
              Who is right? Was it a joint operation or a Malaysian one? For consideration: it is possible that the Malaysians do not want to tell their people that Singaporean Special branch was operating with them in Johor - if indeed it did happen.
              
              (2) Intelligence gathering
              
              Straits Times: Sources told The Straits Times that Mas Selamat was tracked down based on intelligence provided by Singaporeâ€™s ISD. 
              
              The Star: The sharing of information between three countries - Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia - has led to the arrest of Kastari who was hiding in Johor. 
              
              Translation: Unlike the Straits Times report, intelligence had not come from Singapore alone, but from Indonesia as well.
              
              In addition thereâ€™s also the reward of S$1 million - offered for information leading to Kastariâ€™s capture - to consider. Who will get it?
              
              â€˜Return to Singaporeâ€™
              
              There are potential obstacles to remove before Kastari can eb returned to continue his detention in Singapore.
              
              While Singapore's government-controlled Channel News Asia (CNA) reported that Kastari is likely "to be returned to Singapore soon" the Malaysians are giving no indications of this. 
              
              Instead their Home Minister, Hishamuddin Hussein, said it would depend on bilateral talks, implying that it is something to negotiate over.
              
              Mas Selamat is now under Malaysia's own Internal Security Act (ISA). "He is under our detention and is being investigated right now. He was planning something which allows us to arrest him," he said.
              
              The implication is that Kuala Lumpur may have grounds to detain him for its own security reasons. 
              
              If - only a remote if â€“ the investigation were to turn up evidence that the 48-year-old suspect was plotting terrorism in Malaysia during the past year, he might possibly remain under Malaysian detention. 
              
              That would put Singapore in an embarrassing situation of seeing escaped detainee remaining outside its grasp.
              
              The Singapore government, especially Home Affairs Minister, Wong Kan Seng, whose is blamed for Kastri's incredible escape 13 months ago, obviously wants Kastari back as quickly as possible. 
              
              The Malaysians, on the other hand, appear not to see any urgency in releasing their prize catch. Unless, of course, they can extract some benefits from it!

              <p>MSK was caught in an area known to be a breeding ground for JI - it looks as if the breeding ground continue to exist to breed new threats.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #003366; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold; line-height: normal; text-transform: uppercase;">HIDEOUT NEAR JI BREEDING GROUND</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #003366; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: normal;">KUALA LUMPUR: - While he was on the run, Mas Selamat Kastari found refuge in Skudai, a sprawling working-class town in Johor that many Singaporeans frequent for its Giant supermarket.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #003366; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: normal;">Malaysia's official news agency Bernama yesterday quoted a Special Branch source as saying Singapore's most-wanted terrorist was caught in the town, which is 25km north-west of Johor Baru and near Senai Airport. 'He has relatives in Skudai,' said the source.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #003366; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: normal;">About 15km away, across the North-South highway, is Ulu Tiram, another small town but notorious for being a breeding ground for Jemaah Islamiah (JI) terrorists.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #003366; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: normal;">A defunct religious school which groomed JI agents is located in the area, a place familiar to Mas Selamat, a JI leader of the Singapore terror network, as he spent time there some time in the 1990s.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #003366; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: normal;">Yesterday, Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak told reporters that the fugitive managed to enter Malaysia 'a few days' after escaping from the Whitley Road Detention Centre in Singapore.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #003366; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: normal;">His capture had taken place around the same time that the Malaysian authorities had nabbed three other people for suspected JI-linked activities.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #003366; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: normal;">They arrested Agus Salim, a 32-year-old Indonesian, on March 5, and two Malaysians, Abdul Matin Anol Rahmat, 60, and Johar Hassan, on April 1.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #003366; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: normal;">While the authorities yesterday refused to confirm if the three were linked to Mas Selamat, the timing of the arrests has raised speculation over whether all four were collaborating with one another in the alleged terror plot.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #003366; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: normal;">Mas Selamat was also nabbed on April 1 and the Star daily yesterday, quoting sources, said Malaysia's Special Branch had been on his trail for a month.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #003366; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: normal;">The Abolish ISA Movement, a group which calls for the Malaysian government to repeal the ISA, said Abdul Matin is the father-in-law of ex-ISA detainee Zaini Zakaria who was released late last year.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #003366; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: normal;">Mr Zaini, a suspected JI member, was an engineer allegedly recruited by Al-Qaeda to pilot a plane in a second wave of Sept 11-style attacks on the United States.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #003366; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: normal;">He was supposed to have travelled to in Afghanistan in 1999 and met senior figures in Al-Qaeda. He had a licence to fly a small plane but severed his ties with Al-Qaeda after he saw media coverage of the Sept 11 attacks, said reports.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #003366; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: normal;">Agus Salim was a cook in a restaurant at Larkin, Johor. According to reports here, his arrest was captured on video by the police, raising questions about whether Mas Selamat's arrest was also captured on video.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #003366; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: normal;">Abdul Matin was apprehended by 12 policemen in an operation around 7.30pm on April 1 in Johor Baru, said Chinese publication Merdeka Review in an April 17 report.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #003366; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: normal;">There has been no information on Johar Hassan.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #003366; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: normal;">Sources told The Straits Times that the trail that led to the arrests of Abdul Matin and Johar on April 1 also led to the capture of Mas Selamat on the same night.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #003366; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: normal;">At a press conference yesterday, Malaysian Home Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said Mas Selamat 'was planning something which allows us to arrest him'.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #003366; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: normal;">He declined to elaborate, including on when the fugitive would be handed over to Singapore, adding: 'I can't go into the details, it is too sensitive...This is something that I don't want to jeopardise.'</span></p>

              <p><span><span>SINGAPORE: Singapore's Senior
              Minister Goh Chok Tong said on Sunday that although Jemaah
              Islamiyah (JI) leader Mas Selamat Kastari has been captured, the
              threat of terrorism remains very real.<br> <br> <span style="color: #ff0000;">He said the fact that Mas Selamat was
              able to swim to Johor Bahru, despite Singapore's tightened border
              security following his escape from Whitley Road Detention Centre in
              February last year, showed that it is possible for a determined and
              trained terrorist to enter and leave Singapore
              undetected.<br></span><br> Mr Goh, who is currently warded in the Singapore General Hospital
              (SGH) for chicken pox, said fighting terrorism is like fighting an
              external virus like SARS or Influenza A (H1N1).<br> <br> Despite our best efforts, a terrorist or deadly virus may slip
              through our borders.<br> <br> Mr Goh said the best defence against terrorism is to always be
              vigilant and to maintain a domestic environment that is hostile to
              violence.<br> <br> The senior minister is expected to be discharged from SGH later
              this week.<br> <br> <br> - CNA/so<br></span></span></p>
