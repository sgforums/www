              <p>ChannelnewsAsia reported that Malaysian PM Najib had commented that MAS was plotting to launch a hit on Singapore when he was arrested.</p>
              <p>PM Najib also said that MAS had arrived into Malaysia <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ONE DAY</span></span> after he escaped from the Whitley Detention Centre..... this is shocking news. </p>
              <p>Is this disinformation, or is this detail accurate ?</p>
              <p>Is it possible for MAS to make his way to the northern coastline within 24 hours after his breakout from the detention centre ?</p>
              <p>This shows that MAS is a very, very resourceful person - to be able to organize himself in such desperate and pressing moments, even to make up an improvised flotation device to allow him to swim across the Straits of Johor.</p>
              <p>The improvised flotation device can be anything from a plastic box to a bunch of plastic bottles tied together that will support the weight of his body when he decide to rest midway across the water channel.</p>

              <p>I guess the improvised flotation device was cooked up as no one except mas know how he did it.</p>
              <p>What would happened to some one's face if he was to moved out singapore through the 2nd link ?</p>
              <p>What can I see on the media are:</p>
              <p>- Some one coming forward to claim credit when it was not his. He was no where to be seen after 2 weeks when mas took his holiday.</p>
              <p>- Some loopy fairy tale on how mas landed in mlysia without being detected.</p>
              <p>- Lots of boot licking sms sent to some one.</p>
              <p>- Conspiracy on mas planning some fireworks during his holiday. (WMD ??)</p>
              <p>- Some one fighting for his bonus.</p>
              <p>What was missing are:</p>
              <p>- A big thank you to all the army guys and police men who braved the elements of nature to track down mas during that 3 months.</p>
              <p>- A big thank you to our neighbours for ending the eat-wind trip of mas. (I have only read on how good our intelligence were and blab blab blab, no one was gracious enough to say thank you for the great assistence)</p>

              <p>If Malaysian PM Najib statement that MAS arrived into Malaysia within ONE Day after breaking out from the Whitley detention Center - then either he drove through the Causeway or Tuas Checkpoints within the two hours before the general alert for an island wide clamp down was made.</p>
              <p>The lorries and vehicles were not checked prior to the general alert being made.</p>
              <p>With the audacity, daring, ingenuity and cunning that MAS has displayed, this could be true.</p>
              <p>Given his nature, it will not be too far fetched to speculate that he was already planning to make a dramatic hit at Singapore.</p>
              <p>Considering that this piece of information came from the Malaysian side, some credibility could be given to their press release.</p>

              <p>Mas Selamat had not been formally charged at the time of his escape, and was being held under Singapore’s Internal Security Act which - like the Malaysian equivalent - allows for detention without trial.”</p>

              <p>u know.....either WKS is a brilliant tactician or absolute clown.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>MSK was captured on Apr 1 but on Apr 15, in a speech to the ISD, he mentioned that "MSK will be captured".</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Furthermore, as reported in ST today, Msian PM Najib says he has already informed PM Lee during the Pattaya Summit on Apr 10-11 that MSK has already been captured.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So either WKS is exuding pure brilliance by throwing everyone off guard to ensure that the covert ops to capture MSK is a success OR he's a complete idiot being kept in the dark about everything because of the way he has bungled this issue.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Well, see what he says in the press the next few days. If he doesn't claim credit for smoking everyone's eyes, then....he's a complete idiot! haha</p>

              The only fact that matters is that MAS is arrested. The rest of the issues that are disscussed here are just 'noise'. 
              
              For those who are trying to piece together information from here and there, are you really sure by doing so you will get a better picture? Let's face it, the media is also a dirty place. They publish what they want their readers to see. The Malaysian, Indonesian and Singapore papers will paint a positive picture of their own government or security agencies so that the citizen would have a 'feel good' effect. They are all propagating their own agenda, so do not read too much into it.
