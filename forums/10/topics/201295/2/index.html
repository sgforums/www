            <div class='col-md body'>Some observations:<br><br>1. <strong>Inexperienced doctors need to get experience </strong>- so how? Of course, some patient will always end up being the first case of some trainee doc. Doctor choice applies only to private full fee-paying docs. BUT please note that many consultants have not done procedures in years, so sometimes the best people are usually senior registrars or registrars in their 2 or third year!!<br><br>2. More importantly is the need to <strong>ensure adequate supervision</strong>.<br><br>3. Puncture of the heart is a <strong>known complication </strong>of thoracentesis and pleural biopsy - even in the best of hands, and even under radiological guidance.<br><br>4. In our restructured hospitals - they are also our training institutions. The aforementioned procedure takes approximately 1 hour to perform. It takes about 1 hour to organize all the pre-procedure blood tests and radiographs and to review the results. Post-procedure it takes half an hour to write the procedure note, get a post-procedure radiography and review the result. A trainee doc and a supervising doc if paid at locum rates (at least $60/hr) will put in about 2.5 hours getting this thing done (so labour cost - just doctors only not including ancillary staff) will be $300. The procedure equipment and peri-procedural tests etc would cost something. The last I was told way back in 1998 when I was helping out with these procedures was the private docs were charging about $1200 procedure fee.<br><br>So ..... I wonder how much this procedure would have been billed and what was actually paid by patient/medishield/medisave.<br><br>If you have truly instructor/clinical faculty supervision, who set aside time (ie, consultants, experienced registrar = time = &gt;$200/hr), clearly medical training/education and procedure costs will be very high.<br><br>WHO WANTS TO PAY?<br><br>I did my graduate medical training in the USA for 6 years, estimated to cost the US government $100 000/year - all free. + Great lifestyle and freedoms in the USA.

The procedure equipment and peri-procedural tests etc would cost something. The last I was told way back in 1998 when I was helping out with these procedures was the private docs were charging about $1200 procedure fee.<br><br>So ..... I wonder how much this procedure would have been billed and what was actually paid by patient/medishield/medisave.<br><br>If you have truly instructor/clinical faculty supervision, who set aside time (ie, consultants, experienced registrar = time = &gt;$200/hr), clearly medical training/education and procedure costs will be very high.<br><br>WHO WANTS TO PAY?<br><br>I did my graduate medical training in the USA for 6 years, estimated to cost the US government $100 000/year - all free. + Great lifestyle and freedoms in the USA. SINGAPORE CANNOT COMPETE!!!!<br><br>Now I am FT in USA ?!?!!?[/b]</blockquote>Years ago, we first trained to insert chest tubes by practising on cadavers...there were lots of unclaimed bodies in the mortuary in those days. By the time we first performed the procedure under supervision on a live patient, we had already done at least 5 insertions on dead bodies. Obviously, you have to practise on simple cases before going on to the complex ones.<br><br>Nowdays, young doctors do not have any dead bodies to practise on. What's worse is that many patients refuse to allow a junior doctor to do the procedure, which means we have medical officers who haven't even done a single chest tube insertion. In the past, housemen used to do 2-3 chest tube insertions every day!<br><br>With more patients refusing to allow our juniors to do procedures, we are just pushing the problem back. Our housemen do not perform any procedures and now we have more senior medical officers who are completely inexperienced with some procedures.<br><br>As for billing for this procedure, if the patient is a C class patient, they probably won't have to pay for the procedure anyway...their expenses are capped.</div>

As the expert witness pointed out, it was not a requirement to view the CT scan before performing the procedure. Further, even if the second doctor knew of the enlarged heart, it would have made no difference. The ward consultant, who would have known about the enlarged heart, nevertheless ordered the MO to perform the procedure. The consultant was not sufficiently worried to order the procedure to be performed under radiological guidance.<br><br>MOs should be competent to perform chest tube insertions, a procedure that used to be done routinely by more junior housemen. The problem is that junior doctors now have little opportunities to gain experience because the larger numbers of private patients refuse to allow junior doctors to do the procedure.<br><br>Ultimately, young doctors have to learn and pick up experience. If they do not learn from patients with simpler conditions, their first case might well be a difficult case like this one.<br><br>As always with cases like these, I fear the hospital response will be to limit chest tube insertions to even more senior doctors. But that is only prolonging the inevitable. If housemen and junior MOs are not allowed to perform such procedures, in a few years, we will have senior MOs and registrars who will be doing the procedure for the first time.<br><br>This case has everything to do with error of judgment and experience. That is why the court did not find any negligence relating to the two MOs. Of course the Coroner's verdict does not prejudice any subsequent litigation the family might bring, but they will have a high hurdle to clear.<br><br></div>
