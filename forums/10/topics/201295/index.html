            <div class='col-md body'>I can imagine what the doctors involved would have said;<br>"Oh, we didn't know her heart was swollen.."<br><br>Are doctors supposed to check? Take precautionary measures? Or is this another 'how much you can pay is what you get' kind of standard?<br><br>I say that there's no CRIMINAL negligence, but there's PROFESSIONAL negligence!!!<br><br>================================<br>She dies when doctors pierce her heart<br>Coroner rules the mistake was not the result of criminal negligence<br>July 22, 2006<br><br>SHE was warded for sudden wheezing, but died of a bleeding heart in hospital.<br><br>Doctors accidentally punctured Madam Lee Ah Hoe's heart with a trocar, a sharply pointed shaft.<br><br>It happened while they were trying to drain fluid from around her left lung on 5 Sep 2005.<br><br>Complications arose during the procedure because the patient had an enlarged heart.<br><br>Yesterday, State Coroner Tan Boon Heng recorded a verdict of misadventure in the 66-year-old's death.<br><br>While the coroner had 'no doubt' that Madam Lee's death was 'physician- induced', he ruled that the two doctors attending to her had not been criminally negligent.<br><br>NO CHARGES<br><br>The two potential defendants in the case, Dr Akash Verma, 33, and Dr Wijeweera Olivia, 25, will thus not have any charges brought against them.<br><br>It all started when Madam Lee was sent to Tan Tock Seng Hospital for sudden wheezing and stomach pains on 29 Aug 2005.<br><br>Dr Soon Puay Cheow, senior consultant and head of endocrinology, examined her on 3 Sep 2005 and found she had a large amount of fluid around her left lung.<br><br>He then instructed Dr Wijeweera, a medical officer in the department of general medicine, to drain the fluid and conduct a biopsy.<br><br>Dr Soon also told her to look for an experienced senior doctor who could supervise her during the procedure.<br><br>She approached Dr Verma, a senior medical officer in the department of respiratory medicine, and he agreed.<br><br>The procedure was scheduled for 1pm on 5 Sep 2005.<br><br>That day, Madam Lee was propped up in bed at 60 degrees while two student nurses helped hold her left arm above her head.<br><br>Under local anaesthesia, a 22-gauge hypodermic needle and syringe was inserted near her fourth rib under her left armpit.<br><br>When no fluid was drawn out, a larger 18-gauge needle was used instead. (Gauge is a term used to describe the thickness of needle. The smaller the gauge number, the bigger the needle.)<br><br>Blood-stained fluid was then drawn out. Next, a 2cm cut was made and a biopsy needle was inserted. After an adjustment to the needle, the fluid drained freely.<br><br>A chest tube was inserted and about 200ml of bloody fluid was drained.<br><br>But at this point, Dr Wijeweera noticed that Madam Lee was pale and had slumped down in the bed.<br><br>HEART BEATING TOO FAST<br><br>The patient's blood pressure could not be detected and her heart was beating too fast, at 120 beats per minute.<br><br>The chest tube was removed and the blood flow from the 2cm cut was manually blocked.<br><br>They immediately started to resuscitate Madam Lee. But her pulse became weaker and her heart pumped even faster.<br><br>The amount of oxygen in her heart started to fall while her blood pressure remained undetectable the whole time.<br><br>Ward Registrar Dr Chia Pow Li was called in to help while hospital staff tried to contact Madam Lee's family.<br><br>But after more than an hour of continuous resuscitation, Madam Lee died at 4.50pm.<br><br>The autopsy report stated the cause of death as heavy bleeding from the puncture of the heart's left ventricle following the insertion of the chest tube.<br><br>After a discussion with the ward consultant, Dr Soon decided to call for a coroner's inquiry.<br><br>Further investigations revealed that Dr Wijeweera had seen Madam Lee's enlarged heart from the same CT scan which showed the fluid around her left lung. However, she did not inform Dr Verma, who had not seen the CT scan, about this condition before the chest tube insertion started.<br><br>INDEPENDENT EXPERT<br><br>Dr Lim Chong Hee, senior consultant at the National Heart Centre's department of cardiothoracic surgery, was called as an independent medical expert to give his opinion on whether there was any medical negligence.<br><br>His report noted that there was no requirement to view the CT scan of the chest before the chest tube insertion.<br><br>But it would have been wise for Dr Verma to have done so in this case because he was unfamiliar with the patient's case and the CT scan was already available.<br><br>Dr Lim also noted that the inexperienced Dr Wijeweera should have prepared for the case thoroughly.<br><br>She should also have informed the supervising doctor of any abnormality, such as an enlarged heart.<br><br>However, the coroner, citing Dr Lim, noted that there was 'no lack of care given to the deceased' and the incident was 'entirely accidental'.<br><br>One of Dr Lim's suggestions: In future, difficult and complicated cases should be referred to thoracic surgeons for consultation and tubes should be placed with X-ray guidance.<br></div>
