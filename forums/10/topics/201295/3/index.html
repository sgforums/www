            <div class='col-md body'>That's why I said that if there is any fault, it lies with the ward consultant for delegating it to a MO. The consultant did not think that the enlarged heart necessitates a radiology-guided procedure and in fact, all of us have performed left-sided chest tubes in patients with enlarged hearts before without problem. It all depends on the degree of heart enlargement and the skill of the operator. We do not know how big the heart is, the ward consultant knew, and decided that his MO could handle it. He was wrong.<br><br>Every doctor should take proper care when performing a procedure in all patients. I am not sure I undrestand how one can take 'more care' when doing a particular case and 'less care' with other cases. However, knowing the heart is enlarged may mean that the doctors might abort the procedure earlier and ask for radiological guidance. However, that is pure speculation and the court cannot predict what the doctors would have done differently had they known about the enlarged heart. The expert witness apparently did not think that it would make a material difference and the court has accepted his evidence.<br><br>As for the force required, chest tube insertion does require a fair amount of force, depending on the gauage of the trochar and the patient's musculature. There is a give when the trochar clears the chest wall and therefore it is important to prevent the trochar from going too far in when the resistance of the chest wall suddenly gives way. I suspect that was how the MO penetrated the heart. If the patient had been moving during the procedure, the position of the trochar might have changed and that might contribute to penetration of the heart as well.<br><br>That is why it is so important that junior doctors must gain experience from doing lots of procedures on live patients with simpler conditions. The way I see it: the problem in this case isn't that the MO didn't exercise enough care, I think it is a matter of competence and experience.<br><br>That said, even in the best of hands, penetration of the lung (more common), heart and even liver and spleen have been reported. It is a known complication of the procedure, although with experience, the complication rate obviously falls.<br><br>However, I do not understand why the ward consultant decided on a chest tube instead of a pleural tap. If there was a large effusion, it would be easy to tap it with a small needle from the back. You will not clear all the fluid, but it should relieve the breathlessness significantly. After all, if the effusion is due to her failing heart, it will re-collect unless the diuretics and digoxin work.<br><br>In a patient with an enlarged heart, that would be much safer and the worse that can happen is that you puncture the lung and cause a pneumothorax, which is far better than puncturing the heart.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Is the consultant aware of the findings of the CT-scan? We are assuming that he knows that the heart is very enlarged. It has to be. Puncturing the liver or the spleen are known complications, but these organs are just adjacent to the chest wall. In comparison, the heart, which is quite centrally located, has to be pretty enlarged to be anywhere close to the chest muscles.<br><br>As to how they can be "more careful" as compared to "less careful" or "always careful", the point is that if both are aware of how big the heart is, and still elected to go ahead with the procedure, at the very least they are very conscious of the fact that the heart is very close to the pleural muscles. And if they are not confident, don't do it. As doctors, they should "first do no harm".<br><br>The issue here is, the guiding doctor is not aware of the enlarged heart because first, the junior doctor did not say. Second, that guiding doctor did not bother to check. Isn't it a doctor's duty to review through every single radiological test, especially one so pertinent to this planned procedure, before proceeding with it?<br><br>Now assuming that the senior consultant knows the CT scan results, I still do not think the consultant should be implicated, simply because if these two doctors think they are not up to it, they should say so, and ask for senior assistance. The point is, it seems that the more senior of the two, who is supervising the procedure, is not even aware of the enlarged heart of the patient.<br><br>As the expert witness puts is, "it would have been wise for Dr Verma to have done so in this case because he was unfamiliar with the patient's case and the CT scan was already available."<br><br>The same witness also "noted that the inexperienced Dr Wijeweera should have prepared for the case thoroughly."<br><br>I really hope this case serves as a sad warning that all doctors should review their patients thoroughly before performing any procedures.</div>

Although this will not influence the results of any subsequent civil litigation, it increases the likelihood that a second judge will come to the same decision.<br><br>The ward consultant will be liable if the junior doctors are found liable, by virtue of vicarious liability. As far as I understand, the ward consultant based his decision ask the the MO to insert the chest tube based on the chest X-rays, not the CT scan. In other words, even if the CT scan had not been done, it would not have influenced his decision.<br><br>In negligence, you have to establish duty of care, dereliction of duty, causation and damage. If you try to argue that failure to review the CT scan was the negligent act, you have to establish that the act directly led to damage. Since even the expert witness testified that it wasn't a requirement to view the CT scan before doing the chest tube insertion, you have a problem trying to establish dereliction of duty beyond the standard of Bolam's test. Further, if the ward consultant would have ordered the procedure anyway irregardless of the scan results, unless the MOs would refuse to proceed had they seen the CT scan (highly unlikely if the consultant told them to go ahead), you have a problem trying to establish causation.<br><br>We do not know exactly where the trochar was inserted. Normally the risk of cardiac trauma is very low even if the heart is very enlarged, as long as it is inserted correctly. It is more likely that the angle or the site of insertion was incorrect, perhaps because the patient moved during the procedure.<br><br>Yes, this patient is already dead. The more important issue is how to prevent such occurrences. One element of the solution is to get junior doctors to do more such procedures under adequate supervision. If junior doctors do not get enough of such experience, we will have increasing senior doctors who lack the expertise.</div>

A doctor with a sense of responsibility would review all investigations before performing a procedure or operation. But it would not be easy to prove this technical detail in a court of law that if the 2 doctors had borne in mind what the CT thorax showed, then this tragic incident would DEFINITELY not have occured.

Although this will not influence the results of any subsequent civil litigation, it increases the likelihood that a second judge will come to the same decision.<br><br>The ward consultant will be liable if the junior doctors are found liable, by virtue of vicarious liability. As far as I understand, the ward consultant based his decision ask the the MO to insert the chest tube based on the chest X-rays, not the CT scan. In other words, even if the CT scan had not been done, it would not have influenced his decision.<br><br>In negligence, you have to establish duty of care, dereliction of duty, causation and damage. If you try to argue that failure to review the CT scan was the negligent act, you have to establish that the act directly led to damage. Since even the expert witness testified that it wasn't a requirement to view the CT scan before doing the chest tube insertion, you have a problem trying to establish dereliction of duty beyond the standard of Bolam's test. Further, if the ward consultant would have ordered the procedure anyway irregardless of the scan results, unless the MOs would refuse to proceed had they seen the CT scan (highly unlikely if the consultant told them to go ahead), you have a problem trying to establish causation.<br><br>We do not know exactly where the trochar was inserted. Normally the risk of cardiac trauma is very low even if the heart is very enlarged, as long as it is inserted correctly. It is more likely that the angle or the site of insertion was incorrect, perhaps because the patient moved during the procedure.<br><br>Yes, this patient is already dead. The more important issue is how to prevent such occurrences. One element of the solution is to get junior doctors to do more such procedures under adequate supervision. If junior doctors do not get enough of such experience, we will have increasing senior doctors who lack the expertise.  </div></blockquote>In this regard, you are saying that NEGLIGENCE cannot be proven just because an <strong>"expert witness" testified that it wasn't a requirement to view the CT scan </strong>?

You can have all the theory lessions in the world but it is a very different experience when you have to do it on a live patient. All medical practitioners will tell you that.
