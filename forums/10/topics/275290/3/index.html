How are companies going to find people if jobs don't get advertised? The reason i am asking is that i am in the midst of looking for a job and any info would be great.</div></blockquote>From your reply, I can accept that you are really new to job market.<br><br>No problem.<br><br>Just think of it a simpler way. If jobs created is x number, and you think these are all advertised,  then isn't the job ad not showing enough jobs that are really created? Just count and tell me how many jobs are advertised compared to job creation figures.<br><br>Examples of Jobs that are not advertised:<br><br>1. Internal staff recommendation.<br><br>2. Staff transfer from dept A to B.<br><br>3. Job Agencies by word of mouth, network, sources other than newspapers like Monster (this is not newspaper ad. It is a website full of jobs of the world, not just singapore. Feel free to visit to understand more.) Ok, its arguable that this is also a form of advertisement. But other than monster, many agents rely on their network and build up their own database of professionals. And some other ways which I cannot reveal. You dun pay me so I no need reveal the secret. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>4. some other reasons I too tired to think now.<br><br>Another thought I have while replying to your post:<br><br>1. Job Creation figures.  Can anyone out there advise, If a job is removed , that is job position terminated in singapore or relocated to China, and a new job position created. Does this mean 1 new job is created even though the NETT number of jobs EXISTING now remains the same?<br><br>2. How about this way.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>1000 jobs gone extinct. 100 new jobs created.  What does this mean?</strong></span><br><br>Any comments welcome.<br><br>Cheers.<br><br></div>

They usually do not even reveal their client's name and clear job specification. A client can have as many agent as they want to help them search. Usually, there is no need to search. There are resumes floating around all the time. There is no real need to advertise on expensive newspaper , TV or radio. Singapore is a tiny job market. The number of candidates are just so few. By now all agencies have all our records. What they need is call / email you for constant update and check if you are on the look-see-look-see.  Once you reply them, they can safely assume you are thinking already.<br><br>I shall ask again and hope for clarification:<br><br>1. Hypothesis: 1000 jobs gone extinct.  100 jobs got created.<br>Questions:<br>A.     How many jobs get created ?    then<br>How many jobs get created NETT?<br><br>B.     How many of these created jobs went to locals / PRs / Foreigners?<br><br>C.     How much difference in salary between extinct jobs and new jobs?<br><br>I looked at the news this weekend and still, as usual, I cannot find this answer in an article reporting about job growth.<br><br>I dreamt that if I become the perm sec of Manpower, I can bring down the unemployment rate to sub 1 %. I mean, if I go by number system, if you know what I mean.<br><br></div>
