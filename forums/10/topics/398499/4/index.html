              <p>Paying the best, does not imply you get the best talents, a monopolised govt dun need to have much talent, afterall, you dun have to compete, more so with an ever "Yes sir" kind of citizens who dun oppose to any of their decision and laws making., what kind of talent are you talking about, even mistake make can be claimed as honest mistake without any punishment.</p>
              <p>Let take an example, the Current Minister of Education said that the weightage of Chinese in PSLE should be lower, and then the PM LHL came out and said no, it was never the case, and the MOE Minister apologised by saying the wrong usage of words is the culprit...you call that talents?? 5 millions paycheck for both of them and you call that talent??? and the funniest part is everyone keep quiet like no mistake was make and some even praise the govt. OMG! If there is competition, I think they are going to get it, and the MOE minister can pack his back and go home. In a Corporate world, if you make a wrong speech, resulting in the mistrust and misunderstanding of the customer, your competitors will kill you straight off to point out the mistake, and your boss would have lost a huge business and end up you getting boot off the office. But our govt is on mono mode here, no one is challenging them, so what kind of talent is there to show for...even a kopitiam towkay also can become a minister.</p>
              <p>And if you are PM, who wrote you own and your ministers paid structure, do you think he will opts for lower paid??? No. So, he will paid himself high and when he paid himself high, he also have to pay his ministers high, otherwise there will be a big gap within the paid structure. </p>

              <p>politicians salary high while most of the  people cant even fully pay up for a flat,some deciding to get a 1 room studip apartment which resembles a coffin and others may not even have food to fill up stomach currently even though they are highly educated!!!</p>
              <p>THE ABOVE IS AS GOOD AS A FAILED STATE WHERE POLITICIANS HAVE PLENTY OF FOOD AND MONEY WHILE COMMON FOLKS HAVE ONLY AN ARSENIC PILL FOR HOPE!What hope is there for a state such as thus???</p>
              <p>its like going to burger king and they claiming they have the biggest burgers and u discover upon ordering that the burger is huge but the bun is wafer thin and lacks lettuce and sauce!!!!theres no proportion and that hambyburger looks damn odd and strange!</p>
              <p>or like u go eat laksa and they claim they have the best hums and big juicy ones.upon ordering that bowl of laksa u do discover they have huge hums or cockles in the laksa noodles but the taste of the spice is absent,,,tastes like dish cloth water and the noodles are less than the normal standard amount!</p>
              <p>or you goto the local kentucky fried chiken that claims they have the best tasting spicy fried chicken.upon ordering u discover that there is plenty of spice and delicious flour coating on the chicken but the chicken is as small as a pigeon...but they have lotsa spicy delicious fried flour to take up what should be chicken!</p>
              <p>PAP should know they are really living on borrowed time and other peoples hardwerk and money!!by telling everyone they have plenty is like trying to paint a moustache on a mona lisa or making thing look weird and taste weird.spore really looks like a cheap and dirty meal  bought from a streetside food vendor with no class somewhere in a 3rd world nation in the desert wasteland of somali!</p>

              <p>In any organization there is a pay grage and pay range for all levels of appointment. say for a waiter the range is 800-1200. 1200 is the maximum. once you hit that that's it unless the waiter upgrdes or get promoted to captain. then if captain slary range is 1200-1800 once that ceiling's hit that's it. moreover say waiter may have overtime claims while captain has non. captain may in turn enjoy other privileges or benefits that a waiter is not entitled to.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>similar for ministers there has to be amiinimum starting and ceiling for any specific official grade. Comparing sg and us living standards and power of the dollar how can minister pay higher than a president's? are there not ceilings? There should be an international guide on gahmen's salary range. what if one day an opposition or a ruling party decision making be corrupted and manipulate the pay grade to his or her own advanatge how? there should be some external neutral party or law to maintain this balance. high pay does not mean there will never be one corruption in future. losing huge amounts of money in investment is similar. there whould be punishment dealt no matter if you are the father or the country or what.</p>

              <p>In any organization there is a pay grage and pay range for all levels of appointment. say for a waiter the range is 800-1200. 1200 is the maximum. once you hit that that's it unless the waiter upgrdes or get promoted to captain. then if captain slary range is 1200-1800 once that ceiling's hit that's it. moreover say waiter may have overtime claims while captain has non. captain may in turn enjoy other privileges or benefits that a waiter is not entitled to.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>similar for ministers there has to be amiinimum starting and ceiling for any specific official grade. Comparing sg and us living standards and power of the dollar how can minister pay higher than a president's? are there not ceilings? There should be an international guide on gahmen's salary range. what if one day an opposition or a ruling party decision making be corrupted and manipulate the pay grade to his or her own advanatge how? there should be some external neutral party or law to maintain this balance. high pay does not mean there will never be one corruption in future. losing huge amounts of money in investment is similar. there whould be punishment dealt no matter if you are the father or the country or what.</p>

              <p>Are u so sure that every organisation there is a set of pay range...and even so, such range can be adjusted as and when the boss likes..So, if the boss is a wage earner like our PM and SM, they can alway adjust their paid range to a higher percentile with a wider range beyong the 1.5 ratio. And in doing so, they will need to increase the range of their subordinates the likes of Ministers and MPs so as to close the gap. All these are reviewed, chopped, approved and signed by the one who is getting it. That is why Ministers paid are ever increasing, and that is also why we got the highest paid govt here. There is simply no check and balance, no auditing and certainly, no third party except one Ah Ney sitting inside istana waiting for them to give instruction, they said sign, he signed, sit, he sat, stand, he stood up.</p>
              <p>In the like of democractic countries like the west or US of A, the congress make the decision, they must go thru the congress to get the vote of paid increase before they can get increase..but in Singapore, give Ah Ney one prata and one bottle of Johnny walker, he sign everything blindly..after, they fed him.</p>

              <p>Yes. MNC and most recognised firms does that. And their appointment letters also all standard. Their HR also openly states the pay range from junior levels to senior management levels. The others taht never do are chinamen and family business type ones. Rarely these organization adjust the pay grade. Because they adjust it higher they have to pay more. So that;s why many people come and go, esp young one and fresh grad once their ceiling is hit. those that stay are old ones no qulaification thats why alwasy try to sabotage new people that enters with a higher position than them alsways trying to get promoted to a position they not qualify always grumbling about the company, bad mouth people and curse gahmen.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>same for gahmen why alwasy increase ceiling and pay grade. you mean like that can attract good people or retain good people? how many times salary adjusted? governance is sacrifice for the people not earning big bucks in the name of anti-conruption or conruption priacy.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>what about failing in investments? should that ne pinalized? the responsible official should resign and pay back the loss.</p>
