              <p>while the technicians and engineers salary are unable to make ends meet at most multi national companies in singapore.</p>
              <p>so political ministers get $1,000,000/year who didnt build anything apart from promising cheap land for factories to be built on and cheap werkers while the technicians and engineers who build up the country in spore get $24,000/year or less!!!</p>
              <p>$24,000/year or even  $36,000/year is insufficient for any savings for anyone in spore!most multi national companies only have a life span of 10 years in spore before reloacting to even more cheaper countries.then what???</p>
              <p>and with singapore employer culture and evolution insisting that people around 40 years old are too old for any job no matter how well educated and well experienced by the decade....then what??jobless ???and what about the savings???wont it all be used up in spore???and without any source of welfare and finances from any bank to help.....its almost IMPOSSIBLE to survive in spore even if U WANTED TO SURVIVE IN SPORE.</p>
              <p>WHILE THEY GET MILLIONS FR NOT DOING UP THE SALARIES OF SINGAPOREANS AND EXPECT SPOREANS TO EAT NUTS AND TREE BARK FOR MEALS.....THEY LAVISH ON GIANT LOBSTERS EVERY DAY AND US$MILLION SALARIES EVERY YEAR.</p>
              <p>MAYBE IT COULD BE EVEN $MILLION DOLLAR SALARY EVERY MONTH FOR EACH OF THEM FROM LOOKS OF IT ALL!</p>

              <p>if you cannot make it in life, dun blame this and that lah, even give you  minimum wages, the word "minimum" can also kill you. If you set a minmum wage, wages will not become flexible, and bosses can exploit you with a minimum wage even tho you can get a higher wage.</p>
              <p>Problem to individual who cannot make it in life is not about minimum wages or high cost of living, it about each individual mentality. If the mindset is fix on a blaming culture, given a minimum or no minimum wage, individual will still blame this and that, but forgot to blame themselves. There is a layman term called "No body owe you a living", you life is in your own hands, and if the hands and body cannot control the mind, the mind will take over, and the mind is usually very good in blaming and laziness</p>

              <p>life is in your hands, the external enviroment is uncertain, and certainly not your life, it is every individual, as an adult, to be responsbible for his/her life and respond to the changes with an ever changing mentality.  But if dun change, it is ok,  nobody will blame you, but you certianly cannot blame no body  in return.</p>
              <p>If i sell beer at $10/bottle in comparing to $5.50 outside kopitiam, it is up to individual to patronise me, the life is in his hand, whether he wants to drink at kopitiam with ah peks and uncles with old tiger aunties or Carlberg PRC partimers or he wants to come my pub with full aircon and 3 gals on your laptop enjoying the slow music all the way...it all up to him.</p>
              <p>But nobody drinking in kopittiam will blame that they got no money to drink in pub, and nobody in pub will also blame that the drink is too expensive when they have more money to spend.  This type of cost in economic terms is called opportunity cost.  A diversion of oppportunity cost can sway any economic indicators. Opportunity cost is a cost an individual wish to spend or put his/her money in the economic market,meaning a selling and buying market. And his or her decision in one way or the other determine the market movement. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It all voice down to you,  if you dun move, nothing move, u can grumbles and complaints all you like, but after a while, people also get use to your grumblings and complainings. </p>

              <p>ANGEL7030:If i sell beer at $10/bottle in comparing to $5.50 outside kopitiam, it is up to individual to patronise me, the life is in his hand, whether he wants to drink at kopitiam with ah peks and uncles with old tiger aunties or Carlberg PRC partimers or he wants to come my pub with full aircon and 3 gals on your laptop enjoying the slow music all the way...it all up to him.</p>
              <p>ANS: JB has $6/bottle and they have way more beautiful carlberg prc in malaysia and 7 gals on laptop.its aircon too plus free room for the night if over $100.so how???u need to reduce price to stay afloat....then what happens if bar next to u sells beer at $7/bottle and has all the same stuff n aircon as u???of course u have to reduce to $7/bottle too and maybe less even to prevent closure.</p>
              <p>kopitiam is different...they drink for the sake of drinking and talking with frends about serious werk over a pint of beer.like those beer pubs u see in england,u dont see barmaids on all the customers laps do u???hey ,,,,men are not sex maniacs just cuz they are drinking beer.</p>
