              <p>Indeed, living in Singapore is expensive.  And it looks like it's gonna get even more expensive in the near future.  At current prices, just buying a HDB flat will cost an average Singaporean more than 20 years of hard work and savings.  If HDB prices continue to rise, it's gonna get even worse.</p>

              <p>Pros and Cons, if you leased a HDB, your current asset increases, and you will feel confident and delighted, but if you are on the market looking for a resale flat, god bless you.</p>
              <p>I have alway emphasis that it is not the govt who make the decision, it the people, if the people move as one, the govt will have to give way, but if people are individualistic, the govt will take advantages, being multi racial is actually a advantage to the govt, because different racial cannot mix up together due to different perspectives, and LKY plays it into our lives, end up all voting for PAP even tho you can hear some complaining here and there, but at the ballot table, most ticked PAP. So, do you want to blame the govt or the people who chose them. You hv to impartial in saying that the govt make all the decision and they are taking high pays. If by and large, PAP lost this election, the scenerios of high paid will be wipe off.</p>

              <p>Please do not attack the ministers salary.</p>
              <p>In my opinion, it is a good thing, not a bad thing.</p>
              <p>It is important to maintain an attractive and competitive renumeration package, so that the top talents of a society can easily move back and forth and permeate and have easy traffic, between politics and other realms.</p>
              <p>In this way, the political spots can attract the cream of the society.</p>
              <p>If not, only a certain type of people will be in politics.</p>
              <p>Politics will be compartmentalized and segregated from the rest of the other realms.</p>
              <p>The people there will be slow, bureaucratic, class-B type of people, easy to bribe, corrupt, and / or overly ideological in a certain way.</p>
              <p>In theory, there is nothing wrong with ministers high salary.</p>
              <p>As an example, I always say, we must look at the salary of policemen and teachers.</p>
              <p>Singapore's policemen and teachers are well paid by world's standards. In Singapore, after you are in a traffic violation, you will not dare to offer the policeman "coffee money".</p>
              <p>But just a stone's throw away, in Malaysia and Indonesia, it is a common practice.</p>
              <p>University graduates also enter into teaching profession. Teachers are relatively well paid and they can concentrate on their jobs. In other countries, university graduates dont want to enter the teaching profession and teaching is seen as dead-end career.</p>
              <p>Now, do you support the cutting of salary of policemen and teachers?</p>
              <p>Most people would say no.</p>
              <p>But why do you propose the cutting of salary of ministers?</p>
              <p>Same theory. Since they are supposed to be top visionary leaders, and they sit at a higher peak in the organizational pyramid chart, they need to be compensated with higher renumeration.</p>
              <p>They need to have attractive salary, just like what happen with the policemen and teachers.</p>
              <p>Please dont attack this policy.</p>
              <p>In my opinion, it is barking up the wrong tree.</p>

              <p>Would you use the same arguments for teachers and policemen as well?</p>
              <p>Teachers.....is teaching the next generation....instilling new values...shaping the future.....very noble right? So teachers can just be paid some decent amount, no need very much.</p>
              <p>How about policemen?</p>
              <p>They uphold the law, defend citizens, protect society.....such a noble occupation....so people should be motivated, no need to pay attention to the salary.</p>
              <p>If you can see from these arguments, it is just the same theory with ministers.</p>
              <p>No need to cut their salaries, anyways, Singapore budget is quite balanced, it is Ok, No problem and no need to cut it.</p>

              <p>I understand what you are saying, but I disagree with that.</p>
              <p>Why wouldnt the same arguments be used for policemen and teachers?</p>
              <p>The reason is because, despite altruistic motivations, humans also need financial compensation.</p>
              <p>There is really no need to depend solely on altruistic motivations only, and I think that will be disastrous.</p>
              <p>And you mentioned about private sector. This is my second part of arguments, in that, if there is not too much gap between public and private sector, there will be easier traffic between the two.</p>
              <p>At the current moment, lots of ministers and MPs are doctors and lawyers. This can be seen as something positive. At least they are do-ers and they have already succeeded in their life and their private sector profession.</p>

              <p>Please do not attack the ministers salary.</p>
              <p>In my opinion, it is a good thing, not a bad thing.</p>
              <p>It is important to maintain an attractive and competitive
                  renumeration package, so that the top talents of a society can
                  easily move back and forth and permeate and have easy traffic,
                  between politics and other realms.</p>
              <p>In this way, the political spots can attract the cream of the
                  society.</p>
              <p>If not, only a certain type of people will be in politics.</p>
              <p>Politics will be compartmentalized and segregated from the rest
                  of the other realms.</p>
              <p>The people there will be slow, bureaucratic, class-B type of
                  people, easy to bribe, corrupt, and / or overly ideological in a
                  certain way.</p>
              <p>In theory, there is nothing wrong with ministers high
                  salary.</p>
              <p>As an example, I always say, we must look at the salary of
                  policemen and teachers.</p>
              <p>Singapore's policemen and teachers are well paid by world's
                  standards. In Singapore, after you are in a traffic violation, you
                  will not dare to offer the policeman "coffee money".</p>
              <p>But just a stone's throw away, in Malaysia and Indonesia, it is
                  a common practice.</p>
              <p>University graduates also enter into teaching profession.
                  Teachers are relatively well paid and they can concentrate on their
                  jobs. In other countries, university graduates dont want to enter
                  the teaching profession and teaching is seen as dead-end
                  career.</p>
              <p>Now, do you support the cutting of salary of policemen and
                  teachers?</p>
              <p>Most people would say no.</p>
              <p>But why do you propose the cutting of salary of ministers?</p>
              <p>Same theory. Since they are supposed to be top visionary
                  leaders, and they sit at a higher peak in the organizational
                  pyramid chart, they need to be compensated with higher
                  renumeration.</p>
              <p>They need to have attractive salary, just like what happen with
                  the policemen and teachers.</p>
              <p>Please dont attack this policy.</p>
              <p>In my opinion, it is barking up the wrong tree.</p>

              <p>i think you are mixing things up here or you are confused. no one is asking LHL and his lackeys to take home $4500/mth. however, i think it will do LHL's public service credentials a whole lot of good if he can halve his salary of $2m+. $1m/year is still hell alot of money in my opinion.</p>
              <p>also, it is presumptuous to say that all our current and previous ministers will earn big bucks had they stayed in the private sector. take our beloved wong kang seng for instance; he was a hr manager @ an mnc b4 joining politics. i would wager my meager 1mth salary to bet that he will not be earning close to what he is now if he were to stay in the private sector. and also a recent perm sec who tried to bring hip into the government by rapping and breakdancing, probably triple his salary since joining politics than during his private sector days. and not all lawyers/doctors will earn $m salary. maybe $2-300k/year or slightly more, which is still great in all accounts but not at the level the government would want us to believe.</p>
              <p>i agree that money politics played out in our friendly neighbouring countries ain't a pretty sight, but neither is ours. some would argue that legitimizing it is even worse.</p>

              <p><br>No. If a person is weak in the mind he will be corrupted. If he is strong and wants to do good to the people then he don't have to draw sky high salaries to do that. Of course we are not asking ministers to draw low salary, or salary that is not on par or competitive at all against the rpivate sectors. But see that sg money lost in investments i feel that there must be an internation rule or law that governments minister of sate salary.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now see, a president of a powerful continent drawing less tahn a minister of a small island country?</p>
