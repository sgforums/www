              <p>Well, I must admit that the sg gahmen's salary should not be that high. Wonder what is it for? Bribing the minister so they dun take bribes? What stupid reason those were... And what do they mean when they say they need to cover everything so they can focus on the more important issues?</p>
              <p>I guess that they focus on the wrong thing like increasing their pay checks and forgot to focus on us, the tax payers.</p>
              <p>Issue like crowded roads... Resolve by increased erp, road tax, COE while still issuing new COE? That sure sounds like a good solution to their salary increasement issue and not to the core of the problem.</p>
              <p>The public transport in Singapore is not improving despite their aim in maximising public instead of private transport in singapore. The low supply and the increase of transportation charges are not resolving the problem at all.</p>
              <p>Not to mention that the people who took public transport is like increased many folds with the increase of FTs, not to mention that actual SG'reans who couldn't secure a job increase by many folds as well.</p>
              <p>So... I still do not see which part of our nation's issue that they foccus on.</p>
              <p>You say the new casinos are one of their resolution... but then... how many FTs are there in the organisation?</p>

              <p>that's why Govt only tax heavily on the richs who can afford car, coe, erp, road tax, and of course Gst. Poor men and women just go kopitiam or food court, take bus, walks, cycle, shop at Seng Siong can already.</p>
              <p>Gst is mend to help the poor ya, but the poors want to act rich, then govt also cannot help liao.</p>
              <p>In singapore, it is very funny, the richs are trying to evade taxes as much as possible, and the poor who are suppose to gain from rebate and tax less like to go buy luxury goods and spent wildly leading to them having to pay Gst too. And when they cannot make it at the end of the day, blame the govt for high cost of living, in the first place, who ask them to spent unwisely resulting in their on loan car being tow away and house being force to sell...at a lower price, making the rich...richer</p>

              <p>im for meritocracy if everyone have an equal chance.</p>
              <p>but somehow the system seem to be rigged against those at the lower rungs of the social ladder.</p>
              <p>the rich are getting richer, and the poor, getting poorer.</p>
              <p>lets not talk about the extremes cases of rich and poor. just from the perspective of an young adult entering the work force.</p>
              <p>the baby boomers generation had it good, being the majority of house owners and car owners. they lived in a time where they are able to clear off their housing debt in less than a decade. around 5-8 years. and they also live through a period where they see their property rise astronomically, from a 60k 4-rm flat, to close to 400k.</p>
              <p>they also lived through a period of cheap cars. cheap condos. in other words, it is easier for them to fulfil the singapore dream of attaining the 5Cs.</p>
              <p>today, young adults face stiff competition from foreign counterparts, which are chiefly responsible for the artificial depression of wages in singapore. just take a look at australia, where the supply of cheap labour is limited, and generally everyone have a higher standard of living. according to the straits time, a bricklayer could earn up to $5k per month after 5 years of work. and australia doesn't seem to be crumbling without cheap labour. everything is still functional.</p>
              <p>imagine, this too can be the case in singapore, if cheap labour is limited.</p>
              <p>and the argument that big countries like australia have natural resources to rely on. but ask ourselves, how many of their people actually work on farms and mines? in fact, most of them live in cities just like we do in singapore, working the same jobs as we do in singapore. if they can afford to pay that kind of salary, and still have a functional economy, i don't see why singapore couldn't do the same.</p>
              <p>competition aside, the cost of living has also spiral out of control. just a few months back, 40k could buy you a mitsubishi lancer. today, it is barely enough to buy that piece of paper called the COE.</p>
              <p>while housing prices have risen astronomically over the past 10 yrs, the wage of the average singaporean remain stagnant.  housing loans are now calculated using a 30yr-repayment scheme, a far cry from the under-10-yr payment scheme of our parents' day.</p>
              <p>this mean that young singaporeans are unlikely to see the agressive asset enhancement of their properties unlike in their parents' generation. while their parents are able to make a profit selling off their house after completion of housing loan payments in 10 yrs, youngsters today will still be stuck with 20yrs of loan repayment, making it hard for them to upgrade to a better property.</p>
              <p>to sum it all up, the system is now rigged against young singaporeans. young singaporeans will have to bear the brunt of having to cope with higher housing price, higher transport cost (be it private of public transport), higher cost for rearing children and higher cost of upkeep for their parents, while earning not much more than their parents.</p>

              <p>and what did their supposedly rich mind bring in???take tony tan for instance...did his rich mind produce good fixed deposit bank interest rate today and maybe 5 years ago till today???none!!nil....zilch ..ZERO!!!</p>
              <p>their fixed deposit joke interest rate is so low nobody bothers really to think of it because its poor in returns for money placed in it.there dont seem to be much difference between them and the streetside money changer.</p>
              <p>and what did the rest of the politicians do apart from NEGLECTING  ALMOST EVERYONES SALARY and letting all companies take advantage by getting cheaper FOREIGN workers who graduated from local poly or university or their equvalent back home in china or india working in high tech industries in spore.</p>
              <p>and  for 20 years  only politicians  improving and increasing their own salary !!?????do u see any happy faces around other than their own???and why should they be unhappy unless its an act after getting so much money$$$$$$$$$$$ and not improving essential things for the people of spore  from salary,future savings in the bank,some cash in hand and perhaps a miserable small car ??!!!and these arent retarded people im talkin about...these are salaries in multi national companies in spore for technicians and engineers!!!!and most of the salaries in singapore are only good enough if u come from places where a big house is $100,000....like in america...or most parts of china or india.singapore salary for technicians and engineers are bearly unable to make ends meet now let alone the future.</p>
              <p>take for example:MNC or local companies in spore pays a max of $2000/mth</p>
              <h5>savings =$2000(salary)- $300(transport)-$500(food)-$400(government central provident fund- $30(made in china and malaysia everyday items at home)-$200(power bills)-$50(phone bills)-$70(misc items from 2 meals with mom and pop in cheap food stalls to emergency)=$500(in bank account after a month)</h5>
              <p> </p>
              <p>u tell me $500 in a bank account after 1 month as a savings....its not alot....cant even buy half of a  used car or your own room cell pigeon hole in singapore after saving up for 10 years.but this $$$$$ is hard $$$ and shouldnt be wasted on a used car so its mainly meant for me in old age buying rice gruel and salted dried rat meat!</p>
              <p>but singapore housing is more expensive than usa,china or india.and singapore standard salary stinks worse than an equivalent of a fish market that hasnt been cleaned for years!</p>

              <p>The one that termasek holdings lost. Do you truely thinks that all the fundings they use comes from their annual budget ? I bet most of the fundings comes from CPF. They secretly use our money to invest. If successful, they earn money lor . If failure, nevermind one - since singaporeans cannot withdraw them immediately, I will use the money from the next annual budget to replace the money.</p>

              <p><br>if u want to talk about Total real wage, out of $2000, you are getting abt $2300 in total. so yr CPF will reflect abt $700 saving per month..that is good. $200 powerbills is too high, even my motel 3 rooms also dun pay so high, you should cut down to $100, as for phone bills, try to lower it to student price of $25/mth, use WiFi net communication better, free and somemore can have video conferencing, as for meals, try to cut it down to $50, eat more vege and less meat, good and better for health. As for transport try to get a job with transport provide, most MNC do provide transport, and on rest day, stay at home more, afterall, you paid hundreds of thousand for a house and still want to go out for what??? enjoy the house of flat you live in. That will loosen your transportation costs.</p>
              <p>I think if you can squeeze in here and there or save here and there, you can end up saving $800 per month, above the bank requirement of $2 service charges for $500 and below account. And $2000 is not fix, you work smart, hard, please your boss, dun surf net too often, or see doctor too much, go for company sponsor upgrading...you may get promoted or get a good raise in paid and who knows, in a year or two times, you maybe earning $5k per month, by that time, u can buy a bicycle liao.</p>

              <p>so if highly educated and decades of experienced engineers and technicians werk so hard in high tech star trek enviroment and save up at the end of the day $500/mth......</p>
              <p>and then prisoners with not much skills and no education at changi prison work in prison jobs and save up at the end of the day $400/mth...</p>
