That's the paradox of senior minister and<br>former leader Lee Kuan Yew, the man who built this island nation into<br>a world-class economic success but still battles critics as if his<br>life depended on it.<br>.<br>If you were to ask political and business leaders in Asia which<br>living statesman they most respect, Lee probably would nearly top the<br>list. By tapping Singapore's brainpower and work ethic, he created a<br>jewel of the global economy. Yet in defending his personal reputation<br>he remains as combative as when he first became prime minister of a<br>poor and primitive Singapore at age 35.<br>.<br>Perhaps he is an example of what Orson Welles tried to explain<br>in "Citizen Kane." Great men and women, no matter how far they rise<br>in life, never entirely escape the fears they had when they were<br>young. Lee's fear may be that Singapore will be seen as just another<br>corrupt Southeast Asian country rather than as the island of legality<br>and clean government it became under his stewardship.<br>.<br>There is a picture of him in his autobiography with a broom in hand,<br>sweeping the streets of Singapore in an effort to persuade his fellow<br>countrymen to keep the country clean. It was taken in 1959, the year<br>he became prime minister. The ramshackle buildings and dusty streets<br>in the picture are long gone, but mentally Lee still has that broom<br>in hand. Singapore's problem is a bit like China's. When does a<br>country become rich and successful enough to loosen its grip on media<br>and citizens and operate more like a modern democracy? When is it<br>stable enough to stop worrying so much about social control? Lee<br>perplexes me. He is probably the smartest politician I have<br>interviewed in more than 25 years as a journalist. Yet I find his<br>behavior toward the press appalling, not least in the courtroom<br>combat he launched during the 1990s against the newspaper I edit, the<br>International Herald Tribune. He waged similar legal jousting with<br>the Far Eastern Economic Review, now owned by Dow Jones. Those legal<br>fights were destructive for all sides, yet Lee remains ready to<br>rumble when he feels his reputation has been tarnished.<br>.<br>His latest dustup with the press came last month after Bloomberg News<br>published a commentary by the columnist Patrick Smith. The article<br>alleged that Lee had engaged in nepotism when the top post at a<br>government investment firm was given to the wife of his son, Lee<br>Hsien Loong, who is Singapore's deputy prime minister. Lee's lawyers<br>threatened to sue, and Bloomberg quickly issued a public apology and<br>agreed to pay damages and costs.<br>.<br>Another victory for Lee? Maybe. But I suspect that such sensitivity<br>sits uneasily with Singapore's hard-won reputation as a modern,<br>progressive nation. It makes people wonder whether there is something<br>wrong, and in that sense may hurt Singapore more than it helps.<br>.<br>So on a visit here this month, I asked Lee to explain why he was so<br>thin-skinned. If someone told George H.W. Bush that his son's<br>elevation to the presidency was an example of nepotism, he would just<br>laugh it off, I said. Why did Lee respond so sharply?<br>.<br>Lee's answer was revealing, because it showed his fear that Singapore<br>could lose what he has worked so long to build. "That's different!"<br>he said, dismissing the comparison to the Bush family. "This is a<br>hard-won premium that we command," he said, noting that Transparency<br>International ranks Singapore as the least corrupt country in<br>Asia. "Everybody knows that if you impugn our integrity, we must<br>clear our name. How can it be otherwise?" he said.<br>.<br>"We are the best paid of all ministers in the region, but not the<br>most well off. That's because we run it differently. Our people know<br>that. If they doubt that, we are out."<br>.<br>But why take it so seriously? No columnist is going to change what<br>people think of Singapore.<br>.<br>"One Patrick Smith, followed by dozens of Patrick Smiths," Lee<br>replied. "If he gets away, everybody gets away. More calumny is<br>showered on us, and where do we end up?" Where you end up, in<br>relaxing controls on public debate, is with the kind of open and<br>democratic society we have in the West. That doesn't mean opening the<br>gates to calumny and abuse. America has libel laws, too, after all,<br>but they deliberately provide a lower standard of protection for<br>public figures, to foster a more open debate. By reacting as he does<br>whenever falsehoods appear in the press, Lee may be inhibiting<br>Singapore's march into that kind of future. Lee told me last year<br>that efforts to control information were counterproductive in the<br>Internet age. "I don't think we can stop it now," he said. "I don't<br>see any alternative. You either use the Internet or you are<br>backward." Lee reiterated that determination to become a more open<br>society in our conversation this month.<br>.<br>"We have been changing," he said, noting that articles appear now in<br>the local press that would never have been published two years ago.<br>Bravo. But the real milestone will be when someone publishes a<br>defamatory article about Lee's family and he, like former President<br>Bush, just laughs it off.<br>.<br>International Herald Tribune The Washington Post Lee Kuan Yew</div>
