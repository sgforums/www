              <p><span class="postbody">If we look at the fact, what is so excellent about Singapore's system that Ma has to learn from Singapore? Is it system? Is it leadership? <br> <br> Thaksin tried to do so keeping his own business while being the PM but
              seen and judged by his people as promoting himself so was overthrown.
              If Ma is to do so, say tried to pay his ministers millions giving some
              excuses like keeping talents or preventing corruption (legally corrupt
              is ok) he too will be overthrown.
              <br> <br>Talk with all the civil servants in private and all the people running the show in
              Singapore. It will be found there is no excellence like process
              management or promotion of practical knowledge application but only
              craps, like scholars and leaders or talents without system, motivation,
              no process or result-oriented governing.
              <br> <br>That is why there are so many NKF cover-ups of deep-seated problems
              and rising costs of living and deep recessions every few years with no
              sign of value-adding to the economy. Our million-dollar world's best minister for home affair cannot even lock up a limping prisoner in his high-security prison and simply allow him to escape in a toilet break ruse. </span></p>
              <p><span class="postbody">The so-called talents only know
              how to wait for world recovery to catch a win and play with property and share and
              IR while people will continue to suffer from all the taxing and profiteering to
              support dictatorship and selfish self-rewards for his elites and connections.<br> <br>It is a matter of using scholars and paper
              qualifications as a means to control and practise cronyism rewarding connections with the highest pays to buy over their loyalty.</span></p>
              <p>If scholars <span class="postbody">survive and make some claims about solving problems that is fine if not the leaders
              will push the problems away back to the people with some excuses.<br> <br>If China and Taiwan are to learn from our ministers their people will sooner or later rise up in rebellions. </span></p>
              <p><span class="postbody">Probably Singapore ministers have to be sent to understudy from Hu Jin Tao or Wen Jia Bao to
              learn how to win over people and make them achieve their best potential
              and economic success.</span></p>

              I think  Ma Ying-Jeou is just going through the motions, sing the praises of Singapore, suck balls etc.
              
              Taiwan learn from Singapore?
              
              I don't want another dead and lifeless country.
