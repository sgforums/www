            <div class='col-md body'>Thursday October 31, 10:17 PM<br>Singapore lays bare twists and turns in water talks with Malaysia<br>ADVERTISEMENT<br><br>The Government has given a detailed account to Members of Parliament of the twists and turns in Singapore's water talks with Malaysia.<br>It has also released details from a recent exchange of letters between the two prime ministers, which shows clearly that it was Malaysia that unilaterally decided to scrap the package approach to negotiations.<br><br>This has left Singapore with no option but to take off the table the concessions it was prepared to make.<br><br>When Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong met his Malaysian counterpart on 8 October in Kuala Lumpur, Dr Mahathir Mohamad said Malaysia wanted to separate water from other bilateral issues.<br><br>But Mr Goh explained this would leave Singapore less leeway to make concessions on other issues.<br><br>Two days later, Mr Goh received a letter from Dr Mahathir dated 7 October, a day before the two met.<br><br>Dr Mahathir had written: "Malaysia has now decided to discontinue the package approach, and to give the highest priority to first resolving the long-delayed water issue, particularly the price of raw water."<br><br>Singapore's Foreign Minister Professor S Jayakumar, speaking in Parliament, pointed out that the letter was never mentioned at the meeting although it was already written, and it was Malaysia which unilaterally decided to scrap the package without asking Mr Goh if he agreed.<br><br>In his reply, Mr Goh said he had been ready to make concessions on issues like a bridge to replace the Causeway, but added: "Since you now want to deal with the water issue seperately and discontinue the package approach, these trade-offs are no longer possible."<br><br>Mr Goh added: "Had you, at our 8th October meeting, told me that you had already written and signed this letter on 7th October, I would have elaborated on the pros and cons of your new approach."<br><br>Instead, Dr Mahathir and Foreign Minister Syed Hamid Albar have made statements deliberately misrepresenting what happened.<br><br>Prof Jayakumar said: "These statements have impugned PM Goh's integrity and imply that PM Goh was not telling the truth about what transpired during his meeting with PM Mahathir. Singapore's leaders stand by their words.<br><br>Nevertheless, Singapore officials went to Johor Baru two weeks ago, in good faith, to discuss the water issue.<br><br>But Malaysia was only interested in raw water, and fobbed off all discussion about water supply after 2061.<br><br>Prof Jayakumar says Singapore has made it clear that Malaysia has no legal right to raise current water prices, but the Republic is willing to discuss the issue if Malaysia gets serious about discussing future water supply.<br><br>So, the ball is now in Malaysia's court.<br><br>Singapore says it is ready to talk, but it will not simply cave into Malaysia's demands.<br><br></div>
