            <div class='col-md body'>Cheaper cost of Healthcare with more foreign doctors?<br><br>Increase capacity to reduce cost?<br><br>Must be another of your delusional thoughts. In your dreams baby!<br><br>There are guidelines on medical fees.<br><br>http://www.sma.org.sg/guidelines/fees.html<br><br>This is effectively a price ceiling or price floor, depending on the angle you are looking from.<br><br>If there are currently 100 doctors for a poulation of 100,000 (with a doctor to population ratio of 1:1000), charges are say $20 (fees guidelines according to SMA) per consultation. If you increase the doctors to 200, prices will not fall, because the doctor who previously made say $10,000 with a population of 100,000, will only make $5,000 (because he lost half of his income to the new doctors). Do you think the doctor will futher decrease his consultation fees to $10? So that he can make an income of $2,500. Of course, like you said before, this doctor now making less can either face up to the cheaper competition (lowering his charges), or migrate to another country which pays higher.<br><br>Moreover charging of lower prices might not increase the number of patients, as the doctor to patient relationship is an inelastic relationship. You do not change your family doctor just because an Indian doctor charges cheaper.<br><br>It might decrease waiting time in the public outpatients clinic, but that depends on the ability of these Indian doctors to speak Hokkien, Cantonese, Foochow, Hakka, Teochew, Mandarin to our elderly folks which forms the majority of outpatient visits. Else they would need an interpreter just to talk to these folks, which looms the possibility of malpractice due to wrongful interpretation (words change meanings when it's passed to another person).<br><br></div>

Your logic bemuses me.<br><br>First of all you claimed that the doctors are overworked, so they have to increase doctors to increase capacity and decrease waiting time. If the hospitals are already spending say $50 million on pay for the current doctors, they employ more foreign doctors, say increase pay another $25 million to $75 million. How can that translate to lower cost? Please explain? Even if cost is saved, the cost savings will not be passed on to patients, because price levels is sticky downwards.<br><br>How do you suggest that they close the language barrier? Because most outpatient public clinics are frequented by older folks who only speak dialects.<br><br>You are a doctor? A Ph.D is Janitorial Science?</div>

My mom also kenna a few times when hospital assign her some graduate from indian medical school . Besides working as a nurse , I have to  work with foreign doctors . The  doctors who graduated from india,  talk alot , cannot do . Only jump at the chance of procedures but pushing all blame to other doctors if something goes wrong. I don't trust them at all especially on night shift. One misdiagnosed a Ventricular Tachycardia for  normal rhythmn - Ox would know this life threatening condition . My colleague was like hey this ECG doesn't look normal and I look and said Shit ..prepare to call code soon.  I had to overwrite the damn doctor from india , and call for registrar. Then told the registrar what this guy did - he went actually blame the lighting ! MY GOD.<br><br>And then you have DR Jayant Patel aka Dr Death , who trained in India and then went for training in USA and got banned then he lied to come into Queensland and I pity the little girl who saw him anyhow plunging the needle 50 times into her father and now he is claiming that Australia is racist and picking on him.<br><br>Sorry . I don't give a shit about graduates from some new delhi or whatever indian medical school. Enough is enough.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Our doctors are just facing what the rest of the population has been facing for a long time, namely, that anyone can come to Singapore and work.<br><br>For donkey years, our male population has been moaning that foreigners are treated similar to them, despite our own Singaporeans having sacrificed the best two and a half years (or two years) of their lives to the duty of training and defending the country. This has led to the oft-heard comment that being a Malaysian (or Chinese or Indian) in Singapore is better than being a Singaporean!<br><br>There is another flip side to the coin to this, not just about it being unfair to our own doctors, who paid throught their noses to study in NUS Medicine, and got bonded in the bargain. These Indian doctors are surely not be attending to our rich and affluent, but rather to the poor and needy. So the waiting times may be reduced, but they will be attended to by doctors who do not understand their own languages. As all know, medicine is as much about healing as about comforting. Deny it as one might, the difference in language is surely a hindrance to it. Put it another way, would our rich and powerful be willing to be doctored by one of these "bangla" doctors? How many times have we heard our old complaing that these Indian doctors in the polyclinics have no idea what concerns are being voiced? How many of our parents, uncles or aunts would prefer to be seen by them?<br><br>Surely the solution should be to increase the intake such that there would be enough doctors to cater to our own needs in the long term, rather than permanently using these Indian doctors to make up the shortfall. Are they really cheaper? Can someone come up with hard facts that they WILL be paid lower salaries ALWAYS, or rather, only lower salaries in the first year or first two years. If they are going to be paid a similar salary to our own doctors eventually, why not just take in more Singaporean medical students? Why are we paying the same salary to foreign doctors, when they are not as desirable as compared to Singaporean doctors, and most would eventually take the money back to India?<br><br>As to Mushroom's contention that most would still move to the private sector even if we are to take in more medical students, I don't think so. If we produce enough doctors, the private sector would be so flooded with doctors that there would be enough ALSO for the public sector.<br><br>As it is, many aspiring Singaporeans are forced to go overseas to pursue their dreams of practising medicine, resulting in millions of dollars going to foreign medical colleges. Singaporeans who graduate overseas would also find it more easy to continue working and finally settling down overseas, resulting in a double whammy of losing both money (for their fees) and their talents (when they migrate). As to overproducing doctors, that should not even be an issue. Isn't the government pursuing the policy of promoting bioscience? What better people to become researchers and clinical scientists if not doctors? Armed with a medical degree (and the knowledge), they can move on to become even more effective administrators, scientists, researchers, lecturers etc. in the bioscientific field.<br><br>Anyway, this move of bringing in Indian doctors smacks of the same old knee-jerk, short-term reaction to a present problem, instead of implementing a long-term course of action that may take more effort.  We can bring them in for the short-term, but there should be plans to educate enought Singaporeans to man our hospitals in the long run.</div>

Your logic bemuses me.<br><br>First of all you claimed that the doctors are overworked, so they have to increase doctors to increase capacity and decrease waiting time. If the hospitals are already spending say $50 million on pay for the current doctors, they employ more foreign doctors, say increase pay another $25 million to $75 million. How can that translate to lower cost? Please explain? Even if cost is saved, the cost savings will not be passed on to patients, because price levels is sticky downwards.<br><br>How do you suggest that they close the language barrier?

If they employ heck of a lot of foreign doctors who are hired far less than Singaporeans, the general *ahem* preference will be to hire more and more foreign doctors who will eventually squeeze out our local doctors and drive more to the private sector. Then you screw up the market by saturating it.<br><br>To make matters worse, you then have to contend with these bloc of foreign doctors who will request for higher pay eventually (come on, these doctors are smart enough to ask for more pay for their services and Singapore's high costs will make any foreigner who ain't rich squirm.)<br><br>To put it simply: Grabbing foreign doctors will jsut change the whole dynamic of the market in possible ways we cannot easily foresee and then we are saddled with more problems before.<br><br>Let's not even think about whether or not people will benefit from this.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I personally think that the government did the right thing to allow more foreign doctors to serve in the public sector. What the government need to tackle now is the aging population because they need help and we can no longer depend on those greedy bunch of singapore doctors who are all looking at make big bucks in the private sector.<br><br>Honestly, why should singapore care too much about those greedy singapore doctors who chose to migrate overseas because of $$? The reason why they have chosen to become a doctor is not because of passion to treat the sick and poor, but to make big bucks for themselves so that they can live comfortably in big houses in district 9 and 10.<br><br></div>
