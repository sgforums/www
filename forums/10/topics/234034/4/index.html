I have always said there is a shortage of doctors <strong>in the public sector</strong>, due to the loss of doctors to the private sector. What we face is a problem of distribution.<br><br>As Singaporeans do not want to pay more for healthcare and yet demand shorter waiting times, we need to beef up the number of public sector doctors. That's why I have always said we will have to recruit foreign doctors.<br><br>You should read the papers more. Western countries are now sending back the cheap foreign junior doctors (mainly from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh) to their home countries as they have enough junior doctors of their own. The UK in particular is not going to renew the contract of thousands of NHS doctors (http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/6372895.stm). MOH is taking advantage of that to recruit them. Our pay will be much lower than what they used to get in UK, but these blokes have no choice. It's either lower pay in Singapore or even lower pay in Bangalore.<br><br>We are also losing specialists or senior doctors to the private sector at such a rate that we don't have enough to serve the foreign patients in public hospitals, not to mention local patients. Trying to recruit specialists from UK and Australia will be more difficult, in view of the higher pay they receive in UK and Australia. Our advantage is the lower taxes and an easier climate. The younger, ambitious specialists will not come, but those in their 60s who have already obtained their pensions and looking for a retirement job may be persuaded to take up a part-time job in Singapore.<br></div>

Why should anyone believe in your allegations? Go to the press with your evidence, if you have any.<br><br>You contradict yourself time and again, first insisting that the government should subsidize healthcare because it made money, then in the same breath claim that the government has lost huge sums of money. You cannot have it both ways. Make up your mind...you cannot even cary a consistent argument.<br><br><blockquote>What is the Annual Budget allocated for Health that is still insufficient, and result in the atrocious medical and hospital charges that require even the lowest wage earner in Singapore to pay for medical attention ? </blockquote>If anything at all, healthcare charges in the public sector are far too low. You obviously have no clue as to the value of highly trained health professionals and the cost of patented drugs. You are trying to advocate a healthcare system entirely funded by taxes, so Singaporeans do not have to pay for medical attention? Are Singaporeans prepared to pay higher taxes? With an aging population, the burden of the healthcare costs will fall increasingly on the working young. Haven't you seen the problems of the NHS? Such a system will not work.<br><br><blockquote>Was it not the original intention of the Singapore Government to divest its own responsibility of an affordable health care system by restructuring Public Hospitals into Quasi Government Hospitals, and expecting these hospitals to operate along the profit-making lines of Private Hospitals ? </blockquote>If public hospitals are trying to make profit from local patients, they have a strange way of doing it, when their charges are so low for the majority of subsidized patients they serve. Use your brain!<br><br><blockquote><br>Did you not previously agree that a small percentage of the profits made by Temasek and / or GIC would be sufficient to pay the annual premium of a National Health Insurance Plan ? </blockquote>So you admit that Temasek and GIC are making profits then? The answer is in your question...who pays the premium during the year when GIC and Temasek loses money? The profits during a year of plenty like recent years when the economy is doing may well be sufficient to cover the annual premium of a national health insurance plan, but what happens when the economy encounters a downturn? All Singaporeans will lose their health insurance?<br><br>In addition, what should be included in a national insurance plan? Our medishield is a national insurance plan with a low premium. If we want it to cover expensive healthcare items like Herceptin for breast cancer, our premiums will have to go up. If we are going to prescribe Herceptin to all early breast cancer patients in Singapore and Rituximab to all suitable lymphoma patients, even the profits of Temasek in a good year will not be enough to pay the annual premium required.<br><br>No, the government should provide a basic level of healthcare that is affordable under the 3M system of health funding we have. If you want anything more, you will have to fund it yourself.<br><br>Our Medisave system ensures there is personal responsibility for individual healthcare. You save up for your own healthcare needs. If you don't smnoke and drink, you have a better chance of not consuming as much healthcare as theose who do. If you earn more, you can afford a better hospital class. If you earn less and have less in your medisave account, you go for a more basic package. That is fair.<br><br>To cater to the unfortunate instances when Singaporeans require expensive hospital care, there is the medical insurance policy Medishield. By pooling risks, this basic health insurance policy is made very affordable. In addition to personal contribution to one's future healthcare needs, this is a form of shared responsibility for the healthcare needs of society. By pooling risks, the healthier ones are paying to make healthcare costs affordable for the less healthy ones.<br><br>Third, the government has created an endowment plan from public funds for the very poor for whom even both Medisave and Medishield are not sufficient for their heathcare needs. It is right that the government should use public funds only for the poorest in this way.<br><br>[/b][/quote]</div>
