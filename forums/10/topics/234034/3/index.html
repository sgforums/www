What the government need to tackle now is the aging population because they need help and we can no longer depend on those greedy bunch of singapore doctors who are all looking at make big bucks in the private sector.<br><br>Honestly, why should singapore care too much about those greedy singapore doctors who chose to migrate overseas because of $$? The reason why they have chosen to become a doctor is not because of passion to treat the sick and poor, but to make big bucks for themselves so that they can live comfortably in big houses in district 9 and 10.</div></blockquote>I hate to say this, but let's put it in the simplest terms here: Singapore is too darn expensive to live in and frankly any damn fool will have a better life else where if not for the fact that many of these said doctors became doctors because either parental pressure as Asian parents have an idiotic tendency of thinking that a doctor is a great and honourable job for some great entrenched idiotic reason and these doctors have parents who expect them to follow the silly Asian tradition blah blah blah. The other reason simply because many western countries are very protectionistic about foreign doctors entering the market hence they restrict their entry.<br><br>If you are going to throw greed into the equation, i would say that foreign doctors also came here out of greed and if you are going throw in the morality of hospital care, you can go build a castle in the clouds. Everyone is looking to make big bucks and pretending that doctors should do community service instead of doing it for profit is frankly absurd beyond definition.<br></div>

The  doctors who graduated from india,  talk alot , cannot do . Only jump at the chance of procedures but pushing all blame to other doctors if something goes wrong. I don't trust them at all especially on night shift. One misdiagnosed a Ventricular Tachycardia for  normal rhythmn - Ox would know this life threatening condition . My colleague was like hey this ECG doesn't look normal and I look and said Shit ..prepare to call code soon.  I had to overwrite the damn doctor from india , and call for registrar. Then told the registrar what this guy did - he went actually blame the lighting ! MY GOD.<br><br>And then you have DR Jayant Patel aka Dr Death , who trained in India and then went for training in USA and got banned then he lied to come into Queensland and I pity the little girl who saw him anyhow plunging the needle 50 times into her father and now he is claiming that Australia is racist and picking on him.<br><br>Sorry . I don't give a shit about graduates from some new delhi or whatever indian medical school.

If these FTs are second raters compared to local doctors, then it is both a reassuring and troubling fact. Reassuring because it means our doctors have high standards and justify their higher salaries. Troubling because with Singaporeans want more doctors in public hospitals but without raising healthcare costs, the only solution is to bring in these very second rate FTs who cannot work in the West like Singapore doctors and nurses.<br><br>Quality or pricing...Singaporeans may have already decided that cheaper is better. The Health Minister is only responding to the two clear messages from Singaporeans in this issue: more doctors in public institutions but lower healthcare costs</div>

It should be further noted that the Govt runs surpluses every year and that year where they claimed they didn't was simply an accounting nonsense as there were analysts who pointed out that the Govt does not consider land sales as part of the surplus. Why the Govt needs to run huge surpluses every year is quite beyond me. Why the Govt resorts to the same o' alarmist nonsense to justify the huge reserve is again beyond me, unless they are trying to make up for lost billions like the Suzhou project and the impending loss from the Thaksin affair.<br><br>Singapore's competitiveness is sometimes a joke because the Govt has to compromise hugely on citizens' welfare while putting out the begging bowl for foreign companies to come in.</div>

The problem is the inconsistent standard of training in india - I have no issues with australian trained doctors or Singaporean trained doctors.<br><br>If they do something wrong - I will report on them too and there have been times where I reported interns to their registrar for issues pertaining to patient care regardless of whether they are caucasian or asian.<br><br>Bearing in mind there are chinese-australian, indian-australian, vietnamese-australian and caucasian australian doctors who trained in Australia. Their training is different from indian medical school graduates . They at least ask  the senior nurses for advice on how to deal with certain situations and if I say call the registrar - they do call .<br><br>Indian medical school grads - their word is law and they treat most nurses' report or opinions like crap even though they might be dealing with the situation wrongly. That is my impression of them.<br><br>I told one such indian medical school grad (he claims he has 5 years of experience but only can start off as intern status in Australia) to call the registrar because I knew that what he was doing is not right, and he told me I know nothing since I am a nurse.
