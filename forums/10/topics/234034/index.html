            <div class='col-md body'>THE door has been opened wider to foreign doctors, as Singapore moves towards a new goal of having one doctor per patient in public hospitals.<br><br>The public sector currently employs 3,156 doctors - which translates to one doctor for every two patients at any given time.<br><br>The Health Ministry is relaxing registration rules for foreign doctors by reducing their probation periods, and recognising qualifications from more foreign medical schools to boost the number of doctors here.<br><br>Singapore currently has 7,611 registered doctors, including 2,286 who were trained in foreign institutions. Of these foreign-trained practitioners, 976 are Singaporeans and the rest are foreigners. The relaxed rules will also benefit Singaporeans who qualify at newly recognised schools.<br><br>Previously, all foreign specialists had to work under supervision in an approved institution - usually a public hospital - for three years, while non-specialists had to be supervised for six years, before receiving full registration.<br><br>From this year, the probation period for foreign doctors has been shortened to two years for specialists, and four years for non-specialists.<br><br>Those who have had at least five years' relevant experience after becoming a qualified specialist or family physician are now allowed to practise immediately in the private sector.<br><br>More institutions, including three top Indian medical schools, will be added to the list of recognised institutions here next month. Since 2003, the number of schools on the list has soared from 20 to 120.<br><br>The aim is to emulate renowned teaching and research institutions overseas, such as Sweden's Karolinska Institutet, where the doctor to patient ratio stands at one to one.<br><br>With more doctors, each can have more time to spend with each patient as well as on teaching juniors and conducting more research. This would improve patient satisfaction, and also job satisfaction for doctors, said MOH's director of medical services, Professor K. Satku.<br><br>The need for doctors will become more pressing as the number of patients is expected to rise, with a growing and ageing population, and more foreign patients.<br><br>Speaking to students at the Singapore Management University on the globalisation of healthcare on Friday night, Health Minister Khaw Boon Wan said: 'When more (foreign patients) come, and we do not plan our capacity, whether it's more hospital beds or doctors, prices are bound to go up... our job is to anticipate this and move the supply curve so that prices will come down to a more competitive level.'<br><br>His strategy is to increase the number of doctors trained here as well as overseas.<br><br>The National University of Singapore (NUS) has increased its intake of medical students, and classes at the new Duke-NUS Graduate Medical School will start this August. So from 2012, Singapore will produce about 300 doctors every year.<br><br>Mr Khaw also hopes to further increase Duke-NUS' intake by another 50 students in future.<br><br>But this will not be enough as doctors retire or quit. Last year, 212 doctors left the profession.<br><br>Foreigners are needed to fill the gap but they are in short supply worldwide.<br><br>One big recruitment pool may be the Asian doctors in Europe who might consider a return to Asia now that European Union rules are kicking in to favour EU citizens over foreign residents.<br><br>'This is an opportunity for Singapore to draw them in and expand our health-care,' Mr Khaw said.<br><br>(Straits Times 26 Jan)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>As expected, the government has responded to the public's complaints about long waiting times and higher medical costs by bringing in more foreign doctors. They are cheaper to hire and can be required to work in the public sector, as local doctors move into the private sector.<br><br>There is a large supply of Indian doctors in the UK who now have to leave the country due to new EU rules on employment. Most of these are non-specialists but they have experience working in British hospitals. They will have no choice but accept the lower pay in Singapore or return to even low pay and worse working conditions in India.<br><br>Our junior doctors must expect to work even harder or they will be forced out even if they want to remain in the public hospitals. Indian doctors are willing to work for  half the usual pay.<br><br>After doctors, we will need to hire more foreign nurses and health attendants. Now that filipino nurses can easily find jobs in UK, we will have to look for nurses from China.</div>

The problem is that we have too few in the <strong>public</strong> sector. The pay difference between the public and private sectors is too marked. That is one big reason for the exodus to the private sector. The government is unable to raise salaries of doctors in the public sector since Singaporeans want lower healthcare costs but have to increase the number of doctors in the public sector to cut waiting times.<br><br>It is therefore Singaporeans who have demanded more foreign doctors.</div>

First of all , it is pay per use - even for the poorest of the poor unless they have absolutely no asset or children. Where has all the money gone to?<br><br>Probably too many administrators. I remember watching Yes Minister - the old british comedy about a bumbling minister and his workers - they overemployed too many administrators and had to pay them instead of the doctors.  So one hospital only had administrators - no patients , no nurses. It was a good comedy skit - abit of a deja vu but not that extreme.<br><br>If ministers can increase the pay of the president and keep their 1 million dollar a year salary , I see no reason why local doctors and nurses should be forced to accept lower wages. It is a short term fix to decrease overhead costs and increase profits to enrich the upper achelons of management .<br><br>In the long term , Singapore will find that all the brightest and smartest have gone to greener pastures . Does nothing but damage in the long term.<br><br>Anyways all I can say - the way I see it - Singapore is only having short term fixes in policies to cover up the cracks . One day ,those cracks are going to be massive and will be exposed no matter how much covering is placed on it - by that time , it will be too late for Singapore. They hub so much but they never bother to build on it - only moving to the newest fad ....last time was information hub then  medical hub now biomedical hub ...Hub this Hub that ...Hubba bubba...<br><br>Singaporeans are just paying for million dollar ministers to follow the new fads ...oh wow ...might as well pay a teenager less to get ideas out.<br></div>

Once you come to the consultant level, the pay is not much higher than that in Singapore. For certain specialties like surgery, the pay is higher in Singapore compared to the UK. The British surgeon is paid the same amount as his psychiatrist colleague, whereas the pay difference can be twice as high in Singapore. And you must factor in the taxes and national insurance which will wipe out about 45% of your income if you are earning a consultant's salary.

If you raise the salary of doctors in the public sector to retain them, will the population understand? If the patients don't pay more then the government will have to pay. If you want the government to increase health care expenditure, then we have to pay more taxes to balance the budget. Will Singaporeans agree?<br><br><blockquote><strong>Probably too many administrators. I remember watching Yes Minister - the old British comedy about a bumbling minister and his workers - they over employed too many administrators and had to pay them instead of the doctors.  So one hospital only had administrators - no patients , no nurses. It was a good comedy skit - abit of a deja vu but not that extreme. </strong></blockquote>That was true in the past. This Minister has changed it...he ordered some of the non-core administrative offices closed and outsourced many of the administrative and IT functions to private firms with a great deal of savings.<br><br><blockquote><strong>In the long term , Singapore will find that all the brightest and smartest have gone to greener pastures .

It is not the brightest who leave we have to worry about. It is those who cannot go because their skills are not as marketable in the global market...that is the problem.<br><br>Looking for new avenues of growth is essential.

Even in Australia, a certain amount of co-payment is required in addition to the high taxes and premiums on health insurance. As society ages, health care costs will rise. Modern health care is a commercial 'commodity'...but whilst you would forgo a nice car or the chance to study in Harvard if you don't have the money or a scholarship, patients will demand the best medical treatment even if they cannot afford them. In a welfare state, you are obliged to give them that treatment.<br><br>The UK NHS is running out of money as it is, having to close emergency departments and hospitals (http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2006/04/18/nhs18.xml).   Yet because of a woman's demand to have the expensive b_reast cancer drug Herceptin (http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/5063352.stm), the NHS will have to find another 100million pounds a year to pay for this drug. That figure will only rise as more women are diagnosed with the cancer as a result of early b_reast cancer screening. If Singapore were a welfare state and has to provide Herceptin for our patients, we are talking about 21,800 GBP (S$65,659) per patient per year (http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,8122-2027540,00.html).<br><br>Free healthcare at point of contact is far too expensive as the NHS experience has shown us. You may not realize how high the taxes will have to be to pay for the 'free' healthcare. With an aging population, it will be the young who will have to bear the bulk of the burden as the elderly retires from the work force. We will see the young leaving Singapore to avoid having to pay high taxes for a service that they do not consume as much. Even Australia has chosen a co-payment scheme rather than to follow the UK route.<br><br>You are prepared to pay higher taxes in exchange for cheap, high quality healthcare in the public sector. But have you considered that fact that the majority of Singaporeans do not have to pay income tax because they are not working or earning too little. That means you will have to pay for them as well. And as the population ages, you will have to pay for more of them. When you become old, there is no guarantee that our children will want to stay and pay such high taxes, rather than emigrate to somewhere else. What will happen to you then?<br><br></div>
