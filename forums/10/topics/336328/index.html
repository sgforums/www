              <p>Looking for the Truth of What's Going on in This World, and the Planned World War 3?<br><br>"When a well-packaged web of lies has been sold gradually to the masses<br>over generations, the truth will seem utterly preposterous and its speaker a raving lunatic." -- Dresden James<br><br>Amidst an over-abundance of 'information', and a distinct lack of TRUTH, this is where you'll find the most accurate "big picture" presentation of why the world is currently in the state it is.  <br><br>People tend to be sucked into irrational behavior en masse.<br><br>"Men think in herds, go mad in herds, but recover their senses one by one." -- Charles Mackay<br><br>Here's your chance to break free from the herd.  While you might not agree with everything you read here, I take great care in presenting only verifiable facts.  All information is taken from the most reliable sources available and can be verified with a little research.  <br><br>But you won't find any of this in your mainstream news sources.  They are controlled, just as news broadcasts during WW1 and WW2 were carefully controlled.  It's called propaganda.</p>
              <p>You and I know that there is a gigantic cover-up of who the true criminals are.  The mainstream media and authorities are complicit, so you'll never hear it from them.  But you WILL hear it from me.<br><br>Once you understand the REAL reasons behind current events you'll quickly see who the real culprits are.  Once you understand WHY events are unfolding the way they are, you'll have a clearer idea of what's in store for us in the not too distant future.</p>
              <p>Discover How Close We Are to the Planned World War Three<br><br>ThreeWorldWars.com's 1,000 plus quality pages and the free e-newsletter will explain the mess we find ourselves in, with information such as:<br>An Introduction to Conspiratorial History - If you want to understand how major world events in the past have happened by design and not by mistake, this introductory article on the difference between Conspiratorial History and Accidental History is a must-read.<br>The New World Order Timeline - Perhaps the best way to relate a brief history of the New World Order, would be to use the words of those who have been striving to make it real throughout the ages. You will be amazed at how far back this grand plan has extended, and how many similarities there are in early Century 21 compared to the 1990's, with two Presidents from the Bush family in power.<br>Albert Pike's Plan for WW3 - Albert Pike received a vision, which he described in a letter that he wrote, dated August 15, 1871. This letter graphically outlined plans for three world wars that were seen as necessary to bring about the One World Order, and we can marvel at how accurately it has predicted events that have already taken place. <br><br>Many have found the information on this site life-changing, and their understanding of current world events has been clarified significantly.  <br><br>But be warned - you WILL be forced to think while reading this site.  The way you look at life might never be the same again!<br></p>

In conspiratorial history we are led to believe that events, such as wars and revolutions, are the result of planned events. While the conspiratorial view is not accurate for weather, volcanoes and earthquakes, it is a realistic and accurate view of the interrelationship of man and nations. Since the planning for most of these events was done in secret, we use the term conspiratorial history. That is; this history is the result of plans constructed in secret, which by definition is a conspiracy.<br><br><strong>Interestingly enough, the Conspiratorial View of History is also the Biblical View of History.  Try Psalms 2 for starters.*</strong><br><br>We believe that current world events are not simply circumstantial, but the result of an organized campaign by an elite group of unseen and widely unknown world leaders.

              <p>This is my last try already.</p>
              <p>If still not conspiratorial view of history, I chop off my head for you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ruskin's message had a sensational impact. His inaugural lecture
                  was copied out in longhand by one undergraduate, Cecil Rhodes, who kept
                  it with him for thirty years. Rhodes (1853-1902) feverishly exploited
                  the diamond and goldfields of South Africa, rose to be prime minister
                  of the Cape Colony (1890-1896), contributed money to political parties,
                  controlled parliamentary seats both in England and in South Africa, and
                  sought to win a strip of British territory across Africa from the Cape
                  of Good Hope to Egypt and to join these two extremes together with a
                  telegraph line and ultimately with a Cape-to-Cairo Railway.</p>
              <p>Rhodes
                  inspired devoted support for his goals from others in South Africa and
                  in England. With financial support from Lord Rothschild and Alfred
                  Beit, he was able to monopolize the diamond mines of South Africa as De
                  Beers Consolidated Mines and to build up a great gold mining enterprise
                  as Consolidated Gold Fields. In the middle 1890's Rhodes had a personal
                  income of at least a million pounds sterling a year (then about five
                  million dollars) which was spent so freely for his mysterious purposes
                  that he was usually overdrawn on his account.</p>
              <p>These purposes centered
                  on his desire to federate the English-speaking peoples and to bring all
                  the habitable portions of the world under their control. For this
                  purpose Rhodes left part of his great fortune to found the Rhodes
                  Scholarships at Oxford in order to spread the English ruling class
                  tradition throughout the English-speaking world as Ruskin had wanted.</p>
              <p>Among Ruskin's most devoted disciples at Oxford were a group of
                  intimate friends including Arnold Toynbee, Alfred (later Lord) Milner,
                  Arthur Glazebrook, George (later Sir George) Parkin, Philip Lyttelton
                  Gell, and Henry (later Sir Henry) Birchenough.</p>
              <p>These were so moved by
                  Ruskin that they devoted the rest of their lives to carrying out his
                  ideas. A similar group of Cambridge men including Reginald Baliol Brett
                  (Lord Esher), Sir John B. Seeley, Albert (Lord) Grey, and Edmund
                  Garrett were also aroused by Ruskin's message and devoted their lives
                  to extension of the British Empire and uplift of England's urban masses
                  as two parts of one project which they called "extension of the
                  English-speaking idea."</p>
              <p>They were remarkably successful in these aims
                  because England's most sensational journalist William T. Stead
                  (1849-1912), an ardent social reformer and imperialist, brought them
                  into association with Rhodes.</p>
              <p><strong>This association was formally
                  established on February 5, 1891, when Rhodes and Stead organized a
                  secret society of which Rhodes had been dreaming for sixteen years. </strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">In
                  this secret society Rhodes was to be leader</span>; Stead, Brett (Lord Esher),
                  and Milner were to form an executive committee; Arthur (Lord) Balfour,
                  (Sir) Harry Johnston, Lord Rothschild, Albert (Lord) Grey, and others
                  were listed as potential members of a "Circle of Initiates"; while
                  there was to be an outer circle known as the "Association of Helpers"
                  (later organized by Milner as the Round Table organization). </strong></p>
              <p><strong>Brett was
                  invited to join this organization the same day and Milner a couple of
                  weeks later, on his return from Egypt. Both accepted with enthusiasm.
                  Thus the central part of the secret society was established by March
                  1891. It continued to function as a formal group, although the outer
                  circle was, apparently, not organized until 1909-1913.</strong></p>
              <p>This group was able to get access to Rhodes's money after his
                  death in 1902 and also to the funds of loyal Rhodes supporters like
                  Alfred Beit (1853-1906) and Sir Abe Bailey (1864-1940).</p>
              <p>With this
                  backing they sought to extend and execute the ideals that Rhodes had
                  obtained from Ruskin and Stead. Milner was the chief Rhodes Trustee and
                  Parkin was Organizing Secretary of the Rhodes Trust after 1902, while
                  Gell and Birchenough, as well as others with similar ideas, became
                  officials of the British South Africa Company.</p>
              <p>They were joined in
                  their efforts by other Ruskinite friends of Stead's like Lord Grey,
                  Lord Esher, and Flora Shaw (later Lady Lugard). In 1890, by a stratagem
                  too elaborate to describe here, Miss Shaw became Head of the Colonial
                  Department of <em>The Times </em>while still remaining on the payroll of Stead's <em>Pall Mall Gazette, </em>In
                  this post she played a major role in the next ten years in carrying
                  into execution the imperial schemes of Cecil Rhodes, to whom Stead had
                  introduced her in 1889.</p>
              <p>In the meantime, in 1884, acting under Ruskin's inspiration,
                  a group which included Arnold Toynbee, Milner, Gell, Grey, Seeley, and
                  Michael Glazebrook founded the first "settlement house," an
                  organization by which educated, upper-class people could live in the
                  slums in order to assist, instruct, and guide the poor, with particular
                  emphasis on social welfare and adult education.</p>
              <p>The new enterprise, set
                  up in East London with P. L. Gell as chairman, was named Toynbee Hall
                  after Arnold Toynbee who died, aged 31, in 1883. This was the original
                  model for the thousands of settlement houses, such as Hull House in
                  Chicago, now found throughout the world, and was one of the seeds from
                  which the modern movement for adult education and university extension
                  grew.</p>
              <p>As governor-general and high commissioner of South Africa in the
                  period 1897-1905, Milner recruited a group of young men, chiefly from
                  Oxford and from Toynbee Hall, to assist him in organizing his
                  administration.</p>
              <p>Through his influence these men were able to win
                  influential posts in government and international finance and became
                  the dominant influence in British imperial and foreign affairs up to
                  1939. Under Milner in South Africa they were known as Milner's
                  Kindergarten until 1910. In 1909-1913 they organized semi-secret
                  groups, known as Round Table Groups, in the chief British dependencies
                  and the United States. These still function in eight countries.</p>
              <p>They
                  kept in touch with each other by personal correspondence and frequent
                  visits, and through an influential quarterly magazine, <em>The Round Table, </em>founded in 1910 and largely supported by Sir Abe Bailey's money.</p>
              <p>In 1919 they founded the Royal Institute of International Affairs
                  (Chatham House) for which the chief financial supporters were Sir Abe
                  Bailey and the Astor family (owners of <em>The Times). </em>Similar
                  Institutes of International Affairs were established in the chief
                  British dominions and in the United States (where it is known as the
                  Council on Foreign Relations) in the period 1919-1927.</p>
              <p>After 1925 a
                  somewhat similar structure of organizations, known as the Institute of
                  Pacific Relations, was set up in twelve countries holding territory in
                  the Pacific area, the units in each British dominion existing on an
                  interlocking basis with the Round Table Group and the Royal Institute
                  of International Affairs in the same country.</p>
              <p>In Canada the nucleus of
                  this group consisted of Milner's undergraduate friends at Oxford (such
                  as Arthur Glazebrook and George Parkin), while in South Africa and
                  India the nucleus was made up of former members of Milner's
                  Kindergarten. These included (Sir) Patrick Duncan, B. K. Long, Richard
                  Feetham, and (Sir) Dougal Malcolm in South Africa and (Sir) William
                  Marris, James (Lord) Meston, and their friend Malcolm (Lord) Hailey in
                  India.</p>
              <p>The groups in Australia and New Zealand had been recruited by
                  Stead (through his magazine <em>The Review of Reviews) </em>as early as
                  1890-1893; by Parkin, at Milner instigation, in the period 1889-1910,
                  and by Lionel Curtis, also at Milner's request, in 1910-1919. The power
                  and influence of this Rhodes-Milner group in British imperial affairs
                  and in foreign policy since 1889, although not widely recognized, can
                  hardly be exaggerated. We might mention as an example that this group
                  dominated <em>The Times </em>from 1890 to 191, and has controlled it completely since 1912 (except for the years 1919-1922).</p>
              <p>Because <em>The Times </em>has
                  been owned by the Astor family since 1922, this Rhodes-Milner group was
                  sometimes spoken of as the "Cliveden Set," named after the Astor
                  country house where they sometimes assembled. Numerous other papers and
                  journals have been under the control or influence of this group since
                  1889. They have also established and influenced numerous university and
                  other chairs of imperial affairs and international relations.</p>
              <p>Some of
                  these are the Beit chairs at Oxford, the Montague Burton chair at
                  Oxford, the Rhodes chair at London, the Stevenson chair at Chatham
                  House, the Wilson chair at Aberystwyth, and others, as well as such
                  important sources of influence as Rhodes House at Oxford.</p>
              <p>From 1884 to about 1915 the members of this group worked valiantly
                  to extend the British Empire and to organize it in a federal system.
                  They were constantly harping on the lessons to be learned from the
                  failure of the American Revolution and the success of the Canadian
                  federation of 1867, and hoped to federate the various parts of the
                  empire as seemed feasible, then confederate the whole of it, with the
                  United Kingdom, into a single organization.</p>
              <p>They also hoped to bring
                  the United States into this organization to whatever degree was
                  possible. Stead was able to get Rhodes to accept, in principle, a
                  solution which might have made Washington the capital of the whole
                  organization or allow parts of the empire to become states of the
                  American Union.</p>
              <p>The varied character of the British imperial
                  possessions, the backwardness of many of the native peoples involved,
                  the independence of many of the white colonists overseas, and the
                  growing international tension which culminated in the First World War
                  made it impossible to carry out the plan for Imperial Federation,
                  although the five colonies in Australia were joined into the
                  Commonwealth of Australia in 1901 and the four colonies in South Africa
                  were joined into the Union of South Africa in 1910.</p>

                              terms of Cecil Rhodes’s seventh will, are known to everyone. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> What is
                              not so widely known is that Rhodes in five previous wills left his
                              fortune to form a secret society</strong></span>, which was to devote itself to the
                              preservation and expansion of the British Empire. </p>
              <p>And what does not
                              seem to be known to anyone is that this <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>secret society was created by

              <p>To be sure, this secret society is not a childish thing
                              like the Ku Klux Klan, and it does not have any secret robes, secret
                              handclasps, or secret passwords.  It does not need any of these, since
                              its members know each other intimately.  It probably has no oaths of
                              secrecy nor any formal procedure of initiation. </p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>It does, however,

              <p>At various times since 1891, these meetings have been
                              presided over by Rhodes, Lord Milner, Lord Selborne, Sir Patrick
                              Duncan, Field Marshal Jan Smuts, Lord Lothian, and Lord Brand.  They
                              have been held in all the British Dominions, starting in South Africa
                              about 1903;  in various places in London, chiefly 175 Piccadilly;  at
                              various colleges at Oxford, chiefly All Souls;  and at many English
                              country houses such as Tring Park, Blickling Hall, Cliveden, and others...</p>

              <p>Go and compare above crap with below, one heaven one earth, one is nonsense plucked out of thin air, the other solid analysis based on facts, evidence and rational argument:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is probable that the groundwork for Halifax’s visit to Hitler had
                  been laid by the earlier visits of Lords Lothian and Londonderry to the
                  same host, but our knowledge of these earlier events is too scanty to
                  be certain. </p>
              <p>Of Halifax’s visit, the story is now clear, as a result of
                  the publication of the German Foreign Office memorandum on the subject
                  and Keith Feiling’s publication of some of the letters from Neville
                  Chamberlain to his sister. </p>
              <p>The visit was arranged by Halifax himself,
                  early in November 1937, at a time when he was Acting Foreign Secretary,
                  Eden being absent in Brussels at a meeting of signers of the Nine-Power
                  Pacific Treaty of 1922. </p>
              <p>As a result, Halifax had a long conversation
                  with Hitler on 19 November 1937 in which, whatever may have been
                  Halifax’s intention, Hitler’s government became convinced of three
                  things: </p>
              <p>(a) that Britain regarded Germany as the chief bulwark against
                  communism in Europe; </p>
              <p>(b) that Britain was prepared to join a Four
                  Power agreement of France, Germany, Italy, and herself;  and</p>
              <p>(c) that
                  Britain was prepared to allow Germany to liquidate Austria,
                  Czechoslovakia, and Poland if this could be done without provoking a
                  war into which the British Government, however unwillingly, would be
                  dragged in opposition to Germany.</p>
              <p>The German Foreign Ministry
                  memorandum on this conversation makes it perfectly clear that the
                  Germans did not misunderstand Halifax except, possibly, on the last
                  point. </p>
              <p>There they failed to see that if Germany made war, the British
                  Government would be forced into the war against Germany by public
                  opinion in England.</p>
              <p>The German diplomatic agents in London, especially
                  the Ambassador, Dirksen, saw this clearly, but the Government in Berlin
                  listened only to the blind and conceited ignorance of Ribbentrop. </p>
              <p>As
                  dictators themselves, unfamiliar with the British social or
                  constitutional systems, the German rulers assumed that the willingness
                  of the British Government to accept the liquidation of Austria,
                  Czechoslovakia, and Poland implied that the British Government would
                  never go to war to prevent this liquidation. </p>
              <p>They did not see that the
                  British Government might have to declare war to stay in office if
                  public opinion in Britain were sufficiently aroused. </p>
              <p>The British
                  Government saw this difficulty and as a last resort were prepared <em>to declare war</em> but not <em>to wage war</em> on Germany. This distinction was not clear to the Germans and was not
                  accepted by the inner core of the Milner Group.</p>
              <p>It was, however,
                  accepted by the other elements in the government, like Chamberlain
                  himself, and by much of the second circle of the Milner Group,
                  including Simon, Hoare, and probably Halifax.  It was this which
                  resulted in the “phony war” from September 1939 to April 1940.</p>
              <p>The memorandum on Halifax’s interview, quoting the Englishman in the third person, says in part:<sup><a href="http://www.yamaguchy.netfirms.com/7897401/quigley/anglo_12b.html#n_10_">[10]</a></sup></p>
              <blockquote> In spite of these difficulties [British public opinion, the English
                  Church, and the Labour Party] he and other members of the British
                  Government were fully aware that the Führer had not only achieved a
                  great deal inside Germany herself, but that, by destroying Communism in
                  his country, he had barred its road to Western Europe, and that Germany
                  therefore could rightly be regarded as a bulwark of the West against
                  Bolshevism. ... After the ground had been prepared by an Anglo-German
                  understanding, the four Great West-European Powers must jointly lay the
                  foundation for lasting peace in Europe.  Under no conditions should any
                  of the four Powers remain outside this cooperation, or else there would
                  be no end to the present unstable situation.... Britons were realists
                  and were perhaps more than others convinced that the errors of the
                  Versailles dictate must be rectified.  Britain always exercised her
                  influence in this realistic sense in the past.  He pointed to Britain’s
                  role with regard to the evacuation of the Rhineland ahead of the fixed
                  time, the settlement of the reparations problem, and the reoccupation
                  of the Rhineland. ... He therefore wanted to know the Führer’s attitude
                  toward the League of Nations, as well as toward disarmament.  All other
                  questions could be characterized as relating to changes in the European
                  order, changes that sooner or later would probably take place.  To
                  these questions belonged Danzig, Austria, and Czechoslovakia.  England
                  was only interested that any alterations should be effected by peaceful
                  evolution, so as to avoid methods which might cause far-reaching
                  disturbances, which were not desired either by the Führer or by other
                  countries.... Only one country, Soviet Russia, stood to gain from a
                  general conflict.  All others were at heart in favour of the
                  consolidation of peace.</blockquote>
              <p>That this attitude was not Halifax’s personal argument but the point of
                  view of the government (and of the Milner Group) is perfectly clear. </p>
              <p>On arrival, Halifax assured the Germans that the purposes of his visit
                  had been discussed and accepted by the Foreign Secretary (Eden) and the
                  Prime Minister. </p>
              <p>On 26 November 1937, one week after Halifax’s
                  conversation with Hitler, Chamberlain wrote to his sister that lie
                  hoped to satisfy German colonial demands by giving them the Belgian
                  Congo and Angola in place of Tanganyika. </p>
              <p>He then added:  “I don’t see
                  why we shouldn’t say to Germany, ‘Give us satisfactory assurances that
                  you won’t use force to deal with the Austrians and Czechoslovakians,
                  and we will give you similar assurances that we won’t use force to
                  prevent the changes you want if you can get them by peaceful means.' ”<sup><a href="http://www.yamaguchy.netfirms.com/7897401/quigley/anglo_12b.html#n_11_">[11]</a></sup></p>
              <p>It might be noted that when John W. Wheeler-Bennett, of Chatham House and the Milner Group, wrote his book on <em>Munich:  Prologue to Tragedy</em>,
                  published in 1948, he relegated the last quotation to a footnote and
                  suppressed the references to the Belgian Congo and Angola. </p>
              <p>This,
                  however, was an essential part of the appeasement program of the
                  Chamberlain group. </p>
              <p>On 3 March 1938, the British Ambassador in Berlin,
                  Nevile Henderson, one of the Chamberlain group, tried to persuade
                  Hitler to begin negotiations to carry out this plan but did not
                  succeed. </p>
              <p>He repeated Lord Halifax’s statement that changes in Europe
                  were acceptable to Britain if accomplished without “the free play of
                  forces,” and stated that he personally “had often expressed himself in
                  favour of the Anschluss.” </p>
              <p>In the colonial field, he tried to interest
                  Hitler in an area in Africa between the 5th parallel and the Zambezi
                  River, but the Fuhrer insisted that his interest was restricted to
                  restoration of Germany’s 1914 colonies in Africa.</p>
              <p>At the famous interview between Hitler and Schuschnigg in February
                  1938, Hitler told the Austrian that Lord Halifax agreed “with
                  everything he [Hitler] did with respect to Austria and the Sudeten
                  Germans.”  This was reported in a “rush and strictly confidential”
                  message of 16 February 1938 from the American Consul General in Vienna
                  to Secretary of State Hull, a document released to the American press
                  on 18 December 1948. </p>
              <p>Chamberlain and others made it perfectly clear,
                  both in public and in private, that Britain would not act to prevent
                  German occupation of Austria or Czechoslovakia. </p>
              <p>On 21 February 1938,
                  during the Austrian crisis, John Simon said in the House of Commons,
                  “Great Britain has never given special guarantees regarding Austrian
                  independence.”  Six days later, Chamberlain said:  “We must not try to
                  delude small nations into thinking that they will be protected by the
                  League against aggression and acting accordingly when we know that
                  nothing of the kind can be expected.” </p>
              <p>Five days after the seizure of
                  Austria on 12 March 1938, the Soviet Union sent Britain a proposal for
                  an international conference to stop aggression. </p>
              <p>The suggestion was
                  rejected at once, and, on 20 March 1938, Chamberlain wrote to his
                  sister:  “I have therefore abandoned any idea of giving guarantees to
                  Czechoslovakia or to the French in connection with her obligation to
                  that country.”</p>
              <p>When Daladier, the French Premier, came to London at the end of April
                  1938 to seek support for Czechoslovakia, Chamberlain refused and
                  apparently, if we can believe Felling, put pressure on the French to
                  compel the Czechoslovaks to make an agreement with Hitler. </p>
              <p>On 1 May,
                  Chamberlain wrote to his sister in this connection:  “Fortunately the
                  papers have had no hint of how near we came to a break over
                  Czechoslovakia.”</p>
              <p>In a long report of 10 July 1938, Ambassador Dirksen wrote to Ribbentrop as follows:</p>
              <blockquote> In England the Chamberlain-Halifax Cabinet is at the helm and the first
                  and most essential plank of its platform was and is agreement with the
                  totalitarian States.... This government displays with regard to Germany
                  the maximum understanding that could be displayed by any of the likely
                  combinations of British politicians.  It possesses the inner-political
                  strength to carry out this task.  It has come nearer to understanding
                  the most essential points of the major demands advanced by Germany,
                  with respect to excluding the Soviet Union from the decision of the
                  destinies of Europe, the League of Nations likewise, and the
                  advisability of bilateral negotiations and treaties.  It is displaying
                  increasing understanding of Germany’s demands in the Sudeten German
                  question.  It would be prepared to make great sacrifices to meet
                  Germany’s other just demands—on the <em>one</em> condition that it is endeavoured to achieve these ends by peaceful
                  means.  If Germany should resort to military means to achieve these
                  ends, England would without the slightest doubt go to war on the side
                  of France.</blockquote>

              <p>...While all this was going on, the remorseless wheels of appeasement were
                  grinding out of existence one country after another.</p>
              <p>The fatal loss
                  was Czechoslovakia.  This disaster was engineered by Chamberlain with
                  the full co-operation of the Milner Group.  The details do not concern
                  us here, but it should be mentioned that the dispute arose over the
                  position of the Sudeten Germans <em>within</em> the Czechoslovak state, and as late as 15 September 1938 was still
                  being expressed in those terms. </p>
              <p>Up to that day, Hitler had made no
                  demand to annex the Sudeten area, although on 12 September he had for
                  the first time asked for “self-determination” for the Sudetens.  Konrad
                  Henlein, Hitler’s agent in Czechoslovakia and leader of the Sudeten
                  Germans, expressed no desire “to go back to the Reich” until after 12
                  September. </p>
              <p>Who, then, first demanded frontier rectification in favor
                  of Germany ? </p>
              <p>Chamberlain did so privately on 10 May 1938, and the
                  Milner Group did so publicly on 7 September 1938. </p>
              <p>The Chamberlain
                  suggestion was made by one of those “calculated indiscretions” of which
                  he was so fond, at an “off-the-record” meeting with certain Canadian
                  and American newspaper reporters at a luncheon arranged by Lady Astor
                  and held at her London house. </p>
              <p>On this occasion Chamberlain spoke of
                  his plans for a four-power pact to exclude Russia from Europe and the
                  possibility of frontier revisions in favor of Germany to settle the
                  Sudeten issue. </p>
              <p>When the news leaked out, as it was bound to do,
                  Chamberlain was questioned in Commons by Geoffrey Mander on 20 June but
                  refused to answer, calling his questioner a troublemaker. </p>
              <p>This answer
                  was criticized by Sir Archibald Sinclair the following day, but he
                  received no better treatment.  Lady Astor, however, interjected, “I
                  would like to say that there is not a word of truth in it.”  By 27
                  June, however, she had a change of heart and stated:  “I never had any
                  intention of denying that the Prime Minister had attended a luncheon at
                  my house. The Prime Minister did so attend, the object being to enable
                  some American journalists who had not previously met him to do so
                  privately and informally, and thus to make his acquaintance.”</p>
              <p>The second suggestion for revision of frontiers also had an Astor flavor, since it appeared as a leading article in <em>The Times</em> on 7 September 1938.</p>
              <p>The outraged cries of protest from all sides
                  which greeted this suggestion made it clear that further softening up
                  of the British public was urgently necessary before it would be safe to
                  hand over Czechoslovakia to Hitler.  This was done in the war-scare of
                  September 15-28 in London. </p>
              <p>That this war-scare was fraudulent and that
                  Lord Halifax was deeply involved in its creation is now clear.  All the
                  evidence cannot be given here.  There is no evidence whatever that the
                  Chamberlain government intended to fight over Czechoslovakia unless
                  this was the only alternative to falling from office.  Even at the
                  height of the crisis, when all ways out without war seemed closed (27
                  September), Chamberlain showed what he thought of the case by telling
                  the British people over the BBC that the issue was “a quarrel in a
                  far-away country between people of whom we know nothing.”</p>
              <p>To frighten the British people, the British government circulated
                  stories about the strength of the German Army and Air Force which were
                  greatly exaggerated;  they implied that Germany would use poison gas at
                  once and from the air, although this was quite untrue;  they
                  distributed gas masks and madly built trenches in London parks,
                  although the former were needless and the latter worthless.  On 23
                  September, the British advised the Czechoslovakian government to
                  mobilize, although they had previously forbidden it. </p>
              <p>This was done to
                  increase the crisis in London, and the fact that Göring’s air force
                  allowed it to go through without attack indicates his belief that
                  Germany did not need to fight.  In fact, Göring told the French
                  Ambassador on 12 September that he had positive assurance that Britain
                  would not fight. </p>
              <p>As early as 1 September 1938, Sir Horace Wilson,
                  Chamberlain’s alter ego, told the German charge d’affaires in London,
                  Theodor Kordt, “If we two, Great Britain and Germany, come to agreement
                  regarding the settlement of the Czech problem, we shall simply brush
                  aside the resistance that France or Czechoslovakia herself may offer to
                  the decision.”</p>
              <p>The fraudulent nature of the Munich crisis appears throughout its
                  history.  We might mention the following: </p>
              <p>(1) the suspicious fashion
                  in which the Runciman Mission was sent to Czechoslovakia, immediately
                  after Hitler’s aide, Captain Wiedemann, visited Halifax at the latter’s
                  home (not the Foreign Office) on 18 July 1938, and with the statement,
                  which was untrue, that it was being sent at the desire of the
                  Czechoslovaks;  13</p>
              <p>(2) the fact that Runciman in Czechoslovakia spent
                  most of his time with the Sudetens and put pressure on the government
                  to make one concession after another to Henlein, when it was perfectly
                  clear that Henlein did not want a settlement; </p>
              <p>(3) the fact that
                  Runciman wrote to Hitler on 2 September that he would have a plan for a
                  settlement by 15 September; </p>
              <p>(4) the fact that this Runciman plan was
                  practically the same as the Munich settlement finally adopted; </p>
              <p>(5) the
                  fact that Chamberlain made the war-scare over the Godesberg proposals
                  and, after making a settlement at Munich, made no effort to enforce
                  those provisions by which Munich differed from Godesberg, but on the
                  contrary allowed the Germans to take what they wished in Czechoslovakia
                  as they wished; </p>
              <p>(6) the fact that the government did all it could to
                  exclude Russia from the settlement, although Russia was allied to both
                  Czechoslovakia and France; </p>
              <p>(7) the fact that the government and the
                  French government tried to spread the belief that Russia would not
                  honor these commitments, although all the evidence indicated that she
                  would; </p>
              <p>(8) the fact that Chamberlain had a tete-a-tete conference with
                  Hitler at Berchtesgaden on 15 September, which lasted for three hours,
                  and at which only Hitler’s private interpreter was present as a third
                  party, and that this was repeated at Godesberg on 23 September; </p>
              <p>(9)
                  the fact that the Czechoslovaks were forced to yield to Chamberlain’s
                  settlement under pressure of ultimatums from both France and Britain, a
                  fact that was concealed from the British people by omitting a crucial
                  document from the White Paper of 28 September 1938 (Cmd. 5847).</p>
              <p>Two additional points, concerned with the degree of German armaments
                  and the position of the anti-Hitler resistance within Germany, require
                  further elucidation.  For years before June 1938, the government had
                  insisted that British rearming was progressing in a satisfactory
                  fashion. </p>
              <p>Churchill and others had questioned this and had produced
                  figures on German rearmament to prove that Britain’s own progress in
                  this field was inadequate.  These figures were denied by the
                  government, and their own accomplishments were defended. </p>
              <p>In 1937 and
                  in 1938, Churchill had clashed with Baldwin and Chamberlain on this
                  issue.  As late as March 1938, Chamberlain said that British armaments
                  were such as to make her an “almost terrifying power ... on the opinion
                  of the world.” </p>
              <p>But as the year went on, the government adopted a quite
                  different attitude.  In order to persuade public opinion that it was
                  necessary to yield to Germany, the Government pretended that its
                  armaments were quite inadequate in comparison with Germany.”  We now
                  know, thanks to the captured papers of the German Ministry of War, that
                  this was a gross exaggeration. </p>
              <p>These papers were studied by Major
                  General C.F. Robinson of the United States Army, and analyzed in a
                  report which he submitted to the Secretary of War in October 1947. </p>
              <p>This document, entitled <em>Foreign Logistical Organizations and Methods</em>,
                  shows that all of the accepted estimates of German rearmament in the
                  period 1933-1939 were gross exaggerations. </p>
              <p>From 1936 to the outbreak
                  of war, German aircraft production was not raised, but averaged 425
                  planes a month.  Her tank production was low and even in 1939 was less
                  than Britain’s. </p>
              <p>In the first 9 months of 1939, Germany produced only
                  50 tanks a month;  in the last 4 months of 1939, in wartime, Germany
                  produced 247 “tanks and self-propelled guns,” compared to a British
                  production of 314 tanks in the same period. </p>
              <p>At the time of the Munich
                  crisis, Germany had 35 infantry and 4 motorized divisions, none of them
                  fully manned or equipped.  This was no more than Czechoslovakia had
                  alone.</p>
              <p>Moreover, the Czech Army was better trained, had far better
                  equipment, and had better morale and better fortifications.  As an
                  example of this point, we might mention that the Czech tank was of 38
                  tons, while the Germans, before 1938, had no tank over 10 tons. </p>
              <p>During
                  1938 they brought into production the Mark III tank of less than 20
                  tons, and in 1939 brought into production the Mark IV of 23 tons.  Up
                  to September 1939, the German Army had obtained only 300 tanks of the
                  Mark III and Mark IV types together.  Most of these were delivered
                  during 1939.  In comparison, the Germans captured in Czechoslovakia, in
                  March 1939, 469 of the superior Czech tanks.</p>
              <p>At the same time they
                  captured 1500 planes (of which 500 were first-line), 43,000
                  machineguns, and over 1 million rifles.  These figures are comparable
                  with what Germany had at Munich, and at that time, <span class="magenta">if the British government had desired, Germany would have been facing France, Britain, and Russia, as well as Czechoslovakia</span>.</p>
              <p>It should perhaps be mentioned that up to September 1939 the German
                  Navy had acquired only 53 submarines during the Hitler regime.  No
                  economic mobilization for war had been made and no reserve stocks built
                  up. </p>
              <p>When the war began, in September 1939, Germany had ammunition for
                  6 weeks, and the air force had bombs for 3 months at the rate of
                  expenditure experienced during the Polish campaign. </p>
              <p>At that time the
                  Air Force consisted of 1000 bombers and 1050 fighters.  In contrast,
                  the British air program of May 1938 planned to provide Britain with a
                  first-line force of 2370 planes;  this program was stepped up in 1939. </p>
              <p>Under it, Britain produced almost 3000 military planes in 1938 and
                  about 8000 in 1939.  The German figures for planes produced in these 2
                  years are 5235 and 8295, but these are figures for all planes produced
                  in the country, including civil as well as military airplanes.  As
                  Hanson Baldwin put it, “Up until 1940, at least, Germany’s production
                  did not markedly outstrip Britain’s.”  It might also be mentioned that
                  British combat planes were of better quality...</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>...The events of 1939 do not require our extended attention here, although
              they have never yet been narrated in any adequate fashion. </p>
              <p>The German
              seizure of Bohemia and Moravia was not much of a surprise to either the
              Milner or Chamberlain groups;  both accepted it, but the former tried
              to use it as a propaganda device to help get conscription, while the
              latter soon discovered that, whatever their real thoughts, they must
              publicly condemn it in order to satisfy the outraged moral feelings of
              the British electorate. </p>
              <p>It is this which explains the change in tone
              between Chamberlain’s speech of 15 March in Commons and his speech of
              17 March in Birmingham.  The former was what he thought;  the latter
              was what he thought the voters wanted.</p>
              <p>The unilateral guarantee to Poland given by Chamberlain on 31 March
              1939 was also a reflection of what he believed the voters wanted. </p>
              <p>He
              had no intention of ever fulfilling the guarantee if it could possibly
              be evaded and, for this reason, refused the Polish requests for a small
              rearmament loan and to open immediate staff discussions to implement
              the guarantee. </p>
              <p>The Milner Group, less susceptible to public opinion,
              did not want the guarantee to Poland at all. </p>
              <p>As a result, the
              guarantee was worded to cover Polish “independence” and not her
              “territorial integrity.” </p>
              <p>This was interpreted by the leading article
              of <em>The Times</em> for 1 April to leave the way open to territorial revision without
              revoking the guarantee. </p>
              <p>This interpretation was accepted by
              Chamberlain in Commons on 3 April.  Apparently the government believed
              that it was making no real commitment because, if war broke out in
              eastern Europe, British public opinion would force the government to
              declare war on Germany, no matter what the government itself wanted,
              and regardless whether the guarantee existed or not.</p>
              <p>On the other
              hand, a guarantee to Poland might deter Hitler from precipitating a war
              and give the government time to persuade the Polish government to yield
              the Corridor to Germany.  If the Poles could not be persuaded, or if
              Germany marched, the fat was in the fire anyway;  if the Poles could be
              persuaded to yield, the guarantee was so worded that Britain could not
              act under it to prevent such yielding. </p>
              <p>This was to block any
              possibility that British public opinion might refuse to accept a Polish
              Munich. </p>
              <p>That this line of thought was not far distant from British
              government circles is indicated by a Reuters news dispatch released on
              the same day that Chamberlain gave the guarantee to Poland. </p>
              <p>This
              dispatch indicated that, under cover of the guarantee, Britian would
              put pressure on Poland to make substantial concessions to Hitler
              through negotiations.  According to Hugh Dalton, Labour M.P., speaking
              in Commons on 3 April, this dispatch was inspired by the government and
              was issued through either the Foreign Office, Sir Horace Wilson, John
              Simon, or Samuel Hoare. </p>
              <p>Three of these four were of the Milner Group,
              the fourth being the personal agent of Chamberlain.  Dalton’s charge
              was not denied by any government spokesman, Hoare contenting himself
              with a request to Dalton “to justify that statement.”  Another M.P. of
              Churchill’s group suggested that Geoffrey Dawson was the source, but
              Dalton rejected this.</p>
              <p>The efforts of the Chamberlain group to continue the policy of
              appeasement by making economic and other concessions to Germany and
              their efforts to get Hitler to agree to a four-power pact form one of
              the most shameful episodes in the history of recent British diplomacy. </p>
              <p>These negotiations were chiefly conducted through Sir Horace Wilson and
              consisted chiefly of offers of colonial bribes and other concessions to
              Germany.  These offers were either rejected or ignored by the Nazis.</p>
              <p>One of these offers revolved around a semi-official economic agreement
              under which British and German industrialists would form cartel
              agreements in all fields to fix prices of their products and divide up
              the world’s market. </p>
              <p>The Milner Group apparently objected to this on
              the grounds that it was aimed, or could be aimed, at the United
              States. </p>
              <p>Nevertheless, the agreements continued;  a master agreement,
              negotiated at Dusseldorf between representatives of British and German
              industry, was signed in London on 16 March 1939. </p>
              <p>A British government
              mission to Berlin to help Germany exploit the newly acquired areas of
              eastern Europe was postponed the same day because of the strength of
              public feeling against Germany. </p>
              <p>As soon as this had died down, secret
              efforts were made through R.S. Hudson, secretary to the Department of
              Overseas Trade, to negotiate with Helmuth Wohlthat, Reich Commissioner
              for the Four Year Plan, who was in London to negotiate an international
              whaling agreement. </p>
              <p>Although Wholthat had no powers, he listened to
              Hudson and later to Sir Horace Wilson, but refused to discuss the
              matter with Chamberlain.  Wilson offered: </p>
              <p>(1) a non-aggression pact
              with Germany; </p>
              <p>(2) a delimitation of spheres among the Great Powers; </p>
              <p>(3) colonial concessions in Africa along the lines previously
              mentioned; </p>
              <p>(4) an economic agreement. </p>
              <p>These conversations, reported
              to Berlin by Ambassador Dirksen in a dispatch of 21 July 1939, would
              have involved giving Germany a free hand in eastern Europe and bringing
              her into collision with Russia.  One sentence of Dirksen’s says:  “Sir
              Horace Wilson definitely told Herr Wohlthat that the conclusion of a
              non-aggression pact would enable Britian to rid herself of her
              commitments vis-a-vis Poland.” </p>
              <p>In another report, three days later,
              Dirksen said:  “Public opinion is so inflamed, and the warmongers and
              intriguers are so much in the ascendancy, that if these plans of
              negotiations with Germany were to become public they would immediately
              be torpedoed by Churchill and other incendiaries with the cry 'No
              second Munich !' ”</p>
              <p>The truth of this statement was seen when news of the Hudson-Wohlthat
              conversations did leak out and resulted in a violent controversy in the
              House of Commons, in which the Speaker of the House repeatedly broke
              off the debate to protect the government.  According to Press Adviser
              Hesse in the German Embassy in London, the leak was made by the French
              Embassy to force a break in the negotiations. </p>
              <p>The negotiations,
              however, were already bogging down because of the refusal of the
              Germans to become very interested in them.  Hitler and Ribbentrop by
              this time despised the British so thoroughly that they paid no
              attention to them at all, and the German Ambassador in London found it
              impossible to reach Ribbentrop, his official superior, either by
              dispatch or personally. </p>
              <p>Chamberlain, however, in his eagerness to make
              economic concessions to Germany, gave to Hitler £6 million in
              Czechoslovak gold in the Bank of England, and kept Lord Runciman busy
              training to be chief economic negotiator in the great agreement which
              he envisaged.</p>
              <p> On 29 July 1939, Kordt, the German charge d’affaires in
              London, had a long talk with Charles Roden Buxton, brother of the
              Labour Peer Lord Noel-Buxton, about the terms of this agreement, which
              was to be patterned on the agreement of 1907 between Britain and
              Russia. </p>
              <p>Buxton insisted that his visit was quite unofficial, but Kordt
              was inclined to believe that his visit was a feeler from the
              Chamberlain group.  In view of the close parallel between Buxton’s
              views and Chamberlain’s, this seems very likely. </p>
              <p>This was corroborated
              when Sir Horace Wilson repeated these views in a highly secret
              conversation with Dirksen at Wilson’s home from 4 to 6 p.m. on 3 August
              1939.  Dirksen’s minute of the same day shows that Wilson’s aims had
              not changed.  He wanted a four-power pact, a free hand for Germany in
              eastern Europe, a colonial agreement, an economic agreement, etc. </p>
              <p>The
              memorandum reads, in part:  “After recapitulating his conversation with
              Wohlthat, Sir Horace Wilson expatiated at length on the great risk
              Chamberlain would incur by starting confidential negotiations with the
              German Government.  If anything about them were to leak out there would
              be a grand scandal, and Chamberlain would probably be forced to
              resign.” Dirksen did not see how any binding agreement could be
              reached under conditions such as this;  “for example, owing to Hudson’s
              indiscretion, another visit of Herr Wohlthat to London was out of the
              question.”  To this, Wilson suggested that “the two emissaries could
              meet in Switzerland or elsewhere.”  The political portions of this
              conversation were largely repeated in an interview that Dirksen had
              with Lord Halifax on 9 August 1939.<sup><a href="http://www.yamaguchy.netfirms.com/7897401/quigley/anglo_12b.html#n_18_">[18]</a></sup></p>
              <p>It was not possible to conceal these activities completely from the
              public, and, indeed, government spokesmen referred to them occasionally
              in trial balloons.</p>
              <p>On 3 May, Chamberlain suggested an Anglo-German
              non-aggression pact, although only five days earlier Hitler had
              denounced the Anglo-German naval agreement of 1935 and the
              Polish-German non-aggression pact of 1934. </p>
              <p>As late as 28 August, Sir
              Nevile Henderson offered Germany a British <em>alliance</em> if she were successful in direct negotiations with the Poles.<sup><a href="http://www.yamaguchy.netfirms.com/7897401/quigley/anglo_12b.html#n_19_">[19]</a></sup></p>
              <p>This, however, was a personal statement and probably went further than
              Halifax would have been willing to go by 1939.  Halifax apparently had
              little faith in Chamberlain’s ability to obtain any settlement with the
              Germans.</p>
              <p>If, by means of another Munich, he could have obtained a
              German-Polish settlement that would satisfy Germany and avoid war, he
              would have taken it.  It was the hope of such an agreement that
              prevented him from making any real agreement with Russia, for it was,
              apparently, the expectation of the British government that if the
              Germans could get the Polish Corridor by negotiation, they could then
              drive into Russia across the Baltic States.</p>
              <p>For this reason, in the
              negotiations with Russia, Halifax refused any multilateral pact against
              aggression, any guarantee of the Baltic States, or any tripartite
              guarantee of Poland.  Instead, he sought to get nothing more than a
              unilateral Russian guarantee to Poland to match the British guarantee
              to the same country. </p>
              <p>This was much too dangerous for Russia to
              swallow, since it would leave her with a commitment which could lead to
              war and with no promise of British aid to her if she were attacked
              directly, after a Polish settlement, or indirectly across the Baltic
              States. </p>
              <p>Only after the German Soviet Non-aggression Pact of 21 August
              1939 did Halifax implement the unilateral guarantee to Poland with a
              more formal mutual assistance pact between Britain and Poland. </p>
              <p>This
              was done to warn Hitler that an attack on Poland would bring Britain
              into the war under pressure of British public opinion. </p>
              <p>Hitler, as
              usual, paid no attention to Britain. </p>
              <p>Even after the German attack on
              Poland, the British government was reluctant to fulfill this pact and
              spent almost three days asking the Germans to return to negotiation. 
              Even after the British were forced to declare war on Germany, they made
              no effort to fight, contenting themselves with dropping leaflets on
              Germany. </p>
              <p>We now know that the German generals had moved so much of
              their forces to the east that they were gravely worried at the effects
              which might follow an Allied attack on western Germany or even an
              aerial bombing of the Ruhr.</p>
              <p>In these events of 1939, the Milner Group took little part.  They must
              have known of the negotiations with Germany and probably did not
              disapprove of them, but they had little faith in them and by the early
              summer of 1939 were probably convinced that war with Germany was
              inevitable in the long run. </p>
              <p>In this view Halifax probably shared, but
              other former members of the Group, such as Hoare and Simon, by now were
              completely in the Chamberlain group and can no longer be regarded as
              members of the Milner Group.  From June 1939 to May 1940, the fissure
              between the Milner Group and the Chamberlain government became wider...</p>
