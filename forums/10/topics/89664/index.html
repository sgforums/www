Successive leaders will see our consistency and respect us.<br><br>Understanding their needs and aspirations require some consistency on our part. We need to be firm at times but it will be hasty to act high-profile. There is no point having suspicions and strains all the times like in the past. Swiss's style of quiet diplomacy is the best. With military preparedness and capabilities, we can excell Swiss in getting along with our neighbours.

Have you even considered the amount of revenues that Singapore has been earning from Indonesia in the past and years to come? Without the tourism industry (A large portion of it made up of Indonesians), where else do you think Singapore can generate so much income from?
