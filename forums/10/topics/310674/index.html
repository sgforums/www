              <h3 class="post-title entry-title">The disinterested Singaporean.</h3>
              <p>Ladies and Gentlemen,<br><br>Anyone having spent any amount of time in
              Singapore would have discovered a startling characteristic of the
              Singaporean psyche. They have no interest at all in politics or public
              affairs whatsoever. Period.<br><br>They have no interest at all in how
              their tax money is spent. No interest in what new public projects are
              intended. None in how the train system functions. They couldn't care
              less how much the ministers are paid or indeed what they are even
              doing. No interest in whether the education system is working. No
              interest in listening to the next speech given by the Prime Minister.
              Nor for that matter by the Minister Mentor, his father.<br><br>The
              public have stated publicly, by their actions; if not in so many words;
              that as far as they are concerned the government, their ministers and
              the whole establishment can go to Hell for all they care. They are not
              interested.<br><br>A foreigner being confronted with this total
              indifference in the Singaporean about his country's affairs may ask,
              why? Why this universal indifference, disinterest, in their own
              futures; for their own country. The answer is quite simple. Minister
              Mentor Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_0" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew cares two hoots about what the people think.<br><br>Its
              like this, you see. The Minister Mentor has managed, according to him,
              to employ the most capable among Singaporeans, and paid them the
              highest salaries for any job anywhere in the world. Since he has these
              highly talented people, this illuminating brilliance; what need is
              there for the ordinary people to think and question government policies?<br><br>According to Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_1" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew, the people's input in opinions, suggestions is unnecessary. Since
              the government has all the thinkers they need, what need is there for
              the man in the street to even think? It would have made no difference
              if they had no heads at all!<br><br>Therefore the people, have decided,
              naturally, that since his government is not interested in his views, it
              is useless for him to try to voice them. It will after all, fall on
              deaf ears anyway. So<br>understandably, over a period of time,
              Singaporeans have become what they are today. An entire society which
              has disengaged from any involvement in public affairs. They have
              removed their thinking caps. Today, Singaporeans go to work, they do
              their shopping if they can afford it, go home to watch television, they
              sleep, wake up the next day and follow the same routine, day after day.<br><br>Singaporeans
              do not know that they have a constitution. They do not know their laws.
              They do not know who their local MP is. They do not know what the <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_2" class="blsp-spelling-error">HDB</span> policy is. They do not know what the tax system is. They do not know if
              it is illegal to speak in public. They do not know whether it is
              illegal to criticise the Minister Mentor. They do not know if it is
              legal to complain against <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_3" class="blsp-spelling-error">CPF</span> policies. In other words the average Singaporean does not know very
              much about his own country. He or she lives for the next day waiting to
              be told what he has to do next.<br><br>And what is worse, they couldn't care less!<br><br>Such
              a country with an entire population who are unable or unwilling to
              question government policy; figuratively speaking, a country of
              children waiting for Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_4" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew to tell them what to do next, is a country doomed to failure;
              doomed because it lacks a self correcting mechanism provided by the
              people engaging the government in decision making.<br><br>You have seen
              this country stumble from one mistake after another. You will recall
              many years ago, people were told not to have too many children. Today,
              there are no children being born.<br><br>The government introduced national service. This <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_5" class="blsp-spelling-error">speeded</span> up the brain drain with educated Singaporeans taking their children overseas to avoid it.<br><br>English
              was introduced as the main language. But it also facilitated the brain
              drain with people leaving Singapore for English speaking Australia.<br><br>The
              government legislated to own and control all newspapers and news media.
              What is left in the newspapers is just government propaganda. Today,
              the people have no faith in the newspapers. If you need the truth, look
              elsewhere. Look to the Internet. This is causes to heighten the brain
              drain to Australia among the educated.<br><br>The government controls
              the legal profession appointing their puppets in the Law Society. The
              government placed their puppets as judges. This has entirely eroded
              public confidence in the administration of justice. Resulting in
              lawyers leaving the profession and the country. And resulting in the
              people not resorting to the law courts and settling disputes privately.<br><br>This
              fact, that the people of Singapore are being led by this government;
              that there is no rule of law; that it is a country run by dictate; this
              knowledge has spread far and wide. Today foreigners are becoming
              increasingly reluctant to use Singapore for any purpose other than as a
              stopover tourist destination.<br><br>And while this country falters
              along under its own fiction of grandeur and opulence put out in the
              state controlled propaganda sheets or the Straits Times, the people
              remain completely disinterested in what ever is going on. This
              combination of a government which thinks it knows best and a people
              completely disinterested in whatever the government does; to put it
              mildly; is a recipe for disaster.<br><br>It is an explosive situation. An untenable situation. An unhealthy country.<br><br>Gopalan Nair</p>

              <p>yeh but what the point of getting interested into politics when whatever opinions put forward will fall into deaf ear. Yes one can lament here in sgforum, however, no amount of discussion will spearchange anything.. unless changes are collective and lead by a capable leader.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Probably im waiting for someone like Obama...smart, charismtic, know how to fiddle with rules to play with the gahmen.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>On the contray, i prefer very much on foreign politics than local one.. cos none of the local politics are  " so interesting "</p>

              <p>I know this reply might be taken negatively, but even the PAP is made up of the people.</p>
              <p>The ones who formed the PAP in 1959 are ordinary people who came forward and convinced the rest of the people to vote for them. The people who come forward into the PAP and opposition now, are also the people before they joined politics, in which after that, some people do not consider them the people anymore but politicians.</p>
              <p>The ones who gave PAP the manpower are the people, the ones who do not give manpower to the opposition are people too.</p>
              <p>In other words, the root is the people.</p>
              <p>The issue is, what kind of people? 2.5 million Singaporeans, it is difficult to say that they are only one type. The people threw up a Lee Kuan Yew, they also threw up a Chiam, LTK, JBJ or CSJ.</p>
              <p>Everything starts from the people.</p>
