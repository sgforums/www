            <div class='col-md body'>According to news reports, The RSS Courageous incident was an oversight caused by the commanding officer on board, nothing to do with our country's military capabilities. I have to agree with Nathan, you DO have much to learn about our military prowess and capabilities. Don't worry they will tech you all this in NS, then you will not say such things anymore. BTW, do you know that our army is considered one of the best in the region compared to some of our 'Bigger ' neighbors.

Depends on whether you train or not, if you don't train, its a waste of time.  If you train yourself, become fighting fit, no, cos end of the day, you actually gain something.<br><br>So far, most of the people that I know that totally condemn NS without reservation, are those PES C &amp; E NSmen.  I will sympathise with them because its really quite boring and monotonous sitting in an office or driving around all day.  I see PES E induction programmes and I wonder what are these people wasting their time in tekong and seating capacity in the canteen for?  End of the day, they still don't get to learn how to defend themselves.  If they say they feel their times is wasted, they are totally justified to say so.<br><br>Are we too small to defend ourselves?  There are advantages of being small, and of course the disadvantages.   A country is only too small defend itself when the citizens lack determination and courage to take up arms.<br><br>Why NS is important?  This is a question that the govt has answered many times, even when we were kids.  We are a small country with a small population and limited resources and cash.  We cannot afford a regular standing armed forces. We need to rely on the citizen-soldiers to defend the country.<br><br>I have bad comments about NS all the time... especially if its one of those "welfare" sessions.  And other than the SAF's peace time inefficiency, I have no other complaints.</div>
