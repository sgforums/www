            <div class='col-md body'>To Kok-Eh<br><br><blockquote>the wise one has spoken. there's a whole lot of truth in that. but then again, entrepreneurial spirit aside,<strong> if you start a business you would almost have to start depending on your domestic demand initially</strong>, then grow big enough to go overseas. maybe the small domestic market is a concern, and even a cause for unemployment? </blockquote>You are spot on. This is why Singapore will fail. Our government destroys any hope that you have in creating a niche domestically in Singapore. Can you name any industry in Singapore that is not dominated by a GLC or a MNC (invited by the government) .. they don't give you a chance to even start.<br><br>No government in the world has any business in competiting against our own businesspeople. However, in Singapore, we see how DBS kills off the family owned banks with the help of LHL. We see how our second carrier Silk Air is owned by the first carrier (SIA). We see how the government ultimately owns both telcos, both TV stations, the taxi company, the bus company, the public transport company, the grocery stores, the main property developer, main housing developer etc etc. We can't even open a simple mobile phone reseller, as the Hello shop will kill you off.<br><br>All these are avenues for the enterprising to be able to make it and create jobs for the rest of the populace. But sadly, the government has taken full control. And hence, its almost suicidal for anyone to try and take them on. Its probably easier to win against Microsoft at their own turf rather than take on the GLCs with your own company.<br><br>Thats ONE of the reasons why the unemployment crisis is happenning.</div>

Lets just use this data, I know its probably not too accurate as it did not have CPF deductions.<br><br>So the take home pay of a middle level executive Singaporean is US$59,291 .. thats about S$8,400 per month. The Malaysian gets RM8,300 per month.<br><br>In terms of cost .. that means that we are 2x more expensive than Malaysia.<br><br>So MNCs will definately prefer to hire the Malaysians (in Malaysia) for mid level staff.
