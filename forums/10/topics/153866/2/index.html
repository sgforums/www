That being said, the current situation is clearly untimely.

            <div class='col-md body'>Now the gov is trying to polish up our economic data, for better report card at the end of year. The election was expected to held this year initially. But the the outbreak of many "unforeseeable" events, it seems that it is only better to use TIME to dilute the nasty effects of these incidents.<br><br>However, looking ahead, the 2006 may not look that rosy after all. At least IMF and World Bank had repeatedly issue warning on the rising oil price. Many US political heavyweights had stresses in many public events that US60 oil is NOT expensive at all. Currently, many local analyst had rise doubts on the retailed gas price in Sg. We may yet feel the full force of the rising oil price due to the large reserve of oil in Sg. Morever, the electronic sector is not going well too. So long Sg still struggling. One citibank analyst even noted that the growth of our local taxi population in 2004 alone, could have generated at least employments for 8-9K taxi drivers.<br><br>We can expected the Gov to annouce some election good news before they declare the offical date for the election. An interesting area to look at is the usage of CPF money for investment. The indecisive on the election has also left the stock market clueless. Thus, you see the stock is always hovering at 2300. Gov has spent much effort using property news to push the market from 2100. The market is likely to attain new heights when the Gov direction is more clear.</div>
