              <p><strong><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">OPINION</span></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">On Christmas Day 1989, the Bank of Japan raised its benchmark interest rate by half a percentage point. Nine months later, the Nikkei stock market index had fallen by nearly half, and by 2001, it had shed 70 per cent of its value. Land prices followed suit 80 per cent between the end of 1989 and 2002.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">With inflated asset prices went Japan’s inflated growth. Between 1992 and 2003, growth averaged less than 1 per cent a year. Japan experienced what became known as the Lost Decade.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">What went wrong? In the 1980s, when Japanese companies appeared destined to conquer the global economy, the country had become convinced that its miraculous breath-taking growth will never end.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">The result of such thinking – that economies always grow, property prices and stocks always rise – created an exuberance that proved irrational, not quite unlike what Singapore is going through right now.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Japan’s conviction in its own invincibility had caused a rise in asset prices that endangered the economy.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">Like Singapore, land is scare in Japan and land prices escalated through the 1980s. Based on these inflated values, Japanese banks were willing to lend to buyers larger and larger amounts.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">Some of the money borrowed was used to speculate on land and stocks. Property and share prices pushed each other to loftier and loftier, and less and less rational, heights. Japan unknowingly entered a bubble economy with disastrous results when it burst. Today, Japan’s real estate is still more than 50 per cent below its peak value in 1991.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">Is Singapore entering the same property bubble as Japan in the 1980s? Since its recovery in 2006, Singapore’s previously lackluster property market has been on a bull run saved for a minor blip in the first half of 2009.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">According to the latest figures, property prices have rebounded strongly in the third quarter with the private sector increasing by as much as 15 per cent.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">Though Singapore is out of a recession, the global economy has still not quite recovered. Even the government admits that growth is likely to be sluggish for the rest of the year till 2010.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">The official cautious mood is in stark contrast to the ebullience on the ground where the sellers, agents and media conspire to whip up a speculative frenzy which saw Singaporeans flocking back like sheep to new launches.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">Unlike Japan, the Singapore government has a huge stake in the property market through the HDB which builds more than 85 per cent of the island’s public housing and hence it is in a unique position to influence the direction of the market through policies and price controls.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">The price of HDB resale flats hit a record high in June 2009, surpassing its previous peak in the fourth quarter of 1996. It is expected to rise by a further 2 to 3 per cent by the end of the year. As the prices of new flats are pegged to resale flats, they skyrocketed too.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">Under free market conditions, the prices would not have escalated at such a rapid rate. The government is partly responsible for the price inflation through its immigration and housing policies.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">In a bid to increase Singapore’s population via immigration, the government has opened the floodgates to foreigners to study, work and live in Singapore.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Singapore’s population has reached the 5 million mark of which 36 per cent are foreigners, many of whom are encouraged to become Permanent Residents.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">PRs are permitted to purchase resale HDB flats. A recent ERA report revealed that 40 per cent of resale flat buyers are PRs. Needless to say, these newcomers are instrumental in causing the prices of resale flats to rise in the face of a limited supply.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">HDB has started to reduce the supply of new flats in 2000s. Under its Build-to-Order (BTO) scheme, buyers will have to select their flats first before they are built and ready to move in 3 to 4 years later.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">For those who cannot afford or are unwilling to wait that long, they will have no choice but to purchase a flat from the resale market.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">It is obvious that the demand for flats has far outstripped the supply. In less than 2 weeks since HDB announced the sale of balanced flats, there are already over 20,000 applications for some 2,100 flats.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">As the value of flats continue to climb, banks are lending buyers at greater and greater amounts. The tenure of the loan is now increased to 35 years.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">Is it possible for prices to continue rising forever? Common sense tells us that what goes up must come down. It is inconceivable that the prices of HDB flats will continue to grow at the same rate every year while the wages of the average worker remain stagnant.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">Unfortunately, most Singaporeans still do not recognize the danger. Partly influenced by the relentless government propaganda that rising prices help to generate wealth for them, they are under the false belief that property prices will always rise, like the Japanese in the 1980s.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">Home-owners try to capitalize on their asset values by selling them with exorbitant COVs in order to upgrade to a condominium. Few realize that they will have to take out a much larger bank loan in order to finance their new purchase.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">Young couples fresh out of school are willing to fork out 20 to 30 per cent of their household income to finance a HDB flat without realizing that they may not have sufficient savings for their retirement needs, not that they have much of a choice anyway.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Singapore is entering a property bubble or is in fact in one. With an election looming ahead, the government is unlikely to take tough measures to cool the property market out of fear of incurring the wrath of those who bought them at high prices which means that prices are likely to continue rising way into 2010.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">Since public housing is a basic necessity in Singapore, buyers will be forced to take up higher loans to purchase a flat. They have to pray hard that prices will not drop or crash for the banks will ask them to make up the difference in the valuation should it materialize.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">Given Singapore’s over-reliance on the export economy and foreigners, as well as its insipid domestic economy dominated by gigantic state-linked companies with no world-class brands, it is not a question of if but when the property bubble will burst.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">In the next one to five years, the Singapore economy will find it increasingly harder to compete heads-on with the emerging giants of China and India with their creative and talented entrepreneurs and well-run firms like Lenovo and Wipro.</span></p>
              <p> </p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>OPINION</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There is a Chinese saying – “ju1 an1 si1 wei1″ meaning that when one is living in good times, one must not forget to contemplate on the possible dangers ahead.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For Singaporeans, the good times are not even remotely back yet and they are already jumping on the property bandwagon in the hope of making a quick buck either a few months later or many years down the line.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>After all, the prices of HDB flats have appreciated in the last two decades, no thanks to the PAP government who kept reminding Singaporeans that their assets will continue to appreciate in value under their charge so much that it has become one of the greatest myth ingrained in the collective consciousness of the populace.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What if the prices stop going up, drop or even crash? Can Singaporeans foresee or stomach this disastrous scenario at the back of their minds?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>MM Lee is right that Singapore needs foreigners who not only keep our GDP figures impressive but also help to shore up our property market.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>70 per cent of buyers of Singapore’s private properties are foreigners while PRs comprise 40 per cent of buyers for resale flats.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If foreigners were to pull out of Singapore, both the private and public property market will crash precipitously.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>While the United States has regained its footing following the implementation of the stimulus package by the Obama administration, it is still not out of the woods yet.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>U.S. banks are still saddled with a lot of bad debts and the cleaning up of its financial system has only just begun. Nobody really knows the true extent of the damage.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>With an uncertain global economic climate, any tiny jolts in the geopolitical landscape will send it into a tailspin – e.g. renewed hostilities between Russia and Georgia engulfing the entire Caucasus and Eastern Europe, another attack on the U.S. by Al-Qaeda, Iran lobbying a nuclear warhead towards Israel, the implosion of North Korea following the demise of Kim Jong-IL or conflict across the Taiwan Straits.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>These are potential international and regional flash-points which are both unpredictable and devastating in effect. Given Singapore’s reliance on the international trade, political instability in the U.S., Europe or China will deal a terrible blow to its vulnerable economy.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>With a plummet in demand for its goods and services world-wide, MNCs will fold up and return home, bringing with them its foreigners and PRs thereby precipitating a crash in the property market.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The domestic demand is surely insufficient to support Singapore’s buoyant private property market. As the prices go into free-fall, they will bring down that of public housing with them as it is inconceivable that a condominium will cost less than a HDB flat.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Even if this doomsday scenario does not materialize, the downward pressure on prices will increase with time in the next three to five years.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Though actual figures are not given, the majority of Singapore’s immigrants are from China and India. They are mostly here to seek fresh opportunities and to earn a quick buck rather than to escape from the poverty of their homelands.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As China and India become more and more affluent, it will be increasingly harder for Singapore to draw their brightest talents to work and settle here.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Based on anecdotal evidence, there are few Chinese from the rich coastal cities of Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen and Guangzhou who make Singapore their home compared to those from the poorer inland provinces.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>More than often not, it is the qualified PMETs who have the purchasing power to buy private apartments and resale flats while the blue-collar unskilled workers are put up at crammed dormitories or rented flats.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The brain drain suffered by these two countries may slow down and even reverse soon as they catch up with Singapore in terms of living standards and quality of life.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>With decreasing numbers of foreigners from this “elite” pool coming to Singapore,  it will be difficult for property prices to be maintained at current levels for long.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The price increase of HDB flats has far outstripped the growth in real wages. If prices were to continue rising, there will come a time when ordinary Singaporeans will be priced out of the market and they will have no choice but to stay with their parents or rent a place.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Faced with stiff competition from cheap foreign labor, it is highly unlikely that the salaries of Singaporeans will increase by much, if any at all. In fact, they may be forced to accept lower pay and longer working hours in order to land a decent job in an employers’ market like ours.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>5 years ago, the starting pay of an electrical engineering graduate is about $2,800. Today, it is only $2,200 to $2,400. Prices of HDB flats have increased by more than 50 per cent since then. It doesn’t take a mathematician to realize that Singaporeans have actually become poorer especially if inflation is factored in.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Singaporeans have been complaining recently that HDB flats are becoming unaffordable. They may soon have to contend with the fact that they simply cannot afford to buy one and give up their cherished dream of owning a home.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The government is stuck in a quandary here. It is impossible for them to cater to the needs of both the home owner and the first-time buyer at the same time. Cooling the market now will cause recent home owners to suffer a loss while allowing the prices to continue escalating may soon make their biggest nightmare come true – a bubble followed by a crash.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The best hope for Singaporeans is that prices will soon hit a peak, stagnate for a period of time before dropping gradually to more sustainable levels.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The worst scenario will be a sub-prime type of crash with prices plunging abruptly by more than half and buyers defaulting on their loans with devastating effects on the rest of the economy.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Japan has been through it in the 1990s. The U.S. has not recovered for its housing crisis last year. Will Singapore avoid a similar fate?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For post-65 Singaporeans brought up on a daily dose of state propaganda to believe that they will continue to enjoy the good times of their parents, the bitter dose of reality may be hard to accept.</p>

              <p><strong>OPINION</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In the parts 1 and 2 of this article, we compare the similarities between Japan in the 1980s and Singapore now.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Despite signs that public housing is becoming more and more expensive to ordinary citizens, prices of HDB flats continue to rise, fueled by demand on the ground from both new citizens and PRs.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Given Singapore’s over-reliance on the global economy, it is only a matter of time before another crisis happens and precipitate a burst of the property bubble.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The political ramifications of such a crash will be disastrous for the ruling party. Either way, it cannot escape responsibility from causing the housing inflation with its ill-conceived policies in the first place.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A crash akin to the 1996 housing crisis which threw Singapore’s property market into the doldrums for a decade or so is well on the cards except that this time, the pain may be harder especially for some to bear.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Singaporeans have been fed with the illusion by the ruling party that HDB flats are “pots of gold” whose values will only appreciate with time which is further exacerbated by the use of estate upgrading as a carrot canvass for votes during elections.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In a speech made at Kim Keat ten years ago, then Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong told the residents unshamedly that it was the PAP government who was responsible for the rise in their asset value through various upgrading programmes.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>During the 2006 general elections, residents of the two opposition-controlled wards Hougang and Potong Pasir were offered a $100 million upgrading package if they voted for the PAP.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Unlike in the past when housing inflation is caused by a combination of GDP growth and limited land, the present bubble is created artificially by increasing the demand via immigration and limiting the supply of new flats by HDB.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As an indication of how serious the housing shortage is, there were over 20,000 applications for about 2,100 balanced flats released for sale by HDB last week.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A sudden and precipitous drop in housing prices will plunge many home owners, especially those who bought during the peak period between 2007 and 2009 into financial distress with dire consequences rippling to the rest of the economy.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A mini-subprime crisis is not an unforeseeable result with banks repossessing flats due to unpaid mortage loans and bankruptcies hitting a record high.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The anger, angst and frustration arising from such a catastrophe will naturally be directed at the ruling party.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Already, there are some quarters who are blaming HDB for its lack of foresight in building more new flats to meet rising demand between 2004 and 2006.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The number of foreigners arriving in Singapore has increased dramatically over the last few years and yet the number of flats built by HDB have not kept pace with the increase in population, leading to the present situation right now.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Having witnessed their parents and grandparents owning their HDB flats, young Singaporeans expect themselves to be beneficiaries as well, but flats are relatively cheap then unlike now when loan tenures have to be stretched to 35 years in order to accommodate more borrowers.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Naturally, Singaporeans are aghast at having to fork out a substantial portion of their monthly income to finance 99-year leasehold public housing which are obviously over-priced.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For those who are forced to buy a home at today’s prices because they have nowhere to stay, they will surely be peeved with the government should they make a loss subsequently following a property downturn or even worse, a crash.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Burdened with debts and a property which they cannot offload, they will be inclined to cast a protest vote against the ruling party in subsequent elections.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The real impact at the polls will depend on the number of disgruntled Singaporeans who feel hard done by the government’s housing policies.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In narrowly contested wards, it may tip the scale in favor of the opposition enabling them to snare a few seats and even one or two GRC. However, it is improbable that the incumbent will be voted out of office given its relative strength in comparison to the opposition’s weakness.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The ruling party is aware of rising dissatisfaction on the ground which explains shotgun measures introduced by HDB lately to address concerns of Singaporeans such as the release of balanced flats and the building of BTO flats.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Unfortunately, these are unlikely to stem the rise in prices at least in the near future.</p>
              <p>With more and more PRs and new citizens popping up the demand and BTO flats not ready till three years later, the housing shortage is likely to get worse before it stabilizes.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>HDB has predicted that prices of resale flats are likely to grow by another two to three per cent till the end of the year.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Singaporeans who need a place to stay urgently will have little choice but to purchase a flat now. Even for those who can afford to wait, they may be unwilling to do so out of fear of “missing the boat” and having to pay more should prices continue on the upward trend.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Even for existing home owners who bought their flats at low prices years ago, they will be devastated by the depreciation of their asset values for HDB flats have become the Singaporeans’ primary source of wealth over the years.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The backlash against the ruling party will be predictable but manageable unless a credible opposition emerge to challenge its authority.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For a long time, the ruling party has claimed its mandate from the people by generating wealth consistently in the form of asset appreciation though its claims had been debunked by a recent study done by two NUS economists.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Many Singaporeans continue to believe that the ruling party is primarily responsible for rise in flat values despite evidence on the contrary.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The false premises offered so liberally by the ruling party to garner and consolidate support for its rule will return to haunt them in the event that the prices decline or even crash.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As we have seen from the examples of Japan, Iceland, Ireland and the Baltic states, Singapore’s inflationary market is untenable in the long run. It is not a matter of if, but when it will be brought back to earth.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Singaporeans may not be overly concerned about the lack of civil liberties, but they are surely obsessed with material possessions especially their flats.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When the crunch comes, they will have no qualms deserting the ruling party in droves and casting a protest vote against them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The opposition should start studying and formulating an alternative public housing blueprint to replace HDB’s profit-driven one to win support from the masses.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>More rules and subsidies should be provided to safeguard the interests of first-time home buyers.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>HDB must be completely transparent about its building, land and operating costs to allay public concerns that it is making obscene profits at the expenses of citizens.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>PRs should not be permitted to profit from the sale of their flats in the future when they leave Singapore. A capital gain tax can be imposed on their profits which can be directed to help less well-off Singaporeans afford a home of their own.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>HDB flats have now grown to become a necessity in land-scarce Singapore. As the largest landlord and property developer in Singapore, the government is well placed to ensure that public housing remains affordable in Singapore not by some arbitrary benchmarks, but in real terms according to public perception.</p>
