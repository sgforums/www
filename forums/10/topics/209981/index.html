            <div class='col-md body'>Sluggish sales for Suntec City Mall tenants since Sunday<br>By Wong Siew Ying, Channel NewsAsia | Posted: 12 September 2006 1816 hrs<br><br>Sluggish sales for Suntec City Mall tenants<br><br>SINGAPORE: Business has nosedived between 40 and 70 percent for many tenants at Suntec City Mall since the tight security and road closure were enforced around the area on Sunday.<br><br>Selo Ozcelik, the operator of Deli Turk, says his restaurant has seen better days even during SARS and the World Cup season.<br><br>Admittedly, this is the worst patch since he started the business five years ago, with takings falling by 70 percent in recent days.<br><br>Selo has also cut down the number of part-time staff.<br><br>It is the same story for his neighbours, with one of them opting to keep its doors closed.<br><br>"We hope the management considers this and give us some rebate or anything they can offer us," said Selo.<br><br>"Business was affected yesterday, by 40 percent, in fact today it's even worse. Usually it's very crowded during lunch time, but now so many empty chairs and tables," said Anthony Sim, Store Leader, Cedele.<br><br>But most tenants are in no hurry to change their marketing tactics, preferring a wait-and-see approach.<br><br>While some, who have introduced discounts, say shoppers aren't biting.<br><br>"We have done 20 percent discount for our regulars, we contacted them but they also say it's quite inconvenient to come over here," said Lim Tong Li, Push-Cart Operator.<br><br>Many tenants hope business will pick up over the next few days when the delegates arrive at the convention site.<br><br>However, they are concerned that there may not be enough signages leading them to the shopping mall.<br><br>Currently, the most direct route to the shopping area is this entrance tucked at the end of the convention centre.<br><br>Tenants say the tight security and traffic diversions may have put off some shoppers.<br><br>"If you look at the roads and the drive here, the traffic is pretty smooth, car parks are open, people are moving around, I think after the first day, more people are beginning to realise that the shopping malls are open, business as per normal and life goes on," said Andre Lobo, Advertising &amp; Promotion Manager, Suntec City Development.<br><br>The Mall is also offering promotions to reward shoppers. - CNA /dt<br><br></div>
