            <div class='col-md body'>Well, the move isn't exactly something new and I'm not exactly surprise that they are deploying SM Goh to spruce up muscle in the PAP's efforts to win back those two wards. One things for sure, Mr Goh is a political heavyweight in local politic terms, as such, he would definitely bring an added dimsension to the PAP campign. The question is, what role does he exactly play and how do the people of Potong Pasir and Hougang react to his involvement? As I said, he is a former PM and he known the issues that will make Singaporeans tick the PAP way, so if he is able to bring such issues into the campign, it'll be rather interesting to see how do the opposition incumbents react. Mr Chiam has come out running on his track record, Mr Low has remained silent on this development. We shall see.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>OK lah, something for fun</strong><br><br>Galadriel: The power of the enemy is growing. Sauron will use his puppet Saruman to destroy the people of Rohan<strong>(Hougang)</strong>. Isengard has been unleashed. The Eye of Sauron now turns to Gondor<strong>(Potong)</strong>, the last free kingdom of men. His war on this country will come swiftly. He senses the Ring is close. The strength of the Ringbearer is failing. In his heart, Frodo begins to understand. The quest will claim his life. You know this. You have foreseen it. It is the risk we all took. In the gathering dark, the will of the Ring grows strong. It works hard now to find its way back into the hands of men. Men, who are so easily seduced by its power. The young captain of Gondor has but to extend his hand, take the Ring for his own and the world will fall. It is close now, so close to achieving its goal. For Sauron will have dominion over all life on this Earth, even unto the ending of the world. The time of the elves is over. Do we leave Middle-Earth to its fate? Do we let them stand alone?<br><br><img src="http://lotr.skennie.com/templatesite/images/palantir.jpg"><br><br>Theoden: A great host, you say?<br>Aragorn: All Isengard is emptied.<br>Theoden: How many?<br>Aragorn: Ten thousand strong at least.<br>Theoden: [astonished] Ten thousand?<br>Aragorn: It is an army bred for a single purpose, to destroy the world of men.

What can men do against such reckless hate?<br>Aragorn: Ride out with me. Ride out and meet them.<br>Theoden: For death and glory.<br>Aragorn: For Rohan<strong>(Hougang)</strong>. For your people.<br>Theoden: The Horn of Helm <strong>Hammer</strong>hand will sound in the deep, one last time!<br><br><img src="http://alicia-logic.com/capsimages/LOTR_Two185BernardHill.jpg"><br><br>Frodo: I can't do this Sam.<br>Sam: I know. It's all wrong. By rights we shouldn't even be here. But we are. It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo. The ones that really mattered. Full of darkness and danger, they were. And sometimes you didn't want to know the end. Because how could the end be happy? How could the world go back to the way it was when so much bad had happened? But in the end, it's only a passing thing, this shadow. Even darkness must pass. A new day will come. And when the sun shines it will shine out the clearer. Those were the stories that stayed with you. That meant something, even if you were too small to understand why. But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand. I know now. Folk in those stories had lots of chances of turning back, only they didn't. They kept going. Because they were holding on to something.<br>Frodo: What are we holding on to Sam?<br>Sam: That there's some good in this world, Mr. Frodo... and it's worth fighting for.<br><br><img src="http://www.creativescreenwriting.com/csdaily/csdart/images/LOTR-ROTK%20-%20Sam,%20Frodo%20(300w).jpg"></div>
