            <div class='col-md body'>We need opposition in our Parliament. NMPs just can't hack it cos they are not objective enough and being nominated by the ruling party means they are skewed in the ruling party's favour. It is also a way for the government to assess the capability of a new cohort so it doesn't really count as opposition. Having a stronger opposition reduces the likelihood of corruption.<br><br>Actually upgrading is just a 'face lift'. And flats on every level are not really necessary. Just something to put money back into the construction industry and the economy. In the end, the flats are on 99 yr lease and value will decrease proportionately, not to mention that the flats are already old and therefore not worth the value to upgrade. Why bother when there are new estates and new flats to sell. Plus upgrading means residents have to fork out money which they may not be willing or able to pay. Plus strong arm tactics may have the opposite effect. If u don't like it, u can always leave and live in a different area (if u have the money).<br><br>Something for everyone. If you want better packaging, go for Bishan flats. And pay more.

NMPs just can't hack it cos they are not objective enough and being nominated by the ruling party means they are skewed in the ruling party's favour. It is also a way for the government to assess the capability of a new cohort so it doesn't really count as opposition. Having a stronger opposition reduces the likelihood of corruption.<br><br>Actually upgrading is just a 'face lift'. And flats on every level are not really necessary. Just something to put money back into the construction industry and the economy. In the end, the flats are on 99 yr lease and value will decrease proportionately, not to mention that the flats are already old and therefore not worth the value to upgrade. Why bother when there are new estates and new flats to sell. Plus upgrading means residents have to fork out money which they may not be willing or able to pay.

            <div class='col-md body'>Sitoh the better - and younger - man, says SM<br>He asks if incumbent Chiam, 71, will have stamina to serve as MP for 5 more years<br>By Lydia Lim and Erica Tay<br><br>THE People's Action Party (PAP) man for Potong Pasir, Mr Sitoh Yih Pin, is the young, energetic challenger up against ageing defending champion Chiam See Tong.<br><br>Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong cast the fight between the two men this way at a rally in the opposition ward last night.<br><br>'Sitoh is better than Chiam any time,' he said.<br><br>Mr Goh asked voters to consider if Mr Chiam, 71, will have the stamina to be the ward's MP for another five years.<br><br>'This is a marathon, you've got to fight for five years and at the end of it, Mr Chiam will be 76,' he said.<br><br>Mr Goh cited another important difference between the two men. Mr Sitoh, 42, will make sure the blocks of flats in the ward are upgraded so there are lifts which stop on every floor.<br><br>He said even though Mr Chiam had promised to do this over the next five years, the opposition incumbent MP simply did not have the funds to do so.<br><br>Speaking on the same issue during a visit to the ward in the morning, Mr Goh told reporters: 'It is an empty promise. I have looked at the accounts. He does not have the money to upgrade all the lifts.'<br><br>During last night's rally, Mr Goh also praised the many ideas Mr Sitoh had to make Potong Pasir a beautiful town, including building a promenade along the part of Kallang River that flows through the ward.<br><br>He said Mr Sitoh will be able to deliver on his promises because if he is elected, he will have both the Senior Minister and Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong behind him.<br><br>Mr Goh also took issue with Mr Chiam's leadership abilities, saying the veteran opposition figure is afraid to recruit party members better qualified than him.<br><br>This is because of his experience with Dr Chee Soon Juan, who caused Mr Chiam to be kicked out of his former party, the Singapore Democratic Party.<br><br>Mr Sitoh, who spoke at the rally before SM Goh, gave a report card on the work he has done in the past 5 1/2 years as the ward's grassroots adviser.<br><br>Although he lost to Mr Chiam in 2001, he said he still wrote to the Government to appeal for the opening of Potong Pasir MRT station - which happened in 2003 - and, when there was no walkway between the station and a nearby coffee shop, he succeeded in getting one built.<br><br>Mr Sitoh said if he is elected, he will fulfil residents' three wishes - lift upgrading, brighter lights along corridors and covered linkways.<br><br>'I can do a lot, a lot more for you,' he said.<br><br>'As grassroots adviser, I'm able to do only community work. My hands are tied... We really want to win this election so we can run the town council.<br><br>'I sincerely ask you to give me a chance. I promise you in five years, Potong Pasir will be a very different home, totally revitalised.'<br><br>Mr Goh, who visited not just Potong Pasir in the morning, but opposition-held Hougang as well, told reporters the chances of a PAP win are higher in Potong Pasir.<br><br>'We feel we have a chance in Hougang and certainly more than a chance of winning in Potong Pasir,' said Mr Goh, who is tasked with helping the two PAP candidates win back the constituencies.<br><br>He noted that during his walkabout at the market area in Potong Pasir Avenue 2, there were residents who went up to Mr Sitoh to express their support for him - 'important signs that Sitoh is doing very well', added Mr Goh.<br><br>On the other hand, the task in Hougang for PAP candidate Eric Low is 'a little uphill'.<br><br>The PAP man is well known in the ward but a victory against incumbent Low Thia Khiang is a bit tougher, Mr Goh conceded. 'It is still - I would say at this stage - a little uphill. But we are making progress to balance the equation now in Hougang.'<br><br>lydia@sph.com.sg<br><br>ericatay@sph.com.sg<br>_____________________________________________________<br>Goh talking cock again.<br>Why don't ask President and MM got stamina to serve their terms?<br>Many of Goh's men all replaced by LHL aides, how to become "resource man" for Sitoh?<br>Where is my beautiful promises of Siwss standard of Living and More Good Years Ahead?<br><br></div>
