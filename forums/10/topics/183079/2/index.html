            <div class='col-md body'>But frankly speaking,i dont think the opposition will lose their ground in Potong Pasir n Hougang.Becoz Chiam n Lau are very respectable opposition party leaders.Imagine,the whole cabinet only got this 2 elected opposition party members to challenge the whole group of "no guts" PAP members,what a remarkable achievement!!!<br><br>Therefore,the residents in this 2 areas will continue to support Mr Chiam n Mr Lau.Besides,if this 2 areas also fall to PAP party,then what is the difference between our country n communist China?</div>

Yet they pay the same taxes as everyone else. But the ruling party in their supreme talent in manipulating the constitution, have somehow managed to pen somewhere that national development funds and other benefits available to constituencies run by the lightning are conveniently not available to the opposition camps in the wards they hold.<br><br>Instead the money is made availble to grassroots advisers, who ironically are PAP-aligned.<br><br>Is it therefore surprising or SHORTSIGHTED (as claimed by the yes-men of the ruling party) that the WP included a plan to dismantle grassroot teams in town councils? Low Thia Khiang and Chiam See Tong has no doubt been doubly agrieved that such funds have not been legitimately made available, and other handouts such as Singapore Power vouchers (an obvious political gimmick) were not distributed through the elected MPs in opposition wards but through PAP-aligned grassroot advisers.<br><br>If our people remain absent-minded and continue to snatch the carrots dangled in front of us by such unscrupulous attempts to BUY our vote, then i guess Hougang and Potong Pasir will both submit to lesser rule this time round.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>NO big deal! Let the PAP have Potong Pasir and Hougang back if they desperately want to upgrade the estates. In return all we need to do is vote in an entire team of opposition members in a GRC from some other contituency for example maybe Ang Mo Kio GRC   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Seriously, if the government wants to play ball then the people too can play musical chairs with them.<br><br><strong>Has it ever occured to residents of Potong Pasir and Hougand to sue the government collectively in the high courts on the upgrading issue? Tax payers money is being used to pay for upgradings. As citizens of the country residents of Potong pasir and Hougang are entitled to the same benefits as any other residents in any other contituency in the country.<br><br>For example, Can you imagine if in the United States all states controlled by Democrats were denied budgets/funding and the cities become derelicts and run down just because the state voted in a Democrat governor against the current President and Congress which is controlled by the Republican Party. Mr Bush and his republican government would be sued left and right by the American people. You can have different parties controlling states BUT it doesnt mean the American people collectively are denid equal benefits for voting in a representative from the opposing party. </strong></div>
