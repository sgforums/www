            <div class='col-md body'>For your info, I know about how tender goes about. However u need to realise tat the cost price, or the money they estimated tat is needed to build out the station depends on the company itself. Some companies which r more slack or have poorer equipment can in the end need more money to build up the same station. As such it is natural tat some companies can afford to bid at a lesser price than others. Do u think they will build out something tat cannot earn money ?<br><br>As I said before, your only point is tat the company tat construct out the nicoll highway is not a quality or reputable company. In fact it is one of the biggest construction company in singapore, it has already built up several station in the past before, it has good fiancial background and it do have a good track record.<br><br><blockquote>Why it was given to the lowest, reason can be 3.<br>1. To help the local from going bust in a faster way. (from the way it seem so.)<br>2. So they can make more out of it as contract was sign. (Delay of handing over can cost you everything.)<br>3. They simply dun know anything or they feel life is cheap, safety can be comprise. (Must be the main reason) </blockquote>Why don't u just think tat cheaper for the same things u buy is better ? If the transport fees increase due to the increase in building fees for the station, do u like to pay this extra ?<br><br>Do u really think a japanese company will be more sub standard compared to a singaporean one ? Do u really think they fail to include safety cost ? For your info the design for everything is already fixed and the contractor just carry out the construction according to the design. There is also regular checks done on the construction site by gov organisation too.<br><br>BTW 78% should be comapred with the expected full 100%, not 50%, thus it reflects tat they do not choose a tender just because it is cheap only</div>

Sor lee to the rest.<br>Hmm, if you are from the CCL, there is no point explain anymore. you should know very well what is happening inside now. Last year I had just get out from one of the CCL project. </blockquote>Sorry... I happened to be nobody... I have no connection with the circle line watsoever...<br><br><blockquote>Hmm when did Singapore did that. Even it has just like what you ask do u like to pay this extra ? the ppl pay and what can we the ppl say abt it.

" is to mention tat the company tat had caused the collapse had taken into account all the cost yet manage to come up with a cost price tat is cheaper than the other companies, thus should be awarded the contract.<br><br>About NEL, r u sure they purposely go and find a contractor tat had request for a high price ? I thought the cost of NEL is due to the implementation of "high technology"...<br><br><blockquote>Why not check who is the JV 1st. I am talikung abt the local con here. GOV try to help but 1st they must help themselves, kay.</blockquote>Maybe u can try to cut down words like JV as probably few people knew wat it is about. Why don't u try to provide information about the JV instead ? BTW the company tat cause the collapse is not a local contractor...<br><br><blockquote>transport fees increase... should be public transport fees. </blockquote>WAAAAAAAAAaaaaaAAAAAAAAA ! Big difference leh !!!<br><br><blockquote>Har, look at it. NELP(btw I was there as well) even b4 it operate the operator make noise that they are not going to make money at all? Look what happen after 6 mth till today. Profits is there kay. </blockquote>Wat is your point ? The fees for NEL is still higher than the MRT line owned by SMRT isn't it ? They use their cost price to determien the fare for the public, thus is they spent more on building out the stations, tis costs inevitably will be passed down to us consumers. Therefore it make sense for LTA or watever to accept low bidders isn't it ?<br><br><blockquote>Jap that have been too long in Singapore have become like local contractor but still is still a few notch above. The pt is still who he JV with kay. </blockquote>JV = ? Who he JV with ? Since u know he is Jap company and hold certain standard, then wat is your complains ?<br><br><blockquote>As for the design, it from LTA not like the NELP. Can you say that the safety-factor is the higher if not the same? </blockquote>Since the safety factor is higher or the same, then why complain tat they do not calculate the safety cost when they bid in your earlier reply ?<br><br><blockquote>And for the check by GOV in SAFETY will be MOM, STRUCTURE will be BCA. What do you know abt the check done by MOM. Which safety standard are we talking abt now?(For info I am a SAFETY PAX on site) PPL within LTA dun feel safe themselves, ppl like me, what do you think get out for? Money is one factor, nothing to denial abt it. </blockquote>So in the end there is checks conducted to make sure they do not use shortcut or inferior materials. So why blame Gov for accepting low bids ?</div>
