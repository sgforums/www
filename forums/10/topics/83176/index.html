            <div class='col-md body'>As someone who is going to get married and buy a HDB flat (since I cannot anything else) I was recently informed of this "fact" of Singapore's public housing. In my 29 years of existence, this little "fact" is a big shocker to me in today's Singapore; well, I was informed by my oldie birdie friends in my neighborhood kopitiam that all the Choice flats and Choice units in a HDB housing estate is prioritized first and foremost for this group of people known as Grassroots Leaders -- aka or also commonly known as the people who do the dirty work for PAP MPs in each constituency -- remember how the Nee Soon grassroot buggas cocked up in the last GE over the lor zhu incident and almost cost the Minsta of State his seat until SM had to go to a temple and negotiate like a true blue gangsta? Yep, those people indeed. Anyway, back to my story: I gaped and said "WTF???"<br><br>My guess is that there has to be some truth to this little fact since it was confirmed by at least another 3 or 4 people. When asked whether this kind of policy is logical, they shrugged their shoulders in the very Singaporean style and said "like that lor?". To pre-empt any Minsta from justifying by saying that these people contribute tons to the constituency and break their Sundays arranging the walkabouts for PAP MPs, my answer is "SO WHAT?" To be a grassroots leader, you are VOLUNTEERING right? So why should this act of volunteering be sweetened by these little "perks"? It's like donating for NKF so that you can win the first prize condominium. Where is equality and a free market for PUBLIC housing? If these people are so important why doesn't HDB build one block right in the middle of Toa Payoh Central and house them there? While you're at it, paint the block white with a red lightning logo across the building. These can be the first 10-room HDB flats to reward these minions of the party.<br><br>If such a policy does indeed exist, it has to be removed. Simple as that. For all the lucky ones getting Pinnacle @ Duxton, maybe you should go find out who your top-floor neighbours are.<br><br>Bo Zheng Hu<br>18.06.04<br>www.thevoiddeck.org</div>

Way way way below? in parliment "they" mention it oso.<br><br>If you dun know what tender was all abt, let me tell you.<br>it need 2 parties ie the client/developer and the contractor/s. As a client or develper you have calculated how much it will cost you oredi. and how much you will make after the sale.<br><br>If you are the client, not only will you choose the cheapest, but you will consider the quality as well. As for construction, you will oso look at the safety performance. All this is in your calculations. This was usually off look or look last till today. HDB, LTA and blah blah blah from the garment, nothing change.<br><br>"Other" as not in Singapore or non local developer will look at safety track records before they go into details like quaility and cost. from here it does not really differ much from the calculation they made. Reason why cheapest get is that "they" oredi make up their mind on how much "they" going to make.<br><br>Why it was given to the lowest, reason can be 3.<br>1. To help the local from going bust in a faster way. (from the way it seem so.)<br>2. So they can make more out of it as contract was sign. (Delay of handing over can cost you everything.)<br>3. They simply dun know anything or they feel life is cheap, safety can be comprise. (Must be the main reason)<br><br>As for local coy <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  safety is a cost to them which they dun count much in it. So when MOM so call do a rountine or spot check they will just carry out the so call said item during than and forget after that. Garment smart as to fine them for so call infringement and by doing this, from the tender which did not include the safety cost has cut into the so call 'profit'<br><br>More to write and say. but i think you know till now. there is no cheap and good around. Maybe NTUC have.</div>
