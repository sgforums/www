              frequently makes them disliked abroad. By Seah Chiang Nee.<br> May 17, 2008</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">JUSTIFIABLY
              or not, the disastrous Sichuan earthquake has sparked off a re-look
              here at a Singaporean characteristic that overshadows his economic
              achievement.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">In a
              TV interview, a tourist who just returned unhurt complained angrily
              about his encounter with airport delay and telephone breakdown at a
              time when the Chinese were frantically rescuing people.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">One
              viewer commented: “He kept complaining bitterly as if the whole
              world owed him an explanation about the airport delay.”</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Another
              added: “the man was practically shouting at the camera. His
              behaviour was really shocking.”</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">In
              the face of the terrible suffering, the middle-aged Singaporean’s
              insensitive complaint about his personal inconvenience spread
              consternation and a sense of shame among viewers.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">It
              highlighted a trait often attributed to affluent, educated
              Singaporeans that they have become too self-centred and insensitive
              to other people’s plights.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">After
              years of social campaigns, tales still abound of people rushing for
              train seats or refusing to give one up to the elderly, ill
              treatment of maids, littering or inconsiderate driving.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Many
              of the offenders are middle-class, young and educated who seem to
              have little interest in other people’s feelings.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">The
              Singaporean tourist, instead of lending a helping hand, was fuming
              about his own safety – even after he was safely back
              home.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">“Typical
              ugly Singaporean the sort that makes other people dislike us –
              totally self-centred,” said a blogger.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Others
              disagree, with one defending it as a normal reaction for a
              foreigner desperate to escape quickly. “He may have put it badly,
              but he was scared and obviously wanted to return to his family,” he
              said.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">“Realistically
              speaking, not every one can be highly principled about helping in a
              disaster in a foreign country,” he added.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Most,
              however, condemned his insensitivity. “It reflects the overall
              selfishness and self-centredness of middle-class Singaporeans,”
              said ‘investor’.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">“My
              general impression is that they are the second most selfish and
              self-centred people in Asia, next only to Hong Kongers.”</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">The
              debate raised the question whether Singapore could be considered a
              First World city with such boorishness.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">A
              mature, developed country isn’t defined only by wealth and
              education; it is also about humanity and concern for
              others.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Several
              days earlier, a girl who refused to give up a seat (meant for the
              elderly and the handicapped) to a pregnant woman, called her a
              “bitch” because she had stared at her and shook her
              head.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Some
              blame it on the environment, especially an elitist,
              each-man-for-himself mentality.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">“There’s
              no such thing as a free lunch” is a theme that has been drilled
              into every child and adult. A whole generation has grown up
              believing that if Singaporeans get into trouble, they can expect no
              help from anyone.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">It
              may be a good teaching for a small city without resources, but it
              has also spawned an antithesis: If you can expect no help from
              others, you also do not need to care for others.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">“Living
              in a society where only money talks makes all of us less human and
              less caring,” says ‘Anonymous’.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Another
              writer said he was a typically an apathetic, uncaring Singaporean
              until he went to live in the United States.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">“Two
              years into my stay there and having been offered help by plenty of
              strangers on the street, I found myself doing the same,” he
              said.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">“The
              typical Singaporean reaction when they are offered unsolicited help
              is a suspicious glare. Certainly not encouraging to would-be
              helpers,” he added.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">The
              person who has the single biggest influence on how Singaporeans
              think and behave is Lee Kuan Yew. Many of the current leaders and
              civil servants as well as older Singaporeans, emulate
              him.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">The
              Minister Mentor has never been too concerned about his own – or
              Singapore’s – popularity as much as its interests. Giving charity
              to countries in need, for example, has rarely been its
              forte.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">The
              political elite, followed by and large by the citizenry, takes
              after Lee’s generally no-welfare, harshly competitive and
              unsentimental leadership.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Last
              year, the “survival of the fittest” type view, believed to prevail
              among the top elites, burst into a public furore following remarks
              made by the scholar-daughter of a government MP.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Condemning
              a young professional, Derek Wee, who wrote about the pressures
              faced by the common people, the student, Wee Shu Min lambasted the
              critic as wretched, an idiot and “leech”.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">She
              appeared to be defending the class divide in Singapore or “a
              tyranny of the capable and the clever” saying that “the only other
              class is the complement.”</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">She
              ended by telling Derek: “Please, get out of my elite uncaring
              face.”</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Her
              MP father criticised her intemperate language, but supported some
              of her sentiments expressed.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">A
              nationwide condemnation ensued.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">The
              issue would have ended there if it were just regarded as a
              teenager’s rants. It was more than that.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Because
              Shu Min was a scholar designed for a possible leadership role and
              daughter of a People’s Action Party MP (from Prime Minister Lee
              Hsien Loong’s constituency), it instantly became a political hot
              potato.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">The
              critics said it reflected a government perception that a class
              divide was inevitable and may even be necessary to encourage people
              to strive harder in life.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">The
              target of her invective, Derek Wee, was actually echoing a popular
              public sentiment when he said Singaporeans were suffering partly
              because the government failed to understand their
              plight.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Shu
              Min’s message was that failures were caused by laziness or lack of
              capabilities, which the persons themselves were responsible – with
              no words of support or care for those in need.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>yes, singaporeans need to see beyond their little
              world.</em></p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>

              <p>To TS,</p>
              <p>Self-centered is the worse when a person , for his own selfish happiness , salary and personal gains, do injustice to the rest of the people. for examper, there was a fiction story about during Yaponese occupaition, some betrayed their people and sell information to Yaponese who killed those who try to rebell against them. For his personal gains and self preservation, he went against his own kind by doing injustice to them. The more bad he did, they more the Yapons are happy and the faster he got promoted. he very happy. no one dare to touch him as they know he is backed by the Yapons.</p>

              <p><br>I disagree to some extent fellow Melbournite. The country has to take (part) responsibility for nurturing this attitude in our people. Singapore is highly competitive and a big portion of jobs are inadequate to provide a "comfortable" lifestyle. To be precise I feel for those earning $1-2000/mth.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Added to that the perspective your fellow peers put on you to be "successful" that encourages the "selfish" nature in our people.</p>

              <p>I've once asked an aquaintance in a pub what his job was..... his reply was ..... no lar I'm just a air steward. The tone of his voice surprised me. I felt like saying that's a great job lots of perks and a chance to see the world. I told him I'm an office clerk (albeit with a nicer title) .... he then smiled and bought me a drink .... lol??</p>
