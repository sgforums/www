                                    that frequently makes them disliked abroad. By Seah Chiang 
                                    Nee.<br> May 17, 2008</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">JUSTIFIABLY 
                                    or not, the disastrous Sichuan earthquake has sparked off 
                                    a re-look here at a Singaporean characteristic that overshadows 
                                    his economic achievement.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">In a 
                                    TV interview, a tourist who just returned unhurt complained 
                                    angrily about his encounter with airport delay and telephone 
                                    breakdown at a time when the Chinese were frantically rescuing 
                                    people.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">One 
                                    viewer commented: “He kept complaining bitterly as 
                                    if the whole world owed him an explanation about the airport 
                                    delay.”</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Another 
                                    added: “the man was practically shouting at the camera. 
                                    His behaviour was really shocking.”</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">In the 
                                    face of the terrible suffering, the middle-aged Singaporean’s 
                                    insensitive complaint about his personal inconvenience spread 
                                    consternation and a sense of shame among viewers.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">It highlighted 
                                    a trait often attributed to affluent, educated Singaporeans 
                                    that they have become too self-centred and insensitive to 
                                    other people’s plights.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">After 
                                    years of social campaigns, tales still abound of people 
                                    rushing for train seats or refusing to give one up to the 
                                    elderly, ill treatment of maids, littering or inconsiderate 
                                    driving.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Many 
                                    of the offenders are middle-class, young and educated who 
                                    seem to have little interest in other people’s feelings.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">The 
                                    Singaporean tourist, instead of lending a helping hand, 
                                    was fuming about his own safety – even after he was 
                                    safely back home.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">“Typical 
                                    ugly Singaporean the sort that makes other people dislike 
                                    us – totally self-centred,” said a blogger.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Others 
                                    disagree, with one defending it as a normal reaction for 
                                    a foreigner desperate to escape quickly. “He may have 
                                    put it badly, but he was scared and obviously wanted to 
                                    return to his family,” he said.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">“Realistically 
                                    speaking, not every one can be highly principled about helping 
                                    in a disaster in a foreign country,” he added.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Most, 
                                    however, condemned his insensitivity. “It reflects 
                                    the overall selfishness and self-centredness of middle-class 
                                    Singaporeans,” said ‘investor’.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">“My 
                                    general impression is that they are the second most selfish 
                                    and self-centred people in Asia, next only to Hong Kongers.”</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">The 
                                    debate raised the question whether Singapore could be considered 
                                    a First World city with such boorishness.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">A mature, 
                                    developed country isn’t defined only by wealth and 
                                    education; it is also about humanity and concern for others.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Several 
                                    days earlier, a girl who refused to give up a seat (meant 
                                    for the elderly and the handicapped) to a pregnant woman, 
                                    called her a “bitch” because she had stared 
                                    at her and shook her head.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Some 
                                    blame it on the environment, especially an elitist, each-man-for-himself 
                                    mentality.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">“There’s 
                                    no such thing as a free lunch” is a theme that has 
                                    been drilled into every child and adult. A whole generation 
                                    has grown up believing that if Singaporeans get into trouble, 
                                    they can expect no help from anyone.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">It may 
                                    be a good teaching for a small city without resources, but 
                                    it has also spawned an antithesis: If you can expect no 
                                    help from others, you also do not need to care for others.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">“Living 
                                    in a society where only money talks makes all of us less 
                                    human and less caring,” says ‘Anonymous’.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Another 
                                    writer said he was a typically an apathetic, uncaring Singaporean 
                                    until he went to live in the United States.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">“Two 
                                    years into my stay there and having been offered help by 
                                    plenty of strangers on the street, I found myself doing 
                                    the same,” he said.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">“The 
                                    typical Singaporean reaction when they are offered unsolicited 
                                    help is a suspicious glare. Certainly not encouraging to 
                                    would-be helpers,” he added.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">The 
                                    person who has the single biggest influence on how Singaporeans 
                                    think and behave is Lee Kuan Yew. Many of the current leaders 
                                    and civil servants as well as older Singaporeans, emulate 
                                    him.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">The 
                                    Minister Mentor has never been too concerned about his own 
                                    – or Singapore’s – popularity as much 
                                    as its interests. Giving charity to countries in need, for 
                                    example, has rarely been its forte.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">The 
                                    political elite, followed by and large by the citizenry, 
                                    takes after Lee’s generally no-welfare, harshly competitive 
                                    and unsentimental leadership.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Last 
                                    year, the “survival of the fittest” type view, 
                                    believed to prevail among the top elites, burst into a public 
                                    furore following remarks made by the scholar-daughter of 
                                    a government MP.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Condemning 
                                    a young professional, Derek Wee, who wrote about the pressures 
                                    faced by the common people, the student, Wee Shu Min lambasted 
                                    the critic as wretched, an idiot and “leech”.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">She 
                                    appeared to be defending the class divide in Singapore or 
                                    “a tyranny of the capable and the clever” saying 
                                    that “the only other class is the complement.”</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">She 
                                    ended by telling Derek: “Please, get out of my elite 
                                    uncaring face.”</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Her 
                                    MP father criticised her intemperate language, but supported 
                                    some of her sentiments expressed.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">A nationwide 
                                    condemnation ensued.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">The 
                                    issue would have ended there if it were just regarded as 
                                    a teenager’s rants. It was more than that.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Because 
                                    Shu Min was a scholar designed for a possible leadership 
                                    role and daughter of a People’s Action Party MP (from 
                                    Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong’s constituency), it 
                                    instantly became a political hot potato.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">The 
                                    critics said it reflected a government perception that a 
                                    class divide was inevitable and may even be necessary to 
                                    encourage people to strive harder in life.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">The 
                                    target of her invective, Derek Wee, was actually echoing

              <p>What we can do in Singapore, either we donate clothes or food to the charities organisation or if u can still take out some money in your own pockets, donate to them.Seriously i feel they need it very much.</p>

              <p>this instance is a singapore society malaise where our immaturity as a nation stands out like a sore thumb. as singaporeans, they need to step up.</p>
              <p>it is a known fact LKY takes a hard stand on `humanitarian acts' in singapore's formative years; because singapore itself is not exactly on firm platform yet. in rejecting a larger role of accomodating the vietnamese boat people, i think LKY said that `we must grow calluses in our heart' in this instance. that has changed. the most recent earthquake in northwest china, singapore is the first to offer aid. in fact, it is one of the first few countries to have flown civil defence personnels to assist in the rescue effort. call it a political correct move (and it definitely is), it also shows that singapore is now more confident of its abilities.</p>
              <p>for the crude individuals, there is little we can do. with due respects to malaysians or elsewhere citizens, i am sure they too are equally capable of creating a ruckus. perhaps when the singaporean in general grew in its social and grace stature, we will hear less of this.</p>

              <p>Will Singapore ever be gracious?</p>
              <p>The question was put to LKY some months ago. I have to search the archives for this. His answer was like this. Never, he don't think so, but there is no harm trying to do so within the next five years, but <strong>not at the expense of economic growth. </strong></p>
              <p>So what is the mystery?</p>
              <p>Decades ago, in my hey days of package tours to Thailand, I saw at first hand how uncouth Singaporeans can be. Adults and childrens alike.

              <p>Whenever there is a disaster, I will always remember the incident of a Singaporean, jumping into a tank of drinking water to bathe. This was during the massive landslide disaster in Thailand.</p>
              <p>Will Singaporeans ever be gracious?</p>
              <p>Sadly we all know the answer.</p>

              <p>i think it is a question of time....never is too strong a word. it would be a shame if the gap between social grace and material wealth widen further than what it already is today.</p>
              <p>i believe LKY was commenting and comparing austria and singapore when that comment was made.</p>
              <p>and i don't put myself as part of a government representation on these matters. this is more of a question of personal upbringing.</p>

              I am sorry but i feel that ur arguement holds no water and makes no
              sense. BUT from what i understand u are blaming the government for
              causing us to struggle through daily life when they can be making
              our life easier. But this is merely an assumption on your part is
              it not?But has it not occured to you that if they could make our
              life they would?Do you not realise that they are dependent on us to
              stay in power?therefore they will try to appease us if
              possible?</p>

              This is your illusion. They are so entrenched in power that it is almost impossible to get rid of them!
