But of course I am looking from the point of an individual, and u r looking from the point of society. I think we concur that our society's copcept of sexuality is narrow, as u argued earlier.<br><br><strong></strong><blockquote><strong></strong><div class="quote_from"><strong>the idea that one can "choose" is not very neutral... when a choice is called for, values are inevitably attached to those choices and though u may suggest that they are both equally valid and respectable, i hardly think thats how the human mind works. </strong>[/quote]<br><br>Hmmmmm...i dun really get what u r trying to say in this paragraph...., i dun understand what u mean by "the idea that one can "choose" is not very neutral...".<br></div><div class="quote_body">[quote]when we "choose", we reject. for instance, when an individual "chooses" hetrosexuality, he does not discriminate against homosexuals, but he would be rejecting homosexual conceptions of love, relationships and sex.</div></blockquote>I feel "rejecting" is a rather strong word to use. If a person does not discriminate, like what you say, maybe it would be more accurate to use "not subscribe to homosexual conceptions of love, relationships and sex?" I feel rejecting would mean that the person is taking a negative stand. On the other hand, "not subscribe to" would infer to having a neutral stand on this. (not supporting and  not rejecting)<br><br><strong></strong><blockquote><strong></strong><div class="quote_from"><strong>and that is just an overly narrow understanding of what sexuality should mean. modern society is just plain vulgar and prudish to impose these sort of demarcations that hardly makes sense.</strong>[quote]<br><br>Agreed!<br></div><div class="quote_body">[quote]if u ask me, the ancient greeks got it right all along... its just too bad that the nobody bothered to properly understand the nature of being human before passing judgement based on narrow precepts... bah... religion... what a con-job.<br></div></blockquote>well I am not religious...but religion is a con-job?? erh....no comment. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Firstly we do not have the right to judge whether being homosexual is right or wrong. If they choose to follow that life style so be it. Some religions choose to hold the view that being homosexual is detrimental to their faith..let them have the freedom to do so. Each of us have a certain moral standard that we ascribe to. We should not impose judgement on others.<br><br>And that sex is for pro-creation purposes...that is something hard for me to swallow. Humans DO have sex for enjoyment as well and they enjoy sex with the person they love most. If I limit sex to only creating children...gosh....I rather have a test tube baby...the probability of getting pregnant could be higher <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
