            <div class='col-md body'>I think almost all acts of sex are learned.If a person never knows there is sodomy,he wouldn't  do it.So a person CHOOSES what act of sex he want to do.But if he is hooked to a certain  act,then it is another matter.It is similar to drug addicts who hook on drugs.Then they should seek help from professional.<br><br>Persons of the same sex can be friends,and even very good  and closed friends.They can even live together.But to have sexual relationship between same sex is not according to nature and so i believe is wrong.<br><br>Oldbreadstink,<br>Pleased with your understanding.</div>
