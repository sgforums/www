            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>We haven't come to the end of our debate yet.So the verdict is not out yet.<br></blockquote>debate as most completely used in this forum is to engage in argument by discussing opposing points, it is not like trying to agreeing on how much to raise the GST rates or how much clothing is considered indecent on television.<br><br>The way i look at it, it's a waste of time to consider any useful debate with you PRP, you have already issued a verdict and thus finished the debate before it even started.<br><br>Homosexuality whether it's right or wrong? By what standards do we use for reference?<br><br>Sodomy, an act which homosexuals parttake in is considered an offence that would get you stoned to death regardless of whether it was voluntary in the middle east, while in America no one really gives a damn if both sides consented to the act. By the laws of nature? I thought humans have already considered themselves to be beyond that for the past few decades.<br><br>So, repeating myself by whose standards do we adhere to decide the conclusion to this debate? Your narrow minded view of the world? Or our own individual opinion ?</div>

I guess in another post I said "hateful scam". Too harsh of a word to use. I guess I came out wrongly. What I wanted to say is that why should we allow these kind of opinions to be posted? What I mean is the kinds of opinion that are only based on ignorance and clearly hateful. If a gay basher was to utter all these words, and is able to attract more hate bashers to join in, it is just self perpatuating. Studies have shown for example, chaos, if there was a riot and people standing along the road were to join in, their ability to think for themselves, and say that it might be wrong is greatly reduced. They get caught up in heat of things and fall into the "follow the leader" trap.<br><br>What I wanted to say but was not clear about was, if we were to allow hateful words that have no sound facts and just hateful opinions, that are out to discriminate, there could be a backlash of other ignorant people joining in spitting out shit that consist of no intellectual thought behind it. So, shouldn't we stop this?<br><br>I guess the lack of ignorant people (except for PRP) replying could show that maybe people are more tolarent and understand the study of sexuality better than PRP. That is a good thing I guess. Hitler was very elequant speaker, he was able to convince people to join his cause.<br><br>Personally, I think opinions should be allowed to be displayed. BUT only with facts backing up their points. If opinions have not factual basis, then what is the point? To me it becomes a scam. Other people listening in could very well think that the opinion is fact and have gone through the intellectual process of weeding out biases.<br><br>I gave up on PRP and Stupid is Smart (what an appropriate name but think he got it wrong should be stupid is stupid) long time ago. I just wish someone will stop him from spewing out shit.<br><br>I didn't mean that you and some others were part of a scam or anything like that... just a wrong word to use, cause I clustered everyone together. However, I dont know why some people think that just because they are a majority, they have the right to force their thoughts and practices down on other's... it is just like the Americans trying to force democracy on Iraq, and not understanding that it has to come from within. I think that is why we should stop these non factual opinion from surfacing. It is harmful to everyone.<br><br>Maybe PRP is closeted and is trying his best to deny himself only to wake up 50 yrs later to find out that his life was based on false pretenses. *laugh* If he cannot even try to see the other side of the story, we must wonder why is that.<br><br>If this was a real debate, PRP would be long gone.<br><br>(lots of spelling errors, please excuse me spell check in word has made me lazy)</div>
