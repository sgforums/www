It's 'abnormal' to us because for thousands and thousands of years, guys have been screwing gals and gals have been screwing guys and that instilled the idea of what's supposed to be normal.

We might get uncomfortable with homosexual but there's no need to get so hostile with them. </blockquote>this whole idea of "abnormality" is questionable to begin with... its not a question of discriminating against them, but do we even have a claim to call them "abnormal" in the first place?<br><br><blockquote>They don't really hurt us. They are just humans like us who are trying to live the life they wanted.

Its a great big complex and diversified world out there, not as simple as it sounds when u lazily and conveniently label all these different people under one "gay" banner.<br>pls. go do your research... u're sounding more and more ignorant.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
