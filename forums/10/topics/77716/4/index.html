            <div class='col-md body'>Let me try to add a bit of my views here. This is quite a sensitive issue here and all comments should be objective and everyone should not take it as offensive.<br><br>Firstly, it doesnt mean that if anyone thinks something is wrong, that something is a crime.  It is just like when a child sulks sometimes to get what he wants. Some would think thats wrong. Some would think it is cute. Many things are subjective. But sure, go ahead and think it is wrong.  it is important to know that while we think something may be wrong but we do impose this on every single other person we meet.<br><br>Homosexuality is present from i dun noe since when.  The reason why this topic seems to be very sensitive in recent times is because of the tension between the homosexuals and the heterosexuals.<br><br>Many homosexuals presumed that just because heterosexuals reject their sort of lifestyles, they are being discriminated.  But, I would like to say that for MOST heterosexuals that when they speak out against gay marriages or stuff as such, it is not a discrimantion against the person but rather the discomfort at the moment with accepting such practices.  We must understand that this is after all not a social norm.  The way that most heterosexuals look at homosexuality is just like how we look at people who farts in public.  I mean, its ok to fart and sure you have the right to fart in public but...we do feel weird and it just feel right to just fart loudly in public.  Thus, homosexuals should not feel discouraged becos personally I love homosexuals as who they are. I may not agree to their lifestyles just as some people do not agree with my laidback lifestyle but yet I think they deserve a chance equal to mine in work, in leisure and in society.<br><br>Homosexuals should be patient because they should understand that though they have human rights, most people in society need time to adjust to ideas of gay couples getting married, of legalising sex between 2 same sex person. It is not something that people can get used to easily.<br><br>And i think homosexuals should be more confident of who they are.  With confidence, they can show society that they are more than their sexual orientation.  Sometimes, by pushing for something just because you have numbers on ur side and also using human rights, it may just backfired on you.<br><br>If you say I am against homosexuality, you are right. This is my personal view.  But, any objections should be that of a intellectual sense. It should not be a physical objection, emotional objection.  It is just like at work, i disagree with my superiors on many things but at the end of the day, we go out for drinks and we share with one another our problems at home.  This is how heterosexuals should treat homosexuals. Even friends can agree to disagree.<br><br>My 2 cents worth.  I am not interested to engage in any quarrel or debate of a total acceptance of homosexuality or total discrimination of it. But i would love total tolerance of one another.</div>

It should not be a physical objection, emotional objection. </blockquote>how can anyone intellectualise a sense of objection that IS essentially a physical and emotional response? at best, it would reek of hypocrisy... not that u're a hypocrit, but that i think your views needs to be clarified.<br><br>there are afterall, evidence that supports the notion that homosexuality, had as u mentioned, existed since goodness knows when, and that homophobia was essentially a state of mind that was constructed and imposed on pple and societies over time.<br><br>shouldn't such knowledge serve to debunk the myth of homophobia as a legitimate intellectual position?<br><br>i do acknowledge that society has strong views about homosexuality... but whether such views are grounded in facts or just simply fear and prejudice needs to be explored.<br><br>personally, i wouldn't force a person to accept homosexuality if that person simply holds the view that it is unacceptable to him / her... but i would like to hear what the basis of such feelings are.<br><br>if it is simply personal and emotional, then everyone is entitled to their own opinions... but if it rests on a weak and misplaced "intellectual" basis, then i think there's much to say about it.<br><br></div>
