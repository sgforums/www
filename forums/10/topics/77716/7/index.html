It would naturally be in the Singapore context of course.<br><br>I start from the LEGAL viewpoint first:<br><br>Fact: In Singapore, it is illegal to have sex with a another person of the seme sex.<br><br>Fact: There is no law in Singapore that says loving one person of the same sex is against the law.<br><br>Does LEGAL = Right and ILLEGAL = wrong? FOR THE SAKE OF ARGUMENT, I will assume the above. If homosexuality means ONLY having sex, then it is WRONG. When homosexuality means love, it is NOT illegal certainly, so it is RIGHT.<br><br>Note however, that this is strictly a legal viewpoint, and when people talk about right or wrong, it really goes beyond the legalistic definition that I have restricted myself above. How can it be that when something is legal, it can be RIGHT? Or when something is illegal, it is wrong?<br><br>I use the following example: possession and consumption of chewing gum in Singapore is illegal, so it is wrong in a legal sense, but certainly not wrong in a moral sense! I can chew gum in Malaysia, where it is legal! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> But then there is nothing wrong or right about chewing gum in Malaysia, it is simply whether u want to chew gum or not.<br><br>Anyway, I am rather uncomfortable with saying that when homosexuality = love, it is RIGHT just because it is not illegal. I certainly do not think that homosexuality, whether for sex or for love, is RIGHT. But I also think it is not WRONG either. Let me explain further.<br><br>When one looks at this from the RELIGIOUS viewpoint, then it becomes more complicated.<br><br>Christianity certainly doesnt allow same sex relations, therefore it is morally and religiously WRONG to have same sex relations, but as far as I know, Buddhist rules has nothing against homosexuality, but it doesnt encourage it either. There is even a forum for gay buddhists in Singapore, which I saw previously. So different religions have different prespectives. From a buddhist prespective, there isn't even a right or wrong to talk about.<br><br>SO if one doesnt care about the legal stuff, then it depends on what religion the person believes.<br><br>Finally, the MORAL viewpoint. I would take the MORAL viewpoint to mean a societal norm.<br><br>Definition of NORM from dictionary.com: A standard, model, or pattern regarded as typical: the current middle-class norm of two children per family<br><br>May I expand the definition further: that a norm would be determined by the majority of a population in a society.<br><br>It is quite indisputable that the majority of Singaporeans see homosexuality (whether for sex or for love) as taboo, as it clashes with traditional values and perception that heterosexual relations is necessary for the creation of the next generation.<br><br>However, with the influence from the west, the spread of homosexual culture from the west has gained ground in Singapore, since more people now are more open and liberal to different aspects of life, such as taking drugs, pre-martial sex, and naturally homosexualism.<br><br>As a society progress, it is inevitable that the values of people change over time to keep up with society's new demands. Change is a constant.<br><br>Thus, while one can say that homosexuality was wrong 50 years ago, one cannot say it in this era anymore. Times have changed. But I wont say that homosexuality is right. It is just something that everyone has to accept, whether we like it or not. And who knows, if in future when having sex with someone of the same sex is legalised, not only would it become acceptable, it may very well be the RIGHT thing to do, since medical science mey be so advanced that women may no longer be needed to create babies. (this is obviously too futuristic, but I am trying to get across my point that when our environment change, values change along with it too, and it is already happening in Singapore)<br><br>So in conclusion: It is not helpful or useful to say whether homosexuality is right or wrong, rather it is more of a personal choice I feel.<br><br>And if you are wondering how people turn homosexual, I would like to forward your attention to 2 websites:<br><br>www.peoplecanchange.com<br>www.freetobeme.com<br><br>That would answer PRP's questions right at the beginning of this thread effectively, I hope. There is no scientific proof to determine homosexuality IMHO, but it is more of external environmental factors that turn people's mentality to become homosexual. But they can come out of it, if they have the determination to. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br></div>
