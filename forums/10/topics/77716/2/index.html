The topic is "What does Singapore need?" not want. There is a big difference. I personally do not think homosexuality falls outside the topic. I think Singapore must emphasis more on equality, being a multiracial society and all. But when looked in depth, it is easy to find that there are other fractions in society that needs a voice because they have been oppressed. Understand this, in a democracy, there is AWAYS going to be someone that is going to get hurt. The majoriy will always win the minority. However, I am not saying that communism is the way to go, all I am saying is that we should find the weak spots in democracy and solve those problems; such as helping the disabled, equality for women and homosexuals, stuff like that.<br><br>In one of your posts,You also wondering why people are attacking your statement. What you said is just plain offensive, rude, discriminative, and unacceptable (to me)<br><blockquote> <strong><br>Homosexual is abnormal.For most  ppl,heterosexual is natural inclination.</strong> </blockquote>you just made a statement without providing facts. What is so abnormal about homosexuality and what is so natural about heterosexuality? Haven't you been reading what we discussed about socialization etc. Let me ask you what made you heterosexual? When did you become straight? come on enlighten me.<br><br>But I think this is a great topic, fear can only be defeated through knowledge.  Hopefully this topic will help others talk about their fears. Discussing homosexuality as a topic could enlighten narrow minded individuals. But when you judge others based on self rightous beliefs, don't be shocked when people to put you down.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation"></div>

I don't see people saying be gay or else...<br><br>I think we are here, or at least I am here to state that gay or not, no one should be discriminated against and thought of as abnormal, freaks, or even deviants. In this world where eveyone is different, diversity must move beyond tolarance. Accepting difference is the goal I think. But equally important is dealing with intolarant hate mongers<br><br>First off, does what people do in their bedrooms affect you in anyway? Do you really care who does who? Seems a little voyeristic to me.<br><br>Are you also a representative for those gay bashers and hate starters? Why I am saying this is because you seem to have taken the 'other' side. Are you feeling overwhelmed by all the posts that are against you, that you are calling for representatives?<br><br>In another post it was stated that it is law that homosexuality is wrong. Please remember that laws are made up by people, they are not natural and some laws are made through discriminative ideologies so there is a need to debunk these ideologies. If laws stated that women were only objects of men's desire and satisfaction, where they were not allowed to vote or have a say, what would you do?<br><br>if there are 6 against 1 and you think you are not winning, maybe it is time to reevaluate your reasoning. Maybe majority of heterosexuals do not care about what goes on behind closed doors and just want to live in peace and harmony with all people, gay or straight. So you don't believe that homosexuality is natural, so do I, neither is heterosexuality, that is alright. but lets get to the juicy part. What do you think of gay marriages or changing the laws so that homosexuals will get equal status as heterosexuals?<br><br>Stop giving one line answers, show some facts and some reasoning skills, put what you have learnt in school to the test.<br><br>If you want to understand more about nature vs nurture, go read the posts in the topic "what does SG need".</div>
