              <p>For centuries, both Israelis and the Muslim tribes were in conflict
              without end. God has even intervened on both sides sometimes helping
              the Israelis but other times the Muslim to triumph in those wars.
              Conclusion : No side is supreme so those who practise love, compassion,
              righteousness, will finally triumph.<br><br>Let
              the people of Israel and Palestines come to know this plain fact. It is
              of no use fighting any more without taking care of their fundamentals
              of religion. Only when their religion takes over by making changes to
              recgonise the rights and love for men will both sides find acceptance
              of the other and eventual God's approval from heaven and peace. Human
              peace will not last. Heavenly peace based on recognition of such love,
              rights and faith in God will lead to final peace.<br><br>Let this message be sent to both sides the peace makers for their love, right and faith in God is the kingdom of god.<br><br>I
              pray for all Israelis and Muslim to subscribe to such heavenly peace so
              that they will attain their wish finally which they could not do for
              past centuries.<br><br>Amen.<br><br>Robert Yeh Kok Hua<br>(From Singapore - see www.managefranchise.blogspot.com)</p>

              <p>There was never a palestine before Israel. It was always part of someone's territory from the biblical time til now.</p>
              <p>1949 - the arabs were given a chance to set up a state of Palestine . They refused so it got divided up.</p>
              <p>If there is someone to be blamed , it is the arabs to be blamed - they screwed their own. The Jews just took back what they deemed rightfully theirs historically and in a biblical sense.</p>

              <p>Jihad assaults took many forms besides military, there are economic jihad, media jihad and also taking over university middle eastern depts whitewashing everything from dhimmitude to ethnic cleansing...if a rich sheik wants to donate hundreds of millions of dollars to your school, will you not change the curriculum?</p>

              <p>well, Catknight, I don't agree with you, but I respect your opinion.</p>
              <p>I don't see the Jihad threat as a grave danger, it is probably exaggerated for political reasons.</p>
              <p>I see USA aggression and their policy of global hegemony as the danger.</p>
              <p>In the days of the Soviet Union, USA was less aggressive as there was still the USSR to counter it.</p>
              <p>Now USSR is gone, USA and their NATO clique is getting arrogant and attacks countries left and right to impose their will on them.</p>
              <p>I see this as a danger.</p>

              <p>Actually you said -&gt; Muslim man are not suppose to "test drive" before buying mah...so
                                      god give them 4 chances to pick the right one.</p>
              <p>fymk is right. It is not about buying. The Prophet had many wives and amazingly the first wife Khadijah was 40 when she married the 25 years old Muhammed. IF we try to apply the test drive idea, the whole thing is preposterous.</p>
              <p>To add on to fymk's point, men are obliged to provide for their family, in addition to treating each of the wives fairly. Technically speaking, the wife needs not spend a single cent on the family and children, the husband will provide for them.</p>

              <p>Infidels understand why the Israelis need to return to their ancestral homeland. If divided and scattered all over the countries, their numbers will fall and will one day cease to exist.</p>

              <p>Fymk,</p>
              <p>This is a call for prayer for peace. The historical conflict between the Israelis and the Arabs has been deep-rooted in hatred for each other. Today, such hatred is no longer as relevant. It is futile to try to settle their problems politically now after many years of UN and international efforts have failed.</p>
              <p>Yet God whether he is a God of Israelis or the Arabs is advocating love, compassion and faith of god. In fact Ibraham or Abraham was the same apostle in both religion.  In other words both were originally half-brothers.</p>
              <p>There is no reason both cannot practise the common beliefs existing in both religions Judaism and Islam.</p>
              <p>Let there be common understanding of what their gods wanted them to achieve in this living world. If both sides can see they share the same common godly beliefs from the beginning there should be no reason they are fighting or should be fighting again and again.</p>
              <p>Their original causes of conflicts were all historical or water under the bridge. There has to be statesmenship to promote the old godly beliefs to both sides and to me only when they could share common heritage could they eventually find lasting peace.</p>
