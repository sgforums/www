              <p>.. as shown by the ongoing US presidential elections campaign.</p>
              <p>I just saw a video on youtube where they slammed obama for the smallest and most insignificant of reasons, sometimes discrimatory as well.</p>
              <p>1. Questioning the fact that his middle name was Hussein and that he spent 4 years in a muslim school and how making a mockery of it.</p>
              <p>2. Do you want a smoker as a president?, they asked.</p>
              <p>3. When obama and his wife gave each other a friendly knuckle to knuckle punch, FOX news questioned if it was a TERRORIST FIST. fucking absurd.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And if i'm not wrong, fox news was the one that reported the collapse of one of the buildings during 9/11 15 minutes BEFORE it actually happened. Basically FOX is just a lap dog for bush to use.</p>

              <p>.. as shown by the ongoing US presidential elections
              campaign.</p>
              <p>I just saw a video on youtube where they slammed obama for the
              smallest and most insignificant of reasons, sometimes discrimatory
              as well.</p>
              <p>1. Questioning the fact that his middle name was Hussein and
              that he spent 4 years in a muslim school and how making a mockery
              of it.</p>
              <p>2. Do you want a smoker as a president?, they asked.</p>
              <p>3. When obama and his wife gave each other a friendly knuckle to
              knuckle punch, FOX news questioned if it was a TERRORIST FIST.
              fucking absurd.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And if i'm not wrong, fox news was the one that reported the
              collapse of one of the buildings during 9/11 15 minutes BEFORE it
              actually happened. Basically FOX is just a lap dog for bush to
              use.</p>
