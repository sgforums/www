So by becoming ministers they became rich. Even assuming they stay back in the private sector it is only the exception that anyone of them will ever get such salaries as a million dollar unless they have become successful entrepreneurs like Sim Wong Hoo or Simon Cheong. Therefore it is not true that we the people have to pay million dollars to attract people like Goh Chok Tong, Wong Kang Seng, Jayakumar, or Lim Boon Heng to attract such persons to join politics. Why is MM Lee doing this then? It is very simple, he has to pay them high in order to control them or else he could not get their obedience to carry out all this wishes to serve his own narrow agenda.<br><br>Any salaries like $300,000.00 pa could easily attract many good and committed people. It is only when the top leaders are broad-minded and prepared to respect talents and independent of thought and teamwork that he can attract talent not salaries.<br><br>If the fact is all or nearly all the current ministers did not get any pays higher than $300,000.00 pa before they were invited to join politics there is no justification to pay ministers million dollars to attract them to do so.<br><br>It is all an issue of leadership quality of the PM or the supreme leader in charge not the amount of salaries which will attract true passionate people to take up the challenge of joining politics.<br><br>It is proven that MM Lee's assumption about the need to pay ministers more to attract them to join politics is unsubstantiated and totally baseless.</div>
