              <p>drawer, you hit the nail on the head,very well said indeed.</p>
              <p>They are slaves not only to money, they are also slaves to power, authority, exploitation, oppression, tyranny, self centredness, arrogance.  They are the taichi masters of singapore.</p>

              <p>But our Singapore is unique, when a PM step down, he is promoted to SM, and then later promoted to MM, and maybe later to SMM and later MMM...etc etc. They dun get out of the politics, their paid increased more and more...so in the end, we hv to pay all these old bags of PM, SM, MM, SMM, MMM etc etc etc..higher and higher..no wonder Gst go up, ERP increase, cost of living jump up...OMG, please lah LHL, dun retire lah, otherwise we hv to paid one more SM, one more MM, and one more SMM...</p>
