              <p><strong>JTC begins construction of Jurong Rock Cavern at Jurong Island</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Singapore, 8 February 2007:</strong><span> </span>Tunnelling work has begun at the construction site of Singapore’s first underground rock cavern for hydrocarbon storage – the Jurong Rock Cavern (JRC). JTC Corporation (JTC), which has been appointed by the Singapore Government to undertake the project, held a groundbreaking ceremony this morning to mark the commencement of this milestone project.<span>  </span>The event was graced by Mr Lim Hng Kiang, Minister for Trade and Industry.</p>
              <p>2<span>          </span>Located at Banyan LogisPark on Jurong Island, the multi-million dollar JRC project will be built at subterranean depths beneath the seabed of Banyan Basin.<span>  </span>Phase 1 of the JRC, with a storage capacity of approximately <span style="color: #ff0000;">1.47 million cubic metres</span>, will be used to store liquid hydrocarbons such as crude oil, condensate, naphtha and gasoil. <span> </span>JTC has engaged consultants to provide expert advice on the design and construction of the underground cavern.<span>  </span>JTC will also be inviting interested parties to submit proposals for operation of the facility.</p>
              <p>3<span>          </span>Storage of petrochemical products beneath the seabed through the JRC will further enhance safety and security on Jurong Island.<span>  </span>In addition, the underground storage facility will free up land for higher value manufacturing operations. <span> </span>The size and storage capacity of the JRC translates to a saving of approximately 60 hectares of surface land space.....</p>

              <p>I dont think petrol is colored under the pretext and in the situation of SG.</p>
              <p>It depends on the regulations. If the country taxes the crude oil coming in through the depots high , the cost to sell will be higher. SG is diregulated and so by that it means the oil companies can fight the prices among themselves.And using lowest price , biggest volume ratio. Or they can all co-op and set a standard price within themselves as to control the retail oil prices.</p>
              <p>If they all have the same prices , it will come down to whoever's brand is more visible , better customer services and lastly the technology they R &amp; D 'd in it.</p>

              <p>PENANG, Feb 25(2008) (Bernama) -- Malaysian Prime Minister Datuk Seri Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said today the Malaysia government allocated massive subsidies to offset the price of petrol in the market as it cares for and is concerned about the people.</p>
              <p>The Malaysian Prime Minister said the Malaysia government did not want the people to be too heavily burdened by the rise in petrol price.<br><br>The Malaysia government was spending RM43.4 billion currently to provide various subsidies to offset the petrol price increase and the allocation was actually much bigger than that for national development, he said.<br><br>"Despite having to bear the high cost, we do it because the Barisan Nasional (BN) government is public-spirited and is concerned about the welfare of the people," he said when launching a campaign organised by the Association of Malaysian Taxi/Limousine and Hire Car Drivers (Pertekma) at the grounds of Hotel Sunway, Seberang Jaya, here.<br><br>"If the price of petrol can be brought down, I'll be much happier but when we do this, it may affect other necessities," he said.<br><br>Abdullah said the government always looked for various ways to ensure that the people were not burdened by the rising cost of petrol and other goods, including providing free text books to school children, abolishing school and examination fees and reducing charges for treatment and healthcare at government hospitals.<br><br>In addition to reducing the burden borne by the people on expenses, the government also endeavoured to provide more job opportunities for them and to increase their income, he said.<br><br>Compared to the other countries, he said the prices of petrol, food items and health care in this country were much lower because of the subsidy element from the government.<br><br>"We ensure that these prices are under control, including adequate supply of food items and the burden is borne by the government. If the petrol price can be reduced, then all countries would want to do it.<br><br>"Of course we have Petronas, but it too has to spend hundreds of billion for overseas operations and if all the Petronas funds are to be spent, then it will be gone," he said.<br><br>At the function, Abdullah took the opportunity to clarify to the approximately 300 taxi drivers present the impact on the people if transportation cost were to increase.<br><br>"If transportation cost rises, the price of goods transported will go up, vehicle rental also rises and if the rental increases, the fare will also go up.<br><br>So, we have to control all these so that the people are not affected," he said.<br><br>The Malaysian Prime Minister hoped taxi drivers would help the government in explaining to the passengers on the issue of higher petrol prices and the efforts taken by the government to protect the people from the adverse effects.<br><br>-- BERNAMA</p>

              <p>Ms Samantha Wong, 44, was surprised when a police officer approached her and showed her a photocopied picture of a man and asked if she had seen him.</p>
              <p>'I was told he had escaped and that he was short and walked with a limp,' said Ms Wong, who lives in the area.</p>
              <p>She said she was shocked by the news, but did not recognise the man's face.</p>

              <p>Jemaah Islamiah (JI) detainee Mas Selamat Kastari, 45, escaped from the Whitley Road Detention Centre at 4.05pm yesterday and, at press time, was on the run.</p>

              <p>The police immediately mounted a massive manhunt in the area.</p>
              <p>It is understood that checks were also made at the Tuas and Woodlands immigration checkpoints.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>At the Tuas checkpoint around 6pm, student Tan Thiam Chye, 25, said all immigration clearance was stopped for about 15 minutes, causing a traffic build-up.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'Immigration officers were holding a picture of a man and they were passing it around,' said Mr Tan, who was on his way to Johor on a bus.</p>

              <p>Mas Selamat, who walks with a limp, is not known to be armed, the Ministry of Home Affairs said in a press release yesterday.</p>
              <p>He had led the Singapore JI network and was among five JI members detained here under the Internal Security Act in 2006.</p>
              <p>He had even plotted to hit Changi Airport with a hijacked plane.</p>
              <p>By 6pm, across the highway from the Whitley Detention Centre, just behind Catholic Junior College, police were moving into the quiet estate.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Gurkhas and armed officers withred berets, wearing bullet-proof vests, with kukris around their waists and holding revolvers, lined Malcolm Road, Mount Rosie Road, Mount Pleasant Road and Whitley Road.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There were also more than 20 police vehicles along those roads, including Special Operations Command vehicles, fast response saloon cars, Toyota Hi-Lux sport utility vehicles and blue buses.</p>
              <p>The New Paper also spotted police along the Pan-Island Expressway towards Onraet Road.</p>

              <p>Officers holding maps were seen instructing their teams to move into certain areas.</p>

              <p>They stopped several joggers between 6pm and 7pm to ask them if they had seen the fugitive.</p>

              <p>i admire how singapore attract the foreign investment and infrastructure buildup from the past to the present.</p>
              <p>i admire how the old PAP party put together their effort and planning to bring forth the fishing village to a world class city.</p>
              <p>i was from the 70s and seeing how singapore transformed slowly to a mfg hub to a high tech hub and to a major financial hub.</p>
              <p>however, the effort of building SG up is NOT within a person's effort as what Lee has claimed to be. it is a team effort, starting from the PAP party, down to the man and woman in the street.</p>
              <p>BUTTTT.. big BUTT... the old party member had either died or retired. the once relinquished freedom for the sake of nationhood progress has never been restored. the leader that once held in high esteem for his uncomprising leadership has turned selfish and deceitful. the new party members are getting enormously greedy and conceited. </p>
              <p>where is the pride of the nation from the yesteryears? i sorely miss the old gang of PAP; those that really served the country selflessly and passionately.</p>
              <p>what i hate is the current generation of PAP parties members and the Lees. what Lee used to be a leader that i admire in the past, he has changed over the years. and i no longer can stomach his constant domineering power over every single one of singaporean's future.</p>

              <p>i admire how singapore attract the foreign investment and infrastructure buildup from the past to the present.</p>
              <p>i admire how the old PAP party put together their effort and planning to bring forth the fishing village to a world class city.</p>
              <p>i was from the 70s and seeing how singapore transformed slowly to a mfg hub to a high tech hub and to a major financial hub.</p>
              <p>however, the effort of building SG up is NOT within a person's effort as what Lee has claimed to be. it is a team effort, starting from the PAP party, down to the man and woman in the street.</p>
              <p>BUTTTT.. big BUTT... the old party member had either died or retired. the once relinquished freedom for the sake of nationhood progress has never been restored. the leader that once held in high esteem for his uncomprising leadership has turned selfish and deceitful. the new party members are getting enormously greedy and conceited. </p>
              <p>where is the pride of the nation from the yesteryears? i sorely miss the old gang of PAP; those that really served the country selflessly and passionately.</p>
              <p>what i hate is the current generation of PAP parties members and the Lees. what Lee used to be a leader that i admire in the past, he has changed over the years. and i no longer can stomach his constant domineering power over every single one of singaporean's future.</p>

              <p>Yup..people get relatively high salary for a reason. It may be because the job is dangerous, may be because one brings in a lot of money for the company, may be because there is a lack of skilled talent etc. There are many of such jobs out there but many here and Gopalan Nair choose to believe that the bulk of Singaporeans are all cleaners, hawkers and part time waiters who struggle to make a living.</p>
