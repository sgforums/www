              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><em>Singapore Democrats<br><br></em><img src="http://www.yoursdp.org/images/stories/postersI/ideas1.jpg" border="0" alt="" width="220" align="left"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The
                  Singapore Democrats only know how to criticise the Government but are
                  not constructive in providing alternative ideas.</strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Like the other
                  misconceptions (see <a href="http://www.yoursdp.org/index.php/news/singapore/2207-misconception-no-1-sdp-not-interested-in-elections">here</a> and <a href="http://www.yoursdp.org/index.php/news/singapore/2272-misconception-no-2-sdp-working-through-qextra-legalq-means">here</a>), <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>this is one that the PAP and its supporters like to spread despite abundant evidence to the contrary.</strong></span><br><br>As early as 1994 the Democrats adopted<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> <em>Dare to Change: An Alternative Vision for Singapore</em> written by Dr Chee Soon Juan as its manifesto.</strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><br>The book unambiguously spells out
                  alternative ideas in the various policy areas including the economy,
                  politics, society, culture and the arts, education and the media. Not
                  only that, it also provides the rationale for these alternatives.<br><br>The ideas were subsequently expanded and refined in other publications such as <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Y<em>our Future, My Faith, Our Freedom: A Democratic Blueprint for Singapore</em>, the <em>SDP's Economic Report 2005</em>, and <em>First World For Whom?</em> They are further developed in Dr Chee's latest book <em>A Nation Cheated</em>.</strong></span> (See all the publications <a href="http://www.yoursdp.org/index.php/component/content/article/46-publications/255-publications">here</a>)<br><br><img src="http://www.yoursdp.org/images/stories/daretochange.JPG" border="0" alt="" width="120" align="right">Our flagship publication, <em>The New Democrat</em>, and pamphlets consistently highlight these alternative policies.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>This
                  website includes a section, Our Manifesto, that spells out the SDP's
                  position and counter-proposals on the various policy areas where we
                  disagree with the ruling party.</strong></span><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>During the Budget debate in
                  February this year, we came up with a 5-point counter-proposal to help
                  Singaporeans cope with the current economic crisis including suspending
                  the GST, giving out spending vouchers, restricting the use of the ERP,
                  etc. </strong></span>(See <a href="http://www.yoursdp.org/index.php/news/singapore/1845-budget-spending-not-transparent-sdp-proposes-alternative-5-point-plan-">here</a>)<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>All
                  these put to rest once and for all the untruth that the Singapore
                  Democrats are not constructive and do not offer alternative ideas.</strong></span><br><br>In
                  fact not only have we come up with alternatives, our proposals have
                  been echoed by other people including academics, commentators, and even
                  PAP MPs.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>But Singaporeans don't know much about this because the
                  state media will not publish our ideas.</strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">What's more, PAP and their
                  supporters <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>keep repeating the lie that the Democrats simply criticise
                  and don't offer constructive ideas.</strong></span><br><br>In the 2001 GE we campaigned
                  on a few of our ideas including the Singaporeans First Policy, minimum
                  wage, and retrenchment benefits. We repeated this in the 2006 elections.<br><br>But
                  the media refused to highlight and debate these ideas. Instead, all it
                  did was to focus on the actions the PAP took against us.<br><br>Such is
                  the tragedy of Singapore politics where constructive ideas from the
                  opposition are not highlighted and discussed.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The state media ensures
                  that no national debate takes place on such issues. As a result the
                  nation is the poorer for it.</strong></span><br><br>Censoring and not debating the
                  Singapore Democrats' alternative proposals is one thing.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">But to then
                  turn around and accuse us of not being constructive is simply dishonest.</p>

              <p>At least, the SDP has put Singaporeans first on their agenda.</p>
              <p>At least their ideas is spending money on Singaporeans - especially the under-class, and those in the lower Middle-Class that need help most.</p>
              <p>At least, the idea is to make Health Care more affordable to Singaporeans, education more relevant for our young to face a more creative global competition and not to be a mere economic digit for the MNC partnered by Government Linked Companies that create directorship positions for retired PAP Ministers and MPs.</p>
              <p>At least, the SDP have the idea to have money spent for Singaporean's security in the long term social, economic and political welfare.</p>
              <p>One thing is for certain - the SDP will surely review LKY's "<span style="font-weight: bold;">minimum Million Dollar wages</span>" for Ministers when there is ZERO minimum wages paid to Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>Another thing we can be certain is that the SDP will not spend US$100 BILLION to bail out foreign banks, and refuse to spend a single Singapore Cent to bail out Singaporeans who are out-of-job, or even to help the Singapore Under Class who has to beg the MP to help them prevent HDB from throwing them out of their homes, or the PUB from cutting the electrical and water supply. </p>

              <p>As the owner and manager of a Bar, we can understand your resistance to have a minimum wage for SINGAPOREAN worker.</p>
              <p>The PAP principle in meritocracy is a self-serving principle that is selectively exercised.</p>
              <p>If meritocracy is a measure, can the dictates of the market be exercised ?</p>
              <p>Both are in conflict with the other, as meritocracy demands the market to react according to its merit, while the market reacts to the supply and demand conditions.</p>
              <p>Is your position reflective of Singapore's situation ?</p>
              <p>Are wages in Singapore based on meritocracy, and free market conditions of supply and demand ?</p>
              <p>This is happening in Singapore, where Meritocracy demand that the MINIMUM wage for Ministers are placed at a minimum of S$1,000,000 while the wages of Singaporeans are dictated by the National Wage Council.</p>
              <p>The National Wage Council is supposed to be tripartite working between the Singapore Employers, Trade Union and the Singapore Government - and with the priority given to the Employers survivability to allow jobs to exist without too much regard as to the ability of Singaporean workers to survive.</p>
              <p>This is obvious when the Singapore Government implemented the self-serving policy of changing Singaporean Employment Contract to renewable short-term period - and with revised short termination notice.</p>
              <p>All these are done in total disregard to Singaporean's need for long term financial security and commitments in housing and raising of young families.</p>
              <p>The policy is self-serving as the Singapore Government is the largest employer of Singaporeans through its various Government Linked Corporations.</p>
              <p>Can the problem in Indonesia be comparable to Singapore ?</p>
              <p>The Indonesian population is almost 25 times larger then Singapore, its minimum wage still allow its Citizens to survive as the country is largely an agricultural country and not wholly dependent on industries.</p>
              <p>Its urban population is only a fraction of the entire Indonesian population, and the total number that demand wage increases in better times are insignificant, and their demands for wage increases during the better times are justified as it is common for Cost of Living to go up during such times.</p>
              <p>Surely, you will raise the price of your drinks to cover the increase in rental demanded by your landlord during the good times ?</p>
              <p>Everyone ask of increases during the good times, and it is a matter for the Indonesian Government to communicate with the Indonesian masses during the good and bad times.</p>
              <p>Can you deny the Minimum Wage Policy to allow Singaporeans to survive ?</p>
              <p>Even in the USA, the US government is looking into<a rel="nofollow" href="http://my.barackobama.com/page/community/post/sumi/gGCgtT"><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></a><a rel="nofollow" href="http://my.barackobama.com/page/community/post/sumi/gGCgtT">‘Obama’s plan to increase minimum wage of US Workers’.  </a></p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://my.barackobama.com/page/community/post/sumi/gGCgtT"></a>This is not mere political rhetoric, but a purposeful action plan to reduce Government expenditure by raising the minimum wages of US workers so as to raise the Standard of Living of those who are perpetually dependent on Social Welfare Support.</p>
              <p>Is Obama alone in this review ?</p>
              <p>Since 2007, the same was done in Germany, France and UK, and reviews are constantly made to maintain living standards.</p>
              <p>Did LKY not make a claim that Singapore is a First World Country ?</p>
              <p>Why are the majority of Singaporeans still drawing Third World wages ?</p>

              <p>Both are in conflict with the other, as meritocracy demands the market to react according to its merit, while the market reacts to the supply and demand conditions.</p>
              <p>Is your position reflective of Singapore's situation ?</p>
              <p>Are wages in Singapore based on meritocracy, and free market conditions of supply and demand ?</p>
              <p>This is happening in Singapore, where Meritocracy demand that the MINIMUM wage for Ministers are placed at a minimum of S$1,000,000 while the wages of Singaporeans are dictated by the National Wage Council.</p>
              <p>The National Wage Council is supposed to be tripartite working between the Singapore Employers, Trade Union and the Singapore Government - and with the priority given to the Employers survivability to allow jobs to exist without too much regard as to the ability of Singaporean workers to survive.</p>
              <p>This is obvious when the Singapore Government implemented the self-serving policy of changing Singaporean Employment Contract to renewable short-term period - and with revised short termination notice.</p>
              <p>All these are done in total disregard to Singaporean's need for long term financial security and commitments in housing and raising of young families.</p>
              <p>The policy is self-serving as the Singapore Government is the largest employer of Singaporeans through its various Government Linked Corporations.</p>
              <p>Can the problem in Indonesia be comparable to Singapore ?</p>
              <p>The Indonesian population is almost 25 times larger then Singapore, its minimum wage still allow its Citizens to survive as the country is largely an agricultural country and not wholly dependent on industries.</p>
              <p>Its urban population is only a fraction of the entire Indonesian population, and the total number that demand wage increases in better times are insignificant, and their demands for wage increases during the better times are justified as it is common for Cost of Living to go up during such times.</p>
              <p>Surely, you will raise the price of your drinks to cover the increase in rental demanded by your landlord during the good times ?</p>
              <p>Everyone ask of increases during the good times, and it is a matter for the Indonesian Government to communicate with the Indonesian masses during the good and bad times.</p>
              <p>Can you deny the Minimum Wage Policy to allow Singaporeans to survive ?</p>
              <p>Even in the USA, the US government is looking into<a rel="nofollow" href="http://my.barackobama.com/page/community/post/sumi/gGCgtT"><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></a><a rel="nofollow" href="http://my.barackobama.com/page/community/post/sumi/gGCgtT">‘Obama’s plan to increase minimum wage of US Workers’.  </a></p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://my.barackobama.com/page/community/post/sumi/gGCgtT"></a>This is not mere political rhetoric, but a purposeful action plan to reduce Government expenditure by raising the minimum wages of US workers so as to raise the Standard of Living of those who are perpetually dependent on Social Welfare Support.</p>
              <p>Is Obama alone in this review ?</p>
              <p>Since 2007, the same was done in Germany, France and UK, and reviews are constantly made to maintain living standards.</p>
              <p>Did LKY not make a claim that Singapore is a First World Country ?</p>
              <p>Why are the majority of Singaporeans still drawing Third World wages ?</p>

              <p>If LKY said that we are in the first world, so be it, there are many first world countries around the world with beggars on the street and homeless old folks too. I guess the world also recognised us as in the 1st world, why not, we should be proud to be after 50 years of national building. As opposition, they should be proud that they are  the 1st world opposition.</p>

              <p>If you are not the real employer, what do you know about managing workers wages during good or bad times ?</p>
              <p>Do you not know that during bad times, the MINIMUM wages can also be similarly adjusted DOWNWARDS - and most workers are happy to take a lower pay then to be with NO PAY and JOBLESS ?</p>
              <p>However, minimum wages are required during the good times, as much as it is needed during the bad times for Singaporeans - and the National Wage Council has to be guided by such minimum wage guidelines.</p>
              <p>Did retrenchment help to sustain your operation, or does it mean that with every Singaporean worker that you lose - you will be allowed to employ one or two less foreign worker that is determined by the ratio imposed by the Manpower Ministry ?</p>

              <p>Japan, Switzerland, Israel and other similar countries with no resources do not have to institute the kinds of policy that the PAP led Singapore Government has decided to follow at the expense of our Singaporean Citizens.</p>
              <p>These countries have jealously protected their borders from the free and easy entry of foreigners to take up work and residence at the expense of their own nationals - and this is done even when they are just as much locked into the Global Economic Grid.</p>

              <p>Minimum wage can be minimum hourly wage.</p>
              <p>So depends on the worker working how many hours.</p>

              <p><br>on behalf of longinchjohn,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The govt is now giving up to 90 percent of payrolls to employers who sent their employees to training under the SPUR program. And most of the courses are free. Many company are sending their employees for course during these down time, and when economy pick up, they still get back their without the need to recruit new ones which make admin messy. And more over, their staffs are now better trained and equipped to higher the productivity for them. It is a win win situation. Why go unpaid leave?? You may not come back and take the unpaid leave forever.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For those workers and staffs who are retrenched is mostly due to closure of a dept or operation of certain division, in another words, they become redundant, whether company send them to SPUR or not is no more viable. These group of people can individually go for SPUR and get $6/hr training and if you are a Professional executive you get $10/hr training. So what are they waiting for, take the free course, get paid, and they will job match for you. And all these are for Singaporeans only, not for PR or S pass or Permit holders. Now, where in the world do you find such structured way of getting our fellow singaporeans trained and be ready, where in the world, the govt paid you to go for training??</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Yes, of course it is up to the boss, the boss can said that the mini wage for my organisation is $1000, another may be $700 and so on. But the most important is the legal aspect, the nation must not set the mini wage bill, it will only give the bosses an upper hand in lowering their mini wage policy, so instead of giving $1000, now the mini wage is set at $500, i can give you $500, and I am not wrong?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hey, i told you thousand and one times, longinchjohn is my brother, he is no more here, and if you keep insisting that I am longinchjohn so be it, i cannot do much but to date you out to prove to you. But is seem that you never want to be dated. Anyway, i got nothing to loose.</p>

To gauge it, you have look at our economy thru out the last 50 years. You have to put you hand in your heart and ask yourself, are we better off than our surrounding countries??</p></div>

              <p>Is it as straight forward as it has been made out to be by the resident Bar "Manager" in this Speaker's Corner ?</p>
              <p>The following is taken from selected details of the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mof.gov.sg/budget_2009/speech_pc/pc.html">Budget 2009 – ‘Re-skilling: SPUR for workers and professionals’. </a></p>
              <p>In this 2009 economic downturn, the Singapore Government has shown signs of desperation not shown in the previous downturns of 1987, 1997 and 2002 - and the "Aid Programs" offered has never been given before.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal;"> </span></p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 0.8em; text-align: justify;"><span class="header2" style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 0.9em; font-weight: bold; text-transform: uppercase;">(C) JOBS FOR SINGAPOREANS</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">C.1. We will introduce a Jobs Credit scheme to help employers to keep their workers. We will also strengthen our subsidies for training and provide additional support for lower-income workers who face a reduction in pay during the downturn. Finally, the Government will also expand recruitment across ministries and statutory boards, for all levels of employees, and including mid-career professionals.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">C.4.	But wages are only part of the total cost of doing business. We expect businesses to find every way to cut unnecessary costs in their operations, improve efficiency so as to reduce overheads without having to retrench workers. As NTUC Secretary-General Lim Swee Say has urged, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">businesses should cut costs to save jobs, not cut jobs to save costs</span></span>.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">C.5.	The Government will however, provide a significant incentive for companies to retain existing workers, and where their business warrants, to employ new ones. <span style="color: #ff0000;">The Jobs Credit will provide every employer with a cash grant to reduce their costs of employing</span> Singaporean workers during the crisis.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Jobs Credit will have broadest impact</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">C.6.	The Jobs Credit that <span style="color: #ff0000;">an employer receives will comprise <span style="text-decoration: underline;">12% of the first $2,500</span></span> of the wages <span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">of each employee who is on the CPF payrol</span></span>l. It will be <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">given in four quarterly payments</span></span>, with each payment being based on the workers who are with the employer at the time. This will therefore provide incentive for employers to retain their local workers. For example, for a worker whose wage is $2,500, an employer will get $900 a quarter, or $300 a month.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Re-skilling: SPUR for workers and professionals</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">C.12.	The second component of our Jobs programme is to help Singaporeans upgrade their skills so that they can stay employed or seek re-employment. This is the reason why the Government launched the Skills Programme for Upgrading and Resilience (SPUR) last December which provided higher course fee support for companies and individuals and absentee payrolls for companies that send their workers for training.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">C.15.	We will make two more enhancements to SPUR to help PMETs re-train. <span style="color: #ff0000;">SPUR currently provides course fee subsidies of 80% for PMET-level courses</span>. <span style="color: #ff0000;">We will be <span style="text-decoration: underline;">increasing the subsidy rate for PMET courses that are eligible for SPUR to 90%</span></span>, the same subsidy level as rank-and-file level courses. This includes all Specialist and Advanced Diplomas offered by our polytechnics.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">C.16.	Further, WDA will bring under SPUR, selected tertiary courses at UniSIM and our three publicly funded universities.</span></p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 0.8em; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 16px;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">C.22.	The Government will also be expanding recruitment.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">C.23.	In all, we expect a total of 18,000 public sector jobs to be made available over the next two years<sup>4</sup>. (This includes government-supported jobs outside of the Government in areas such as childcare, tertiary education, and restructured hospitals.)</span></p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 0.8em; text-align: justify;"> </p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 0.8em; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 11px;"><sup>4</sup> This includes close to 7,500 in teaching positions and teaching support staff for our schools and tertiary institutions, 4,500 healthcare professionals and administrative staff for our hospitals and 1,400 for our Home Team and over 2,000 for MINDEF, which has been announced earlier by the respective ministries. In addition, the rest of the public service have plans to recruit an additional 2,600 jobs over the next 2 years. These jobs comprise policy, operational and administrative positions in various government agencies, as well as positions in more specialised areas such as Project Management, IT, Accounting and Urban Planning.</span></p>

              <p><br>companies greedy, workers also greedy, govt also greedy, this is not uncommon, since the begining of humankind, greed is there before even before love come into the picture.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When one set up a business, she thinks of the profit, the greed of making more, it is thru greed that make her pushing to set up a company, not wrong. And with a company, peoples come to work, govt started to tax, suppliers start to sell and customers start to negotiate/bargain. No profitable Companies is doing charity, they are not charity companies. The struggler of all these groups makes the economy and thereby the world goes round.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As a boss, if I cannot slash the govt tax, the supplier price index and increase the price of my goods, the only thing left is labour cost.</p>
