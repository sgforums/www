PAS gets pissed, extremists gets out of hand, umno looks like the crook it really is, uncle sam gets pissed, thailand gets pissed, sg gets pissed and i'm not even going to try to speculate on the potential impact its going to have on the other ethnic groups in malaysia...<br><br>sounds like a lose-lose situation to me. well, they just might be myopic enough to try something like this, but it just doesn't seem like its a centralised decision... possibly the schemes of some well-placed upstart faction who's got nothing to lose by altering the status quo.<br><br>seasoned politicians comfortable in their cushy chairs would not likely want to try something like this... unless uncle mat wants to leave with a final blaze of glory  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  THAT i think possible...</div>
