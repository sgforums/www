OR SAF could be giving malaysia a subtle warning that IF MAF tries to sabotage singapore economy through covert means... SAF will and can obliterate malaysia... in retaliation.<br><br>why i think so?.... well for a start... there are only 30 to 40 members in JI so far... most in menial jobs with low pay... even if they contribute 10 percent of their salary to the JI... it still doesnt amount to much at all.... yet they have the finances to buy up to 7 tons of ammonium nitrate and send group members all the way to afgan to train....  PLUS they have to give up to 25 percent of funding to support malaysia JI and 25 percent of their funds to indonesia JI.... how could 30 or 40 JI members come up with so much money ??? they seems a bit TOO rich!! i think the ISD should concentrate on this money trail... it could prove enlightenning....<br><br>Dont know if i read the subtle message clearly though... but i think without a doubt... that the annoucement thus far by singapore officials seems to hint or at least, its an indirect warning to malaysia not to use covert means to undermine singapore... as the consequence could be severe.... for malaysia.<br><br>Afterall... had the bomb went off.. and if singapore choose to conviniently place the blame on malaysia as the JI intended (real or not is irrelevant) and starts rushing north... i think malaysia will regret it too late....<br><br>In short... if singapore is destablised..... MALAYSIA would be obliterated.... so ... its in malaysia's interest to curb its tendency to nose into singapore buissness on pretext of defending singapore malays..... IF singapore malays desire malaysian protection... they would be better protected as malaysian in malaysia rather than live in 'hostile' territory....as non-malaysian...<br><br>As such... malaysia should keep its finger to itself... before we chop it off for them.....</div>

Q... where is the money from??? local donations?? kind of an oddity here...<br><br>as for obliterating malaysia... i think that is a foregone conclusion if war breaks out.... they dont call war destructive for nothing...</div>
