The foreigners who became Singaporeans will realize that we are too small a place to defend or seek refuge so they would definitely run away back to where they came. The rich people would also run and ministers and their children may run too because some of them have bought overseas properties for themselves and their children as a contingent home in case any disasters strike.<br><br>It will only be the original Singaporean citizens born and bred here who would stay and fight to defend against any external aggressions.<br><br>But then think again, the Singaporeans are being sacrificed by the government over the years to foreign in the name of globalization so many of them have become quite demoralized and they may change their loyalty over time too and refuse to stay on and fight. They may run up north to Malaysia or down south to Batam.<br><br>That is why citizens have been telling the ministers not to be too short-sighted in promoting everything foreign. Do so only carefully where their presence and their specific talents are needed by us to feed our growth.<br></div></blockquote>i doubt the ministers will leave Singapore, i think this is only a perception we had on them, they are working hard for the development of Singapore and somemore we here are critising their hard works.<br><br>We need to stand united together to face all the dificulties and obstacles in front of us, each of us has a role to play, so if we are really being call upon.

While talking about building an inclusive society all the policies seem to be implemented to benefit only or mostly the rich e.g. all the developments are taking place mostly around the rich men's areas allowing them to put up their properties for enbloc sales while such will not be allowed for HDB blocks.<br><br>Look at the policy to encourage employers to employ more foreigners. It is now so common to see fellow citizens being sidelined by employers just because they are now able to take the easy way out to get all the foreigners they want to increase their profits while social problems are lurking to explode on their faces due to unhappiness caused to the locals who remain unemployed.<br><br>How to ask the citizens to stay loyal if ministers keep implementing this kind of self-centred government which only allow them to boast about their superficial success.<br><br>Remember citizens do not say that foreign talents are no good in putting up their views on such an issue. It is autocracy - forceful and one-tracked over-implementation of good policy to the opposite extreme as seen happening always with many policies in the past - which causes problems and this is the real bad.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>China has stated time and time again that it's new doctrine is based on actively denying American troops their logisitical support and channels of movement should there be a conflict over Taiwan or the Spratleys and the Americans intervene.<br><br>WestPacLog is HQ-ed in Singapore. Our Armed Forces, though small, may remotely be the only force that can make a ripple in the South China Sea in conjunction with any ASEAN military.<br><br>The worst case scenario, assuming a rogue PRC administration, in a cross-straits conflict, pushing south to attempt to deny the USN her materiel and staging bases, could be a confrontation along the South China Sea around the Vietnamese coast area.<br><br>My two cents worth. Do check out the recent purchases by our neighbours, especially equipment related to long range surveillance and endurance+range of their new naval or airforce equipment. There is a trend slowly appearing.</div>

If they make enough here they would also want to buy properties in other countries in case of war. If they don't make enough here they would kao pe kao bu the pap, but they will lan lan report back to camp when they kena recalled, because they got nowhere to run. So don't need long stories, c o c k and bull to justify your intention to run.<br><br>The question remains, will YOU, as Singaporean, fight for Singapore, the country? not pap, not the rich, not for the immigrants. We, who stay back to fight and if we win the war, will know how to handle those who ran away, the pap ministers (if there are), the rich (there must be), the immigrants (who will just have to move on), the local born and bred (poorest of them all)......but woe is to those who could only run up north to JB and those who run south to batam. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br></div>
