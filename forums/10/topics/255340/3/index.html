            <div class='col-md body'>Geopolitical landscape in SE Asia changing fast if we do not stretch our neck to see whose who? and what is coming; will be caught by surprise.  Previously countries appear to be friends could easily become foe.<br><br>The 2nd Cold War is probably happening right under our nose. So I suggest taking a closer look at Burma and its nuclear ambition n its china naval base, China rearming and its nationalistic behavior, Taiwan moving towards independent, Sprately oil resources for potential flashpoint. The outcome of Middle east may affect our relationship with our neighbors.<br><br>Anytime if there are conflicts in any of these countries Singapore sea lane will get affected all its takes is inbound n outbound freight cargo shipped get boarded for inspection by conflicting nations. RSN will have to conduct escort for both East and West lane.<br><br>PRC do not view Singapore as ethnically Chinese Chinese, but view us as oversea chinese that speak mandarin with fundamentally western. Which maybe a concern for PLA if they do take Taiwan by force, As singapore is 80% oversea chinese city states may become a legitimate voice among the western states. Depending if LKY is around or not.<br><br>So I would not be surprise if PLA intimidation towards Singapore to butt out.<br><br></div>
