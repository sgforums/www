I think that is a very shallow and narrow way of viewing patriotism. </strong><br><br>We can see this in the example of Force 136 and the 1st Malayan Regiment. One fled. One stayed.<br><br>Both are heroes deserving our respect.<br><br>So in the scenario of Singapore facing her first war, do you presume those who run away are cowards?[/b]</blockquote>  For Force 136 and the 1st Malayan Regiment, whether they fled or they stay, they maintain their course. They save their lives for better use, but for the same course. Lim Bo Seng left and return to Malaysia, to fight the same enemy, he didn't run for his own safety, to come back only when there is peace in Malaya and Singapore.<br><br>The "fleeing" intended by soul_rage is clear, they are deserting, there is no intention to come back and fight, singapore is just a piece of land.<br><br>Glad you know some history, sad you do not learn the right lessons.<br><br>So in the scenario of Singapore facing her first war, if you leave Singapore, to solicit international support for Singapore, support of any kind, political, PR or financial, source for war materials, help settle young children and women who manage to escape before the war started, and when there is a need, you are prepared to come back, then you are definitely not a coward, you are worthy of high respect, not only as a patriotic citizen, but a gentleman with noble character and profound moral integrity.<br><br>(This applies to all countries, Sun Yet Sen left China many times when China was in turmoil, but he didn't leave just to stay alive.)<br><br>If you leave Singapore, with whatever you can salvage, to another country, to avoid the war. And will come back if Singapore win the war, or stay and apply for foreign citizenship under "refugee", I can understand and accept this if you are over 50s, or physically handicapped, retarded,.....Mindef don't want you, your neighbour don't need you.<br><br>but if you are a young able man, trained and liable for reservists, regardless whether you are a clerk or commando, in SAF, or Civil Defence, or even just consider yourself useful to help in your community or neighborhood as volunteers, but you pack and go with whatever you have and in whatever way you can, ignoring all recalls through the media, surely you don't expect us to believe you are just going on a vacation. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>The definition of Coward is "a person who lacks courage, esp. one who is shamefully unable to control fear and so shrinks from  danger or trouble." Wouldn't you think this is the right definition to describe those who run away with tails in between their legs?   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> Do I presume they are cowards? no, I don't presume, I say they are.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br></div>

Our govt values money and wealth and people whom are able to generate millions for the country.<br><br>I give you an analogy. I was once in an organization, where the people were like a family, and everyone was willing to sacrifice his time or work OT, over weekends to ensure that the organization was prospering.<br><br>Then... retrenchment came, and the retrenchment was made when the company was reporting excellent profits still.<br><br>And what happened to the 'family'? It was all gone, coz from that point onwards, the staff all know that the company doesn't care for them, and there is no worth in sacrificing their own time for the company to help the company to prosper. To the company, its those whom make millions for them (ie those at the top, whom are also those who proposed the cut in workforce to increase their profits), that they value.<br><br>Naturally, everyone started taking the individualistic stance. If you do not plan for yourself, and ensure your life is lived well, don't expect anyone to help you. If you don't plan escape routes on your own, don't expect anyone to help you when an emergency occurs. You will just die in the situation and no one cares.<br><br>Probably, just shed a few crocodile tears *shrugs*</div>

In reality, friendship and love does not always prevail. There are many cases that are the opposite... the wife leaves the husband after a failed business, friends disappearing in times of needs...<br><br>For me i believe in reaping what you sow... if you do not tend to the needs of the seedling and make sure they grow well, one shouldnt expect good fruits to bear.<br><br>I see that putting arts,music and sports beneath economic growth,as sowing the seeds of lack of national identity/loyalty.

In reality, friendship and love does not always prevail. There are many cases that are the opposite... the wife leaves the husband after a failed business, friends disappearing in times of needs...<br><br>For me i believe in reaping what you sow... if you do not tend to the needs of the seedling and make sure they grow well, one shouldnt expect good fruits to bear.<br><br>I see that putting arts,music and sports beneath economic growth,as sowing the seeds of lack of national identity/loyalty. And of course having it easy for foreigners doesnt help at all. We need to look after our own citizens and nurture local talents rather than taking the easy solutions of importing them.<br><br>Advocating loyalty with moral arguments in Singapore is like using moral arguments to persuade people not to commit crime in a jobless, corrupted police environment. As much as we like to believe moral arguments can persuade people not to commit crimes, its easier to change the people's "moral" by creating the jobs and a more efficient police force. If govt continues to sows such seeds, i hope they wont be too surprised when the fruits come out.<br></div></blockquote>I fully agree with everything you say here, wholeheartedly. But i believe should a war starts, especially one that threatens the very existance of singapore and the life of its citizens, e.g. country up north turns religious fanatic. That will not be the time when Singaporeans could bargain among ourselves, or when some holding the others ransom.<br><br>When singapore loses a war like this, we would not be replacing the old with a better government, every singaporean lose. But not everybody can run! my friend, many of us cannot run. If situation got worse, we need orderly evacuation. Under such circumstance, those run affects badly those who have to stay and fight.<br><br>If the war is similar to a military coup, with political fight among, then I would also be running, like Francis Seow, Tang Liang Hong (hahaha, just joking, I don't contribute like they did).<br><br>Nobody hope for a war, it is a strong and united armed forces that prevents a war. If it comes a day when a corrupt government starts a war to divert the attention of its citizens from domestic trouble, that would call for discussion here under a different scenario, and my position would change. I may not run, but I may not fight.<br></div>
