Nobody go to war wanting to die. Of course you are unlucky if you were killed, but you are probably luckier than those who lose their legs and arms. It takes courage to face all such risks, not to die.<br><br>I have no problem with people who want to migrate for a better life, they migrate so that their children don't have to learn chinese, don't have to tahan the pressure here, don't have to serve NS, don't like PAP...... But uproot yourself to start a new life somewhere during peace time, give up your citizenship, bring all the people who care for you with you, so that nobody will miss you here.<br><br>But doing that when war is imminent and if you have the responsibility to stay and fight, then you are running away from your responsibility as a citizen to help fellow singaporeans, your neighbours would have one man less to help in case the building is on fire, your platoon would have one man short whom yr commander might not find replacement in an emergency, your section mates would have to start building rapport with somebody new....you break the law, you betray the trust of your friends, neighbors and army  comrades. They need you, probably only and especially during emergency, but you run away, at the critical moment. It is your wish, no doubt, but it is also right to describe such people as coward. Of course, if you never had such relationship with people around you, then when you leave nobody would miss you.

Nobody go to war wanting to die. Of course you are unlucky if you were killed, but you are probably luckier than those who lose their legs and arms. It takes courage to face all such risks, not to die.<br><br>I have no problem with people who want to migrate for a better life, they migrate so that their children don't have to learn chinese, don't have to tahan the pressure here, don't have to serve NS, don't like PAP...... But uproot yourself to start a new life somewhere during peace time, give up your citizenship, bring all the people who care for you with you, so that nobody will miss you here.<br><br>But doing that when war is imminent and if you have the responsibility to stay and fight, then you are running away from your responsibility as a citizen to help fellow singaporeans, your neighbours would have one man less to help in case the building is on fire, your platoon would have one man short whom yr commander might not find replacement in an emergency, your section mates would have to start building rapport with somebody new....you break the law, you betray the trust of your friends, neighbors and army  comrades. They need you, probably only and especially during emergency, but you run away, at the critical moment. It is your wish, no doubt, but it is also right to describe such people as coward. Of course, if you never had such relationship with people around you, then when you leave nobody would miss you. It is rather sad, isn't it? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>There are plenty of islands on this planet, big and small, but only here do I have my friends, my neighbours, my classmates, my golf partners, my coffee kake.....most, if not all of them would be around in Singapore, war or peace, run by pap or wp, at least in my generation.</div></blockquote>well its up to you. You still do not have the right to call others cowards.<br><br>In another perspective, a man with a family may instead be the braver person to run to ensure his family doesn't get sacrificed in the war, and be labelled as a coward. He may run coz his wife loves him so much that she is prepared to kill herself if he dies.<br><br>It is your right to stay and fight. With your patriotic spirit, yes sure, I salute you. But there are many different aspects of life, and not everyone sees it in the same perspective as you. I also don't see patriotism as EQUALS to stay and fight. I think that is a very shallow and narrow way of viewing patriotism.<br></div>
