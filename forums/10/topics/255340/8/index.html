If the fighting is on a ridge-line, it will be hard to flank.<br><br>There are only so many ways to vary the firefight. If you don't want to smoke and flank, then everyone will basically fire and movement to the objective.<br><br>In a real war, I suppose a good M203 or LAW gunner can neutralise the enemy without all the smoke and flanking. But during exercise, nobody believes if your grenade or LAW can tiok the enemy or not; the umpires just want the trenches to be cleared. I am not sure if the new MILES can register a hit though.<br><br>It is like CT training isn't it? When enemy contacted, two rounds to the head. Do you consider their training mechanical?</div>

First the soldiers must have courage. When facing a threat, most human, would rise up and fight with courage in them, but some would just shrink and give up. I think courage is in a person, you can't train a coward. if you kenna soldiers who wet their pants before seeing an enemy, they can only be a real burden to the rest of the platoon.<br><br>According to Chinese, there are 36 plans to handle the complexity of a war or battle situation, but "zou wei shang ji" is the last, and is done only after care appreciation and evaluation of the situation. The 'zou' here means 'che' (withdrawal, or retreat), it does not mean 'pao' (run away). To those who are afraid, the first thing that comes into their mind is 'run', SOP will never be effective, unless, it is part of SOP to teach them how to run.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>To an average person with the courage and motivation to fight, any training or SOP will help, but to those who have no guts but only look for reasons to run, no amount of training will do any good. To them, situation awareness means when to run, communication means to hope that people believe their reasons to run, and collaboration? no, I safe first then talk about others. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
