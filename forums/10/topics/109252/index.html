The issue is people are trying to be more politically correct by mentioning more religiously neutral sayings such as happy holidays.  Happy holidays works for anyone's religion no matter what it may be.<br><br>The 1st amendment of the US constitution states:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.</span><br><br>So basically in the US, public areas (funded by tax dollars) cannot have a religious bias.  There have been many cases where the ACLU has filed lawsuits against cities who display the 10 Commandments on public property.  And the cities have lost every one of these lawsuits.</div>
