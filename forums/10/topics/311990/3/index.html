              <p>I am sure the current ruling party is able to manage Singapore successfully with the advice, help of the scholars, etc. Are all the policies thought out by the ministers themselves?</p>
              <p>The ministers themselves don't deal with the day to day work, they only set the general direction of the country.</p>
              <p>According your logic, no opposition party in the world can ever be able to prove that they are more capable than the ruling party since they never have a chance to run the country. So why the presidential election in America? Has Hillary Clinton or Obama run a country before?</p>
              <p>Why are you so sure the opposition can't rule Singapore better? A good leader need not know everything, he just need to be able to use the right people.</p>

              <p>The current ruling party is able to use the GRC election model to "smuggle blood" to the parliment. Therefore, these people have more chance to expose themselve and prove their ability to the rest of the Singaporean.</p>

              <p>Oh realy? SO indepedence is SOOO damn important that people's standard of living does not matter at all? Look at all the former british colonies in africa, is independence good for them?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Can you say that indepedence for those colonies is a better thing?</p>
              <p>And moreover, don't forget what did the british government FAILED to do for singapore, it is singaporeans who started industrialization programs, singaporeans who build the HDB flats to solve the hosing issues in singapore, not the british.</p>
              <p>In my opinion, the PAP do a better job of managing singapore's economy than the british.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So you are saying that opposition DON'T need to manage singapore better than the PAP?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hey, I'm all for supporting the idea that the opposition needs to have a voice strong enough to challenge the PAP. But don't expect to vote the opposition into ruling singapore for the sake of simply giving the opposition a chance.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>They need to prove that they can propose ideas that PAP ignore, that it can be better for singapore in general like economics.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>How do the PAP prove to singaporeans that they can manage singapore better than the british? They propose the plans they are going to carry out.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In the past elections, I've yet to see any opposition party that really talks about managing singapore in general, and not just the GRC. The opposition needs to be daring enough to challenge the PAP DIRECTLY for the power and control of the government.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In my opinion, the current opposition parties isn't any better than the PAP. I want to see opposition parties that can really talk about new ideas that improve the ecnomic sistuation of singaporeans, from the lower class income people all the way to the higher class income people like the bussinessman and etc.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> I want to hear about how singapore can resolve the upcoming energy crisis, like using what kind of energy source to replace fossil fuels, and natural gas.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Perhaps nuclear power for example?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The opposition don't DARE to voice their ideas because they are scared that their ideas will be taken up by the PAP. And when the PAP adopted thier ideas, they never voice out to the general public that it is THEIR ideas in the first place.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When their ideas used by the PAP works, they can used that as proof that the ideas are feasible, and defend their ideas.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I've yet to see a opposition party that actually have courage to challenge the PAP directly over their own ideas.  </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There is a difference between having a stronger opposition and having the opposition party be the ruling party.</p>

              solve the hosing issues in singapore, not the british.</p>
              <p>In my opinion, the PAP do a better job of managing singapore's
              economy than the british.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So you are saying that opposition DON'T need to manage singapore
              better than the PAP?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hey, I'm all for supporting the idea that the opposition needs
              to have a voice strong enough to challenge the PAP. But don't
              expect to vote the opposition into ruling singapore for the sake of
              simply giving the opposition a chance.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>They need to prove that they can propose ideas that PAP ignore,
              that it can be better for singapore in general like economics.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>How do the PAP prove to singaporeans that they can manage
              singapore better than the british? They propose the plans they are
              going to carry out.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In the past elections, I've yet to see any opposition party that
              really talks about managing singapore in general, and not just the
              GRC. The opposition needs to be daring enough to challenge the PAP
              DIRECTLY for the power and control of the government.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In my opinion, the current opposition parties isn't any better
              than the PAP. I want to see opposition parties that can really talk
              about new ideas that improve the ecnomic sistuation of
              singaporeans, from the lower class income people all the way to the
              higher class income people like the bussinessman and etc.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> I want to hear about how singapore can resolve the
              upcoming energy crisis, like using what kind of energy source to
              replace fossil fuels, and natural gas.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Perhaps nuclear power for example?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The opposition don't DARE to voice their ideas because they are
              scared that their ideas will be taken up by the PAP. And when the
              PAP adopted thier ideas, they never voice out to the general public
              that it is THEIR ideas in the first place.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When their ideas used by the PAP works, they can used that
              as proof that the ideas are feasible, and defend their ideas.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I've yet to see a opposition party that actually have
              courage to challenge the PAP directly over their own ideas.
               </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There is a difference between having a stronger opposition and
              having the opposition party be the ruling party.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>1. Firstly, look at southeast asia as a whole. Countries who have 'fairer' elections. Just because the opposition is given the chance to govern their own country does not mean the countries is in a better shape. Take a look at taiwan as well, the opposition has went into power, yet their economy isn't doing better than it was under the KMT. And the reason the KMT was reelected was due the poor economic performance of the DDP.</p>
              <p>I've known many phliphinos that is pissed at their countries politics, and seek to go to US and etc once they get the chance to do so..so what the use of electing a opposition into power if they cannot do better than the current party?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And the main reason why a opposition party should be elected into power is because the current ruling party performance is weak, NOT because it is too powerful, or simply granting a chance to the opposition. It's to ensure that the weak ruling party can be removed and looks at it's mistake.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We are LUCKY that the PAP mindset isn't about hoarding all the money into the minsters pocket, and their mindset is that they themselves can be even richer if singapore is rich. The failure of most of southeast asia so call 'democracy' should be a key indicator.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The very basic principles of democracy is not to elect people into power. The primary purpose of democracy is governance. To govern the nation FIRST, and give a chance for the general public to make decision SECOND.</p>
              <p>And democracy exisit to ensure that good governance takes place, not the other way around.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The PAP runs in election in the first place because they want to RUNS the country better than the british. Why should we expect any less than from the opposition as well?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>They need to understand that they NEED to run the country better than the PAP, as compared to showing others we are a so called 'true democracy'. As I have said before, democracy is another system of <strong>governance </strong>first, granting power to the mass second. <strong> </strong></p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p>And in a democracy, we cannot expect the majority to make the RIGHT decision. Look at US and their Iraq war for example, when the minority is right instead. Electing a good government ISN'T anything that can be taken for granted. Hence, it is better to elect a opposition party when the ruling party <strong>FAILS</strong> to manage the country well as compared to giving power to the opposition when the ruling party is running the country rather well.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Even the 'shinning beacon' of democracy, the United states of America has cases where a elected presidents tries to secure power through improper means in the watergate scandal.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. How to find out when can the opposition runs a country well? Simple, when the elected government FAILS to acheive the stability, economical growth, and meets the expected needs of people's <span style="color: #cc3232;"> </span><span style="color: #000000;">livelihood. That is the signal for us to elect a opposition into power, and see what OTHER ideas can work, ideas that is different from the ruling party. </span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3. <span style="color: #cc3232;"> From what I could remeber, basic information like this should be availabe for students to research in libaries and internet as well. </span><span style="color: #000000;">And with peak oil going on, we HAVE to move on from fossil fuel as a energy source. We don't need to follow US energy policy you know. </span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>All they need to point out is that oil WILL be used up sooner or later, and actions to change to other energy source should be done quickly. That is one advantage the opposition can used.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But some opposition are so pro-west that they starts to absorb the BAD aspect of the west. Policy that is of more harm to us than good. The west isn't without faults like some people is thinking.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4. This is a hard one, but in my opinion, perhaps the opposition party should call for a televised public debate? With the internet, the average joe will get to know that the opposition challengede the PAP to a debate as compared to the past where people only have access to traditional media.</p>
              <p>But at the same time, the goal of the opposition MUST be in the interest of singapore as compared to gaining power for their own polticial party.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you think that those ideas must be keep to the oppositon party because they don't want the PAP to implement it, are they in the interest of singaporeans?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You do know what the more  democratic government in other country is trying to achieve? Cross-party ideas that can be agreed on together in the common interest of singapore. Even IF the opposition is not in power, they must understand they are STILL representing singaporeans.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ideas should not be keep to themselves because PAP can use it, if they are REALLY concerned about everyone instead of their own party, they DON'T NEED to be afriad to tell it and letting the PAP use it. Because it will in the interest of singaporeans.</p>

              <p>4. This is a hard one, but in my opinion, perhaps the opposition party should call for a televised public debate? With the internet, the average joe will get to know that the opposition challengede the PAP to a debate as compared to the past where people only have access to traditional media.</p>
              <p>But at the same time, the goal of the opposition MUST be in the interest of singapore as compared to gaining power for their own polticial party.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you think that those ideas must be keep to the oppositon party because they don't want the PAP to implement it, are they in the interest of singaporeans?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You do know what the more  democratic government in other country is trying to achieve? Cross-party ideas that can be agreed on together in the common interest of singapore. Even IF the opposition is not in power, they must understand they are STILL representing singaporeans.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ideas should not be keep to themselves because PAP can use it, if they are REALLY concerned about everyone instead of their own party, they DON'T NEED to be afriad to tell it and letting the PAP use it. Because it will in the interest of singaporeans.</p>

              <p><strong>1. Firstly, look at southeast asia as a whole. Countries who have 'fairer' elections. Just because the opposition is given the chance to govern their own country does not mean the countries is in a better shape. Take a look at taiwan as well, the opposition has went into power, yet their economy isn't doing better than it was under the KMT. And the reason the KMT was reelected was due the poor economic performance of the DDP.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>I've known many phliphinos that is pissed at their countries politics, and seek to go to US and etc once they get the chance to do so..so what the use of electing a opposition into power if they cannot do better than the current party?</strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Fair elections and failed democracies ? Have you seen some relationship between the two ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Why will you only look at the South-east Asian countries that have failed democracies ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Did you not look beyond South-east Asian shores ? Have you not seen successful democracies such as South Korea, Japan, India, and Australia with their successful economies ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Are you not skewed in using the economic failures of Taiwan as a fallout of the Taiwanese experiment in democratic practices ? </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Did you not consider that throughout the two Presidential terms of Chen Shui-bian, he was more interested in pushing ex-President Liu Teng-Hui's agenda of an independent Taiwan more then economic progress for Taiwan ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">After having experienced decades of economic mismangement under Marcos dictatorial rule, the Filipinos are jealously guarding and preserving their new found democracy, and have unfortunately picked on the US political system as their model - which require a mature society to support such a political system. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Can we blame the Philippine economic morass onto a Democratic System that is operated by politicians more interested in the personal benefits from political office than managing the country ?</span></p>
              <p><strong>And the main reason why a opposition party should be elected into power is because the current ruling party performance is weak, NOT because it is too powerful, or simply granting a chance to the opposition. It's to ensure that the weak ruling party can be removed and looks at it's mistake.</strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Can there be any Political U-Turn when a single Political Party become too strong for any other Alternative Political Party to take over its place ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If Thailand did not have an existing democratic system - that was won from the blood shed by the student uprising in the 1980s - the Military would have continued to govern Thailand after the overthrow of ex-Premier Thaksin.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Zimbabwe is a political basket case to study, where a strong man will ruin the country, and will manipulate the political system for his continued political existence - and while Singapore may not be a basket case for now, parallels come close in the manner that has seen the dismantling of the entire institutions of checks and balances.</span></p>
              <p><strong>We are LUCKY that the PAP mindset isn't about hoarding all the money into the minsters pocket, and their mindset is that they themselves can be even richer if singapore is rich. The failure of most of southeast asia so call 'democracy' should be a key indicator.</strong></p>
              <p><strong> </strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Are you certain of what you are writing in your opening statement in this paragraph ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Are Singaporeans richer since Election 2006 that saw PM LHL supposedly ''taking full control'' of politics in Singapore, or have we seen the shrinkage of the size of the Middle Income Group - with many Singaporeans seeing a drop in the Standard of Living after making sacrifices to cope with the ever increasing Cost of Living ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Is it not characteristic of this Government to be hoarding all the money that sees the Ministers and the PAP members holding Political Offices enriching themselves with million dollar wages that are legitimately taken through unopposed changes to Parliamentary legislations ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Singaporean workers have seen meagre wage increment that did not even pass the 4 per cent level, and yet we will see Ministerial wages taking a 30 per cent jump even when their wages already exceed the top ranking pay of Presidents and Prime Ministers of First World countries.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">With the CPI in 2007 hitting a high of almost 5 per cent and more as the Year 2007 ended, has the 4 per cent wage increases amounted to anything ?</span></p>

              <p><strong>The very basic principles of democracy is not to elect people into power. The primary purpose of democracy is governance. To govern the nation FIRST, and give a chance for the general public to make decision SECOND.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>And democracy exisit to ensure that good governance takes place, not the other way around.</strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Democracy exist to ensure good governance, and can only exist due to the fact that the GENERAL PUBLIC has the opportunity to exercise their POLITICAL RIGHTS.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Democracy can only exist when there is an institutionalised check and balance to ensure that there is no abuse of power assigned to those elected into Public Political Office.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The very basic Principle of Democracy IS TO ELECT people into Political Office and entrusted with the POWERS that come with the Political Appointment. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">How did you come to your version of the Principles of Democracy ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Yes, at least you manage to get it right that the Primary Purpose of Democracy is governance - which I assume you mean to be 'GOOD Governance' and nothing else ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Can such 'Good Governance' exist when democratic institutions of 'checks and balancing' are systematically dismantled for the sheer convenience of questionable ''effective governance'' ?</span></p>
              <p><strong>The PAP runs in election in the first place because they want to RUNS the country better than the british. Why should we expect any less than from the opposition as well?</strong></p>
              <p><strong> </strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Are Singaporeans expecting anything less from the Alternative Parties than what is expected from the PAP ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Surely, Singaporeans are expecting even higher standards of Democratic Governance from the Alternative Political Parties, after experiencing forty odd years of the PAP autocratic governance ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">You got to try harder to sound seriously convincing if you beleive that ''the PAP runs in election in the first place because they want to RUNS the country better than the British''.</span></p>
              <p><strong>They need to understand that they NEED to run the country better than the PAP, as compared to showing others we are a so called 'true democracy'. As I have said before, democracy is another system of governance first, granting power to the mass second.</strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">What is in the name of any Political System - whether democracy or communism or otherwise ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Even the Communist Party of China has awakened to the idea that the village commune will also need to allow the villagers to exercise their Political Rights to participate in the Political System of choosing someone to govern their village.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Even the Chinese Communist Party has realised that good governance can only come about when there exist some checks and balance to their system, or there will be rampant corruption that will damage the reputation and legitimacy of the Communist Party to govern China.</span></p>
              <p><strong>And in a democracy, we cannot expect the majority to make the RIGHT decision. Look at US and their Iraq war for example, when the minority is right instead. Electing a good government ISN'T anything that can be taken for granted. Hence, it is better to elect a opposition party when the ruling party FAILS to manage the country well as compared to giving power to the opposition when the ruling party is running the country rather well.</strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Are you suggesting that the minority is right about the US going into Iraq ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">It seems that you have read recent history in a very odd peculiar way if you believe that the 'minority is right' and that the US is with the majority in going to war in Iraq ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Did you not realise that more then two third of the World Community was opposed to the US going to war to overthrow Saddam Hussein in the second Iraq War ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">LKY had said that Singapore cannot climb back up to where we are today, if ever Singapore should collapse for whatever reasons. Will you wait until the Ruling Party FAIL to produce the goods before preparing an Alternative Political Party to takeover the reins of Government ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">In the British Parliamentary system, and in the US Political System - the Alternative Political Parties are given as much information of Government to be effective in their role of checking on Government policies.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Unfortunately, in Singapore, the Ruling Political Party placed a 'SECRET' stamp on all government publications and policy documents that prevent any loyal Singaporean in the Alternative Political Party to perform the task of ''check and balance''.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Can the Alternative Political Party be in any state of preparedness to takeover when the cards have collapsed ?</span></p>
              <p><strong>Even the 'shinning beacon' of democracy, the United states of America has cases where a elected presidents tries to secure power through improper means in the watergate scandal.</strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Will you throw the wooden bucket due to one small splinter on its side that happen to prick you ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If you want to eat fish, be prepared for the bones, will you condemn the entire fish simply because of your own carelessness in choking on the bone ?</span></p>
              <p><strong>2. How to find out when can the opposition runs a country well? Simple, when the elected government FAILS to acheive the stability, economical growth, and meets the expected needs of people's  <span style="color: #000000;">livelihood. That is the signal for us to elect a opposition into power, and see what OTHER ideas can work, ideas that is different from the ruling party.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Given the standard of your thought process that is displayed in this thread, are you able to discern good from bad if the ideas are presented by the Alternative Political Parties ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">With the deliberate moves by the Ruling Political Party to starve the Alternative Political Parties from receiving any financial, moral, intellectual and administrative support - can the Alternative Political Parties be in any position to step into the shoes of Government in the same manner that the Labor or Conservative Parties in UK takeover from each other ?</span></p>
              <p><strong>3. <span style="color: #cc3232;"> From what I could remeber, basic information like this should be availabe for students to research in libaries and internet as well.</span> <span style="color: #000000;">And with peak oil going on, we HAVE to move on from fossil fuel as a energy source. We don't need to follow US energy policy you know.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong>All they need to point out is that oil WILL be used up sooner or later, and actions to change to other energy source should be done quickly. That is one advantage the opposition can used.</strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Are the Alternative Political Parties in Singapore following US energy policies, or is it the Ruling Political Party that is a loyal supporter of the US policies - energy or political or military ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Can the existing political system in Singapore support any Alternative Political Parties to put up any paper that will influence a Political System that is totally dominated by the Ruling Political Party, and shut out the system to all other political parties ?</span></p>
              <p><strong>But some opposition are so pro-west that they starts to absorb the BAD aspect of the west. Policy that is of more harm to us than good. The west isn't without faults like some people is thinking.</strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">East or West - which system has ever claimed themselves to be perfect ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">It is the self-serving propaganda spouted by the Ruling Party that claims at different times the GOOD and BAD of both system to suit their 'Flavor of the Month'.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">China's Deng Xiao Peng had once said that ''Black or White Cat, both are just as good as long as it catches the mouse'' - can you appreciate the wisdom in such a simple statement ?</span></p>
              <p><strong>4. This is a hard one, but in my opinion, perhaps the opposition party should call for a televised public debate? With the internet, the average joe will get to know that the opposition challengede the PAP to a debate as compared to the past where people only have access to traditional media.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>But at the same time, the goal of the opposition MUST be in the interest of singapore as compared to gaining power for their own polticial party.</strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Tell this to the Ruling Political Party - that the goal ''MUST be in the interest of Singapore as compared to gaining power for their own political party''.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Singapore's Ruling Political Party has never wanted Singaporeans to listen to the other side of the debate, and has avoided public debate that will give the Alternative Political Parties any higher public profile then the limited avenues available.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Public debate has always been held behind closed door, carefully managed with pre-vetted audience, and the entire show meticulously planned and cheographed to the last detail.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">This is the Singapore way of debate - even at the level of the National Parliament</span></p>
              <p><strong>If you think that those ideas must be keep to the oppositon party because they don't want the PAP to implement it, are they in the interest of singaporeans?</strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">It is not the Alternative Political Parties are not prepared to share their ideas with the Ruling Political Party in Government, but it is the Ruling Political Party that refuse to accept anyone's ideas as being more superior to them - as it will shoot their reputation full of holes, when unpaid politicians from the Alternative Political Parties can produce better ideas than the over-paid Ministers and their fellow Politicians holding political appointments.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Have you read some of the ideas from Chee Soon Juan in his publications in the early 1990's ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Those ideas were implemented ten years later - after Year 2000 - and with changes made but never acknowledged.</span></p>
              <p><strong>You do know what the more  democratic government in other country is trying to achieve? Cross-party ideas that can be agreed on together in the common interest of singapore. Even IF the opposition is not in power, they must understand they are STILL representing singaporeans.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Ideas should not be keep to themselves because PAP can use it, if they are REALLY concerned about everyone instead of their own party, they DON'T NEED to be afriad to tell it and letting the PAP use it. Because it will in the interest of singaporeans.</strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Tell this to the Ruling Political Party - enough has been said and repeated since the 1960s - by politicians and from concerned Citizens.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The PAP believe themselves to be the only legitimate Representative of Singapore and Singaporeans, and all others - who dare to challenge their position - are charlatans to this exclusive role that can only be monopolised by them alone.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Can any idea from any Singaporeans be more superior than that coming from the minds of the over paid politicians from the Ruling Political Party ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Can any good idea come from any other Singaporeans when the idea is driven home that talent is limited in Singapore ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">According to the POWER of ONE, talent can only exist when cultivated and cloned through the political process of the Ruling Political Party - under the watchful eyes of the POWER of ONE.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">What is being sought is a cloned idea from a clone - not from talented Singaporeans, who can think out of the box.</span></p>

              <p>I am sure the current ruling party is able to manage Singapore successfully with the advice, help of the scholars, etc. Are all the policies thought out by the ministers themselves?</p>
              <p>The ministers themselves don't deal with the day to day work, they only set the general direction of the country.</p>
              <p>According your logic, no opposition party in the world can ever be able to prove that they are more capable than the ruling party since they never have a chance to run the country. So why the presidential election in America? Has Hillary Clinton or Obama run a country before?</p>
              <p>Why are you so sure the opposition can't rule Singapore better? A good leader need not know everything, he just need to be able to use the right people.</p>

              <p><br>With so much "support" from the gov, I consider Potong Pasir as quite well run. Otherwise, why did the resident there continue to vote for Mr Chiam See Tong despite being "marked" by the gov?</p>

              <p><br>What does the property prices at Potong Pasir matter to you ?</p>
              <p>It is served by an MRT station along the North-East Line, despite the poor illogical excuse given by the Transport Ministry - that reflect the petty mentality of the MIW Government - in the excuse given that it is uneconomical to open the MRT Station even after it has been built.</p>
              <p>Ironically, WP Low Thia Kiang's Hougang Constituency has its property prices comparable - if not higher - than some Constituencies run by the Ruling Political Party.</p>
              <p>Do you really believe that property prices in Singapore are affected by the Political Party that is managing it ?</p>
              <p>Being a long time resident in the UK, do you believe there is any difference in the property prices in the Constituencies with a Conservative MP when the Labor is in Government, and vice-versa ?</p>
              <p>If you wish to lampoon the alternative parties, at least have some depth in your knowledge of local politics.</p>

              <p>With hypocritical Singaporeans boastfully claiming proudly to be noisy for the Singapore Lion - do we need any Alternative Parties to make Singapore a failure ?</p>
              <p>With or without the PAP, Singapore and Singaporeans will continue to thrive and be a World Class country as Singapore had been before LKY and his PAP even existed during the Colonial days.</p>
              <p>Hong Kong do not have any personality such as LKY and his 1957 Team, nor an interfering autocratic Political Party as the PAP - yet Hong Kong is comparable and even supercede Singapore in its economic, social, judicial, cultural and political standards.</p>
              <p>Do we need more of the PAP style of politics and political interference in the daily life of Singapore and Singaporeans ?</p>

              <p>OPPOSITION or PROPOSITION is only a matter of relativity.</p>

              <p>To me it does not matter as long as the leader is TRANSPARENT and HONEST to the people and not just on paper but true honesty.</p>
