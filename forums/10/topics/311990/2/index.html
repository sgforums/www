I mean seriously, if that is any argument at all, just paint the entire opposition as Chee Soon Juan and tear their credibility to shreds, I believe people look at their bank accounts and their HDB flats and think twice about voting anything but the People's Action  Party. So to the question, if one day the opposition comes to power, trust me they've mathematicians and statisticians running the formulas again and again, and that together with the people's incessiant need for security, the opposition (Yes! think Chee and Co.) would find it very hard to even take a single GRC, much less form the government. Another thing, Singapore is no Malaysia, two very different situations. Because in Malaysia, voting for the Barisan National doesn't actually bring any benefits, you just see more crime, more scandals, more corruption. So since things are as screwed up as they are already, voting opposition actually means change. It's a different equation in Singapore, at least in the minds of the masses.</p></div>

              what i mean is instead of forming an opposition party to contest with the pap hedgemony, which it has effectively used the its position as the government to aid itself somewhat, the people should be more proactive and do things on their own to move the foundations of the rules established. <br><br>
              you see people like mrbrown, giving a satrical jab to the non-answers the government sometimes gives to the people. there are many others, giving a sensible critique at the government's actions. <br><br>
              the only problem is that these are all done online. so to progress, the people must be able to talk and react to the nonsense given to us in the real world... other than a good ol' protest, I'm sure there are other ways to loosen the 1party system.

              <p>Only if a political party can prove itself that it can LEAD better than a PAP.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Less on ideas, focus more on how to do stuff BETTER than the PAP. That is what alot of opposition party lacks. The ability to show that they can do a BETTER job in improving the economy. They need to grab more talents than the PAP. Convince those talents to join the opposition party.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Because the opposition has been so focused on opposing the PAP, they did not mention how they can manage singapore, not just a GRC better than the PAP.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Oppose for the sake of telling the PAP that it is not invincible, that it is POSSIBLE for the opposition to do a much better job in controlling singapore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Let singaporeans KNOW the benefit of letting the opposition run the government.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The oppsition in singapore is more or less same as DDP in taiwan, ideas before people's bread and butter issue.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You cannot manage a country with ideas alone, and most pro-opposition singaporeans did not think why did the PAP keep winning the elections, it isn't because singaporeans are dumb, it is because they did not tell singaporeans WHY they can MANAGE singapore better.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You need a opposition with ideas AND the ability to manage the country before we can talk about a strong opposition.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Another reason is because the opposition keep letting the PAP gain all the credit for the more liberal and workable policies.</p>
              <p>What is the use of a opposition if the PAP can keep on using more open-mindset as well?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The PAP is hardly a conservative faction in singapore politics, in fact, PAP is more liberal as compared to most republican in the USA.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The opposition cannot use idealism to win the public confidence. They need to provide more concrete evidence to the public that they can do a better job in bread and butter issue as well.</p>

              <p>Only if a political party can prove itself that it can LEAD better than a PAP.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Less on ideas, focus more on how to do stuff BETTER than the PAP. That is what alot of opposition party lacks. The ability to show that they can do a BETTER job in improving the economy. They need to grab more talents than the PAP. Convince those talents to join the opposition party.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Because the opposition has been so focused on opposing the PAP, they did not mention how they can manage singapore, not just a GRC better than the PAP.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Oppose for the sake of telling the PAP that it is not invincible, that it is POSSIBLE for the opposition to do a much better job in controlling singapore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Let singaporeans KNOW the benefit of letting the opposition run the government.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The oppsition in singapore is more or less same as DDP in taiwan, ideas before people's bread and butter issue.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You cannot manage a country with ideas alone, and most pro-opposition singaporeans did not think why did the PAP keep winning the elections, it isn't because singaporeans are dumb, it is because they did not tell singaporeans WHY they can MANAGE singapore better.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You need a opposition with ideas AND the ability to manage the country before we can talk about a strong opposition.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Another reason is because the opposition keep letting the PAP gain all the credit for the more liberal and workable policies.</p>
              <p>What is the use of a opposition if the PAP can keep on using more open-mindset as well?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The PAP is hardly a conservative faction in singapore politics, in fact, PAP is more liberal as compared to most republican in the USA.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The opposition cannot use idealism to win the public confidence. They need to provide more concrete evidence to the public that they can do a better job in bread and butter issue as well.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We do not NEED to be a second taiwan, where the opposition slow the taiwanese economic growth. We don't need a opposition government for idealism. We need a opposition that can manage singapore BETTER than the PAP.</p>
