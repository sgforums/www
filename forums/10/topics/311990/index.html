              <p>Hi all,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Been posting at SBF but seems that they have a tracking system once you lock in. My recently purchased Internet protection software warned me about the link to talkcity.com where there is potential for spyware to be downloaded. Nuff said!!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3 points:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>No.1 Opposition winning 2/3 Majority in Parliament</p>
              <p>Is it so bad if the oppositon is to run S'pore? We all have been so badly brainwashed by the ruling party that we cannot tell right from wrong. Can the opposition do more worse than Shin Corp? UBS losing almost $6Billion of our money!!! Mas selamat Escape?? Rising costs of living?? C'mon enough is enough!!!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>No.2:State controlled Mediacorp</p>
              <p>I believe the media has somehow now been instructed by the authorities to follow closely the states run by the opposition in Malaysia. Any issues/problems that arises will have to be given maximum coverage so to "frighten" the S'pore population so that if they vote for the opposition in the next GE, similar scenarios will happen in Singapore. A snap-shot way of being re-elected to power. In fact the opposition swing in the M'sian GE could very well be a blessing in disguise for the PAP.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>No.3: Million dollar Mini-Star WKS</p>
              <p>Will he follow the road of Samy Vellu? In fact a lot of Netizens were asking Samy to resign prior to GE but he ignored them. However, the people kept it in their hearts and showed him during the GE once and for all of what they think of him. It is happening now to WKS, only that the GE is not here yet. What do you all think?    </p>

              <p>in the past i thot Opposition means to break things.</p>
              <p>having seen Malaysia and TW (the most vibrant democracy in asia), I am convinced the word does not matter.</p>
              <p>Oppositon today, Ruling tomorrow. We have proves.</p>
              <p>Its not just about scholars. Its also about how real they want to serve the people and not for money alone.</p>
              <p>Crave for Money may not have any end.</p>
              <p>Sometimes, its not just win or lose.</p>
              <p>Sometimes, its simply about BALANCE.</p>
              <p>With Balance, if there exist Complacency, that party will surely suffer a defeat in time to come.</p>
              <p>Reason : Democracy.  If only you understand. </p>

              <p>a smaller party can become big in shortest time when many talents join them.</p>
              <p>Its like companies.</p>
              <p>Example: for some reason many of the best talents of a company who is the market leader quits and forms a new company, the market leader suddenly does not have the brains to run itself. it simply collapse and get overtaken by the actual brains who ran the show in the old market leader, now relegated to second place by a new young but full of brains company.</p>
              <p>impossible is nothing.  just my 2 cents (without gst and inflation and price hikes!)</p>
              <p>above, what i said is purely to enlighten some people, who may be living in the dark, to let them understand some logic. to stay neutral I say that i am on the side of the incumbent.</p>

              <p>that's the impression i get as well. i think LKY studied MZD a lot and tampered a lot of the thoughts and political administration strategy MZD implemented to the running of singapore.</p>
              <p>i can draw parallel to for instance, PAP running numerous campaigns to get a particular message across. MZD in his lifetime, perpetuated a few great campaign movements to get his message across, overthrow dissents or those opposing him. think great leap forward, hundred flowers campaign, the cultural revolution amongst others.  </p>
              <p>The other is the obsession to absolute power and order. in china, opposition in not tolerated nor exist; and in singapore, opposition in not tolerated but it cannot cease to exist by constitution rights, hence one get a steriled type of opposition here.  </p>
