            <div class='col-md body'>I'm not really interested in political affairs.<br><br>But one issue that has caught my attention concerning the new bridge's proposed plan is that this would create a major disadvantage to a border defense concern.<br><br>Assuming that the Malaysian side does goes thru with its completion of the 'hooked' shaped bridge, the under portion of the bridge within the Malaysian territorial will allow for any Police or Naval craft from their side to freely navigate to and fro across the Strait.<br><br>By contrast, with the Singapore side being hampered by the current remainants, SG patrol crafts will be unable to move as freely as compared to the Malaysian counterpart.<br><br>This is a rather serious issue concerning strategic defense doctrines, and should be looked into and investigated with deeper concern.</div>

I think we don't want to involve Singapore in this," the Prime Minister said at a Press conference after witnessing the signing of the memorandum of understanding between the Public Works Department (representing the Government) and Gerbang Perdana Sdn Bhd for the construction of the project.<br><br>The project, involving the building of a new Customs, Immigration and Quarantine (CIQ) complex and an elevated 31.5-kilometre bridge, is scheduled to be completed by Dec 31, 2005.<br><br>He had been asked if Malaysia was still open to Singapore's participation in the project.<br><br>Dr Mahathir said Kuala Lumpur had initially proposed the idea to the republic, but had failed to receive a favourable response.<br><br>"We are forced to build a crooked bridge. It was supposed to be a straight one replacing the Causeway, but since our proposal had failed to receive a favourable response from the other side, and since the Causeway is nostalgic and maybe we could only start the project in 2007, we have to go on with it on our own. We saw it heading in the same direction as the water dispute," Dr Mahathir said.<br><br>He said that rather than a protracted discussion which may not yield anything positive, the Government had chosen to go ahead with the project by redesigning the bridge.<br><br>"So we have to build a crooked bridge. That's our fate. We can't get co-operation from the people, so we have to accept. This is how we solve problems." During the ground-breaking ceremony of the project in Johor Baru on Feb 14, Dr Mahathir had revealed that the proposal to replace the Causeway had been shot down by Singapore Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew.<br><br>He had stated that Lee had reasoned that Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong had nostalgic attachment to the Causeway and that any plan to remove the link could only be carried out when Goh leaves office in 2007.<br><br>"It is not that we are not co-operative. Actually, I had spoken to (Singapore Senior Minister) Lee Kuan Yew at our private meeting when he came to see me and he seemed very pleased with the idea.<br><br>"I gave him the map, plan and the design of the proposed elevated bridge. But later he wrote to me and mentioned again during his meeting with me that even though he was keen to have the elevated bridge constructed, (Prime Minister) Goh Chok Tong was opposed to the idea because the Causeway was nostalgic to him.<br><br>"This was in a meeting between us. Normally, I don't reveal such meetings... no one knows until today but I have to tell the truth today because even my letters have been published. So I'll have to set the record straight so that people don't blame us for not co-operating with Singapore.<br><br>"Initially, I was happy (based on Lee's initial response), thinking that we could co-operate and build the bridge, but according to Lee, his Prime Minister was nostalgic about the Causeway. So he suggested that we should start the project after Goh leaves office," Dr Mahathir had stated.<br><br>Gerbang Perdana is 60 per cent owned by Merong Mahawangsa Sdn Bhd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ibex Corp Amalgamated, 20 per cent owned by Diversified Resources Bhd and 20 per cent owned by Transwater Corp Bhd's Detik Nagasari Sdn Bhd.<br><br>Dr Mahathir, who is also Finance Minister, said that by partly removing the Causeway, water would be able to flow freely in the Straits of Johor, contributing towards the improvement of marine life and the environment in general.<br><br><span style="color: red;"><strong>He said that boats or vessels less than 25 metres in height could also ply the straits, thus enabling the movement of cargo between the ports of Pasir Gudang and Port of Tanjung Pelepas (PTP) . </strong></span><br><br>"Now it's closed (the straits). We only have two tiny culverts underneath but they are not serving a purpose. With the removal of the Causeway, water will then flow through and boats not above 25m height can cross from east to west and vice versa. It will also facilitate, probably, the movement of some cargo from Pasir Gudang to PTP if it's worthwhile to do so," he said.<br><br>On the water issue, he said Kuala Lumpur would refer the case for arbitration instead of engaging in further talks or negotiations with Singapore.<br><br>The Prime Minister said Malaysia could not afford to be bogged by the delay in resolving the dispute.<br><br>"We go forward. I think the period of talking and negotiating is now over. We want to have arbitration. According to the provisions of the agreement, if there is a dispute that cannot be settled then we go for arbitration," he said in response to questions on the deadlocked water pricing dispute.<br><br>He said that while Malaysia would continue supplying Singapore with water as stipulated in the two agreements signed with the Singapore City Council in 1961 and 1962, the pricing of the commodity would have to be reviewed accordingly.<br><br>To a question, Dr Mahathir said that the Federal Government's intention to take over the management of water resources from State Governments had no bearing on the water agreement with Singapore.<br><br>He reiterated that Kuala Lumpur would continue to supply Singaporeans with water.<br><br>"We have promised and we will honour our word," he said.<br><br>Dr Mahathir also touched on the need for contractors to provide professional and quality service, and not opt for quick profit by selling their projects.<br><br>He warned that although he might not be the Prime Minister during the scheduled completion of the project in 2005, he would still turn up to inspect the "bridge".<br><br>"We don't want to be forced to pay the sub-contractors directly by the Government. We hope that the principal contractors will manage the money that they get properly and, of course, since PWD has now advertised itself as a very efficient and upto-date organisation, I hope not a single sen will be lost and, right on the dot, I expect to cross this bridge... if I'm still alive then. I'll be more than 80 at that time, so I may need a tongkat (walking stick).<br><br>"I'll be there with my tongkat, if I can't use the tongkat to help me walk (on the bridge), I'll use the tongkat on the people who built the bridge," he said in jest.<br><br>On the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) rate for the year, he said 4.5 per cent was achievable as the second quarter growth figure was expected to be better than expected earlier.<br><br>"I think second quarter should be good, should be better than what we expect. A 4.5 per cent (GDP growth) is achievable unless you have got some other diseases or war. These are unpredictable things. If everything else remain as they are, we should achieve 4.5 per cent GDP growth," the Prime Minister said.<br><br>Dr Mahathir said earlier projections were thrown off-track due to the impact of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome outbreak which devastated the economies of East Asian nations.<br><br>"At that time, when we were budgeting for this year (2003), we did not anticipate SARS although we were anticipating the Iraq war. But as you know, SARS has affected our performance, as much as it has affected the performance of most countries in East Asia. But we are not as badly off as some other countries," he said Also present at the signing ceremony were Works Minister Datuk Seri S.

The project is slated for completion by December 2005.<br><br>'With this removal of the Causeway, water will then flow through and boats not above 25m high can now cross from west to east.<br><br>'It will also facilitate probably moving some cargo from Pasir Gudang to PTP, if it is worthwhile,' he said.<br><br>Shipping industry observers said the idea of cargo shipments is viable as the 25m gap under the bridge is sufficient for small ships or feeder barges to pass through.<br><br>The journey between the two ports could take about three hours using barges. PTP is located on the west coast of Johor, while Johor Port is east of the Causeway.<br><br>'It is feasible as a feeder could pass under it and the distance is much shorter than going to Singapore,' said Mr S. C. Chan, the Singapore-based regional director of Hong Kong line OOCL.<br><br>Linking the two Johor ports could mean that some cargo ships could bypass Singapore.<br><br>A vessel from Japan, for example, could drop off its cargo in Pasir Gudang and then turn back, instead of having to go to Singapore to unload.<br><br>Barges could then take the cargo across the Johor Strait to PTP from where another ship would pick it up and take it to its destination.<br><br>Besides saving time and fuel, shipping lines could be enticed to berth in the cheaper Johor ports instead of Singapore.<br><br>This is the first time Malaysian officials have said that the bridge could help its ports.<br><br>The bridge project has previously been billed as being good for the environment as it allows for the natural flow of tides in the straits again after 80 years.<br><br>It was also promoted as enabling pleasure craft to sail through, while cutting the time for vehicles to cross between the two countries as a bigger customs, immigration and quarantine (CIQ) complex would also be built.<br><br>Singapore has decided to keep its section of the Causeway intact.<br><br>When asked at another function yesterday whether the bridge would boost its port business, Dr Mahathir said: 'Yes, of course it will improve it. Also, it will improve travel because we are moving the CIQ in so that people can travel faster.'<br><br>The plan to link up the two ports ties in with Malaysia's ambition to make southern Johor a regional transportation hub that includes an expanded role for Senai airport, said a shipping analyst.<br><br>'It is all coming along nicely as this cargo plan would boost the connectivity between PTP and Pasir Gudang,' he said.<br><br>PTP and Johor Port officials declined to comment.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>See lah.<br><br>M government spend so much money to build such a weird one sided bridge instead of putting down their pride and come have have a nice tea to talk with our government and share the cost of building one bridge.<br><br>Later, we'll see them in the future blaming us that their treasury got no money because Singapore refused to share the cost of building one single bridge because we wanna deter their port channel from progressing and fear for their competition.<br><br>Now you'll see why we don't want to invest in any of their projects. They are not doing anything prospective and sensible. Later say us miser again.<br><br>Haiz...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I went matlaysia yesterday (Sunday). While on the causeway, I notice tat they have already start their project for building the bridge already.<br><br>Things tat benified for the mat with a new bridge:<br>-faster traffic flow, it's citizen can travel to s'pore to work faster. with a faster traveling, it's citizen can save the expenses of staying back in s'pore and contributing back to their homeland economy.<br>-more of their citizen could be employ by local company as they are paid much cheaper than local citizen.<br>-boast their ecomony with the s'porean heavy spending in JB.<br>-i head tat the brigde is a pull bridge rite where ship can travel under it.... with tat, they can attract ships stopping at their ports with lower fees. could be a setback to s'pore shipping industries.<br>-they can overcharge the price for entering matlaysia again... the price charge presenting in 1st link and 2nd link is quite a big different. 1st link is RM$2.5 and 2nd link is RM$5 or RM$6. Dont really use the 2nd link, so no idea how much is it.<br></div>

For example, can the Malaysian operator guarantee that the bridge mechanical system remains functional 24/7 weeks &amp; 365days a yr like what existing causeway ?<br>Can the Malaysian guranteee that the water-supply would not be disrunpted during the construction ?<br><br>Can the Malaysian gov  provide safty gurantee of  ships with dangerous cargo when using that narrow straits ?<br><br>With existing ships already sailing to Sembawang shipyard at the eastern side of the straits, will extra traffic on the Malaysian side increase the risk of accident?<br><br>I welcome Malaysia's economy challenge that it can give to Singapore. But when one see how Malaysia's humonguous plan became white or black elephants, the construction of this odd bridge should be watched with concern as this will have enomous impact on people's activities on both side of the straits.</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Bridge is just one more project that contribute to the retirement funds for "the Chief", why the urgency and insistence in having the entire project rushed ?<br><br>It would seems that the piling have been rushed to ensure that work will definitely start before the October date.<br><br>There do not seem to be any public bidding for the design and the appointment of Consulting Professionals, nor any publicity in the retendering of the bridge design - when Singapore announced during 3rd Quater of 2002 that it will abandon the "package approach" in settling the outstanding dispute that affects Singapore's participation in the Bridge.<br><br>There is so much "grey work at play" that there is certainly more then meets the eye in the manner that this Bridge has been rushed with such urgency.<br><br>Concerning the ship movement in the narrow Straits of Johor, sailing between Pasir Gudang and the South China Sea - most ships sailing through this narrow Straits of Johor will have to pass through Singapore's territorial waters.<br><br>The waters between Changi Point and Pulau Ubin forms the bottle neck, and is much deeper to allow ocean going vessels to pass, than the waters between the northern shores of Pulau Ubin and the Southern Johor Coastline.<br><br>This passage on the Singapore side goes all the way up until the ship near Pasir Gudang.<br><br>Perhaps, our Port of Singapore Authority will enjoy maritime Pilotage Fees for guiding all ships heading up our side of the Straits towards Pasir Gudang.<br><br>If ever Pasir Gudang should enjoy the same popularity as our Port of Singapore, then the entire narrow Straits of Johor will be clogged with ships anchoring within the Straits.<br><br>It will be quite a certainty that most of these ships will have to anchor on the entire length of the Singapore side of the Straits, which means that these ships will still be subject to PSA anchorage rates.<br><br>If there will be so many ships anchoring to wait their turn to berth at Pasir Gudang, there will be hardly any passage corridor in an already narrow water way filled with ships at anchor.<br><br>The Port of Pasir Gudang do not have the same length of dock space as Singapore PSA has - (reputed to be the longest dock space in the World at 14 km).<br><br>For Pasir Gudang Port to beat PSA with a faster turn around time of Ships calling at its port will be an uphill task.<br><br>Moving cargo between Pasir Gudang and PTP will add further confusion at the Pasir Gudang Port.<br><br>Having a rail connection between the two ports will require additional heavy investments for traffic that is relatively low at current levels. The rail line between the two ports will reqire a large deviation off the main trunk rail line.<br><br>Someone is making up a tall story to justify the construction of the Bridge - that probably explain the reluctance of the Malaysian Press to print more then one paragraph concerning the movement of cargo between the two ports.<br></div>
