            <div class='col-md body'>Philip Bowring of Intl Herald Tribune thinks that it would be another decade before Singaporeans vote out the PAP.<br><br>Singapore beyond Lee<br>Philip Bowring. International Herald Tribune<br>May 10, 2006<br><br>HONG KONG - Every regime has its day, so the result of Saturday's election in Singapore provided a glimpse of what its politics may look like when Lee Kuan Yew, founder and mentor of the People's Action Party (PAP) and scourge of all opponents, is no longer around.<br><br>At 82, he played an active role in this campaign.<br><br>For sure, his son, Lee Hsien Loong, fighting his first election as prime minister, was able to claim that winning the same number of seats as in the previous election - 82 out of 84 - was "a clear vote of confidence" in his administration.<br><br>However, the more relevant statistic was that the PAP's share of the vote fell by 8.7 percentage points to 66.6 percent compared with the 2001 election, when Goh Chok Tong was prime minister.<br><br>In Lee Hsien Loong's constituency, uncontested in 2001, the PAP polled marginally less than its average.<br><br>Given a strong economy, the opposition's lack of significant media access and the huge organisational and legal obstacles placed in its way by a PAP leadership, with open disregard for the benefits of liberal democracy with a strong opposition and the possibility of a change of government, the result could be seen as the biggest setback for the PAP since 1981.<br><br>That was the year when the PAP lost a by-election to an opposition lawyer, J.B. Jeyaretnam. With it went a monopoly in Parliament the PAP had enjoyed Since 1968.<br><br>Jeyaretnam later lost an action brought by the government and in 1986 was made bankrupt and disbarred from Parliament and legal practice.<br><br>The judicial committee of the Privy Council, to which appeal on the issue of disbarment was then available, found that he suffered "a grievous injustice."<br><br>He was ultimately reinstated as a lawyer. In 2001, Jeyaretnam was bankrupted again following his failure to pay damages in libel actions brought by ministers.<br><br>Since 1981 the electoral system has also been changed so that most members Of Parliament are now elected from five or six member constituencies where the PAP's organisational strength and connections to the government machinery overwhelm the much-harassed opposition candidates.<br><br>Districts that have elected opposition members have previously been threatened with official neglect.<br><br>The opposition won two of the nine single-member constituencies, but none of the group ones.<br><br>But in one where a well-known young liberal activist, James Gomez, was a candidate up against Foreign Minister George Yeo, it got 44 percent.<br><br>The PAP leadership continues to make great play of its success in<br>government, as though it were entirely responsible for the economic rise of Singapore over the past 40 years.<br><br>It accuses those who query current policies of being ungrateful for the past achievements of the leaders.<br><br>But what an increasing number of people appear to recognise is that other economies in East Asia have done at least as well over that period - Hong Kong under an undemocratic but liberal colonial-style bureaucracy, South Korea, Taiwan and Thailand under both democratic and authoritarian regimes.<br><br>Indeed, Singapore stands out in East Asia not for exceptional economic success but for the immobility of politics still dominated by the presence of Lee Kuan Yew, in power since 1959.<br><br>Its system would come in for more scrutiny internationally if it were not so useful to US strategic interests and foreign multinationals or so successful in subduing the foreign media with carrots and sticks.<br><br>The Singapore leadership likes to scorn the "instability" of Asian liberal democracies such as Thailand, the Philippines and Taiwan.<br><br>But at some point it will likely have to address demands for greater openness and for power-sharing with middle and lower income groups, which have benefited from economic growth but feel excluded from power.<br><br>The PAP is a small, tight-knit party. The leadership controls the<br>government bureaucracy and the state-owned enterprises, which play a large part in an economy that is dominated by multinationals and state enterprises.<br><br>The PAP has such a grip on the levers of power that it could be a long time before any opposition can pretend to be an alternative government.<br><br>Opposition leaders like Jeyaretnam and Chee Soon Juan, who threaten to gain popular momentum, have been successfully sued and financially ruined.<br><br>There is also the unspoken fear of Muslim-majority Malaysia and Indonesia, and the importance of Chinese identity, to keep the majority in line.<br><br>But none of this can cover up the fact that the PAP has been losing<br>popularity.<br><br>There are those who will always follow Lee Kuan Yew but have less respect for the second generation headed by the elder son, Hsien Loong, and the daughter-in-law, Ho Ching, who runs Temasek, the giant state holding company.<br><br>Low income groups note high and rising income gaps (which would be even bigger if the army of very low paid foreign workers is included).<br><br>Small businessmen resent the dominance of foreign investors and huge state enterprises. A younger generation is anxious for the greater social and political freedoms now enjoyed in much of the rest of Asia.<br><br>And an aging population that has generally been supportive of the<br>government now finds that decades of forced savings have had such low returns that a comfortable retirement is not in sight.<br><br>But it could be another decade before Singaporeans decide that enough is enough, and have their own velvet revolution.

            <div class='col-md body'>Globe and Mail (Canada) thinks that LHL only paid lip service to the need for more openness.<br><br>Shadow over Singapore<br>Globe and Mail (Canada)<br>May 9, 2006<br><br>Singapore's Prime Minister, Lee Hsien Loon, has paid lip service to the need for more openness in a political system that is democratic in name but authoritarian in practice.<br><br>But his deeds show that the eldest son of founding prime minister Lee Kuan Yew is following in his father's footsteps, with the same lack of tolerance for political dissent, open debate or free media - essential ingredients of a functioning democracy.<br><br>Prime Minister Lee's ruling People's Action Party won all but two of the 84 seats in the country's parliamentary election on Saturday, the same number it held after the last vote in 2001.<br><br>But its share of popular support dropped to 66.6 per cent from 75.3 per cent.<br><br>In Western democracies, such a slippage in its overwhelming approval might have prompted the political leadership to reassess its policies and priorities.<br><br>The fact that the small opposition parties made their greatest headway among younger voters who yearn for more political freedoms to go along with the huge economic gains of recent years ought to be a spur to modest reform.<br><br>What Singapore's election has prompted, though, is intensified harassment of political opponents.<br><br>James Gomez, whose opposition Workers' Party won a single seat, is being investigated by police for something called "criminal intimidation."<br><br>His alleged crime: He incorrectly blamed the elections department (which is an arm of the prime minister's office) for losing one of his required forms, an accusation for which he later apologised.<br><br>The small party won 16.3 per cent of the vote, up from a mere 2.7 per cent in 2001, including a third of the ballots cast in the Prime Minister's constituency.<br><br>The leaders of another opposition party, the Singapore Democratic Party, face libel actions from both Prime Minister lee and his father.<br><br>This is an old tactic employed by the ruling party to silence critics and bankrupt political opponents, which in turn disqualifies them from holding elective office.<br><br>Lee Kuan Yew held the reins of power for more than three decades before stepping down in 1990.<br><br>While his son, now 54, was being groomed for the top job, the elder Mr. Lee remained a senior minister in the cabinet of his chosen successor, Goh Chok Tong.<br><br>After the younger Mr. Lee became Prime Minister in 2004, the 82-year old family patriarch retained his considerable influence with the new title of "minister mentor." His mentoring is all too apparent.<br>Globe and Mail</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Financial Times called our politics as "curious politics" as we might be one of the wealthiest and most technologically advanced nations, but politically we seemed as backward as the old Soviet Union or an African dictatorship:<br><br>The curious politics<br>Financial Times<br>May 8 2006<br><br>The People's Action party, which has governed Singapore since Lee Kuan Yew led the country to independence in 1965, avoided two possible embarrassments in the election on Saturday.<br><br>First, it did not lose parliamentary seats to a resurgent opposition, an outcome that would have suggested a weakening of the PAP's grip on the city-state.<br><br>Second and more important was the party's failure to make a clean sweep with 100 per cent of the seats, even though that was the professed ambition of Lee Hsien Loong, Mr Lee's son and the current prime minister.<br><br>That would have made Singapore, one of the wealthiest and most technologically advanced nations, seem as politically backward as the old Soviet Union or an African dictatorship.<br><br>In the event the PAP, led for the first time in a general election by the younger Mr Lee, won 82 of the 84 seats in parliament, exactly what it had before and for much the same reasons.<br><br>The economy is expected to grow 6 per cent this year and unemployment is at 3.4 per cent for Singaporeans.<br><br>In case this admirable record might not be enough to sway the voters, the government made financial handouts to low income groups a few days before the poll and maintained tight control of the media to the detriment of the opposition.<br><br>The PAP's leaders persist infiling crippling defamation suits against their political opponents and in threatening to withhold taxpayers' money for the upgrading of housing estates in constituencies that have the temerity to vote for other parties.<br><br>James Gomez, an opposition candidate who became a focus of attacks by the PAP, was detained yesterday for alleged "criminal intimidation" following a dispute over election paperwork.<br><br>However, the unchanged shape of the parliament cannot hide the fact that Singapore society is changing in ways that do not favour the ageing figureheads of the PAP or their adherence to "soft authoritarianism" in a nominally democratic system.<br><br>Many young Singaporeans are concerned about the gap between rich and poor and the lack of real democracy, and have used the internet to express irritation with the paternalistic PAP and the continuing influence of Lee Kuan Yew, who at the age of 82 keeps a cabinet post as "minister mentor".<br><br>Thousands of people attended large rallies of the opposition Workers' party that were pointedly underplayed by the media. The PAP's share of the vote fell to 66 per cent from 75 per cent in 2001.<br><br>More significantly, in his multi-candidate constituency Lee Hsien Loong was challenged by a group of Workers' party candidates in their twenties and - unusually for a sitting prime minister - did worse than the PAP as a whole.<br><br>Mr Lee said his new leadership team would "see Singapore through the next 15 to 20 years", although the electoral mandate is only for five.<br><br>He may learn that five years can be a long time in politics, even in PAP-ruled Singapore.</div>
