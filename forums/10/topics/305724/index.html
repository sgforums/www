              <tr>
              <td colspan="2"><span class="postbody">If
              someone has a good idea in Singapore and tries to visit one of the
              agencies like Spring, EDB as I have once done most likely he will be
              asked: "Has your idea worked and how has it worked or do you set up a
              company to market your product?"
              <br> <br>In other words if you are only a starter and even if you have very
              good systems which worked for you these agencies are not interested.
              What they want are mature ideas which already worked. They are not
              interested in seeing a new ideas which may be better than existing
              ideas on their table. <br> <br> Then by this time when you are totally turned off by all the conditions
              and getting no headway, and start asking for more help, you will most
              likely be given some names and telephones like Chamber of Commerce
              agencies etc.
              <br> <br>So you called or emailed those persons from CEOs to some other high
              sounding personalities you will be referred from one person to another
              with excuses like they only look after some other matters and you are
              barking up the wrong trees.
              <br> <br>My conclusion is that Singapore government does not help talents to
              flourish because they only look for mature and successful people to bet
              on safe horses and not the budding talents.
              <br> <br>So forget it !! Let the Spring and EDB and ministers continue to do
              their boasting and look-good assistance schemes for entrepreneurs.
              <br> <br> These schemes are not intended to grow the budding entrepreneurs but to share their glories or a piece of the cake.
              <br> <br>How hypocrites work. That would be the end of your entrepreneurship
              in this little red dot which only looks for mature and successful
              entrepreneurs to get a ride or for greenhorn foreign talents which give
              them good international publicity free.</span></td>

              <p>The only advice I can give you is start small.</p>
              <p>Use your smaller ideas, make them successful. You'd learn a lot along the way. Build up your expertise and experience so that you'd be in a better position to tackle the big ones. With some kind of track record you'll be in a better position to gain some capital, from friends, family or left over from previous business success.</p>
              <p>If you don't come from a rich family with connections you're definitely at a serious disadvantage but it won't be impossible.</p>

              <p>It's heartening to note that EDB and SPRING actually listened to your ideas. </p>
              <p>Since a few schemes are indeed in place to aid entrepreneurs-wanna-be, the organisations which you have mentioned probably prefer interested parties to apply for these when they call for submissions, instead of approaching them separately.  This would allow them to examine and judge applications concurrently, in a convenient, effective and fair manner.  As funds are limited, a rigorous selection system is essential.</p>
              <p>The same relates to many corporations' recruitment process as well.  To fill a vacant post, companies invite potential candidates for interviews and choose from this pool of talent, rather than waiting for suitable individuals to come knocking on their doors.</p>

              <p><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica; color: black; font-size: xx-small;"><strong>The Creative and EDB story.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica; font-size: x-small;">The post below is what I got from a forum about Creative's<br> CEO Sim Wong Hoo's encounter with the EDB/NCB.<br> <br> This poster echoes my opinion about govt participation<br> in entrepreneurship. They are a hindrance and barrier<br> to ordinary people like us. <br> <br> -----------------------------------------------------<br> <br> "Frog3"  wrote in message<br> news:KK8CXJAD37298.5179282407@frog.gilgamesh.org...<br> <br> Lee Kuan Yew can keep his illusions about a citizenry <br> brutalized by a police state in a bankrupt system turning <br> out to be entrprenuers. Just for the record he openly <br> denigrated Singapore's most successful entreprenuer, <br> Sim Wong Woo when Sim's Creative hit a bad patch about 4 <br> years ago.<br> <br> Lee believed that his "top talent" could do better.<br> ==================================================<br> ==<br> I will give u a more interesting story about Sim Wong Woo <br> and the scholars and the government.<br> <br> Whe SWW had developed the 8 bit cound card, he came to <br> NCB (National Computer Board, now known as iDA)to explain <br> what he has done and why he needed $ 250K to market this <br> at Comdex ( trade show in the U.S.) The CEO of NCB was <br> Lim Swee Say (current Minister) and the Chairman was <br> Tan Chin Nam (now Perm Sec of MoM).<br> <br> Both of them ended up ridiculing him, saying that no one <br> would every want to hear a sound from the PC. And moreover <br> also mentioned that he was just a poly dip holder and thet <br> he needs to develop something for the local market for <br> which NCB would give him assistance. They also shunted him <br> to TDB, which finally ended up giving him a $15K grant to <br> participate.<br> <br> SWW went to Walden's office who ended up giving him $800k <br> immediately for an undisclosed stake and the rest as they <br> say is history.<br> <br> In 1994 and 1995, after Creative's success, the CEO of <br> NCB ( Ko Keng Hwa, now CEO of EDB) and various other <br> officials tried very hard inviting him to sit on committes, <br> Boards and others. He didnt even return calls.<br> <br> In one year when the nomination committee nominated him <br> for the Entreprenuer of the year award (1994, I think) he <br> declined. That year it was given to the Thakral group. <br> Subsequent year, needed a personal persuation from the PM.<br> <br> He has considerably mellowed down but I dont think he has <br> forgotton the insult and embarassment.<br> ==================================================<br> =======<br> In late 1993, Aztech wanted to do the sound cards and <br> actually hired 2 engineers from Creative. ITI (information <br> Technology Institute) which has now become KRDL and Aztech <br> signed a joint MOU to develop multimedia products. But, <br> their real agenda was to try and reverse engineer Sound <br> Blaster and make a better chip. After 5 months they did <br> come up with a prototype, but was highly unreliable. <br> Aztech pursued other initiatives and tried to clone <br> SoundBlaster. They infringed several copyrights and lost <br> their case both in singapore  and U.S.<br> <br> All, I am saying is that if at all there was roadblocks, <br> it was the Government.<br> <br> Hence I respect SWH for having been steadfast in his <br> approach. I take my hats of for him<br> ==================================================<br> ======<br> <br> FYI Aztech is a GLC.</span></p>

              <p>why do you want to give your ideas to Spring and EDB? They will listen and then turn you away. next thing you know, it will be implemented by the government and you will lose any rights.</p>
              <p>One of my class mate (the footballer from Australia who broke his leg on the 1st game and then never played onwards but still carried a 10K salary in Singapore and even bought a 10k facial package), he said Singapore had this stupid idea that enforce that foreigners had to hand over their business ideas when they want to come in and ask for a grant and start some business. He said that no one in their right mind will hand over a business idea or plan. Because, for all you know, the government agency will copy it and that's the end of their business idea.</p>
              <p>Aye, foreigners are not stupid ok. Why Singaporeans are so naive .... save your ideas and go implement it somewhere else where your idea will be appreciated and you can make money and not have it copied by some govt linked corp.</p>
