            <div class='col-md body'>We all know that parliament is supreme in that it has the power to pass laws to govern the country.<br><br>However when it comes to paying Ministers; and MPs' own salaries, bonuses and life long pension from the public funds do they have the same right to put up any such motions or benchmarking for approval by their own members.<br><br>In the case of NKF's Durai using his power to pay himself and his subordinates peanut salaries even with the unfailing support and sanction by government patron Mrs. Goh Chok Tong the court obviously has censored the board and Durai for such self-reward as conflict and improper conduct.<br><br>Our leaders are trustees of public funds. They have apparently even without voting given themselves self-rewards beyond their originally contracted salaries and payments which were essentially tied to the salary structures of the public service.<br><br>The ministers have therefore committed a serious error by introducing such motions and have their own members to approve such rewards.<br><br>Even if there is voting the votes may be declared null and void by the court.<br><br>Citizens have the right to check on such wrong doings They are not being jealous as our politicians have been calling the people. What is immoral and not right cannot be made right by propagandas.<br><br>Even PM Lee felt so embarrassed lately with people's strong objections to such self-writing of ministers' own pay cheques that in order to retain a sense of propriety and morality to govern he had decided to donate his own increments to charity.<br><br>If such salaries and bonuses and life pensions were taken in this manner sooner or later they will have to be adjudged by the court and the monies so taken may have to be returned to the people.<br><br>The proper thing for our leaders to do is to put forward such self-rewards as manifestos of the party in the election and specifically have the votes taken based on such public sanction.<br><br>Two wrongs do not make a right so the fact that when a mistake has been made it will not be right to allege that just because the ministers and MPs have won the election they could write their own pay cheques or approve their own bonuses or life pension as they like.</div>

(as reproduced above) This is a good piece of evidence which confirms once and for all beyond all doubts that our PM at S$2,500,000.00 pa is grossly overpaid.<br><br>From this report it is clear that there is a lot of unhappiness (not necessarily because Canadian politicians lack the political daring and courage to face the ministers' pay issue squarely as put it by MM Lee) by their countrymen and parliamentarians with the ministers' and MPs' pay increases calling it hypocrisy and lack of openness in increasing their own ministers and MPs; salaries while denying their own countrymen of due wage increases.<br><br>There is no notes provided to show how their motion was introduced and whether the Canadian constitution contains a provision for such self-approval of their own salaries.<br><br>We are more than convinced now by such evidence that for a small country like the little red dot it is much easier to govern and therefore our PM should be paid at most up to say 2/3 of Canada PM's gross pay of C$301,600.00 pa) assuming our PM is extremely talented and competent.<br><br>On top of our PM's salary of S$2,500,000.00 pa he would be paid a few months bonuses and at least S$1,500,000.00 pa in life pension so his total gross salary at the end of the day would be very much higher than S$4,500,000.00 pa.<br><br>Let our PM and Ministers be more accountable and not engage in such conflict of interest in exercise of their power and refer their additional pay packages and other packages over the contracted figures based on public service structure originally adopted back in 1970s including all the bonuses and life pension to the people in the party manifesto in the next election for sanction or referendum by the citizens.<br><br>In the same report reference has been made to US President's salary which was only US$400,000.00 for running a more onerous superpower of very much larger population and size. So it is not true that our PM and MPs are doing a more responsible or more talented job and have to be paid much higher than equivalents or counterparts in US or Canada.<br></div>
