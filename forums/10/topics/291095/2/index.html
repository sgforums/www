            <div class='col-md body'>i'll choose to be born in Singapore anytime rather than China..<br><br>Anyway..i notice that seniors in other countries like to travel around. We can't say the same for Singaporeans, not my grandmother anyway. That is an unhealthy habit. Staying at home or being cooped in the same neighbourhood is no good.<br><br>Seniors should be relieved of the burden of transport costs so that they can be mobile, can window shop, can visit friends, regardless of economic situation. Subsidising them on transport costs (bus, Mrt) can come from the taxes the additional taxes generated from FTs and GST ? I'm not sure. Anyway, true we have an ageing population but judging from current trends, they'll probably stay at home anyway.....<br><br>The government cannot consider this as a harmful form of welfare as i don't think anybody will lose the motivation to work or to save just because they get free transport when they hit the twilight years of their lives.<br><br>If the government is worried about us not having enough after age 80-85 and require us to purchase an annuity, then they also be worried that we might not have enough for transport.

When there is such a government citizens will be able to live and procreate their next generation. Now they cannot even fend for themselves and many young ones could not earn enough to afford and older ones pay mortgages for the HDB flats how do they expect the citizens to procreate. To restructure to such an economy, we will need a government which is more creative and proactive not by all kinds of assumptions by one man at the helm but spread out all the ministers to be working closely with the people at all level, improve on HR, look after employees' welfare and interest and promote motivation and helping the citizens to live within their government-restricted wages. In such a situation, even if the government makes a lot of mistake with pushing up their monopoly fees and over-taxing and profiteering people will still be able to live and be motivated to live in this country and be happy.<br><br>If not we will end up having a government which keeps talking about its own superficial success while citizens are either migrating or switching off refusing to listen to any of their propaganda,<br><br><blockquote>2. aging population --&gt; ask local to buy compulsory annuity<br>-- Annuity payout at 85?  Is there any figure to support the majority of Singaporean are living past 85 (Or simply benchmark against LKY age?)[/b]</blockquote>Solution: Use the government windfall profits from land sales and all the profiteering schemes to create any endowment fund of S$20 billion from which to derive interest incomes without affecting the principal sum (avoid draining of national resource on welfare).<br><br>Such endowment funds could either go towards helping to pay ageing annuity insurance premium for citizens who live beyond 80 or channel to lower the rising costs of living on transportation, utility and education.<br><br><blockquote>3.

I admit I have no idea whatsoever as to the guidelines and processes for reviewing ministerial salary. So I can't comment on that particular process. But what I was trying to emphasis here is that legality, or the rule of law, which is a common regime principle incepted by most states is itself defined and safeguarded by those who hold the reigns of power. A matter of legality or illegality is no white or black differentiation, but rather lies with the people who voted for the regim. I know its a simplistic view, but this is all  I can say to that</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think the NDP (It's a left wing party btw) made a pt that what is needed is a clear and above board process that is open to public scrutiny to study any proposal to increase salaries of govt officials.
