In the context of GRCs, bigger political parties stand a better chance in finding a slate and supporting it with adequate grassroots and admin hands. Hence, my earlier statement.<br><br>Nevertheless, understanding that not everyone can see eye-to-eye with one opposition party, I advocate two to three for maximum participation from Singaporeans. At present, I believe there are about 9 contactable ones that see a level of movement, some with as little as 4 active members and many with less than 20.<br><br>Regards</div>
