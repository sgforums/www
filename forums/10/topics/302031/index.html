The company has offered to pay SLA royalties from the sales.<br><br>SLA disagreed and said it had deliberately put some nonÂ—existent buildings on their maps and those phantom features were also replicated on streetdirectory.com.<br><br>The Authority said this shows Virtual Map had reproduced SLAÂ’s maps, and in so doing, Virtual Map had attempted to use SLAÂ’s work without licence or consent.<br><br>That propelled Justice Tan Lee Meng, who is hearing the appeal, to suggest that perhaps Virtual Map had not done something new enough to cut off their apron strings from SLA.<br><br>Justice Tan gave his own example by saying that you can change the outfit on Mickey Mouse when you have the licence to use the image. But once your licence is expired or terminated, you cannot use that image anymore, even after you have revised it.<br><br>The hearing for this appeal case was originally scheduled for two days till Wednesday.<br><br>Virtual MapÂ’s lawyer was supposed to have finished his arguments on Tuesday, leaving the Singapore Land Authority lawyer to make his case on Wednesday.<br><br>But Virtual MapÂ’s lawyer did not manage to wrap up his arguments so the hearing is likely to go beyond the scheduled time frame.<br><br>Virtual Map charges companies that reproduce their online maps, and has even threatened to track down companies who use their maps without permission.<br><br>That prompted SLA to take action against Virtual Map, saying that the company itself is using SLAÂ’s maps without consent.

              <h1 class="clr">Appeal hearing for SLA—Virtual Map feud wraps up</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE : The longstanding feud between the Singapore Land Authority
              (SLA) and Virtual Map, the people behind street.directory.com, wrapped
              up on Wednesday, the last day of hearing on whether the company’s
              online maps infringed SLA’s copyright.</p>
              <p>SLA said the maps on Virtual Map’s website are based substantially
              on data from the authority, and Virtual Map had no right to do so after
              the license agreement was terminated in 2004.</p>
              <p>SLA said this was a copyright infringement.</p>
              <p>However,
              Virtual Map argued the maps were theirs — as they had spent millions to
              improve them, using GPS surveys and satellite photos.</p>
              <p>SLA
              countered by saying if that were the case, Virtual Map’s maps should
              not have incorrect items like non—existent temples, which SLA had
              deliberately put in as a trap for copy cats.</p>
              <p>A written judgement
              is expected in about a month’s time and this will mark the final
              chapter in a saga that started some five years ago when relations
              between Virtual Map and the SLA first started souring. — CNA/ms</p>

              <h1 class="clr">Virtual Map’s appeal against copyright infringement dismissed</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE: The High Court dismissed Virtual Map’s appeal against the
              District Court’s decision that the company had infringed Singapore Land
              Authority’s (SLA) copyright in its street directory maps.</p>
              <p>The High Court also upheld the injunction granted by District Court,
              prohibiting Virtual Map from reproducing SLA’s street directory maps
              and from distributing or selling reproductions of the maps.</p>
              <p>The company was also ordered to compensate SLA and pay its legal costs.</p>
              <p>Between
              1999 and 2003, Virtual Map entered into non—exclusive licence
              agreements with SLA to use the Authority’s street directory maps and
              address point data to produce maps. These were then made available on
              Virtual Map’s website — www.streetdirectory.com.</p>
              <p>SLA had to
              terminate the licences granted to Virtual Map in July 2004 when the
              latter asserted that its maps at www.streetdirectory.com were
              independently created and were not substantially reproduced from SLA’s
              maps and data.</p>
              <p>However, Virtual Map had continued to use SLA’s maps and data, infringing the Authority’s copyright.</p>
              <p>SLA then decided to take legal action against Virtual Map in October 2005 for copyright infringement.</p>
              <p>In
              August 2007, the District Court decided in SLA’s favour and granted an
              injunction restraining Virtual Map from infringing SLA’s copyright.</p>
              <p>In rejecting the appeal, Judge Tan Lee Meng gave a few reasons:<br>Firstly,
              "errors" that were placed in SLA’s maps to trap infringers, as well as
              genuine mistakes, were reproduced in Virtual Map’s copies.</p>
              <p>Secondly,
              Virtual Map’s maps could hardly be called independent creations as the
              inexperience of its main map—makers showed up during cross—examination.</p>
              <p>Thirdly,
              even though Virtual Map had improved and beautified the maps, the
              company was still heavily dependent on SLA’s core features.</p>
              <p>With
              this verdict, Virtual Maps would have to remove the disputed maps from
              www.streetdirectory.com, implicating the organisations that have their
              maps linked to the website. — CNA/so</p>

              <h1 class="clr">Streetdirectory.com will stay alive</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE: They have it all mapped out.</p>
              <p>At a meeting on Saturday after it lost its case in the High Court,
              shareholders of Virtual Map (VM) decided to continue running its
              website. They also decided not to refund the parties VM had fined for
              unauthorised use of its maps.</p>
              <p>These decisions came after the
              company’s appeal against the Singapore Land Authority (SLA) over
              copyright infringement was thrown out last month.</p>
              <p>VM managing
              director Firdhaus Akber said the website, streetdirectory.com, will be
              up and running again this week, but he declined to say exactly which
              day. And he would not comment on how exactly VM will go about putting
              the maps together without falling afoul of copyright infringement again.</p>
              <p>At
              the meeting, two key topics were debated. There were the strength of
              public hostility towards the company VM had fined or threatened legal
              action at about 500 businesses and if the site is still a worthwhile
              investment.</p>
              <p>Since it was taken offline last Wednesday, more than
              2,000 users have appealed for it to be put back online, said Mr
              Firdhaus, who also said that "only a small minority hates the company".</p>
              <p>"We
              understand it is painful for them," he said. "If there is anything we
              can do to lessen their pain, please inform them to contact us. But we
              will not refund any money as the monies have gone back into building
              better products and services and the running of the site."</p>
              <p>So far, no one has demanded that VM refund the money it collected from its previous lawsuits, he added.</p>
              <p>As
              to whether those parties are entitled to do so, copyright lawyer Siew
              Kum Hong said it was a "tricky" issue that is dependant on the terms of
              the settlement.</p>
              <p>In cases such as these, the "alleged infringer"
              should have gotten a warranty agreement from VM that says it is
              authorised to grant a license to them to continue using the maps, said
              Mr Siew, who is also a Nominated Member of Parliament (NMP).</p>
              <p>But
              he pointed out that now that VM has been found guilty of infringing the
              SLA’s maps, VM could be found to be in breach of that warranty because
              it did not have the right to grant the licence in the first place.</p>
              <p>As
              for the possibility of the SLA going after the parties who have been
              using VM maps, the NMP said they can then turn to VM to compensate them
              or indemnify them.</p>
              <p>"It is legitimate for these companies that
              were previously sued by VM to feel ripped off," said Mr Siew. "Even if
              the settlement agreement did not specify that VM is authorised to grant
              these licences of use, it is likely that this can be implied and if
              they wanted to, they could go after VM." — TODAY/so</p>

              <h1 class="clr">Virtual Map’s legal woes benefitting similar service providers</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE: Virtual Map said it will continue to run its website street
              directory.com sometime this week despite losing its case against the
              Singapore Land Authority (SLA) over copyright infringement recently.</p>
              <p>But it did not give details how it will do so without running afoul again.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, the website’s legal woes have been a boon for others who provide online maps.</p>
              <p>For 25—year—old Douglas Gan and his business partner, running an online map business just got better.</p>
              <p>Operating from home, they said their venture is seeing benefits due to street directory.com’s legal problems.</p>
              <p>Mr
              Gan, CEO &amp; Founder of www.shownearby.com, said: "Their shut down
              has actually increased our traffic by about 500% everyday. So, just
              this month alone, we launched the site on 1 April and for this month we
              have about 7,000 over absolute unique visitors already."</p>
              <p>Mr Gan and his business partner have spent about S$30,000 on their entire business so far.</p>
              <p>They
              are hoping to generate revenue from business listings — basically
              companies that want to be featured prominently on the search engine
              aspect of their site.</p>
              <p>The entrepreneurs are using Google maps without any copyright infringement and it’s free.</p>
              <p>Google
              allows anyone to make use of their maps for free as long as they are
              not used directly to make money and instead used to enrich an online
              business.</p>
              <p>Derek Callow, Marketing Manager of Google, said: "The
              relationships and the contracts we’ve got with our maps providers allow
              us to in turn make those maps and the Google Maps API available for
              individuals, businesses and associations to embed those maps into their
              website and the net result is actually making the internet experience
              so much better."</p>
              <p>Other companies like V3 Teletech which powers
              websites like www.can.com.sg and uses maps from SLA, said their
              business has also gone up by about five per cent in the last six months.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile,
              Virtual Map has said it will not refund companies which it fined for
              unauthorised use of its maps although Virtual Map itself was found to
              have infringed copyright law.</p>
              <p>But those fined may have some recourse.</p>
              <p>Philip
              Wong, Head of Civil &amp; Commercial Litigation, Harry Elias
              Partnership, said: "These companies may argue that when it entered into
              a settlement with Virtual Map, it did not know that in fact Virtual Map
              did not own the copyright to these maps. So on that basis, they can
              argue that the settlement was entered into by a common mistake or a
              unilateral mistake and on that basis they might consider going after
              Virtual Map to recover the fines they’ve paid."</p>
              <p>Virtual Map said it will take its case against SLA to the Court of Appeal on 10 April. — CNA/vm</p>

              <h1 class="clr">High Court dismisses Virtual Map’s leave to appeal</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE: The High Court on Monday rejected Virtual Map’s application
              to appeal against the latest ruling in the company’s ongoing copyright
              infringement case with the Singapore Land Authority (SLA).</p>
              <p>In a private hearing on Monday morning, Justice Tan Lee Meng said he
              found there were insufficient grounds to grant leave to appeal.</p>
              <p>Virtual
              Map, the company behind streetdirectory.com, has been involved in a
              long—standing feud with the SLA over the use of online maps.</p>
              <p>Virtual Map now has seven days to take its case to the Court of Appeal, where it will again seek leave to appeal.</p>
              <p>The
              company also intends to apply for a stay of execution, which will allow
              it to continue providing the disputed maps on streetdirectory.com until
              the case is fully resolved. — CNA/ac</p>

              this was precisely it....if they hadn't gone round suing, sla might not have taken any action as reported.....i recalled reading how vm went for the throats against many..including some individuals who had posted small partial maps directing readers to their location, vm went all the way, extorting thousands...no negotiation....as much as i love streetdirectory.com ,  i can't help but feel vindicated for those whom they sued...ntuc was sued too for a hefty amount, but for that one i have no sympathies...lol

              <p>I don't pity Virtual Maps... So what if they are a good online map... They STEAL and use what they had stolen to sue us of innocently using their maps... our company was struggling when they sued us last time... we beg them but they were so merciless... so mercenary... THIS IS RETRIBUTION... They should face the music...</p>

              <p>in a sense it's ironic that VM got sued while they were busy sueing others. poetic justice aside, it has served to encourage people to come up with alternatives and for people to actually consider using these other alternatives. personally, i don't think people really fancy using online street directories that are cluttered with irrelevant advertisements of florists. it was just that there wasn't much choice for the consumer. now there's choice.</p>
              <p>personally, i like GoThere (http://gothere.sg) cos it fulfils my basic needs like public transport info and driving directions while offering many other frills such as searching for nearby food and wifi but that's just my personal choice. at least there's more to choose from at the moment i feel.</p>
