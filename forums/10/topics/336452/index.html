              <h1>Bhutan's turn to celebrate with crowning of young king</h1>
              <p><img src="http://afp.google.com/media/ALeqM5hEhGCOTpkbc9Gc8nKtFzdwHC-Iag?size=s" alt=""></p>
              <p>HIMPHU (AFP) — The isolated Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan crowned a
              new king Thursday, placing a charismatic Oxford-educated bachelor as
              head of state of the world's newest democracy.</p>
              <p>With the rest of
              the world gripped by the historic US election win for Barack Obama, all
              eyes in Bhutan were on 28-year-old Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck, now
              the world's youngest reigning monarch.</p>
              <p>In an ancient Buddhist
              ritual in the white-walled palace overlooking the picturesque Thimphu
              valley, Wangchuck was handed Bhutan's Raven Crown by his father.</p>
              <p>"It's
              a wonderful day, there is no cloud in the sky. The gods are here. It
              will be remembered as an event which unifies the Bhutanese people,"
              Prime Minister Jigmi Thinley told reporters.</p>
              <p>The country now goes
              into three days and nights of festivities, and has even shut down its
              mobile telephone network for the occasion.</p>
              <p>The deeply revered
              former king, who is 52, abdicated two years ago as part of his plan to
              reform and modernise the staunchly traditional and insular nation of
              just over 600,000 people by ending absolute royal rule.</p>
              <p>Bhutan,
              wedged between India and China and never colonised, has witnessed
              sweeping changes this year -- having held its first democratic
              elections for a new parliament and prime minister in March.</p>
              <p>Since
              the former king's abdication, the century-old Wangchuck dynasty has
              been waiting for astrologers to give the go-ahead for the coronation.</p>
              <p>The
              palace was packed with hundreds of foreign dignitaries, including
              Indian President Pratibha Patil, ruling party leader Sonia Gandhi and
              Bollywood stars. It was also surrounded by lines of jubilant locals
              dressed in their national costumes.</p>
              <p>The new king has pledged to
              maintain his father's unique philosophy of improving "Gross National
              Happiness," and not common economic indicators, to ensure well-being in
              the "Land of the Thunder Dragon."</p>
              <p>"I am happy, my friends are
              happy and in general as a nation we are happy," enthused Sonam
              Phuntsho, a 27-year-old civil servant.</p>
              <p>"He is reaching out to the people. He is a very smart and decent man," he said of the new king.</p>
              <p>The
              royals in Bhutan are deeply revered, although the family clearly wanted
              to escape the fate of their counterparts in nearby Nepal -- which saw
              the outbreak of a Maoist insurgency in 1996 that culminated in the
              abolition of the monarchy there this year.</p>
              <p>"The best time to
              change a political system is when the country enjoys stability and
              peace. Why wait for a revolution?" Bhutan's former king said when he
              began the democratic reform process in 2005.</p>
              <p>Continuing to
              balance Bhutan's exposure to the forces of globalisation will be the
              new king's main challenge -- especially as many in the younger
              generation now have access to satellite television and the Internet.</p>
              <p>Bhutan
              had no roads or currency until the 1960s and allowed television only in
              1999. The extremely beautiful country also continues to resist the
              temptation of allowing mass tourism -- preferring instead to allow
              access to only small organised groups of well-heeled visitors.</p>
              <p>"We
              are a small and traditionally oriented country. We have to preserve our
              traditions, and it's important to control external influence,"
              explained Heroka Zangpo, a 25-year-old public utility worker enjoying
              the festivities.</p>
              <p>Still, many people are also confused over why
              the hugely popular former king decided to step down, and view the
              transition to democracy with trepidation.</p>
              <p>There are also potential external threats.</p>
              <p>Bhutan
              forced out 100,000 ethnic Nepalese in the early 1990s during a campaign
              to impose compulsory national dress and ban the Nepalese language.</p>
              <p>The
              refugees went on to languish in camps in Nepal, which have seen the
              emergence of a communist rebel movement determined to wage war against
              the Wangchuck dynasty.</p>

              <p><strong>In no man’s land: Bhutanese Refugees</strong></p>
              <p><em>More than 100,000 ethnic Nepalese refugees fled Bhutan in the 1990s. Officials say it was voluntary migration; the refugees say they were forced out. So, where does the truth lie?</em></p>

              way Thakhur Prasad Louitell tells it, his eviction began in the morning
              when the police arrived at his farm in southern Bhutan and marched him
              to their camp. “They didn’t begin to torture me until midday. </span></span></span></em></p>

              me tied up and took turns beating me with sticks. I passed out. After I
              woke up they started beating me again. That went on all night. The next
              morning they threw me out and said, ‘You’d better get out of Bhutan, or
              we are going to burn down your house with you in it’.” That was
              December 1991...</span></span></span></em></p>

              <p><strong>Maoists among Bhutan’s Nepali refugees ready for war</strong></p>
              <p><em>BELDANGI REFUGEE CAMP, Nepal: In a secluded corner of a refugee camp in
              southern Nepal, Nirmal Chettri outlines his plans for waging a bloody
              “people’s war” on the tiny Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan. <br><br>With
              the intense stare of the ideologically fervent, the 26-year-old said
              his organisation, the Bhutan Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist-Maoist),
              was ready to start killing for its cause. He also warned that his
              faction would step up attacks on thousands of Bhutanese refugees who
              are leaving the camps in Nepal to start new lives abroad. <br><br>“There
              will be a lot of casualties and destruction but we cannot shy away from
              fighting for justice,” said Chettri, one of around 100,000 Bhutanese of
              Nepalese origin who were forced to flee Bhutan in the early 1990s...</em></p>
