              <p><strong>Written by Our Correspondent</strong></p>
              <p>In an uncharacteristic Freudian slip, Singapore’s octogenarian leader Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew finally confirmed the suspicions of many Singaporeans – that all grassroots organizations are part of the PAP and not “non-partisan” as they are supposed to be.</p>
              <p>Dispensing his usual “pearls of wisdom” on China yesterday during a dialogue, Lee said that the Chinese have been studying Singapore for several years, sending many teams of officials, at different levels of government, to attend courses at, for example, the National University of Singapore, the Nanyang Technological University, and the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy.</p>
              <p>To illustrate one lesson the Chinese learnt, he said:</p>
              <p><em>“They discover that the People’s Action Party (PAP) has only a small office in Bedok. But everywhere they go,<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"> they see the PAP – in the RCs (residents’ committees), CCCs (citizens’ consultative committees), and the CCs (community clubs).”</span></strong></em></p>
              <p><strong>[Source: Straits Times, 30 December 2009]</strong></p>
              <p>Over 85 per cent of Singapore’s population lives in public housing estates built by HDB.  Every estate is subdivided into various zones, each with its own RC.</p>
              <p>A RC usually comprises of residents living within the zone and serve to promote interaction between Singaporeans by organizing events such as “block parties” at the void decks of HDB flats.</p>
              <p>Community Clubs cater to residents of the entire estate and offers a broader range of activities such as yoga classes, language courses and cooking classes.</p>
              <p>All grassroots organizations in Singapore are under the purview of the People’s Association, a statutory board set up on 1 July 1960 “to promote racial harmony and social cohesion.” Its Chairman is none other than the Prime Minister himself who is also the Secretary-General of the PAP.</p>
              <p>Though grassroots organizations are non-political organizations, they are often involved in “pseudo-political” activities which serve the partisan interests of the PAP.</p>
              <p>The premises of RCs are used for the weekly “Meet-the-People” sessions of PAP MPs. Dialogue sessions with ministers are often held in the halls of Community Clubs.</p>
              <p>To further complicate matters, the Chairpersons of RCs are sometimes PAP members who sit on many boards. A PAP branch secretary may be the Vice Chairman of a Community Club Management Committee and a RC Chairman at the same time.</p>
              <p>As an example, a YPAP member and moderator of the YPAP Facebook Network Mr Fong Yoong Keong, is the Vice Chairman of Eunos Community Club Management Committee and Assistant Secretary of Eunos Zone “3″ RC at the same time.</p>
              <p>The RCs and CCs give the PAP a powerful grassroots machinery on the ground which enables it to steamroll over the opposition election after election.</p>
              <p>Since the PA is a statutory board funded entirely by taxpayers’ monies, Singaporeans have been unwittingly “sponsoring” the PAP’s partisan activities over the last four decades.</p>
              <p>In fact, the PAP is found not only in grassroots organizations, but everywhere in Singapore as well from the mainstream media, trade unions, police, Internal Security Department, state-linked companies and what not – you name it, you have it!</p>
              <p>Lee once boasted unashamedly about the PAP’s complete dominance in Singapore during an interview with its mouthpiece Petir in 1982:</p>
              <p><em>“I make no apologies that the PAP is the (Singapore) Government and the Government is the PAP.”</em></p>
              <p>No wonder the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is so interested to learn from Singapore.</p>

              <p>I dunno, it either opposition supporters are too naive, stupid or simply dun want to understand it, PAP had already built it base so strongly that they need only another 15% from the ground out of all the grassroot CCs n CCCCs, to regain it 66.6%, anything more than that, will be a big bonus for them.</p>

              <p>It is just like working in a big organisation where 1 country trying to take over the other countries as a regional hub.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The other country (existing regional hub) will buy lots of machineries, lots of servers, lots of pcs, lots of programes, lots of applications until it was virtually very difficult to ship to another country (new regional hub).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>That is what they are doing now.</p>
              <p>Untouchable and our opposition are no where near them.</p>
              <p>If opposition take over, the whole system will break down and create choas.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Look at our ministers, going overseas and shake hands and to mingle and to introduce themselves to the leaders. Imagine they gone, who go overseas to make friends with the foreign leaders? Foreign leaders know the opposition members? Very hard isnt it?</p>

              <p><br>We, as citizens of Singapore, must be able to weight the situation in balance, first and foremost,</p>
              <p>PAP we already know that so well, thanks to our opposition players comments and also confused notions. In another words, we know how PAP rules and what they achieved for this country and benefits we got from it.</p>
              <p>Oppositions becoming rulers here is still unknown, we dunno what they are going to do, and what happen to singapore, or are they to do what they preached freely without much responsibilities in their rallies, or after attaining govt status, forget about what they said but concentrate more on gaining power, struggle and end up Chao.</p>
              <p>Is Singapore ok without the oppositions? well, since we are all here, still enjoying life and post freely, money in bank, got a business or job, dun have to beg for 3 meals, dun have to sleep on the street, dun have to work like a slave, do you think we want to take the risk to vote for opposition.??? Foods for thought ya.</p>
