              <p><br>I think the present topic is not surprising considering the fact that the opportunities in this country is getting limited plus in other countries, there are more opportunities, look at the late Bruce Lee going to US enable him to become famous, if he remained in HK, he will not be able to get to his present status.</p>

              <p>I thot my Dad told me, Bruce Lee was make famous in Hong Kong, his homeland, not in USA, I hope i get it right, cos i wasn't even born when he died.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyway, be smart, the prospect of foreign students who studied in Singapore and left to work in greener pasture, is not entirely wasted, actually it is one of the main purpose, of course, by remaining here to help us is a blessing, but to be on the competitive side also help us alot. In this world, there is a powerful tool that is not in any syllabus of education, and that is social networking, Singapore govt see a potential global economy on the rise, and especially so, in China and india, therefore we even offered scholarships to these people in return for our youngs to be able to mingle with them to form a social and business network for the future world. An example will be a singapore graduated businessman will find himself/herself having a better advantage that his Chinese business Counterpart in China was his/her former classmate. So again, be smart hor.</p>

              <p>It is not healthy to live within a fence in sg.    I wish these overseas sg students well.  Hope they able to get jobs and settle down there.   Come back Singapore is not a good idea, come back here means to feed the white scumbags who never stop sucking.</p>

              <p>If u mention opportunites in other countries, it depend on what u want. Mayb in the chinatown, u can set up ur restaurant. As for the subject of NS whether it totally turned a boy into a mature young man with a sense of responsibility is a subjective matter. Last time got a reservist got called back for ICT never turned up, went missing for several months before being found n kena court martialled.</p>
