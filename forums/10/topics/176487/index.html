Yet these petrol taxes were raised to the high level during period before government introduced high vehicle exercise duty and COE and ERP to serve as an economic tool to control use of oil or road congestion.<br><br>With the introduction of COE and later ERP, the case for high petrol taxes has become weaker and is now seen as serving only to increase tax revenues. In fact it has become a quadriple tax after vehicle excise duty, COE and ERP.<br><br>It is about time government moderates the high costs to citizens by reversing excessive taxes in those areas which have been increased or revamped.<br><br>Do not become a pay and pay party. Rule the country with reason not persistent self-serving purposes which only benefit the governing elites as seen happening in NKF case which do not contribute to larger nation building.</div>
