The Australian<br>---<br><br>FIFTEEN years after Paul Keating introduced the superannuation guarantee legislation, Australia's superannuation assets are set to smash through the $1 trillion level.<br><br>The magic number, which is set to be passed within the next two weeks, has dramatically changed Australian savings patterns, creating a funds management industry that is the fourth largest in the world and helping to fuel Australia's stock market boom.<br><br>It has also given a new generation of ordinary Australians with a significant level of savings outside their family home and boosted careers and salaries in financial planning, funds management and investment banks - which have designed new deals to take advantage of the huge amount of cash looking for a home.<br><br>More than $150 billion in new funds has flowed into superannuation in the last year alone, with investment managers looking at investments from shares to property, infrastructure to private equity - and an increasing volume of funds now looking for new assets offshore.<br><br>The high salaries and bonuses of those clipping the ticket of the $1 trillion super industry has seen financial services become one of the best-paid professions in Australia, reducing the attractions of other careers.<br><br>The empire includes a rapidly growing $155 billion low-cost industry superannuation sector, run jointly by unions and major employers, which is challenging traditional private superannuation suppliers for both funds and performance.<br><br>More recent changes under the Howard Government have also encouraged the development of self-managed superannuation funds, which now represent more than $210 billion of the industry.<br><br>"They were huge changes," says HSBC economist Dr John Edwards, who worked as a policy officer with Keating during his time as treasurer.<br><br>"Before Keating's changes, (superannuation) was a fantastic system for evading income tax," Edwards says.<br><br>"Keating did two major things. He encouraged the Arbitration Commission to require that a certain percentage of wages be paid as superannuation and he made sure it was preserved - that it could not be taken out and spent.<br><br>"Without these changes we would still have a system where most Australians had practically no financial assets other than money in bank accounts."<br><br>Started by the Hawke/Keating government and further encouraged by the changes of the Howard/Costello Government, Australia's massive superannuation wealth has created a unique situation which puts the country in a better position than other major Western nations to cope with the retirement of the baby boomers.<br><br>"At the point where the ageing population starts to hit - which is still about 20 years away - we would have a vastly better provision that most of Europe and the US are likely to have," Edwards says.<br><br>Options  Reply<br><br>From:  Leongsam    21:28<br>To:  Wee1001 unread  2 of 4<br><br>128095.2 in reply to 128095.1<br><br>Australia should hire Ho Ching to manage the funds.
