            <div class='col-md body'>Again, lets be reminded that the number of ppl at rallys does not translate automatically into votes. Furthermore, it wouldn't be surprising so few ppl turn up fpr the PAP rally, I mean fact is we hear about their policies and politics all the time. The opposition on the other hand is a different proposition, the media hardly reports on them , if they did it's just the snipet of news about some flop or some inconcise comment on a certain issue. Thus, people are curious what is actually being said during those rallies, hence the turn out. It's worth noting too that the majority of the electorate are not present at these rallies, so it's anybodys guess who they'll vote for.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well yesterday at their AMK Rally,Mr Low Thia Kiang made a point in his speech which i think is reasonable.The suggestion is that minister's pay be pegged to a multipler on what the lowest 20% income bracket people earn<br><br>Eg if the multipler is x100 if the lowest 20% income earner earn $800 per month,then using this multipler,minister should get x100 = $80,000.If these lowest income bracket earn more,the ministers will earn more to reward them for policies well ran.<br><br>This way,it is really staying together,moving ahead (PAP's slogan for AMK GRC campaign),and not some staying together,stay the same or even move back while others who are better off and the PAP moving ahead.This way there is the encouragement for minister to really think about the poor and to help them and to help themselves too,win-win situation,and it will make these ministers to be accountable to the people for their policies and not just get rediculous high salaries month after months even if their policies turn out to be failures.<br><br>So what do you guys think of this?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>where is the sense of patriotism among ministers when they will only serve singaporean when their pay are among top CEOs.
