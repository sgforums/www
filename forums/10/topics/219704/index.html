I think SG can be divided into 2 major areas: South-East and North-West.<br><br>The South-East is the center of Singapore, the heart of Singapore. It is the main districts.

If you look at the map. Also where are the most expensive real estate? Where are the districts 9,10,11? And where is the CBD?<br><br>Im a litle worried with this development because I worry this kind of urban planning will widen the social gap especially as Singapore move forward and become a more complex society.<br><br>The forthcoming major superblocks seem to be built on and leverage on the already existing areas. I feel this is not spreading the goodies and even out to the outer areas.<br><br>Perhaps a social-harmony policy can be implemented where new developments take place nearer to middle and lower-middle class districts. This can rejuvenate the area, a kind of urban renewal.<br><br>I mean, Singapore has already implemented a policy to create social harmony through HDB and its ethnic quota system. That is an example of how physical layouts and urban planning can be used as tool to achieve social harmony. Perhaps going into the next stage, a better mix should be considered, this time not only ethnic mix but also social and urban mix.

I don't feel marginalised or anything.. but one should take a walk in those districts 9, 10, 11. I give tuition to one of the kids there, bl00dy hell... the houses there just dwarf you. Their walls surrounding their houses are easily higher than my HDB ceilings</div>
