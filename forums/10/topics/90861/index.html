            <div class='col-md body'>I believe that most ppl would agree that the current govt is more open than it is a decade or two ago. I think what most of us would disagree is the pace of opening up in the political arena.<br><br>Some ppl hope that LHL would take a big leap, but he has move forward in baby steps, but nevertheless its progress in the right direction.<br><br><strong>Originaly posted by laurence82<br><br>Heard this from my law lecturer today, who said its a popular discussion topic...<br><br>its goes something like this..<br><br>When people can self regulate (their behaviour), it means the society has advanced.<br><br>Do u guys agree or disagree?</strong><br><br>I feel that the degree of openess in the society will have to match the ppl's ability to handle it with responsibility and care, otherwise we may end up with a free but chaotic society like Taiwan. Which I feel, is something most ppl do not want.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The current situation does not really permit us to jump straight into the pool; there are still people who feel that we are not mature enough to decide and think for ourselves. One good example we saw was the recent sacking on Perfect 10: I do feel that it was an over-reaction on the part of the producers; even though he did offended the public at large with his comments, it should not have constituted a "capital" offence to justify his dismissal. That would be akin to killing free speech: he gets persecuted for what he says, instead of being confronted and made to justify his lewd remarks. Apparently, Mediacorp feels that Sheikal is unable to do proper thinking on his own, and decides to censor, instead of allowing him to make amends for his mistakes.<br><br>We need mavericks like Sheikal and Chee Soon Juan, however, the mavericks need to take a lesson on "public relations". They have progressive ideas, however they try to put it out to the public before they are ready, which creates a backlash, and does not aid development. A gentler introduction, especially to a population too comfortable with the status quo, and thoroughly opposed to change of any kind would certainly be the best way forward towards our opening up.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>THE current Radio Programme Code, drawn up by the Media Development Authority, came into effect on Feb 23 this year.<br><br>Stations which breach it can be fined between $1,000 and $50,000.<br><br>Here's what it says about sex:<br><br>The inclusion of sexual matters in programmes must be defensible in context and presented with tact and discretion. Sexually suggestive or lewd dialogue and innuendos should not be broadcast. Sexual stereotyping which can be hurtful and/or demeaning must be avoided.<br><br>The broadcast of topics related to sex should be targeted at appropriate audiences and scheduled accordingly to reach its intended listeners.<br><br>Programmes on sex education should be mindful of the target audience. They should not be presented in a sensational or exploitative manner, nor should they encourage or promote sexual permissiveness, promiscuity or unnatural sex acts.<br><br>Lyrics which contain sexually suggestive sounds and obscene/vulgar words or connotations, as well as those which promote promiscuity and sexual perversions, should not be featured nor encouraged in songs.<br><br>Copied from ST article.<br><br>Hmm.. did the DJ violate this code? If yes, nothing shd have happened?<br><br>I would think that the person who lodged the complaint shd shoulder the greater burden. Mediacorp was simply doing what it had to do.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It is a good thing to have a more open society,i think we are moving towards that area.But whether it will continue to progress,it will have to withstand the test to time.LHL has just succeeded his PM post,of coz he will have to do something to win over the support from the public.<br>The crucial part will be once his PM seat is warm enough,will he continue to progress our country into a more open n liberal society or turn our country into a living hell,that we will have to wait for the time to tell us!</div>
