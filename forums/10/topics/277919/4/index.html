He gave ALL Malays in Malaysia a dream, and he did succeed in many different ways. He deserves credit for that.<br><br>But, within the dream that he painted, he added the racist element, the anti Singapore element, what make you believe that the majority of the Malaysian Malays know how to take out the nuts and fruits from a piece of fruit cake before eating the cake? Surely Mahathir does not represent each and every Malay in Malaysia, especially the oppositions, like Anwar, but he did run the country for the last how many years, it is only logical to say that he does represent the majority of the Malays there. Besides, why no rebukes against what he said so far? He has no more power, but nobody dare to say that he was wrong?<br><br>Read what they say carefully, understand their mindset and motivation correctly, and treat them accordingly, that is being fair to them.<br><br></div>
