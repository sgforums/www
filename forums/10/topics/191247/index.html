Sydney university and Melbourne university have produced nobel science winners, so did University of Western Australia recently. If you look at the recent THES ranking - NUS has fell in rankings behind ANU and melbourne university.<br><br>I work in Australia. The Australians whom I work with are brilliant people. Don't condemn a whole nation just because of one newspaper. That would be pure stupidity.<br><br>Media sensationalism is rife here and that is the price you pay for the freedom of speech . The australian and american are arguing because they are probably proud of their nation and showing pride in a wrong way.

Their reporters don't check their facts and have an awful writing style, certainly not up to the standards of Reuters or AFP.  One of their biggest culprits is Mark Baker, who's their Asian section editor the last time I bothered to check - no self-respecting newspaper would have hired that clod as a cub reporter.<br><br>The Age counts more as light reading than as a serious newspaper, and if you wanted to read a newspaper, The Australian's a much more palatable publication (although it too does come up short here and there).</div>

There's a lot of things I love about living in Oz, but the Age isn't one of them.  Their reporters don't check their facts and have an awful writing style, certainly not up to the standards of Reuters or AFP.  One of their biggest culprits is Mark Baker, who's their Asian section editor the last time I bothered to check - no self-respecting newspaper would have hired that clod as a cub reporter.<br><br>The Age counts more as light reading than as a serious newspaper, and if you wanted to read a newspaper, The Australian's a much more palatable publication (although it too does come up short here and there).</div></blockquote>glad to read your post again,  a more balanced view on Oz views.
