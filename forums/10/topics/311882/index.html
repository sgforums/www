Staffs and boss in banks, insurance company, schools will take all our money and run away with it before we could go and withdraw it. Our PAP leaders will also take all our taxes and run away and let all of us remain here to fight for ourselves<br><br>2. The army will want to fight with the enemies. But as the majority of the money have been kapo by our leaders and they ran away, the army got no money to fight a war. We lost the war.<br><br>3. We all wait to be killed by the enemy. Even if the enemy don't kill us, we will starve to death as all our money in the banks etc have all been kapo liao<br></p></div>

              <p>If there is a war, what cause can the ordinary citizens fight for. May be Wee Shu Min will stay to fight because she is so happy being given silver platers without any proving of ability.</p>
              <p>I agree the ordinary citizens will run away because there is no worthwhile cause to fight for. For too long there is the propaganda that divides the people into talents and quitters. If any one ever complains he will be treated as grousers and brumblers with all the slogans and propagandas pasted all over to cover up problems.</p>

              <p>IF there's really a war coming to Singapore, I won't be surprised to see everyone to put on their patriotic coats and defend along side with any other Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>IT's really not about how much we loved our country, but it's about how desperate we're in looking for a fight. Living under the shadow of depression and anxiety (check out the faces of everyone around you while you're out on the streets), this war thingy gives everyone a ticket to murder another legally to satisfy our own primeval ego and nobody will ever need to turn to video games or counter-strike kinda games to feed that inner desire.</p>
              <p>All greatÂ nations are born from the fires of war, and it's the fires of war that givesÂ the citizens their identities in histories (Like weÂ all hadÂ fought against the Japanese, unfortunately we didn't...someone else did it for us).Â </p>
              <p>Plus.... Who doesn't love a fight when it's not just your own but it's everyone's fight too? :)</p>

              <p>Wow, what a tool. You can fight your guts out and in the end the PAP-in-exile are going to move back once victory is secured and proclaim THEIR success. Any war veterans are going to be thrown aside as the returning PAP attempts to 'rebuild' the country using foreign 'talent'.</p>
              <p>Yeah, being made use of by oligarchs in a giant game of chess sounds reeeal lovely.</p>
