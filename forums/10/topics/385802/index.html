            <div class='col-md body'><p>which reminds us of the fall of the nazism in germany.<br>the fascist regime was so used to repeated success that prior to the<br>outbreak of the ww2, the leaders SCARELY KNEW WHAT WAS GOING ON.<br><br>and when the end was near for nazi germany, the LEADERS having hyped themselves and the ALL-BELIEVING PUBLIC, that they SCARELY KNEW WHAT WAS GOING ON.<br><br>you see the tragedy is absolutely power is a detriment, a deadly disease. a nation ran by one man is unwise and dangerous. in the past, there are numerous examples of leaders who ruled CANNOT give power. <br><br>here you have a case of a man still in power but in the background. this was a smart move in that that ruler craftily move into the shadows. he is all over the place. out of touch with reality, he refuses to let go because he CANNOT. he HIMSELF is trapped by his own illusion and madnness. he is no torment and start acting in a terrible way. moreover, he is also fighting against time – FEARFUL of DEATH. so he intensifies his effort to make his mark even more forcefully. <br><br>by to what end? how can we make the public see through the blindness? as in nazi germany, it was the people who gave the regime the soild support. the leaders gave the word, manipulate the emotion, the majority of the people just simply followed. basically, the majority of the people are sheep. no offense but this is true. and leaders KNOW that.<br><br>Herrman Goering, Hitler’s henchman, confessed whilst awaiting trial : “ But after all, it is the leaders of the country who determine policy, and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy, or a fascist dictatorship, or a parliament, or a communist dictatorship. Voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is to tell them they are being attacked, and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same in any country.” NOTE : the Bush administration applied this principle when 9-11 was orchestrated (most likely by powerful elements within the US govt).<br><br>but in the end, as with all things, the nightmare will go away. but at a terrrible cost.</p></div>
