I have personally met with them and had the opportunity to discuss POI technologies with them. We are quite advanced in developing new technologies to combat the terrorist threat and all these are also co developed with the Israelis.<br><br>As for CCTVs and people on the ground, it all boils down to what you are protecting and the manpower level you are willing to commit. How much disruption of daily life are you willing to afford? A person on the ground who is hyper vigilant is worth 20 security cameras with 1 sleepyhead watching.</div>

Its so obvious the security people don't spend their time scrutinising the screens. There is a place in Singapore with a few hundred cameras manned by 2 people. I guess its for them to look when something has happened. But then again I guess it depends on what they are using the cameras for... some use it mostly to check movement of people at night where one change in a monitor will definitely attract attention. We have cameras that will alert people if there are changes to the scenery too.</div>

Before that she was simply lying on those trolley beds without even a pillow, while others like here were put in the same crowded place. She could not get a bed in B2, and not even all the other classes when her daughter tried to, simply because all the beds are filled up. Not even other hospitals e.g. SGH and NUH. According to the hospitals, it is a seasonal thing that beds are hard to come by during this peak period when many come down with flu and elderly with pneumonia. They were even reporting a hospital bed take-up rate of 80-90% !!<br><br>How then, can we cope with a terrorist attack, if the terrorists are smart enough to attack at a time, the "seasonal" period in the year when hospital beds are hard to come by?<br><br>I personally encountered this serious shortage of hospital beds when my father was admitted. They had to put him in isolation ward simply because there was no more bed, and my poor elderly mother had to wheel him there herself because there was "manpower shortage".<br><br>Well, there wouldn't be, perhaps, if they don't admit people without checking properly. One day after my father was admitted, he was discharged as the doctors couldn't do the necessary checks on him as the lab was closed.<br><br>Why then, did they admit him unnecessarily? Is it to milk money out of us??<br><br>Don't even get me started on the decaying standards of healthcare here.<br><br>The truth remains though, that much more has to be done before Singapore starts talking about being ready for terrorist attacks.<br><br>Don't trumpet something untrue.</div></blockquote>u forgot another thing.<br><br>ugly singaporeans these days will rush into the lift without even giving way to the paramedics carrying wounded or unconscious patients from HDB or shopping centres.<br><br>they'll also not give way to ambulance on the road.<br><br>do u think we still need a bed? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

Usually when my company ask for vendor for systems, inside our request, we specifically request for the source code that came along. The strategy is simple.

This is a very bad model as you are being held ransom. However to break from this model, can you recruit competent programmers in-house to do the job? This is crucial to breaking the ransom model.<br><br>Most sporeans can do the hardware task for replacing etc ... but when delving deep into the source code for software or even hardware circuitry within the hardware component, we find not so many takers.
