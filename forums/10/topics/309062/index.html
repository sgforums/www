              <p>From <a href="http://theonlinecitizen.com/2008/02/26/the-pap-government%e2%80%99s-%e2%80%9cbitter-medicine%e2%80%9d-prescription-gone-awry/">Online Citizen</a>:</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">By <strong>Andrew Loh</strong></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">On </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">24<sup>th</sup> January, 2007</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said the following, when justifying the increase of 2 per cent for the GST:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><em><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">“Is
              it better to take your medicine sooner or stretch it out? Take medicine
              once or two times? I prefer to make (sic) my medicine early, why? This
              is something we need to do, once we have done it, we can move on; we
              have the resources to have the revenue from the GST that we use….”</span></em><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"> (<a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/254488/1/.html">Channel NewsAsia</a>)</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">The
              PM was right in that the increase by 2 percentage points in the GST
              brought in the expected revenue for the government - $1.4 billion.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">But do note that the $1.4 billion of GST collected so far is only for the months from July 2007 to March 2008. <span style="color: black;">That
              is, 9 months, and not a one year (12 months) total. It follows then
              that the total one year collection of the 2% of GST could be as much as
              or close to $2 billion – dwarfing the initial projected $1.5 billion. (<a href="http://www.singaporebudget.gov.sg/revenue_expenditure/attachment/Revenue_Estimates.pdf">Singapore Budget</a>)</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><em><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black;">(I stand corrected on the above but as far as I understand, that is what it is. No one seem to know for sure.)</span></em></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black;">Even
              the estimate for the total GST collection for FY2007 was way off the
              mark. The estimate made last year was $4.85 billion. The revised
              estimate in the 2008 Budget is $6 billion.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">What
              was also unexpected was a budget surplus of $6.45 billion, a stark
              contrast to the $0.7 billion deficit which the government had
              projected. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Now, questions are being asked if the GST hike was needed in the first place. (See <a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/330980/1/.html">here</a> and <a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/331042/1/.html">here</a>.)</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Why
              increase GST to 7%, say that the extra $1.5 billion would help the
              lower income, that the government would run a deficit of $700 million,
              and then have a budget surplus of $6.45 billion?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">As my colleague Leong Sze Hian <a href="http://theonlinecitizen.com/2008/02/18/5-minutes-with%25e2%2580%25a6-leong-sze-hian-on-the-budget/">said</a>, this is probably one of the most inaccurate budget forecasts in </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Singapore</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">’s history.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">PAP MPs’ praises</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Yet,
              if you recall some PAP MPs’ reaction to Budget 2007, their praises were
              verging on the ecstatic. Tampines GRC MP Irene Ng described it as “an
              unprecedented new commitment”, and “incredibly generous”. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">MP for Ang Mo Kio GRC, Lee Bee Wah, in defending the GST hike in 2007, rebutted the Workers’ Party chairman, Sylvia Lim:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><em><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">“On
              Ms Lim’s criticism of the timing of the GST hike, she said it was
              better to raise the tax now while the economy was doing well, rather
              then wait till things took a turn for the worse. Using a Hokkien
              phrase, she warned against ‘looking for a toilet only when one needs to
              pass motion’, a comment that evoked laughter from the House.”</span></em><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"> (<a href="http://kwayteowman.blogspot.com/2007/02/on-budget.html#muihoong">Link</a>)</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Dr Fatimah Lateef (Marine Parade GRC) <a href="http://kwayteowman.blogspot.com/2007/02/on-budget.html#muihoong">said</a>:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><em><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">“Let
              me share with her (NCMP Sylvia Lim) that nowhere else in the world can
              you get a Budget which includes love and compassion in abundance as
              this one.”</span></em></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Indeed, the prime minister was the strongest defender of the GST hike:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><em><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">“That’s the way the PAP is – upfront – give the bitter medicine first and worry first and enjoy later on.”</span></em><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"> (<a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/245043/1/.html">Channel NewsAsia</a>)</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">With
              the cost of living increasing at an alarming rate and inflation
              breaching record levels, one wonders when Singaporeans will get to
              “enjoy” the fruits of this so-called “golden era”.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">“Growth Dividend” – really?</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Instead
              of admitting and taking responsibility for the atrocious forecast, the
              government is now packaging the surplus as “Growth Dividends” and
              claiming to be sharing the fruits of such “growth” with Singaporeans.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">The Straits Times senior writer, Chua Mui Hoong, describes it thus in the report titled, <a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/Latest+News/Singapore/STIStory_206911.html">“Budget goodies for all S’poreans”</a>:</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><em><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">“Despite
              it not being an election year, an impressive $865 million in ‘Growth
              Dividends’ will be given to all Singaporeans, with more rightly going
              to the lower-income worst hit by rising costs. </span></em></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><em><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">The
              figure is about 62 per cent of the $1.4 billion increased revenue from
              the hike in Goods and Services Tax - which means that through the
              Growth Dividend, the government is giving back to the man-in-the-street
              60 cents of every extra dollar it collected from the GST hike.”</span></em></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">I fail to
              understand, as do many of my friends, how collecting GST of $1.4
              billion and then giving back “60 cents of every extra dollar it
              collected from the GST hike” can be called “Growth Dividends”.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">It is a media
              spin which has not gone unnoticed by many – and I think senior writers
              in the press should do better. It is like, I take $100 from you, give
              you back $60 and then say I am sharing my profits with you – and having
              the cheek to call it “growth dividends” in the same breath!</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Budget deficit forecast not the only wrong forecast</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">If you think
              the budget deficit forecast is the only one which is way off the mark,
              my colleague Sze Hian offers the following examples as well:</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Real Gross Domestic Product</span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"> (GDP) expanded by 7.7%, higher than the 4.5% to 6.5% growth projected
              when the Budget for Financial Year (FY) 2007 was set out in February
              2007.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">FY2007 Operating Revenue</span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"> at $39.6 billion has been revised upwards by $7.3 billion (22.5%
              higher), driven primarily by active property market transactions and
              higher than expected economic growth in 2007. Higher collections came
              from Stamp Duty, Corporate Income Tax, Goods and Services Tax, property
              tax and various fees and charges.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Corporate Income Tax</span></strong> <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">(CIT)
              collections are estimated at $9.0 billion, or 7.1% higher than the
              budgeted FY2007 estimates. This was driven by higher profits booked by
              companies due to strong economic growth in 2006 and 2007.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Personal Income Tax</span></span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"> (PIT) collections are estimated at $5.6 billion, or 7.9% higher than
              the budgeted FY2007 estimates, in line with strong wage growth in 2006
              and 2007.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Assets Tax</span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"> collections are estimated at $2.6 billion, or 23.0% higher than the
              budgeted FY2007 estimates. This was largely due to the revision of
              Annual Values to reflect the rise in residential and commercial rents. </span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Goods and Services Tax</span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"> (GST) collections are estimated at $6.0 billion, or 23.7% higher than
              the budgeted FY2007 estimates. This was due to higher than expected
              consumption growth.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Motor Vehicle Related Taxes and Vehicle Quota Premiums</span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"> (i.e. receipts from Certificate of Entitlement (COE) premiums) are
              expected to be higher than budgeted by $0.7 billion. This was
              attributable to lower rebates paid out with lower deregistration rates
              and fewer cars with high rebate value.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Stamp Duty collections</span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"> are estimated at $3.8 billion, 155.0% higher than the budgeted FY2007
              estimates. This was due to a buoyant private residential property
              market, which saw a price increase of 31% and a 60% jump in transaction
              volume vis-à-vis 2006.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Net Investment Income Contribution</span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"> (NIIC) for FY2007 is expected to be<br> $2.3 billion, or $0.3 billion above the budgeted 2007 estimate. This is
              due to higher interest and dividend income from the investment of the
              Government’s financial reserves.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">While it
              wouldn’t be fair to expect the government, or anyone, to be perfect in
              their economic forecasts, nonetheless Singaporeans expect the
              government to admit its mistakes and take responsibility for them when
              they are wrong.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Using
              nice-sounding phrases – “budget bonanza”, “growth dividends” and so on
              – only obfuscates and do not address the problems which such policies,
              based on faulty forecasts, create for the average Singaporean.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">This is most
              obvious in the case of the GST hike last July, which even the
              government admitted has contributed to rising cost and record inflation
              since then. (<a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601080&amp;sid=aAzxmir4SLcs&amp;refer=asia">Bloomberg</a>, <a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/080225/singapore_inflation.html?.v=1">Associated Press</a>)</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Branded, non-branded, frozen, unfrozen…</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">The
              spiraling cost of living is of great concern to Singaporeans and a real
              one. The prime minister tried to assuage such fears. He had two
              particular pieces of advice for Singaporeans.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">First, Singaporeans were advised to buy “non-branded” bread on February 4:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><strong><em><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black;">“No need to buy branded bread,’ he said in Mandarin to laughter. ‘Bread is bread, rice is rice.”</span></em></strong><em><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black;"> (<a href="http://app.mfa.gov.sg/pr/read_content.asp?View,9337,">PM Lee</a>, Feb 4)</span></em><em></em></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">The very next day, the local media reported:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><strong><em><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">“House brands are flying off the shelves.”</span></em></strong><em><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"> (<a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/Free/Story/STIStory_203553.html">Straits Times</a>, Feb 5)</span></em></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Five days later, the PM had new advice on how to cut cost – buy frozen food.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><strong><em><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">“<span style="color: black;">But what you can do is to adjust, go for house brands, maybe go for frozen food instead of fresh food.”</span></span></em></strong><em><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black;"> (<a href="http://app.mfa.gov.sg/pr/read_content.asp?View,9360,">PM Lee</a>, Feb 9)</span></em></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><em></em><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black;">Right on cue, the media came up with:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><strong><em><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">“Picking frozen over fresh food could halve your marketing bill”</span></em></strong><em><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"> (<a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/Latest+News/Singapore/STIStory_206197.html">Straits Times</a>, Feb 13) </span></em></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><strong><em><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">“Go for frozen food and cut up to 50% off bill”</span></em></strong><em><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"> (<a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/Free/Story/STIStory_206273.html">Straits Times</a>, Feb 14)</span></em></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><strong><em><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">“More Singaporeans buying cheaper frozen food products.”</span></em></strong><em><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"> (<a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/330482/1/.html">Channel NewsAsia</a>, Feb 22)</span></em></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><em></em><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">And all the while, Singaporeans had no idea that the government would be reaping a budget “surplus” of $6.45 billion. </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">What the government could - and should - do</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">What the
              government could do and should do with the “surplus” is to give the
              entire $1.4 billion back to Singaporeans, and not only <em>“60 cents of every extra dollar it collected from the GST hike.” </em>With a “surplus” of $6.45 billion, it would still have $5 billion in its coffers.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">The government
              should also freeze prices of essential goods and services such as
              electricity (which is adjusted every 3 months), transport fares,
              healthcare cost, school/tuition fees, etc, which are all within the
              control of the government.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">I hope that MPs
              will be more critical and think deeper before singing praises of the
              government in the current budget debate in Parliament.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Else, the ones
              who will constantly be asked to swallow bitter medicine will be
              Singaporeans who are already struggling to keep up – while also being
              told that we are in a <a href="http://www.rsi.sg/english/25minutes/view/20070718160159/1/.html">“golden era”</a> at the same time.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">But that is another story for another day.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">“I have to make the adjustments of 2% which I think is fair and I think Singaporeans will support.”</span></strong> (PM Lee, <a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/241058/1/.html">Nov 2006</a>)</p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">So, as the prime minister asked last year:</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">“Is it better to take your medicine sooner or stretch it out? Take medicine once or two times?”</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">For me, I’d first make sure the doctor is not a spin doctor.</span></p>
              <p>————————</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">One last note:</span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"> I find it really insensitive for the prime minister to be asking
              Singaporeans to, effectively, scrimp and save by buying non-branded
              bread and cheaper frozen food, while the government’s investment arms
              of Temasek and the GIC spend billions on bailing out ailing foreign
              banks.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">In
              the past year alone, both Temasek and the GIC have spent more than $34
              billion on these “investments” – an amount exceeding our entire annual
              budget itself.</span></p>
