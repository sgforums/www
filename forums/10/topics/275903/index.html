Sg_Review<br>Aug 21, 2007<br><br>Now that most of the dust from the NKF debacle has settled, most think it is time to forget the whole episode. I think not.<br><br>The issue at the heart of the whole matter has scarcely been dealt with, and now with our fast-paced mindset, we are thinking of putting it behind us.<br><br>The case has been dealt with legally, but the heart of the matter has little to do with law, but with what is right.<br><br>The former is the letter of the law but the latter is the spirit of the law. The heart of the matter has to do with values.<br><br>Values drive behaviour, and behavior can be judged legally, but the source and crux of the trouble is not behavior but values.<br><br>Therefore, I propose a mindset change in the way we perceive corruption. Corruption is now being rigidly defined as a matter of bribes and misuse of public funds.<br><br>However, the fact that we were outraged by the NFK has little to do with the legalities of corruption but with the corruption of values in an institution using public funds.<br><br>If we don't call this perversion of values corruption we can call it decadence, and it is no less reprehensible, and all institutions of public character must be under scrutiny for it.<br><br>It is an affront to common human decency for public institutions to subvert their values, such that they become bureaucratic self-serving places of decadence.<br><br>We need an active vigilant citizenry not afraid to speak up, a mass media not afraid to publish wrong-doing and a government that does care and listen and which investigates all credible reports and not sweep things under the carpet when it is convenient.<br><br>We have a long way to go on all three aspects.<br>Kelvin Ng</div>

I find this statement interesting.<br><br>In the 1st place, those who joined the media should already have the intelligence to know how super is our media, what it is about.<br><br>I assume they understand very well.<br><br>They applied and got the job of their dreams.<br><br>They know what the business is about before they join and they do their job knowing what needs to be done.<br><br>These people know how to do their job.
