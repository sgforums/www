              <p>"GOV" are giving us the second GST credits on 1st July 08, but also increase of Electrical bill on this day.......U collect little $ from them and have to paid back to their pocket $$$$ triple or even more????</p>
              <p>We rather "GOV" dun't give us any $ becos how much they give to their citizen, they will collect back triple or even more by increasing in "TAX" ,"ERP" N "Bill"......</p>
              <p>(BU NA BAI BU NA)Right!!!!!</p>
              <p>Did Singaporean realise that when "GOV" giving so call big $$$ to their citizen, news paper will post up the "TOPS" news to the whole world telling "Wow" Singapore "GOV" giving so so much $$$ to their citizen ...??!!!. And you guys think again ,why the so call the "NEWS" paper not even report any figure amount being "TAX" from the citizen itself compare to "GOV" giving amount....??????</p>
              <p>Of course "Revenue" figure will be much much higher then "Giving" figure.........so what's the point of showing "TOPS NEWS" for it!!! Laughing stock to the world......</p>

              <p>nothing wrong mah</p>
              <p>The GST credits were supposed to help you pay off the increase in tax</p>
              <p>so in the end, for the poor who spend less, it is very beneficial, and for the rich who spend much more, they get taxed more</p>

Btw the newspaper nor the TV isnt always that accurate anymore,as they are controlled and fed by the P4P.They mostly post news that favors the P4P and their motives.</p></div>

              <p>let's put is this way .... it's only understandable neh ? ... since our goverment would never be in a money loosing business (okieeeee, that's not entirely accurate, but let's forget about temasek holdings and our soverign fund for now) ......</p>
              <p>if they are just going to increase the GST (and the ERP, utilities, transport costs, and everything else), but they'll offset it all by giving everything back to the people, then the whole exercise is rather pointless, no ? .... may as well don't increase at all eh ...</p>

              <p>if you're not happy about things, about the constantly rising costs of living, while the fat cats live it up with million dollar salaries, about your deflating pay checks in the face of hordes of cheap foreign labour, about your CPF which soon won't even belong to you anymore .... then you know what to do at the next elections, neh ? ...</p>

              <p>I agree completely.</p>
              <p>In Spore we gotta pay GST 7%, Tax, COE, ERP, even TV also need
              licence fee etc.</p>
              <p>Everything is increasing but our salary never increase. my
              friend those low to medium rank public servant pay is also
              lower than market value but but gotta pay tax as well even money
              not enuf and now no more pension or whatsoever...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My sis pay less than 30k a year, not even enuf for a credit card
              but still need to pay tax.....</p>
              <p>I like to at at Restaurant but nowadays the GST+Svc
              charge really kills me about 10 dollar already</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But I take pride of Singaporeans as they still can survive
              without complaining like other country (riot etc just bcos of
              imported meat...)</p>

              <p>oh, any decent country would riot/protest as well if you knew the imported meats contained possible traces of mad cow diseases... and they riot or protest simply because they know its wrong..the whole gov cabinet relating to the incident resigned acknowledging the mistake.. wat would you have if it happened here... 'honest mistake?' 'lets move on'? yea i bet those two sentence is etched right into the heads of newborn babies the moment they are born in singapore.. :P but then again..you wouldn;t know becuz the media of yours just prefer painting pictures of the whole wide world in chaos and unrest...whiles yours is a blissful..peaceful... not to mention robotic society.. xD</p>
