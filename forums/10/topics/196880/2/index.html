Please show respect and show appreciation where it is due. Without him is advisory role in the background, we will be in a worse situation like the infighting up North.<br><br>I believe his heart are still concern for the country and the people, the wealth of his knowledge in the world event is treasure. I prefer he stay on during for a couple years more until the present elites had gain enough experiences.<br><br></div></blockquote>The fact is MM Lee has tried to upgrade and restructure the economy for years and there is still no major improvements or upgrading.<br><br>He has not been as effective after 1970s relying too much on certain conceptual assumptions about leadership and talents.<br><br>He was too individualistic and has failed to create a sustainable system of collective leadership based on pro-people and pro-teamwork accountability to tap on mass creative and entrepreneurship governance.<br><br>His tax-and-corporatisation policy was practised to the hilt to charge the highest fees and recover every cost which resulted in accumulation of taxes into surpluses which look good to government but fail to help the people in creating jobs or relieving them in lowering the rising costs of living.<br><br>Surpluses are claimed as success but such narrow plicy has resulted in setting back our economic vibrancy with monies locked up to pay for higher ministers'  and civil servants' salaries and bonuses.<br><br>This kind of governance is not true leadership or successful government as it is not serving the people or pro-progress or creative governance.<br><br>His legalistic system of passing all kinds of laws and regulations to exert greater controls and regulations against dissent or participation only merely allows him to hold on to power.<br><br>Such legalistic governance system only benefit the ruling party. The whole system is created to benefit the governing controls and deprive the masses of level playing field to encourage mass participation in knowledge application.<br><br>The economy has been drifting sideway since the 1970s with foreign-investments being the major policy without concern for empowering the masses, accountability and transparency in whatever he is deciding and doing to the people.<br><br>He should have been more open and accountable and encourage his successor to open up to bring about creative governance with participation of the country's own talents.<br><br>Without such objective and empowering restructuring of the country there could be only limited success. His leadership centred governance could only go so far and no more and the people or economy could not hope to upgrade further until all are motivated by new policies and changes.</div>
