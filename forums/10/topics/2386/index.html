            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Geniejune:</div><div class="quote_body">This is going to take a while so please bear with me...  I need all the help and advice I can get.  My fiance is currently serving his NS in a camp.<br><br>Firstly, his Officer disapproves my fiance to report sick outside camp and it has come to my attention that the medicine provided by the campÂ’s Medical Officer is not sufficient to cure severe illnesses.  My fiance has constantly been given only painkillers, which proved to be no help at all.  He has severe kneecap (his cartilages have worn out) and ankle problems on both legs, certified by specialists at Changi Hospital.  He also has migraine and occasional chest pains.  His long medical records at Changi Hospital are proof that he is not feigning any of the above medical problems.  That is the reason why he could not complete his Polytechnic studies.  It is a great pity he had to leave but he really had no choice.<br><br>Secondly, his Officer has disapproved his stay out repeatedly, even when my fiance has had two official medical letters, recommending his stay out from the specialists at Changi Hospital.  Both letters were written by the specialists on their own accord.  Due to the lack of rest and lack of proper medical treatment, his medical condition has greatly been affected and has turned for the worse.  He feels pain in his knees even when he is standing and has lost a lot of weight.  In addition, his migraine has become more active (probably due to the lack of rest caused by the pain in his knees), occurring so frequently that he is unable to sleep well at night in his bunk.<br><br>Thirdly, when my fiance reports sick outside, he would get angry and warns him not to do that.  He demands that my fiance go to the hospital to see the doctor.  How is he going to drag himself with all the pain in his legs and the unbearable pain in his head (caused by his migraine) all the way to the hospital, and sit in the long queue just to see the doctor?  What I mean is when one is sick, the immediate thought would be to seek treatment from the nearest source possible, such as the neighbourhood clinics, then quickly go home to rest and recuperate.  It is not as though he is feigning his illness.  Then what are his medical records for?<br><br>Fourthly, this Officer Anpa thinks my fiance is feigning his illness.  Just because other people may have done that in the past, does not literally mean that everybody feigns their illnesses all the time.  For example, he gave my fiance three extras because he did not report to him by eight in the morning.  He reported at nine in the morning. I understand it is his fault for reporting late and he deserved the three extras but at least he should have listened to his explanation.  He had a really bad fever, cough and flu and the doctor prescribed him eight different types of medicine.  He took all of the medicine and was too drowsy, which was why he missed the time to call.  It is not the first time he has ignored his explanations and to think that this Officer always thought my fiance was trying to be funny, Â“pulling some stupid stunt?  He said so himself to be exact.  I mean what kind of thinking is that?<br><br>His family and I were hoping to send him to seek further medical treatment overseas after his army (hopefully we can save up enough by then), since the doctors here have proved to be really disappointing.  However, it seems that it could be too late, now that his medical condition has deteoriated so greatly, all thanks to his Officer.<br><br>It is plain to see that this Officer has abused his authority to some extent and ill-treated my fiance.  His family and I still cling on to the hope that his medical problems could still be treated in future and hope that his condition does not deteoriate any further.  It pains us dearly to see him suffer all this pain, plagued with so many health problems at such a young age.  He is not even downgraded yet for goodness sake.<br><br>Moreover, that Officer accused me (to his superior) of threatening to complain against him.  I merely told him over the phone that I want to complain against him because of the way he is treating my fiance.  Is that a threat???  Its amazing how people distort the truth 360 degrees to their advantage just to save their own skin.<br><br>I am at lost as to what to do and where to start.  I really want to help him.  Please let me know if you have any suggestions!  All help is greatly appreciated!!!</div></blockquote>my advice... from a medical point of view... submit all his medical records... MCs.. letters from specialist... and if possible... your finace directly to the HQMC... seek the help of the CARMO there if your finance is from the army and seek his advice...  if your finace is prevented from leaving the camp... ask the CARMO if he can arrange for a transport to bring your fiance to him from your fiance's camp.<br><br>On top of that... emphasize to the CARMO that the your finace's officer who has no medical training has the audacity to nullify a legal medical leave.... by a fully certified medical doctor especially a specialist...(the CARMO would probably gun down that officer point blank heheheee....)<br><br>Better yet... go to the specialist and tell the specialist (i believe they are SAF officers as well) that u intend to file a medical complaint to the HQMC and ask them for supporting letters... and pass it to the CARMO (Chief ARmy Medical Officer)... then sit back and wait... for the show to start...<br><br>As long as your fiance case is genuine... i am pretty sure that his officer would soon become a private... EVEN if his CO come to his rescue.<br><br>ABUSE by officers are not permitted by SAF... there is a standing GENERAL ORDER from the CDF pertaining to that... many officers has been demoted and even jailed for abuse of authority...<br><br>Army officers are NOT medical officers and have no authority either in the Armed forces or in the civilian sector to NULLIFY a medical certificate.... That is to say... IF the camp MO (lieutenant or captain) issue an MC... even the Battalion CO (Major and above) Brigade CO(lieutenant colonel and above) up to the division commander and above CANNOT nullify it without the MOs permission!.<br><br>BUT the first thing you must have is courage.... crush that officer like a bug and show him that you are not a pushover... DONT WORRY... small small french fry officer want to act big.....<br><br>If you are worried... DONT... go to see your MP... what is there to be afraid of???</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Oh... important point... HQMC... HEADQUARTER MEDICAL CORPS....h ehehee<br><br>HQMC is located at napier road... near the botanic garden... across the road... bring a guy friend along since u are a lady as the camp is huge and has only a handful of female staff.. its very easy to get lost inside... best got car.. else its going to be a long walk....<br><br>Another alternative is to go to SMC at SGH... see the doctors there and seek for assistance... (all male doctors in singapore are SAF officers..)<br><br>Heaven has mercy on that poor idiotic 'officer' heheheee</div>

BUT no army officer (no matter how high ranking) can nullified an MC without or prior to an MO's review...<br><br>If i am not wrong.... you can actually seek compensation from SAF for aggravated medical conditions due to abuse by SAF officers...<br><br>I cannot give you my email... cos some of the above info i provided is not supposed to be posted in public...</div>
