            <div class='col-md body'>fr LTA:   My e-mail is working again, you can send to this<br>e-mail a/c. Your<br>contact list is very good. You are very free. Well<br>done SOLDIER.<br><br>Regards<br>LTA Denan<br><br>fr huai:   Thanks for your compliments. But no, I am not very<br>free, just that it does not take me too long to do<br>something like that. I'm too efficient, thank you. You<br>can continue using that "soldier" line on me, but you<br>only have 6 more days to do that. Anymore references<br>after that day shall be politely ignored.<br><br>Regards,<br>Huai Wei<br><br>p.s. You made a mistake with your rank. It's LTA(NS).<br>I dun understand why you should call yourself an NSF.<br><br>fr LTA:   Outstanding don't worry don't let me meet you in camp<br>during our reservist period. Are you excuse push up, I<br>hope<br>not so I can knock you down  hahahaahahahahahahaah.<br><br>fr huai:   Dun worry, dear, coz I'm going to sign on in the<br>police force. Don't forget to salute to ASP hor.<br><br>fr LTA:   You sign police I sign army then we should see whose<br>rank<br>is bigger. I sign on as a captain, who knows if I have<br>an<br>honour, I sign as a Major. One or two year later LTC<br>then<br>knock it down ASP. Ha Ha.<br><br>fr huai:   Oh, but for your info, I am not staying in there for<br>long. I intend to quit after 2-3 years, then fly off<br>overseas for an advanced degree/phd, then come back<br>and work in the gov sector as a civilian. As is<br>obvious, it's the money I'm after; who gives a hoot<br>about rank. Anyhow, I doubt u can have a chance at<br>knocking me down, since I'll be back as a civilian<br>before u know it. And not a reservist in the Army, but<br>the police force.<br><br>But if all things do not follow as planned, do you<br>honestly think I'll knock it down at your command?<br>Laughing is a more likely response you will get. In<br>the end, seems like I have the last laugh. Ha Ha.<br><br>fr LTA:  Who knows in the army my rank is much higher then<br>yours, so<br>ten years down the row, you may be working outside not<br>in<br>the army but in your so call government sector and who<br>can<br>tell I may be your superior, by that time I would not<br>want<br>you to knock it down instead "GET THE HELL OUT OF MY<br>SIGHT"<br>I believe that since my rank in the army is so much<br>higher<br>than yours. I can be very "on" in doing things. One<br>thing<br>for sure you would definitely go for reservists. Come<br>on<br>you think I would knock you down, I would recommend<br>some<br>extras for you to do, as you know it is very easy to<br>get<br>extras in the army. If fact you can get extras for no<br>reasons. I think you must also be aware that I could<br>charge<br>people as well. SO BEWARE<br><br>fr huai:  Frankly, I don't know why I bother carrying on this<br>silly conversation with you, but since we've come thus<br>far, maybe I'll just give a bit more of my two cents'<br>worth.<br><br>First and foremost, u seem to possess a strange<br>tendency of putting others down. You apparently attach<br>a very high value to that rank of yours, but may I<br>remind you that it is but just a rank as an NSF<br>(versus a regular) in the SAF (versus Israel's). Big<br>deal? I don't think so. Hey, I mean, how many times<br>are you compelled enough to go home from camp in your<br>full uniform just to show your rank to the general<br>public during your NSF days? And if you do, you expect<br>the public to look at you with respect? Please face<br>reality, friend. This is Singapore, not Taiwan, where<br>armed forces personnel are treated as national heroes.<br>So with that misplaced pride on something as mundane<br>as two small patches of string, you expect others to<br>regard you with fear? Oh man, I'm so scared....<br><br>Second, I find it rather incredulous that I have to<br>remind you that rules and regulations in the SAF exist<br>for the cohesive running of the various forces, not as<br>an instrument to whit the appetites of a lone man's<br>selfish ego and ambitions. You desire to abuse the<br>rules hinges on the brink of pure childishness. And I<br>have some things I need to bring to your attention, in<br>case you face embarrassment in future: 1. Sure, the<br>army can be extremely unfair, especially in the days<br>of full-time NSF, but (oh no!) the reservist period is<br>a completely different story. There, ranks count next<br>to nothing, and if anyone tries to play stupid tricks<br>on me, don't expect me to sit back and accept whatever<br>is meted out without question. 2. Charge? Yeah, they<br>are only fines actually. Peanuts when you compare with<br>your future pay. And of course you need a heck of a<br>damn good reason to put me in the cell, if you insist.<br>And finally, you can't charge, only recommend. Do not<br>assume others do not have assess or don't read<br>military documents.<br><br>Third, I do not see any reason why you need to mention<br>about being "on". And yeah, of course I'll do<br>reservists, but not necessarily so in the Army. And<br>can you stop me from downgrading in future if I have<br>to?<br><br>And finally, I almost laughed when you claim that your<br>supposedly "Very high" rank is going to mean that you<br>will excel in the civilian work force. Naive indeed.<br>Please enlighten me regarding this claim. And please<br>tell me what you will do if I happen to be your<br>superior. As for me, I will love to invite you to my<br>office and listen to all your oh-so-interesting talk<br>about the way you treat your subordinates during<br>reservist. I'll love to see just how much joy you can<br>derive from that.<br><br>And come to think of it, it makes me wonder how<br>someone with such "articulate" use of the English<br>language can expect to rise up to the pinnacle of<br>society. Still, I wish you well. Good luck.<br><br>Yours,<br>Huaiwei<br><br>fr LTA:  Oh so you are saying that my language is lousy. Look<br>you are<br>from Serangoon Junior College which is not RJC, NJC<br>not even<br>ACJC. So why talk about language, if you are really<br>that<br>good then you won't be in Arts and Social Science. Cut<br>the<br>crap of telling me that you wanted to study subjects<br>from<br>this faculty. The fact is your results sucks just like<br>your<br>junior college.<br><br>Next according to chapter 295 of the mindef directive<br>a NS<br>officer could charge people but first have a valid<br>reason<br>and next he got to discuss it with his immediate<br>superior.<br>Note I put it as discuss because it is as good as the<br>guy<br>would be charged, the only reason to inform superior<br>is only<br>for "show". Sorry I forgot to tell you before I<br>commissioned<br>I was once out of course and was appointed as a clerk<br>and<br>all this directive stuff, I know it at the back of my<br>hand.<br><br>Moreover don't count your chickens before the eggs<br>hatches,<br>who knows that you may be earning a lot. You may fail<br>your<br>first year in University, you may get retained or this<br>are<br>possibilities that might happen. Once again don't tell<br>me<br>this would not happen. For people from RJC I think not<br>but<br>for people from SRJC it would be hard to say.<br><br>In addition just for your info if I sign on, even by<br>the<br>time I retire, I would be guaranted a place in the<br>civil<br>sector. The pay would somehow be the same as what I<br>earn.<br>But for you, you won't sign on because you don't have<br>the<br>rank, next I doubt you would have the physical ability<br>to<br>endure lastly as you are from SRJC, I doubt you have<br>the<br>capabilities.<br><br>Lastly, charge, extra duties and confinements are very<br>common among NS MEN. In fact it is very easy to get<br>these<br>punishments. So I don't understand why you are saying,<br>I<br>can't punish you. Try complaining in the army and see<br>what<br>happen. Wow, are you thinking about downgrading, I<br>think you<br>better not, becos I do not want to have a friend that<br>wanted<br>to escape reservist by downgrading WHERE ARE YOUR<br>BALLS.<br><br>I find it insulting and time consuming actually to be<br>talking to you. Yet there are some facts which I wish<br>to<br>highlight to you.<br>1. I am an officer while you are not<br>2. You may not be as successful as what you think<br>3. You can't escape the fact of having reservist<br>unless YOU<br>HAVE NO BALLS.<br>4. I do not wish to say this again I am an officer<br>while you<br>are NOT. This is already the fact which can't be<br>changed.<br>Yet what you had told me all the while was only what<br>you<br>intend to do but not exactly the fact.<br><br>I certainly hope that you must accept the fact that I<br>am an<br>officer and you are not. So what if I am a NS man, THE<br>FACT<br>IS MY RANK IS HIGHER THEN YOURS. Be in army for so<br>long even<br>for people from Yishun Junior College they should be<br>able to<br>understand that rank counts in the army so I see no<br>reason<br>for someone from SRJC not to understand it.<br><br>Regards Denan<br><br></div>
