That's how you make Singaporean citizen ultra-valuable.<br><br>Some of us are 3rd 4th and 5th generation indigenous people without substantive ties at all to their ancestral countries.<br><br>Do you think the US/Australia/Canada/South American countries or other "New World"/"colonial" countries with substantive immigrant populations make it easy for immigration?<br><br>I want to make it such that my children have unlimited freedoms and liberty to dream and pursue their dreams without excessive competition for the basics.<br><br>P.S. Basics for most Singaporeans are considerably more than what the current government policies envisage and strategize for.<br></div>

Jobs for cheap foreigne.........sorry, here i go again, i mean for foreign talents are only on a contract basis of 1-2 years. At the end, if a local applies and have the same qualifications, the local gets the job.<br><br>Not easy to implement i know, but sounds great eh?<br><br></div>
