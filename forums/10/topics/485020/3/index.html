              <p>We don't ignore the shortcomings in our society while we enjoy the good things we have. but to engage the government to open their eyes to the needs of some people in our society, we need to be more constructive.</p>
              <p>There are people in our society who are not good in expressing themself, cannot write emails or use facebook, we will do them  great favour if we understand them and speak for them, let the government know we know the people better. Highlight what can and should be improved! These people will appreciate you better.</p>
              <p>But if you don't present your case and only make noise, then what you are saying is just noise. Worse if you stay outside of Singapore, and shout, "i want more, i want more...." they won't get anything, for they deserve nothing.</p>
              <p>there are many people working to improve our society, our country, not from the ruling party, be one of them.</p>

              <p>"constructive" is not sugar coated or kissing butts in my vocab.</p>
              <p>"criticism" "suggestions" are not noises to us. But we are getting used to haze from far away places, and noises from the cars, the mosquitoes... as part of city life, but we filter them out immediately.</p>
              <p>From what is said, we know how much you know. Lots of frustrations, anger.....you need to sort them out yourself.</p>

              <p>common people, common or uncommon, we make noise, we fart, we sometimes talk nonsense, we also speak sensibly, we suggest, and we criticize....the difference is in the wisdom to discern which is which. Not all have such wisdom.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has made an application for the High Court to rule in his favour in his defamation suit against blogger Roy Ngerng, without going through a full trial.</strong></p>
              <p>Lawyer M Ravi. who is representing Mr Ngerng, disclosed this in an e-mail to the press about Mr Lee's application for a summary judgement.</p>
              <p>   A summary judgement is a procedure where a plaintiff claims that the defendant has no case and seeks judgement in his favour without a trial.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 115%; color: #0070c0; font-size: 16pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">'NO DEFENCE'</span></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In the application, Mr Lee's lawyer Davinder Singh argued that it is within the jurisdiction of the courts to rule in favour of Mr Lee at this stage of the case since Mr Ngerng has "no defence". He added that "the only issue to be determined is damages".</p>
              <p>   The senior counsel asked the court to issue a provisional decision on how much damages Mr Lee should receive. He also asked the courts to ban the continued publication or dissemination of the offending blog posts containing the allegations.</p>
              <p>   Mr Ngerng, 33, is being sued for defamation after alleging that Mr Lee had criminally misappropriated CPF savings in a May 15 blog post. He followed it up with a few other posts and videos on the same topic.</p>
              <p>   Last month, in a defence filed in court, he said that he never intended to accuse Mr Lee of misappropriating CPF savings. He also argued that the key concerns raised in his May 15 blog post, which is at the centre of the suit, were the lack of transparency with which CPF funds are managed, and the question of interest on these saving, among other things.</p>
