Just look around, we have top people in their eighties and still working!"   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The way i see it, it can go both ways.<br><br>Assume there is no CPF. Assume the gahmen couldn't care less and would rather let Singaporeans handle their own savings.<br><br>The following may happen:<br><br>1. Too many people squander their monies and are left penniless during their twilight years, relying solely on charity to survive.<br><br>2. Many people do manage their finances and comfortably retire.<br><br>Senario #1 will happen regardless; it's just a question of how many per total population. The end result is that the gahmen will have to spend more tax money on welfare benefits in the form of 'homes' for the 'homeless' and 'helpless'. Then the so-called 'dirty word' of welfare becomes reality as more and more people 'expect' such free lunches.<br><br>Senario #2 will also happen, abeit to a smaller proportion of the population. Most of these people will fall under the 'highly educated' bracket, who have enough knowledge of financial investments to grow their savings with better returns. They need not depend on the gahmen and are fully self-sufficient.<br><br>Bottomline: CPF is a great thing, but the inconsistent increase of withdrawal age is making the gahmen look unnecessarily silly. Changing the age, and then again, simply shows that the 'future planning' that MM Lee boasts of his current crop of hot-shots, has evidently not succeeded, else it has failed to account for forseeable factors that have inflated the cost of living in SG. This effectively renders the existing plan sadly insufficient.<br><br>It would seem the 'trial and error' approach is fast losing people's confidence.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In today's Straits Times (Insight Pg 33), Chua Mui Hoong suggested that Lim Boon Heng could have "slayed the sacred cow of withdrawal at age 55".<br><br>What she meant was that the option to withdraw CPF money up to a limited amount could have been removed by Lim but instead, he chose to only up the retirement age.<br><br>She also went on to say those who complained about the age increase are mostly those from the "low to median income" group. These people are very keen to use the money accumulated over the years but ironically, these are also the very people who need the money over the long term.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">That is what the CPF's system is for:<br><br>1) Partial and limited withdrawal at age 55 and<br>2) Monthly withdrawal at age 62<br><br>Withdrawal at age 55 ensures that Singaporeans may enjoy the fruits of their labour but at the same time, leaving an amount for retirement.<br><br>The withdrawal at age 62 ensures that Singaporeans may live beyond their money.</span><br><br>She also mentioned that it's a "fact of the world" that people are living longer, thereby justifying the age increase.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">According to a survery by the UN (Human Development Report 2006), Singaporeans' life expectancy at birth in 2004 is 78.9. Those retiring within the next 20 years shall still, on average, continue to die in their 70s.<br><br>Why the need to raise the retirement age? By doing so will only mean that these Singaporeans shall die before they can fully enjoy their CPF savings.</span><br><br><span style="color: blue;">Party propaganda once again. She, as a reporter is supposed to write objectively but now she is writing to further the party's cause and justify Lim's "good decision". The age increase looks inevitable.</span></div>

They will never be the one who are old and in need of work . Last time the govt also keep trying to push pple to learn chinese untill alot of youngsters were turned off completely untill one of their sons complained that chinese is too difficult to learn then they willing to simplify it . Pple can say anything they like because they are not the one involved , only when they are really involved in doing then they will take back their words . My engineers also used to pass me the companys 15 yr old van , load it with wooden shelf and lots of tools then expect me to drive it like ferrari expecting me to reach loyang rd in less then 1 hr time from tuas .</div>
