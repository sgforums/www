              <p>Tuesday, 22 September 2009</p>
              <p><em>Singapore Democrats</em><br> <br> <img src="http://www.yoursdp.org/images/stories/the-party/tnd.jpg" border="1" alt="" width="150" height="191" align="left">After a three-year break, the SDP's <em>The New Democrat</em> is back in business. Publication was stopped when Mr Lee Kuan Yew and
              his son, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, sued the party and its
              executive members for defamation over an article we published. <br> <br> But the Singapore Democrats are proud to announce that normal services
              have been resumed. Party members visited several hawker centres
              downtown as well as at HDB estates to sell the newspaper, and sales
              have been encouraging.  <br> <br> In 2006, the Lees said that a story we wrote about the National Kidney
              Foundation (NKF) scandal were defamatory of them and the Government. As
              a result they sued.</p>
              <p>The case was awarded to them <strong><em>without</em></strong> a trial. The courts only allowed the defendants to argue over the
              amount of damages we had to pay to the plaintiffs. Eventually, High
              Court Judge Belinda Ang awarded a total of $610,000.<br> <br> During the hearing to assess the amount of damages, Dr Chee Soon Juan
              and Ms Chee Siok Chin took on the Lees during cross-examination. The
              plaintiffs made an unprecedented application for their
              cross-examination to be limited to two hours. Judge Ang granted it. <br> <br> Even then, the Lees refused to answer many questions put to them. In
              the end the SDP leaders were cited and jailed for contempt of court.
              (Listen to Dr Chee's cross-examination of Mr Lee Kuan Yew <a href="http://yoursdp.org/index.php/news/singapore/519-lee-lost-for-words-audio-recording-1">here</a>.)  <br> <br> The Lees also sued the printer who was made to promise, as a condition for not paying damages, not to print future issues of <em>The New Democrat</em>. As a result we had to discontinue publishing the newspaper. <br> <br> Until now, that is. For a time, we concentrated on building up the
              party through this website. Now with the expansion of our operations
              and resources, we are able to begin our publication again and to resume
              sales. <br> <br> Party members and supporters will fan out across the island to sell the
              new-look, tabloid-sized newspaper which contains four languages. <br> <br> The exercise will help us reach out to the general public and is part
              of our campaign activities in preparation for the next general
              elections. It will also help the party raise funds. <br> <br> Singaporeans will see that the presence of the Singapore Democrats is
              not limited to the Internet. While we have been at the forefront of
              using the new media to reach out to Singaporeans, the sale of the
              newspaper will help us establish a presence in the general public
              offline. <br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br> The current issue looks at the billions of dollars lost by GIC and
              Temasek as well as other bread-and-butter issues such as the witholding
              of our CPF savings and the high cost of living in Singapore.  </strong></span><br> <br> In order to maximise sales and to spread our message more effectively,
              <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>we need volunteers. We need all the help we can get. </strong></span></p>
