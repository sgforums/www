Have you ever written an argumentative essay before. That is part of my thesis. You don't need proof for every single line you write in your thesis.<br><br>And i never said it wasn't a rhetorical question. I said it was a question, and when you probed me further whether it was rhetorical in nature or not, i confirmed that yes it was rhetorical in nature. Period. I did not retract my statements as you suggested, which brings me to my next point.<br><br>Really, you are making a fool of yourself. Go take up English class please for the goodness of humanity.<br><br>P.S. Until you start making constructive arguments which contribute to this thread, I won't respond to your replies.</div>
