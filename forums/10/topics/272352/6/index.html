As we all know both trade (or re-exported) and domestic export are considered as export. (Atobe, are you trying to be too smart?)<br><br>- I am not sure if this SHEEP has ever read any of the MTI report. If he does, he should have know now that Singapore is a net importer if we exclude the re-export trade, because most of the good we consumed are imported<br><br>- By accusing me of pretending to be an economist is just another stupid and pathetic stunt by the sheep trying to win an arguement.

If this is true, then why isnt america tweaking their budget to reduce their trade deficit with China? I got this bad feeling that Atobe is confused between Budget Surplus and Trade Surplus.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by Atobe:<br>At the 'Micro-level' - what is the use of the US Dollar - if after making the profit, it is not converted into Singapore Dollar for its local operational use ?<br><br>Even if a Corporation has a large holding account of US Dollar, when it is taken into Year End Balance Sheet and P+L Statement, the exchange loss or gains will still need to be considered.<br><br>If the US Dollar account is insufficient for the ordering of goods and services, it will have to be topped up by converting Singapore Dollar into US Dollar - and depending on the prevailing exchange rates, it CAN make the required goods and services to be either more expensive or cheaper.<br><br>At the 'Macro-level' - will a country continue to hold large quantities of any foreign currencie, if it continue to be negatively volatile ?

Lets see...<br><br>- Obviously, Atobe doesnt really know what is the fundamental difference between trading (export) and domestic export and that is why he is coming out all sort of stupid reasons.<br><br>1) For trading export, all you need is a trading office and you will be able to handle billions of trade without have the need to set up any factory, warehouses and paying GST. As such your arguement that companies need to convert their US$ income for local operaton is true (to pay for rental, admin cost) but WEAK!!<br><br>- Large corporations with significant exposure to forex will usually<br>a) Hedge their foreign currency income (just like how SIA control all their forex revenue)<br>b) Reduce forex risk by avoiding US$ transaction (e.g. switch to Euro)<br>c) Balance between domestic and export business to balance the receipt and usage of US$.<br><br>- Our country's reserved is still being kept in multiple currencies and government will always maintain that position to spread our risk. like it or not US$ is still the most traded currency in the world and it will be stupid to even try to suggest that Singapore will hold reserved in S$.<br><br></div>
