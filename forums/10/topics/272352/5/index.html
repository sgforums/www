Other factors determine the foreign direct investments (FDI) pouring into the country, size of market, penetration of new markets, consumer spending power (which is limited in Singapore by the recent increases in GST).<br><br>You don't need to single out tax holidays for comparison, because Singapore has it's own tax incentives under income tax acts and economic expansion incentives act (EEIA). We are comparing standard corporate investments, there is no need to complicate matters about all the other incentives China or Singapore has. China has a headline corporate tax rate of 33% and Singapore has a headline corporate tax rate of 20%, but investments keep pouring into China as compared to Singapore. Proves one point, tax rates are NOT the main deciding factor in investment decisions.<br><br>The headline corporate tax rate for China 2007 is 33%. What tax holidays are you talking about? Maybe you can provide some explanation? A naive person actually thinks that tax is the "key deciding factor"? I wonder if you know what is a double taxation agreement (DTA) and a witholding tax?<br><br>Double taxation agreement allows for the income earned in another country to be taxed in the receiving country (Singapore), if taxes were paid in China at say 5%, then tax credit will be given for the 5% paid and the income is subject to tax at the prevailing corporate tax rate (say Singapore 20%).

So....what "negate the effects of the extra 2% in terms of imported goods" are you talking about?<br><br>This paper analyzes the short-run effects of a consumption tax increase (VAT or national sale tax) on aggregate demand. Because it increases the prices paid by consumers relative to the prices received by suppliers, a consumption tax affects the supply of real money balances, in addition to reducing expenditures. Hence, when a consumption tax replaces an income tax so as to maintain a balanced government budget, the net effect can plausibly be contractionary.<br></div></blockquote><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Gazelle:</div><div class="quote_body">fortunately Singapore GST/VAT and income tax is still a lot lower than those countries the whiners are worshiping.<br></div></blockquote>You mean Switzerland like the VAT rates in Switzerland:<br><br>VAT rates<br><br>The VAT rates in Switzerland are:<br><a href="http://www.taxation.ch/index.cfm/fuseaction/show/temp/default/path/1-541.htm" rel="nofollow"><br>7.6% standard rate<br>2.4% reduced rate (e.g. food, medicine, newspapers, books and feed)<br>3.6% lodging services<br></a><br>Where basic necessities are tax at a reduced rate and they provide better social welfare services.<br><br>Or<br><br>Hong Kong where there is no GST/VAT.<br><br>Or<br><br>Australia<br><br>Where GST is 10%, but medical services are FREE, housing is cheaper, electricity and cars are cheaper.<br><br>Singapore government has taken more profits, duties and taxes from GST, cars, COE, HDB, gambling (4D, TOTO, Horses Racing, Football, etc), but provided no help to the common folks of Singapore. Only time when money is given out is during general elections, but after elections all the money is returned to the government with interest.<br><br>Sad to see that Singapore will sink that much further when left with only the brains of Gazelles (panty sniffer), Mat Toro (one liner explains a theory), lionnoisy (failed PSLE English) and oxford mushroom (self proclaimed doctor who knows nothing about PQRSTU) , when all the top brain have migrated to better countries.</div>
