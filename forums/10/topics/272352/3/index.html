Have you ever written an argumentative essay before. That is part of my thesis. You don't need proof for every single line you write in your thesis.<br><br>And i never said it wasn't a rhetorical question. I said it was a question, and when you probed me further whether it was rhetorical in nature or not, i confirmed that yes it was rhetorical in nature. Period. I did not retract my statements as you suggested, which brings me to my next point.<br><br>Really, you are making a fool of yourself. Go take up English class please for the goodness of humanity.<br><br>P.S. Until you start making constructive arguments which contribute to this thread, I won't respond to your replies.</div></blockquote>Ooooh, thesis.  I'm just sooooo impressed.  Now did you mean "thesis" as in dissertation, or as in the BS you're trying to sell as an argument?  I'll give you the benefit of the doubt that you've managed to scam some institution into believing that you could write a thesis.  By the way, junior, I was marking theses when you were looking for your first pubes to sprout. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Good, so you say it wasn't a rhetorical question.  We've finally got you starting to act in an honest manner.<br><br>I may be falsely crediting you with more knowledge than you possess, but you <span style="text-decoration: underline;">do</span> realise that a rhetorical question by definition presents an assertion, don't you?  In this case, your assertion is that people assume that "everyone who lives a good life is a Wee Shu Min".<br><br>Well, simple question (and it's not rhetorical) - where does this assertion come from?  What makes you say that people think this way?<br><br>Now, little Mr Thesis Writer, if your supervisor has failed to impress upon you that your starting point requires justifcation, he really ought to be fired.  The rest of your first post rests upon the assertion that people assume that "everyone who lives a good life is a Wee Shu Min".  If the assertion cannot be supported, it cannot act as a premise and therefore the rest of your first post is as misguided as you are. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Lemme put in terms that are simple enough for even you to understand.  If you cannot prove your starting point, the rest of your argument means jack squat because it's been pointed in the wrong direction from the get-go.<br><br>Now if you need it any simpler, I'll have to draw it in crayon for you and you'll have to ask Mommy to help you with the big words.  Don't trip over yourself spouting rubbish like "argumentative essays" before you even understand what an argument is. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Your little schpeal about "You don't need proof for every single line you write in your thesis" is very amusing in its sloppiness.  Sure, parts of the thesis comprise of arguments, but your capacity seems too limited to encompass the fact that whatever the arguments are, they must ultimately lead back to facts.  Did you leave your fact at home for the dog to eat along with your homework? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Just curious - what useless little subject are you writing your thesis for? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
