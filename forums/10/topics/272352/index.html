I am not an economist, but this move may bring in more foreign investment which would drive up our exchange rates and make our imported goods cheaper. In other words, this could very well negate the effects of the extra 2% in terms of imported goods.<br><br>However, all these are just theory. We'll know soon enough how this change will affect our economy. Of course, I'll be royally pissed off if this move means that the government will receive more fundings. </span><strong><br><br>Have those PAP dogs consider our situation before raising the tax, if they raise our salary at the time, i don't mind the raise in gst<br><br><span style="color: blue;"><br></span></strong><span style="font-style: italic;">As I said earlier, the increase in tax rate has a far reaching effect on the economy as a whole. It will have much effects on our GDP, exchange rate, bank interest rate and fiscal/monetary policy. Raising the tax can raise our purchasing power, or depress it. It is not as simple as raising tax = depressing purchasing power. We need to look at the macroeconomic effects of this tax increase to determine how much the citizens will gain/lose. </span><strong><br><br>long time, never meet a dick like you already, really want to flame you<br><br><span style="color: blue;"><br></span></strong><br><span style="font-style: italic;">bring it on! take some facts with you too!</span><strong><br><br></strong></div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I know so many so many RJC and HCI people who took scholarships even though their parents could easily afford an overseas education, just because they could. In the process, depriving other needy students who barely fail to qualify. Fair? Yes. Meritocracy? Yup.<br><br>And I have no idea how in the army some NSFs can literally earn 4x as much as their peers. It's national service(or slavery) for god's sake, conscription! Not a job or occupation that should pay by qualifications. Yes, there should be an incentives for commanders but most people are really sucking it up.<br><br>All hail PAP!</div>
