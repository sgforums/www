It is not money that goes to our budget.<br></strong><br><br>if the country as a whole is buying more than it can sell, unless that shortfall is made up for by FDIs, it can only mean more government spending.  so trade surplus or deficit strongly influences govt budget / deficit, as in the case of the US.[/b]</blockquote>Snow..are you certain about what you said?</div>
