At least I get some news fast from these sources.<br><br>The problem in that case is like what Dr. Tony Tan has said: lack of coordination and working as an entity. There was a breach of registration regulation in one department but it is the job of customer service or PR department to find a way to solve a problem like this - justified correction of a mistake in a more equitable manner.<br><br>Why? Because LTA does not have proper procedures or there was a lapse in solving problems all because of blind following of procedures. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

SMRT could always set up an NEL dept. In that way, there could be cost savings to be gained by consolidatiing some parts of the operation. This cost-savings would benefit commuters would it not?<br><br>However you cut it, barring SMRT from even applying to run the NEL is pretty darn incompetent.
