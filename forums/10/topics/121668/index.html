            <div class='col-md body'>My choice:<br><br>LAND TRANSPORT AUTHORITY<br><br>Perhaps the worst and most incompetent stat board to ever exist in Singapore. A list of fiascos that have transpired from within this stat board:<br><br>1. Upgrading of Bus Stops<br>Remember the fiasco couple of years back involving the upgrading of those old red rooftop bus stops?  Solar-powered fans? Advertising billboards that slant one side thus blocking views of oncoming buses? Billboards with fluorescent lights generating so much heat at night the bus stop felt like a sauna?<br><br>And mind you, all these mistakes only surfaced after several millions of dollars of taxpayers' money had been spent installing them!!<br><br>2. Nicoll Highway Collapse<br>Lives lost. Road closure for 1 year. Traffic congestion at ECP. Cracks on buildings along Beach Road. Amazing you need a public inquiry to determine who is to be blamed when LTA has ultimate ownership of the entire project.<br><br>3. Suicide of Senior Engineer<br>Just a perfect attestation to the mindset of some of our senior bureaucrats, no less those from LTA who personifies the "top management knows best" attitude.  Little people's views, no matter how valid, obviously do not count.<br><br>4. ERMS<br>Is it called ERMS? That gigantic electronic billboard that's supposed to forewarn drivers of any congestions on our major roads?  Now tell me, what's the point of informing me there's a jam when I'm already in it? Enough said!<br><br>5. NEL<br>What's that phantom station on the NEL!!? Whoa, nobody told LTA that if you build a station above a cemetery in superstitious Singapore, you are guaranteed to have zero human traffic?  Maybe they call it forward planning, I don't know.<br><br>6. NEL, again!<br>NEL to SBS Transit vs SMRT. What competition are you talking about when one line plies through estates not served by SMRT and both lines happen to be essential transport platforms for majority of Singaporeans. Don't get it? If you stay in Sengkang and want to get to Raffles Pl, you die die also must take the SMRT line because smart and profiteering SBS happened to cancel their bus services there!  So what cost-savings is there??<br><br>7. Satellite Tracking System for Buses<br>This is something I can never understand. Why do you need a multi-billion project to monitor bus schedules when all it takes is commonsense?  You know, it really doesn't take a 3 year-old kid to tell you that between 8-9 am and 6-8 pm, there will be heavy human and vehicle traffic and hence, you'll need to send out more buses. Why not give bus drivers transmission sets or gather feedback from them on road traffic conditions during particular stretches of time?  And it's a great mystery why buses in Sydney can run exactly on time, even though, mind you, there are traffic jams and buses in Singapore cannot?<br><br>8. Zig-zag lines<br>Everywhere I go, I see cars parked illegally along roads with such lines where you are not supposed to even wait!!  Bottomline: If you are not willing to enforce rules, don't bother implementing them.<br><br>9. Perpetual Jams at Orchard Boulevard<br>LTA must be idiots not to only know about the problem after it has been recurring year after year.</div>

Obviously it has not worked. If it couldn't work in the first place, why go ahead with it? Community involvement and CCA points were also dropped for JC entry. During my time, CCA points were a bonus. There are just too many policy U-turns in this department. If those bureaucrats had a sane mind, these problems wouldn't have cropped up.</div>
