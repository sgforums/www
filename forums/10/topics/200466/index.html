            <div class='col-md body'>Lebanon bombed to bits<br>BEIRUT:  Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah vowed yesterday <strong>an unrestrained campaign against Israel </strong>as his group killed eight people in a rocket attack on its third largest city and Lebanon reeled under devastating bombardment. But in the strongest international message yet to the protagonists, the G8 group of top world nations demanded at their summit in Saint Petersburg an end to Israeli military operations and attacks by militants on Israel. At least 39 Lebanese were killed in Israeli strikes as the Jewish state pressed on with the fifth day of a blistering offensive that has left much of Lebanon's infrastructure in tatters and raised <strong>fears of all-out regional war.<br><br>"We will use all means," </strong>Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah said in an address on Lebanese television. "As long as the enemy has no limits, <strong>we will have no limits. </strong>Surprises are coming. Our forces are still intact, and we are the ones who are choosing the time and the place" for the attacks, he warned. The rocket attack on the Mediterranean port of Haifa was the deadliest cross-border rocket attack on Israel in decades and strengthened the Jewish state's resolve to destroy the Shiite militant group.<br><br><strong>"Nothing will deter us, whatever far-reaching ramifications</strong> regarding our relations on the northern border and in the region there may be," said Prime Minister Ehud Olmert.<br><br>Within two hours of the 8 am Haifa attack, Israel warplanes retaliated by bombarding the Hezbollah headquarters in south Beirut, sending a thick smoke cloud over the city. Hezbollah said it had fired "Raad (Thunder) 2 and Raad 3" rockets at Haifa. A senior political source said Israel's army chief, Dan Halutz, had told a cabinet meeting that "some of the missiles were probably produced by Syria".<br><br>The United States has maintained Israel had every right to defend itself and also urged restraint over the offensive, which has split the international community and raised fears of dragging Syria and Iran into the conflict. But the leaders of Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia and the United States presented a united front in urging all parties to halt violence in a statement issued at their summit. "The extremists must immediately halt their attacks. Those extremist elements and those that support them cannot be allowed to plunge the Middle East into chaos and <strong>provoke a wider conflict."</strong> Urging Israel "to exercise utmost restraint," it demanded "an end to Israeli military operations (in Lebanon and Gaza) and the early withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza."</div>
