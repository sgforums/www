            <div class='col-md body'>as a ignorant teen i never had any idea about politics of singapore but after reading so much thread in speaker's corner it constantly give me a drill of impression of ineffective our highly paid ministers are and how ppl of foreign country's with equivalent gdp per capita are enjoying their life with more spending power while our fellow singaporeans have to suffer under wad ppl in the forum brand as the PAP regime with influx of foreign talents and prc. True enough wad they said reflects exactly wad i see everyday.. its like this forum holds alot of negative viewside of system of singapore and as a part of the younger generation after surfing this forum for some time felt that i really ought to migrate for the better...<br>with some many kids in sgforum wouldnt they grow up in sg holding such negative viewpoints throughout their childhood and finally cause a great out flux if emigration of locals and attracting them to the greener side of the world when they reach adulthood provided they are qualified for emigration to their ideal homeland??<br>ok 2cents..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree completely that political discussion has been quashed so flat in Singapore that it is quite difficult to raise a new generation of independant minded leaders.<br><br>All too often when us of the younger generation complains about the lack of freedom etc., the elders retort with "You're lucky to be born here, not [insert 3rd World Country]". Sure, we can count our blessings that we have a free market economy, fantastic education, law and order and generally all the material trappings that half the world would give a limb for but sometimes, the quality of live have to be measured through intangible and qualitative means. I fear that we are becoming a nation of automatons, bred for maximum efficiency and wrung dry of our energy to be the batteries to power Singapore to be a regional powerhouse, the hubs of all hubs (I must digress here. Does anyone not think the the word hub have been so shamelessly overused by the state media and government agencies its becoming something of a joke? Play spot the "hub" on tomorrow's papers, I bet it will hit double digits.) The concept of nationhood is to unite the people and pool our resources together to better our lives, yet it seems like Singapore pools its people resource to better her own interests (money, fame, survivor...) Thus, Singaporeans do not have much space to develop as individuals, all around us are voices telling us what to study, how to behave, which jobs to choose, where to live, when to marry/have children etc. in the name of national interest. I believe this is what my generation means when we say we have no freedom. It is not a bone-gnashing struggle between life and death ala Myanmmar, but it is just as precious. It is a struggle for hope.</div>
