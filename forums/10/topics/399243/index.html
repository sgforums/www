              <p>Jalan Besar Town Council had took an unemployed man to court for arrears S&amp;C arrears of $432!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In a letter written to the Straits Times Forum, Mr Lim Beo Thiam, a 52 year old who has been unemployed for 18 months and lost part of a leg through diabetes relates his unhappy experience with his Town Council. (read letter <a rel="nofollow" href="http://singaporeenquirer.sg/?p=4697"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">here</span></span></a>)</p>
              <p>He claimed that this is the first time he did not pay the S&amp;C charges due to financial difficulties and he was taken to court by Jalan Besar Town Council.</p>
              <p>His new debts now ballooned to more than $1,000 which included court penalties and late payment charges.</p>
              <p>“When I tried to settle subsequent S&amp;C charges to avoid a fresh spiral of hefty penalties for non-payment, I was rejected. The town council ruled that I had to settle the old debt before I could pay the new charges. Naturally, this led to more penalties as my fresh S&amp;C arrears spiked. So, I am now some $3,000 in debt to my town council,” he added.</p>
              <p>Mr Lim wrote that he has appealed to his Member of Parliament for help many times but the final reply invariably remained unchanged: pay up.</p>
              <p>He lampooned the Town Councils for hoarding extra revenue collected instead of helping needy residents like himself:</p>
              <p>“Town councils shouldn’t be surprised if residents like myself, who face tough times, wonder why we aren’t being helped via the excess revenue collected; revenue which is instead ploughed into loss-making investments. Shouldn’t any excess revenue be refunded to residents via rebates? If town councils are keen to invest, set up a fund offering soft loans to residents to tide them over tough times and pay service and conservancy charges.”</p>
              <p>His letter attracted a fresh barrage of criticisms at the government with many netizens expressing their support and sympathy for him.</p>
              <p>Wrote <strong>between777</strong>:</p>
              <p>“seems the govt is pushing the buck and trying to get town councils to make more money as it focuses even on getting town councils to recover arrears – which in these times, there are a fair number who cant barely afford to pay – but yet this is on the agenda – whereas Investments by town councils are NOT graded – and this is especially impt bec the town councils LOST some nearly $20 million in the lehman fiasco! And the govt can spent $100 million just to host a 3-day APEC Summit! which is more to a ego trip – as in all honesty such APEC or even ASEAN have all along been making alot of talk but never walk their talk – and in fact even within ASEAN there are many issues yet to be even worked on and the many barriers to free trade within the group.”</p>
              <p>Added <strong>anlibeth2000:</strong></p>
              <p>“Having a report card to monitor the town council’s performance is a good ideal but collecting of the outstanding arrears is otherwise. Whoever owes the town council are likely to be the poor of the poor. Fancy writing off 16 millions in lost of investment and here they are squeezing your poor citizen till the last drop of blood. Not only that , if for any reason you happen to owe them they will impose penalties, late payment charges, court charges, so that they are quite similar to the loan shark charges.</p>
              <p>12 months outstanding of $36 x 12 = $432. Penalties $561 plus $50 legal fees. Total to claim $1043. If these don’t work they will get a court action to seize your household items until you have nowhere to run. Yes I had personally experienced it. Forget about seeking your MP’s help because they are of the same office. (N/B The MP take charges of the town council) After auctioning your item that will not be enough they will start the proceduring all over again. One would have been better off if they borrowed from a loan shark to pay them off. However the SPF had cleared a lot from their business and seeking a loan shark is not easy nowaday.”</p>
              <p><strong>iamgoondu</strong> wants the Town Councils to accout for the fees collected and sent:</p>
              <div>“I doubt that there are residents would want to assess their town councils based on the arrears collections. We are more interested in the fees collected and spent (dollars and cents). If Holland-Bukit Timah TC can afford to lose big in their investments, they should be capable to waive the arrears as well.”</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div><strong>Stevewu77</strong> wondered why S&amp;C penalities are so high:</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>“Why should the S&amp;C penalties be so high in these times of need when the bank interest rates are at rock bottom levels. I have personally witnessed the large number of residents taken to night court to recover the S&amp;C charges. Surely, the majority must have been hardship cases and they must be addressed sensibly. Mr Lim’s letter is a poignant reminder that the policy failure at the town councils has already caused irreparable sufferings.</div>
              <p>This situation becomes even more unthinkable when the People realize the huge reserves that the town councils have amassed, enough to write off large investment losses. It means that the town councils have collected too much S&amp;C fees. Where is the promise by the MND to address accountability in the aftermath of the investment fiasco now? The People are not so forgetful.</p>
              <p>I challenge the town councils to provide more complete statistics on this matter. Maybe then, the PAP government shall be less quick to proclaim the job credit scheme a success when it is obviously NOT and faces squarely the root issue, i.e. the structural unemployment problem which has escalated over the years.”</p>
              <div> </div>
              <div><strong>2009Lembut</strong> gave a sarcastic reply to the writer:</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>“Mr Lim, after this letter is publish, you can expect a swift response from the town council. The reaction is typically defensive. They will probably state how they had tried to help but you were not coorperative or that you have not come clean on some of the points……..”</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>While the Town Councils are taking poor and needy Singapore citizens to court for S&amp;C arrears, the PAP constituencies are splurging money to make the new citizens and PRs feel welcomed including organizing HDB tea parties, treasure hunts and offering free language courses to them. A $10 million community fund will be set up at taxpayers’ expense to help the newcomers “integrate”.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Though the PAP town councils had lost more than $10 million in credit-linked investments last year, they claim it is only a small percentage their total sinking funds. In fact, investments will not even be featured as an indicator of their performance meaning that they will not be held accountable for further losses.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Listing S&amp;C arrears as one of the criteria for good performance will only motivate the Town Councils to go after residents who are unable to pay the S&amp;C charges due to financial reasons. Since the Town Councils have millions in reserves, why waive off the arrears altogether? After all, the arrears are “peanuts” compared to the millions of dollars they have lost so far.</div>

              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">In another report on the same day, “Hougang’s Low may be ‘heart’ to beat”, the Straits Times reported:</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt 0.5in;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"><strong>Government grants came up to about $111 per household in Hougang in 2004-05. By contrast, neighbouring Aljunied Town Council, which has access to funds such as the government-controlled Community Improvement Projects Committee (CIPC), got $560 per household for the same period.</strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt 0.5in;"><strong></strong></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt 0.5in;"><strong></strong></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt 0.5in;"><strong></strong></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">One therefore will have to question why the Aljunied Town Council charges more for S&amp;CC than Potong Pasir and Hougang, across the board – from 2 rooms to executive flats – when the Aljunied TC is getting more government grants than the two opposition wards.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">In one instant, a one-roomer’s S&amp;CC in Aljunied Crescent rose from <span style="font-family: Verdana;"><strong>$3.50 to $18.50</strong></span> from 1994 to 2005 – an increase of about <span style="font-family: Verdana;"><strong>428 per cent</strong></span>.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"><strong>Raising fees, penalties, legal cost, jail, lose your home!</strong></span></p>

              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Instead of charging more, how about reducing S &amp; CC for the cle</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">aner precincts instead?</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Instead of using penalties almost all the time, how about incentives to motivate people, for a change?</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">By the way, we understand that if you couldn’t pay your S &amp; CC, the penalty used to be just 50 cents or a dollar or so.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Now, we believe it is 2 per cent per month of the amount owed or a fixed penalty of a few dollars, whichever is the higher.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">2 per cent is the highest charge for all financial transactions allowed in Singapore, and only credit cards charge such a high rate.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">If you can’t pay your S &amp; CC, you are slapped with penalties. If you still can’t pay, you get a legal letter for which you have to pay the legal cost. As it’s a standard letter for which thousands are sent every month, why charge $20 as the legal fee for such a letter?</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">If you still can’t pay, you are charged in court, and slapped with a fine.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Well, here’s the paradox – if you can’t pay for your S &amp; CC, how can you afford to pay the fine?</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">If you can’t pay the fine, you may end up in jail.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">By the way, how many people in Singapore have been to jail?</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">The Town Council Act also empowers the Town Council to sell your HDB flat to recover unpaid S &amp; CC.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>

              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">In the spirit of keeping one’s promise, this new idea to increase S &amp; CC should be nipped in the bud, before we waste anymore of taxpayers’ money and time to figure out how to implement it.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Perhaps our MPs may have rather short memories, as the promise was made just about 2 months ago.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">By the way, with more than <a rel="nofollow" href="http://theonlinecitizen.com/2007/12/03/1-billion-in-town-council-funds-whatre-they-used-for/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">a billion dollars in PAP town councils’ sinking funds</span></span></a>, as well as operating surpluses – does Aljunied Town Council still need to charge more “to cover the extra work that goes into maintaining them”, as officials at the TC claimed?</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">It is high time that PAP-run Town Councils stop taking the easy way out.</span></p>
