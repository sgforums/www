              <p>This is a council, and a council also employ singaporeans and laymen and women, at the end of the day,  they also take paid. So, dun blame the council peoples, they are just doing their jobs, blame yourself for voting the wrong MPs.</p>
              <p>Some council are built to give counsel and advices to help peoples, but most council are built to count money only.</p>

              <p><br>Dear Mentor,</p>
              <p>As much as i wanted to join you to care for the poor, we also need to understand that the world is never fair. All over the world, there are rich and poor, some got 10% very very rich and the rest 90% poors. Singapore poors are not as poor as other countries' poor people. And yet our poor consitute only about 10%, who in one way or the other get to ride as free rider along with the rich and the middle class.</p>
              <p>People becoming rich by hook or by crook is up to people ability anc capability, there is a price to everything, we therefore, should not put that in our mind, if not, everyday you will get anger and frustration just by thinking of it.</p>
              <p>When you want to help the poor, help them with open arms, help them with no condition, and help them by not differentiating them with the rich, then you can truly help them. It does not imply that because of poor, which exist in every society, the very rich are at fault, sometimes, the poors are the one who make themselve poor.</p>

              <p><br>town council belongs to the governor (MP) who thru election get to sit on it, it is not a govt agency, if you look at potong pasir and hougang, they also got town council, which is not under the govt...u understand or not??? that is why town council got the mandate to invest. And that why PAP wanted to get hold of opposition ward town councils, and inorder to do it, they need to win the election.</p>
              <p>HDB is different, it is somehow govt linked, even opposition wards blocks also belong to HDB and have to adhere to HDB rules and regulations and not under the governor who won the election.
