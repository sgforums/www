            <div class='col-md body'>No doubt some of them are veteran troops.  Under-strengthed veteran units that were sent from the Eastern front to recuperate.  Most of them were above the age of 35.  They didn't have much logistics support, hardly any vehicles.  Ammunition was drawn via donkeys etc.  The Germans on the western front were seriously lacking support of any kind.  Regardless, that amount of bravery is rather unmatched.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>One small note to Atobe: The "poisonous prawn" doctrine was discarded sometime early in the nineties. That old doctrine meant that we would aim to have the forces to fight a long battle but eventually lose, exacting a tremendous toll on the opponent in the meantime. In a sense, we were "planning to lose"<br><br>Our current doctrine is to train and build up enough strength to reliably *win* a limited war. We intend to be able to completely defeat the armed forces of any potential aggressor, possibly even if we allow them to attack us first (which is good diplomatically but bad militarily). However, we do not aim to have enough force to occupy or annex the aggressor in return (which is likely impossible considering our conscript nature). This new strategic doctrine shapes our defense procurement, force structure, manpower policies and combat doctrines.<br><br>For more details, read the excellent book: Defending the Lion City by Tim Huxley.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think Joe Black made a very valid &amp; serious point. Though I personally think that their NS plans might be driven more by strategic decision to handle internal concerns, the probability of having someone mentally screwed up in his head (potential terrorist wannabe) &amp; receiving BMT is really a very dangerous potential backfire that few can effectively control cos nobody can really see whos screwed up inside their heads from the outside.<br><br>However, I think that the move may actually benefit SG a little indirectly also. Personally, I believe that if our neighbour really go ahead wif their plan, prehaps quite a significant number of their population would then choose to come here.<br><br>And since we got quite selective criterias that only allow the cream of the crop to come, this new influx is likely to bring with them assets such as funds or biz contacts &amp; opportunities into Singapore. Through this phenomena, we might actually emerge as a more economically powerful nation than we currently are. Just think, if we have their top industrialists here, we might then have access to previously unknown detailed knowledge of their domestic market conditions, the whereabouts of natural mineral rich resource locations, etc... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>

The point is, are our men willing to fight to the end SHOULD the circumstances arise.<br><br>The Major did not charge foolishly to die like the stupid japs.  He gathered remaining forces, and skillfully struck at the rear of the Canadian forces.  Ultimately taking the command tent.  His under-strengthed unit had already lasted longer than normal.

THAT's what motivates soldiers to fight at the end of the day.<br><br>the bottom ine therefore, is not whether soldiers are brave enough to fight tenaciously to protect their homeland, but whether they're cowardly and stupid enough to just sit there and let the enemy use them for target practice.<br><br>i honestly do not see surrendering to a bunch of rabid malaysians to be a viable option when there is a fair chance that u could tear them to pieces and toss their remains into the gutter.<br><br>i, as well as many others have said this before: better to fight to the death than live on your knees.<br><br>the alternative to destroying the enemy is the enemy breaking into your house, burning it down and killing, possibly raping your mother, sister, wife and daughter.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"></div>
