            <div class='col-md body'>Recently the Malaysian government have planned to implement NS in their country. What is the possible impact of such an action to the neighbouring countries in particular,Singapore? I can't help but wonder if they are copying our defence strategy,as we are the only country in ASEAN which had already implemented this.Comments is welcomed from both Singaporeans as well as Malysians. Last but not least, NO flaming please! Thanks. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It is likely that they are doing this because they feel threatened by being caught between two regional military behemoths -- Thailand and Singapore. Also, I think they feel that they need to increase security manpower as a response to the terrorism that seems to be sweeping our region and to be prepared in case of possible disintegration of Indonesia.<br><br>It is also true that NS has had good effects on the national character in Singapore. It has helped countless boys turn into men (I wish it would turn whiny girls into women too, but that's a different discussion) It has also fostered national unity. Believe it or not, Malaysia is NOT a very united nation despite being more racially and religiously homogenous that Singapore. In particular the economic divide between East and West Malaysia has been growing wider. I believe that they feel that some form of NS might help to reunite the nation.<br><br>In addition, I feel that this indicates that Singapore's policy of military deterrence is starting to backfire. There is a difference between deterrence and aggression. When you grow too strong, you no longer deter, you THREATEN. There have already been a few incidents where we have pushed them back diplomatically with veiled threats of military force. I think that Singapore and Thailand have grown so strong militarily that it has sparked off an arms race in the region. This is not good. No real way to fix this or back out now, but I don't like the way things are heading.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The implementation of NS into Malaysia poses serious complications to Singapore's defence strategy. First and foremost, one of our major strengths over the MAF is our quantitive superiority in men and armanent. The recent purchases by the Malaysians, as mentioned by dkhoo, was aimed at negating the effectivness of the latter, while NS is directed at leveling the playing field with us, in terms of personnel. With universal conscription, the MAF could potentially swell to hundreds of thousands during war.<br><br>In short, the SAF could be facing a larger, more well-equipped enemy if it tries to invade Malaysia.<br><br>I hope that the government sits up, takes notice of this, and introduces conscription for women.<br><br>Joking lah  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>From reliable sources, malaysia version of NS is not like the drafted Singapore or Israel one. Their's would probably be a year or a half, their training will be less military prone, more like some kind of "boy scout" camp, singing songs and field camps, some basic weaponary (M16 rifles) training plus lots of drills to forge racial harmony and enforce self discipline which they really lack, more like civil defence cum para-milita type of forces where you find tons of them in Indonesian. After the training whacking their boys to  become man, they will become civilians and say bye bye to regimental life forever. Unlike Singapore where you still have to serve 13 years of reserves, frequent in-camp trainings plus IPPT to ensure you are in shape.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Typhoon, I take that as an insult to the NCC, hah, When you come home I'll make sure that you'll never get to see NCC Cadets running around S'pore or anything else! Anyway, the like all of the above reasons, another factor would be economic growth, where the hell do you think Malaysia is fill up all the places of men who are going to NS, it might cripple their economy. Also, in the modern battelfield, it is not how many men you've got but how many NUKES you've got <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

Muslim extremists will get "free" military training.<br>2. It is also a good breeding ground for muslim extremists to recruit semi-trained NS men.<br>3. Give some states the incentive to break away from the federation (in extreme cases). You got your population with some basic military training and maybe weapons to go with... dangerous proposition.<br>4. lead to false sense of military strength. The sayings go... a little knowledge is dangerous... more so with military training.... may give trouble to neighouring countries.<br>5. Deem to fail if the objective is to promote "patrioism". It is better to learn from Singapore, China or the US. Sing more "Count on me Malaysia" songs and maybe you will get your next generation to be better patriots.<br><br>These are just some of my personal opinions... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
