              <p>Wtf. One small country need so many ministers. DUn u find it strange? Knn, if we have the size of america. I suppose we are going to have around 3000-4000 minister and minster of state. WTf, everything they in charge. Normal MP do what. Zhuo bo lan is it.</p>
              <p>Somemore pay also so high. They reduce to 3000-4000. Maybe i vote them back.</p>

              <p><strong>The Reform Party Responds to PM Lee’s Cabinet Reshuffle</strong></p>
              <p>We note the announcement by PM Lee today of changes to the Cabinet*.<br> While it is good that the PM has owned up to the urgency of the need for
                   change, it is clear that the PAP is at a loss where to go from here. 
                  The problem is not with the personnel at the head of each Ministry or 
                  department but with the policies themselves.  This cabinet reshuffling 
                  of the same old figures is not rejuvenation and the same old line up 
                  wearing different numbered jerseys can only lead to stagnation. The PAP 
                  is wedded to its old policies which are failing, have failed or are 
                  simply not delivering for Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>The PM is quoted as saying “I wanted a fresh start, and that’s why 
                  I’ve gone for a radical change”. But this election we witnessed the PAP 
                  put up its weakest slate of new candidates for many years. It is clear 
                  that our ruling party has run out of ideas.  As I said at the RP’s final
                   rally on 5th May 2011, if The PM really wants a change we would advise 
                  him to pinjam some policies from the first new and fresh political Party
                   to contest an election in Singapore for over 20 years.</p>
              <p>http://youtube/f1RSMUm3ahY  Minutes 7:10 for ‘pinjam’ comment.</p>
              <p>Making Mr. Wong Kan Seng, Mr. Mah Bow Tan and Mr. Raymond Lim the 
                  sacrificial lambs does not change the fact that their Ministries’ 
                  failures are the responsibility of the entire government. Also if Mr. 
                  Lee Kuan Yew and Mr. Goh Chok Tong are stepping down, why have they been
                   appointed as senior advisers to GIC and MAS and Mr. Goh given the title
                   of Emeritus Senior Minister? After the PM’s comments about the PAP 
                  having a monopoly on talent in Singapore, so that there can only be one A
                   Team, it is surprising that the government cannot allow them to enjoy 
                  their retirement. Furthermore we feel that the voters of Marine Parade 
                  and Tanjong Pagar have a right to feel aggrieved that the ministers and 
                  senior ministers they voted to keep in before the election,  stepped 
                  down straight after the election. If I bought stock in a company heavily
                   promoting its directors and the day after my purchase the directors 
                  stepped down, I would be aggrieved.</p>
              <p>We are seriously concerned by the fact that several Ministers are now
                   running more than one ministry after this reshuffle.  This should be a 
                  wakeup call to the people of Singapore as it smacks of desperation. (Mr.
                   Tharman acting as DPM, Finance and Manpower Minister and Mr. Shanmugam 
                  as Law and Foreign Affairs Minister) This, more than any other factor of
                   the reshuffle shows that the government simply lacks enough talented 
                  players. How can we hope for any fresh ideas or talent to emerge from 
                  the PAP when they occupy 81 of the 87 seats in Parliament in a top-heavy
                   and extremely expensive structure yet still need to double up?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Failed and failing PAP policies include:</strong></p>
              <p><br> •	An outmoded economic growth strategy which boosts the incomes and 
                  employment of Non citizens and their home economies rather than the real
                   incomes of Singaporeans.</p>
              <p><br> •	A housing policy derived from Socialist-era Britain that keeps 
                  Singaporeans in almost serf-like dependence on the government rather 
                  than allowing them to actually own their own property and live where 
                  they want. At the same time, in an effort to win votes and boost the 
                  asset side of the government’s balance sheet, the government has 
                  embarked on an irresponsible so-called asset “enhancement” strategy of 
                  deliberately driving up prices. This both puts the first rung of the 
                  property ladder out of reach of young Singaporeans and will have severe 
                  consequences for the real economy when the bubble bursts.  There will 
                  not be nor ever be a fat middle class in Singapore with this housing 
                  policy but instead only a spread of the sandwich classes.</p>
              <p><br> •	A “forced saving” policy (CPF) appropriate to earlier stages of 
                  development where the goalposts are regularly moved without Singaporeans
                   having any choice in the matter.</p>
              <p><br> •	A healthcare policy which deters Singaporeans from seeking early 
                  treatment for many serious illnesses because of high fees and leaves 
                  them facing financial ruin if they develop a life-threatening or high 
                  maintenance chronic condition.</p>
              <p><br> •	An economy which is controlled to a large extent by GLCs and where 
                  Singaporeans pay higher prices than they need to for many basic 
                  utilities and public transport because of lack of competition and/or 
                  effective regulation.</p>
              <p><br> •	A non-transparent process of accumulating chronic government surpluses
                   (of the magnitude of over $100 billion over the last ten years 
                  excluding surpluses from Temasek and GIC and profits from land sales) 
                  without justifying why such large savings are necessary and whether or 
                  not a large part of them can be prudently returned to the people in the 
                  form of lower taxes or higher spending or dividends.</p>
              <p><br> •	Not one but two Sovereign Wealth Funds whose asset valuation and 
                  investment policies are opaque and whose ultimate purpose is unclear. 
                  Singaporeans should properly be given transparency and accountability. 
                  Indeed The Reform Party calls for them to be given a stake as it is 
                  their savings and hard work which has financed this accumulation.</p>
              <p><br> •	A Defence Policy which relies on an amateur conscript force. This 
                  labour comes only from male Singaporeans (but not male new citizens) who
                   are then not equitably compensated for their economic sacrifice.</p>
              <p><br> •	Restrictions on the rights and liberties of Singaporeans which insult 
                  our intelligence and reduce us to the equivalent of a subject people in 
                  our own county.</p>
              <p><br> •	Restrictions on the rights to freedoms of speech and expression which 
                  reduce Singapore to the level of a Third World developing or 
                  authoritarian state.</p>
              <p><br> •	Obscenely high pay for Ministers which appears to be negatively correlated with the quality of their performance.</p>
              <p>When The Prime Minister has finished moving his pieces around he can 
                  find some new ideas and our policy proposals here:

              <p>LKY, GCT, all bowed out, WKS, MBT and RL were probably asked to leave in recognition of the mistake they made. The newly elected, including the WP are all quiet and leave the new cabinet to work out what is necessary. Changes in policies are very likely but will have to take its course.</p>
              <p>But how interesting those who couldn't even form a party big enough to challenge the ruling party in the election, couldn't even come up with a proper party manifesto,  (let alone winning a single seat in the election) are so quick in assuming the role of advisor telling the elected what to do, or they think they can do a better job? Now it is not what should be changed, it is what should be the new policies!</p>
              <p>The people of singapore are waiting to see how the new cabinet will perform, how the opposition party elected into the parliament can speak for the people and make a difference. Those who have lost will have to work double hard to show us why they deserve more votes to make a difference, the next time. Talk a lot won't make any difference.</p>
