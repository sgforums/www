            <div class='col-md body'>I think you think too much. PAP's style, although not well-liked, are always pretty visible. PAP will sue them bankrupt; not plant spies. It's a waste of time and risky. If after a period of time of working with WP and the spies like them, PAP will be gone case.<br><br>Also, to clarify this:<br><br><blockquote>I am wondering that, PAP knowing that by increasing GST, their salary they might loose alot of votes.But they still risk doing it.</blockquote>They didn't risk it. It's not a bet. If you heard their reasoning for increasing GST, you would know why Singaporeans would still vote for them.<br><br><blockquote>I dun know if Mr Low was <strong>bride</strong> by the PAP.</blockquote>The word is "bribed", not bride. Bride is a human, dude.</div>
