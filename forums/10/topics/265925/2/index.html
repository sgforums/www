But is<br>this assumption proven. No doubt there may be cases of negligence among the<br>people but was the latest outbreak caused by such habits?<br><br>I feel that the key issue here is how the ministries and the government<br>should coordinate and take serious preemptive measures to deal with a<br>problem of such nature.<br><br>It is pertinent perhaps at this stage of evolvement to a more inclusive and<br>caring society that various ministries and the government as a whole should<br>tackle issues and problems holistically. In the past, it would appear that<br>there has been manoerving of issues and problems with legalistic wrangling<br>of laws and regulations on the assumptions or presumptions that someone is<br>at fault and to pass certain duties and responsibilities to citizens.<br><br>Over the years, we have already seen too many such laws and regulations<br>passed on presumptions of such nature with penalties imposed on citizens for<br>its own negligence and inefficiencies from HDB's own poorly designed<br>windows, lack of structural checking on buildings to illegal immigration<br>where old lady landlords were presumed guilty of habouring illegal to<br>mosquito breeding attributable to insufficient preemptive measures by NEA.<br><br>It is my humble view that government should take on the larger role of<br>looking into all problems holistically and solve them by preemptive measures<br>instead of legalistically passing more laws and regulations to presume<br>responsibilities by citizens to solve problems.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi TS,<br><br>Ur theory is interesting and may be plausible...<br>However, the ACTUAL fact now is that Singapore govt is being over-controlled by PAP and we need to bring a balance to that....<br><br>So for the next coming election, I shall vote for the opposition regardless who runs in my area..It depends not on their ability to actually run the govt or not but just to lower the power wield by PAP a bit...<br><br>Based on recent news, even an EX-Army officer can become MD of Temasek..That goes to show that PAP does not actually need professionals to run the govt or investment firm...Any Tom, Dick and Harry will do... Hence, if Singapore has been prospering for the past decades with Tom, DIck and Harry running the govt, any opposition can also do the job well ...<br><br>So at the moment, I am not that worried about the WP or PAP spies... Rather, I am more worried abt the current arrogance of the PAP who actually dared to raise their own salary and push through so many policies without giving a thought to the outcries of the citizens. Once a balance has been brought to the politics, then perhaps can we look into the finer details of whether is our govt of PAP and opposition parties is competent enough to bring our country forward to a prosperous future...<br><br></div>

I believe she said something along the line of someone needs to oppose the current govt that's overpowered, and why not her? Someone needs to help the suppressed.<br><br>I can't quote exactly what she said, since it was quite some time ago, but i could see from her expression that she was serious in wanting to help. Why else would she step down from her teachings before the elections, just because she didn't want to get tp implicated?<br><br>And regarding these spies, who's to know?
