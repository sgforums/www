I would not say exactly so. As it is, I have made several points about where the government has not done right. But yet, it is also true that this government is not always wrong. There are too many baseless negatives comments made about the government. And I feel I need to correct that whenever I feel it otherwise. In this case, your remark of government using excuses about Singaporean not wanting to be cleaner is one where I am doubtful about it just being an excuse. It could very well be the truth.<br><br>Despite that, I do not disagree with you that the government could have done more to help the employment situation in Singapore. It is the only adding of the above remark that I disagree with.<br><br>I am tolerant towards different opinion. But I am not tolerant of baseless attacks and blaming. The one thing I always hate to see is when people concentrate their effort on blaming then building. Hence, the common phase Â– Â“blame stormÂ” to ridiculed Â“Brain stormÂ” session. Perhaps, I am trying to just bring about the balance here, where blaming seems to be the more common approach. Probably, I overrated myself<br></div>

Yes, it could be necessary 4 S'pore's economic growth, in order to face today world's tough competition. Or probably there are also other reasons.<br><br>However, not only low paying jobs like cleaners, there are many average paying jobs like clerial or administrative jobs have been taken by foreigners. esp. Malaysians or other asian. (nothing against them).<br><br>I jus find it quite disheartening that some of those wif work experienced, but older Singaporeans whom have dip or degree end up looking 4 jobs like drivers, fast food counter staffs &amp; so on.(understood if the economic is really bad &amp; no choice) but not to 4get that there are many "high paid foreign talents" also wif degrees.

Average pay for cleaning job is abt $800 compared to $1000 in factory. End up only old ppl with no other skills or choices will take up these jobs.<br><br>Nowadays most cleaning work is tendered to contractors. The contract amt may be enough to give workers a better pay, but to maximise profits, contractors turn to foreign workers. Restricting number of foreign workers in these sectors will forced the contractors to hire local workers at more competitive rates.</div>
