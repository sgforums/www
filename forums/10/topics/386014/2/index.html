              allow you to take HDB and you gain from selling yr condo. In

              <p><br>I believe susbidy in study does help people to decide on child birth.  It would be good if govt can provide subsidy for polytechnic education.   </p>
              <p>So far feedback from those not willing to give birth or give birth to more babies is costs of living is too high.    We cannot control the constant rise in the costs of living only the govt can.</p>
