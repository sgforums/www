              <p><span><span class="update">By S Ramesh, Channel NewsAsia | </span><span class="update">Posted: 25 December 2009 1441 hrs </span></span></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: 32,630 babies were born in Singapore in the first 10 months of this year, far short of the 50,000 needed to replace the population each year. <br><br>That's according to figures obtained by MediaCorp from the Registry of Births and Deaths. <br><br>For the whole of 2008, 39,826 babies were born in Singapore. <br><br>Singapore has had three marriage and parenthood packages so far, the most recent one in 2008. <br><br>Despite such efforts, Singaporeans are not replacing themselves. <br><br>Sociologists argue that one important reason for this lack of improvement is the state of the economy. <br><br>Said Dr Chang Yau Hoon from the School of Social Sciences at the Singapore Management University: "A lot of family planning decision is being made based on the economy, like whether a person can keep their job, maintain their job. Their salary over the couple of years would be a main determinant. <br><br>"Inflation....whether there would be an expected rise and the cost of living. They would want to ensure they can provide for the family and provide a good education (for their children). <br><br>"(They would consider) whether in their particular occupation, they need mobility, especially for women.....then, they may delay having babies." <br><br>Hence the need for Singapore to bring in new citizens to make up for the low birth numbers. <br><br>Dr Chang said: "I don't actually see a correlation between the influx of foreign migrants and people's decision to have more babies or not. At the end of the day there is only so much that social engineering can do. A lot of the decisions for family planning are big long term decisions and it would have to come from peoples' confidence over the years towards the future." <br><br>The falling trend is also evident from the number of births at Singapore's largest hospital for women and children. From January to November this year, 11,069 babies were born at the KK Women's and Children's Hospital. <br><br>The figure for 2008 was 12,535. <br><br>But some private hospitals like the Thomson Medical Centre have recorded an increase in the number of babies born at their premises. Some 8,900 babies were delivered there so far this year, compared to 8,567 births last year. <br><br>- CNA/ir</span></p>

              <p>Part of the problem is contributed by the ruling party.    They keep increasing the costs of living and make it so difficult or impossible for families to have babies or more babies.     </p>

              <h1>Shortage of babies in Singapore this year despite government incentives</h1>
              <div class="date">
              <div class="dateleft">
              <p><span class="time">December 26, 2009</span></p>
              <p>Despite government incentives to boost Singapore’s flagging birth rates, Singaporeans are still not producing enough babies this year.</p>
              <p>According to figures from the Registry of Births and Deaths, 32,630 babies were born in Singapore in the first 10 months of this year, far short of the 50,000 needed to replace the population each year.</p>
              <p>39,826 babies were born in Singapore in 2008.</p>
              <p>Sociologist Dr Chang Yau Hoon from the School of Social Sciences at the Singapore Management University felt that the state of the economy is a key reason deterring couples from having more babies.</p>
              <p>When interviewed by CNA, he said:</p>
              <p><em>“A lot of family planning decision is being made based on the economy, like whether a person can keep their job, maintain their job. Their salary over the couple of years would be a main determinant. Inflation….whether there would be an expected rise and the cost of living. They would want to ensure they can provide for the family and provide a good education (for their children).”</em></p>
              <p>The CNA article defends “the need for Singapore to bring in new citizens to make up for the low birth numbers.” However, immigration is only a stop-gap measure which does not address the root cause of the problem and may create another one in the process.</p>
              <p>A key reason for the low birth rates is the high cost of public housing in Singapore. While the prices of HDB flats has more than tripled in the last decade or so, the median wages of ordinary Singaporeans have not kept pace with it.</p>
              <p>Young Singapore couples are finding it harder to afford a home of their own, let alone start a family. The price of resale flats hit a record high in June this year.</p>
              <p>Despite evidence showing otherwise, HDB continues to insist that public housing is affordable in Singapore. Government ministers even claim that rising asset value helps to create wealth for Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>The situation is exacerbated by the relentless influx of foreigners into Singapore which contributes to inflation, especially that of properties.</p>
              <p>According to the Home Affairs Ministry, there were over 20,000 new citizens and 90,000 PRs in 2008. Foreigners now make up 36 per cent of the population, up from 14 per cent in 1990.</p>
              <p>In a recent interview with the National Geographic magazine, MM Lee Kuan Yew said he did not care less if Singaporeans are unable to compete with the newcomers:</p>
              <p><em>“Over time, Singaporeans have become less hard-driving and hard-striving. This is why it is a good thing that the nation has welcomed so many Chinese immigrants. </em><em>If native Singaporeans are falling behind because the spurs are not stuck into the hide, that is their problem,” </em>he quipped.</p>
              <p>With such a mindset in the officialdom, it is little wonder that Singaporeans are not keen to have more children. After all, who will want to bring up their children in a country which offers no security or benefits to them.</p>

              <p>And thus the government opines that bringing in foreigners would help to solve the problems caused by the lack of a younger generation covering up gaps left by the older generation..is that truly a permanent solution?</p>
