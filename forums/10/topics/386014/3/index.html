              <p>I do  hope Singaporeans can seee thru this bluff and charade put up by the local media and the incumbent party - aiyah, firstly, it is simply to justify the policy of FT and immigration policies that works in their favour and to foreigners.</p>
              <p>Secondly, it is build up a base for the eroding support - which they  know and now they have sought 'means' to circumvent and indirectly benefit from them.</p>
              <p>What is sad is that Singaporeans have been given short shrift to views and grievances that affect their lives.</p>
              <p>All in all it shows what politics is all about - prostitution of ... to achieve or perpetuate power.</p>
              <p>There is no corrupt politician, one is inherently corrupt - hence the desire to entire politics (all forms) to give it full play!!!</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>In my humble opinion, the reason why the birth rate is low can be summarized as follows:</p>
              <p>1. expensive housing</p>
              <p>2. expensive cost of living / women need to work / need double income / need career</p>
              <p>3. lack of maternal leave program (women are worried they will be left behind)</p>
              <p>These factors consitute more than 90% of the reason, in my estimation.</p>
              <p>More accurate analysis can be gotten from focus group interviews and data mining.</p>
              <p>However, I am confident the results will be more or less pointing to that same general direction.</p>
              <p>Thus, to promote a healthier birth rate, the solution is simple, the society must find answers to remove those factors.</p>
              <p>I think such things must be considered:</p>
              <p>1. Baby bonus is a failure because it doesnt solve anything. A little bit of money which doesnt cover housing cost, doesnt cover the female's lost income, doesnt cover the need for child-rearing help, doesnt cover the lost career advancement in the female's company, and so on. A total failure by some lazy bureaucrat who cant be bothered to think of deeper solution.</p>
              <p>The solution must be targetted and must solve the root fundamental problem.</p>
              <p>Thus, I recommend the following.</p>
              <p>1. Housing must be made cheaply and abundantly. Regulation must be relaxed or tweaked which encourage young couples to purchase their housing, early and easily.</p>
              <p>2. Child-rearing help must be promoted and spread. Nowadays there are many tuition centres, but few day-care. Remember, the women want to get back to work, they dont want to lose too much time. They need quality and affordable childcare centres, and lots of them spread everywhere, accessible.</p>
              <p>3. Maternity leave program, and even faternity program in companies must be reviewed again, conduct focus group interviews and restructure it. It must be made attractive, real, and pertinent.</p>
              <p>Thus, if these 3 solutions can be implemented with vigor, I am confident the birth rate will rise to a healthier and more sustainable level.</p>
              <p>Now, I see there is no general thrust, no political will, no leadership, no bold vision, everyone at the top is lazy. They just say society has changed, nowadays people have new values. But they dont bother to investigate further, what exactly has changed, what factors have changed, and how can they be ameliorated, to create a more condusive environment to promote child rearing.</p>

              <p>The majority of Singaporeans no longer have the mentality that they need a child or children to depend upon when they grow old.</p>
              <p>They no longer believe that more children the better as their parents and grandparents believe.</p>
              <p>If the government wants more babies, the government has to look after the needs of the babies from birth to 18 years old as many developed countries have already done that eg Germany.</p>
              <p>Alternatively, the government can keep on importing teenager and adult foreigners to meet the country's economic,defence and social needs lor.</p>

              <p><br>Giving birth and decendent transition is a natural process of all living things including virus and bacteria. Ants produce as much as they can, virus take over as many hosts as they can, and some other like salmon can die for the sake of carrying on their roots and decendents. So, it is sad to see we as humans are not producing?? and not only that, we destroy forest and lakes and seas to build luxury stuff at the expense of other living things progression.</p>
              <p>And now here, you can tell me about govt policies, mentality problems, defences and those social shits, aren't we part to the living evolution. When all living things are struggling to produce in whatever condition they are in which include even ending their life to produce and protect their youngs, we, as human should be ashame of ourselves for not producing just becos of some stupid govt and society conditions, more worst, humans throw their babies around in rubbish bins, drains and even in toilets.</p>
              <p>I think it is about time i call upon my lord, ah Jesus, to end this human race.</p>
