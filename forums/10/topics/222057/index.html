            <div class='col-md body'>I believe it is good to hear how much freedom of speech in Singapore has. I seriously wonder why the government need to suppress opposition parties to this level, is it because they are hiding alot of dirty skeletons in the closets in the PAP, or is it because the opposition parties are speaking the truth and someone is scared that they would be exposed? Sometimes, I feel that Singapore is not a democratic society, it feels almost like tyranny and dictatorship. The more they suppress, the more people will fight back, it's only a matter of time when the people will start to win the battle.<br><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnLqpYupQfg" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnLqpYupQfg</a></div>
