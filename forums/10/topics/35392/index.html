            <div class='col-md body'><br><br>DR MAHATHIR Mohamad on Friday said that Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong's 'nostalgic' feelings towards the Causeway had blocked a plan by both countries to build a bridge to replace the 80-year old road link to Johor.<br><br>The Malaysian Prime Minister said Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew told him in a private meeting that while Mr Lee was acceptable to the idea, the project could only go ahead after Mr Goh retired.<br><br>Advertisement<br><br>Dr Mahathir told more than 5,000 people during a day trip to Johor Baru: 'He said Goh Chok Tong has a nostalgia about the Causeway. So he said we can build the bridge after Goh Chok Tong retires.'<br><br>The Malaysian leader said this was the first time he was revealing the contents of his private discussions with Mr Lee on the road-bridge plan.<br><br>He said he was forced to do so for two reasons. One was the recent release of private letters between him and Mr Lee on the water negotiations, which had angered Malaysia.<br><br>The second reason was that he also did not want to be accused of not seeking Singapore's cooperation before going ahead with the project, which is expected to be ready in 2007.<br><br>'I tell you sincerely, by Allah, this is what he told me, I am not lying. He said we build the bridge after Goh Chok Tong retires and there won't be a nostalgic protest. This is what he told me.<br><br>'I feel very sad because the number of vehicles that cross the Causeway has risen dramatically, we cannot wait until Goh Chok Tong retires,' he said.<br><br>Dr Mahathir was speaking at the project site on a one-day visit to Johor.<br><br>The project is part of the Integrated Southern Gateway complex that includes a train station and customs, immigration and quarantine facilities, and road links.<br><br>It has been estimated to cost RM2 billion, with the bridge and railway line across the Johor Straits alone coming in at RM1 billion.<br><br>Singapore has said previously that it sees no compelling reason to tear down the existing Causeway and that the project on its side of the border would be costly.<br><br><br><br>Just when u tot it was safe to cross the causeway......</div>

I think we will be wasting our time if we respond because we have better things to do.<br><br>'Let them say whatever they want to say. I think the facts are very clear no matter how they spin it,' The Star quoted him as saying.<br><br>The Malay daily Utusan Malaysia also reported him as saying that the statement by Mr Goh was immature and was not unusual.<br><br>'I feel that there is no need for us to continue to respond and reply to the statements issued by them. All these will not bring any good.'<br><br><br><br>*yawn* Now they pretend to be the victimised ones...the Malaysians are getting real good at the game.<br><br>All the "politically correct" statements start to fly in from them, least of all their contradicting foreign minister...how quiant.<br></div>
