            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>just would like to make a posting on workers' welfare which I feel the govt does not care, and instead aids companies in exploiting it by turning a blind eye to it.<br><br>As mentioned before, here's one main grudge I have with local companies (SMEs or local MNCs):<br><br>When you work OT, or over public holidays, or over the weekend, most of them will keep quiet and will not return you an off-day in replacement of your sacrifice.<br><br>This is hardly so in the foreign firm I am in, where they tell us to take our Off-days should we ever need to work OT/over weekends/holidays.<br><br>Yesterday, 1 of my juniors came to me. Was offered a position as Management Trainee in a cooperative that has supermarkets all over the place (We all know which cooperative is this). In the contract that they gave her, was one of the worst violation of human rights I have ever seen:<br><br>Clause 2.2 "The executive is to know that there will be a need for him/her to work on public holidays or weekends or overtime, and that there will be no replacement off-days or overtime pay entitled to him"<br><br>To me, this is the worst violation of human rights. Most companies pretend and will reluctantly give off-days if you request for it. This cooperative WROTE IT into the contract, that you should die and slave for the company without a complaint.<br><br>And this is my grudge with the Govt. They do not give any protection to white-collar workers, choosing to say that it all comes with market conditions. They turn a blind eye to violation of welfare, such as the company eating the staff's welfare, and exploiting them to the fullest.<br><br>Imagine what happens if some desperate people sign the contract for this cooperative. The cooperative will say, "well, I wrote it in, people still come, so next time I can make the contract even more exploitative".<br><br>So, welfare gets worse, and govt ignores.<br><br>By the way, does anyone know that executives in Japan working OT get OT pay? This is something the govt doesn't want anyone of us here to know.</div>
