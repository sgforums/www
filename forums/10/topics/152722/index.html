With multiple outlets throughout SG, they are the primary heavyweights slugging out while the rest feast on the scraps.<br><br>But with this new contract with NTUC, i see Esso-mobil either consolidating their position in SG mkt or planning to buy off caltex and turn this into a 3-pronged tri-nopoly. The signs are definitely there.<br><br>As for Fairprice cornering the market, i'm doubtful. Convenience stalls at petrol stations was never really much of a draw to customers anyway. Shell's supermart countered this by going 24h in some outlets. The tiger shops never really took off and are in serious need of a face-lift. SPC adopted a transparent concept similar to Breadtalk, no doubt to attract drivers by 'showcasing everything' (literally) in their shop and along the outside.<br><br>Unless Fairprice can provide some value-add to this trend, i see them falling into the same trap as the previous brands. The only advantage is that being a larger corporation, they can absorb losses better and still project some measure of growth.<br><br>Nothing to worry abt....except the same stale variety Fairprice will offer, possibly at better rates or higher discounts.</div>

They have just obtained the rights to open a 'mobil-mart' with the name fairprice on it. Likely to sell the same things at better prices.<br><br>However your point is interesting, depending on the size of the mart allocated. They might build on the supermarket idea and go one better.<br><br></div>

Sizes of petro kiosks in singapore can only accommodate convenient stores, not super market. You need the space for merchandize and car parks, and walkway in between.<br><br>Products in convenient stores are often available only small quantities, available 24 hrs...and that means higher prices. usually when we pick up a few items out of convenience, we don't check prices. Watch out next time.<br><br>What puzzled me is that prices of new kiosks or service stations have been over 20 millions for 30 yrs lease and oil companies justified such high biddings on higher sales of oil products. How does NTUC help in repaying such high leasing prices?<br><br>Higher sales in NTUC, resulting in traffic jams, on the forecourt and at the cashiers, is definitely at the expense of petrol sales, is NTUC supermark business more profitable than petrol business???</div>

As the colonial master of singapore, they never committed in a refinery like Shell, Mobil, Exxon, (except the small kettle at pasir panjang which was limited in lease) and finally they had to share SRC with SPC and Caltex, and now they even pulled out from this. They moved their management HQ out of singapore to KL many times. It is not surprising that they are out now completely. Take note, they also do not own one single service station in Hong Kong, where they were also the colonial master till 1997!! Singapore market too small?? not true when you look at Shell who announced upgrading their crackers in Bukom. I can only conclude that the brits are only good at taking as more out of their colonies than anybody.<br><br>BP looked around for a buyer of their retail network in singapore and malaysia for a long time! I am glad it was SPC who bought over and not another MNC paying high prices to BP only to recover it from their customers later.<br>It may be a choice of two evils but SPC is a better evil.<br><br>If you notice, even before SPC took over all the BP retail network, SPC oredi started giving discounts, and when they took over, discount war (not free gift war) intensified, especially in area where there are SPC stations. During this period of crude price escalation, I believe SPC actually restrained the market from passing all the increases directly to the customers, plus increased margins and increase tax. I now use 95 instead of 98, still I have to pay over 70$ for a full tank, over $80 if no discount, over $100 if crude hits $100 per barrel and still no discount, I used to pay only around $55.<br><br>ExxonMobil and Caltex, are always the first to increase prices! is it coincidental that they are american? SPC, so far so good, they need to prove themselves what kind of suppliers they are in the long run. Shell has retained their reputation as a reliable oil supplier in singapore. For now, I support SPC to support the discount war.<br><br>What is the link between BP's withdrawal from the mkt and the decline in COE prices?? pls enlighten. Thanks.<br></div>
