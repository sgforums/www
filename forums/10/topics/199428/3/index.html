Bhavani issued a strong res- ponse which was also carried in Today. Last Friday, the freesheet's editors decided to suspend Mr Lee's column, drawing sharp criticism from bloggers and netizens.<br><br>Dr Lee said Mr Lee has made 'very unfair, unjustified comments' on key government policies and strategies as well as 'unfounded allegations' in the mass media.<br><br>'Should we just remain quiet, let it pass and treat it as just humour, laugh about it and forget about it?'<br><br>He stressed that the Government is 'duty bound' to set the record straight or these distortions 'will make it more difficult for the Government to rally Singaporeans for national objectives'.<br><br>At the end of the day, it is the ordinary folks who will suffer, he added.<br><br>In responding to Mr Lee's comments, he said the Government was merely exercising its right of reply.<br><br>If Mr Lee had posted his comments on his blog, it would be treated as 'part of the Internet chatter'.<br><br>'We understand that there will be certain elements of humour, sarcasm and cynicism expressed on the Internet and we just let it be.

Dour crap from our MICA head.<br><br>If a statement is wrong in principle, you respond, whether it was released in a blog or in print.  There should be no discrimination between the internet or newspapers.<br><br>The only difference is: the govt has to ACT in closing his blog if they so chose and they would be OPENLY incriminated in such a destardly act. In this case, they have TODAY readily scalped as the scapegoat, thereby innocently feigning ignorance.<br><br>Once again, the govt shames itself for being the big playground bully, with it's instrument of response - TODAY editorial board, or hum ji kings, who have strong-armed a popular columnist into publishing exile.<br><br>I sure wish more people would sit up and take notice of these laughable acts by our petty and 'infallible' govt.</div>

It is always easy to have a panel of esteem judges to judge who is actually telling the truth and who is distorting the truth with the findings in a moot environment. However, this case is no longer so clear cut when involving the mass public. Definitely being a responsible government, the next course of action would have to rectify what is wrong and put it right, henceforth answerable to the public.<br><br>To be a truely administrative efficient government is not to fight fire all the time as the nation well being should be the topmost agenda. The establishment of the feedback department serve this purpose with officials ready to response to genuine public concerns and feedbacks. I am sure the last thing we want to see is our leaders performing firefighting stunt instead of solving fellow countrymen livelihood problem.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>
