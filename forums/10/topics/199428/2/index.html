            <div class='col-md body'>In the Straits Times today, 13 July:<br><br>SINGAPOREANS will lose confidence in the Government if it does not rebut distorted views expressed in the mainstream media, said Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts Lee Boon Yang.<br>Dr Lee was responding to media queries yesterday about the Government's reaction to the mr brown column in MediaCorp's Today newspaper.<br><br>Full-time writer and blogger Lee Kin Mun, who writes under the monicker mr brown, commented on June 30 that hikes on taxi fares and electricity tariffs had come after the General Election and at a time when a government survey showed a widening income gap in the country.<br><br>The Minister's press secretary K. Bhavani issued a strong res- ponse which was also carried in Today. Last Friday, the freesheet's editors decided to suspend Mr Lee's column, drawing sharp criticism from bloggers and netizens.<br><br>Dr Lee said Mr Lee has made 'very unfair, unjustified comments' on key government policies and strategies as well as 'unfounded allegations' in the mass media.<br><br>'Should we just remain quiet, let it pass and treat it as just humour, laugh about it and forget about it?'<br><br>He stressed that the Government is 'duty bound' to set the record straight or these distortions 'will make it more difficult for the Government to rally Singaporeans for national objectives'.<br><br>At the end of the day, it is the ordinary folks who will suffer, he added.<br><br>In responding to Mr Lee's comments, he said the Government was merely exercising its right of reply.<br><br>If Mr Lee had posted his comments on his blog, it would be treated as 'part of the Internet chatter'.<br><br>'We understand that there will be certain elements of humour, sarcasm and cynicism expressed on the Internet and we just let it be. It is not our intention to chase after every single posting,' he added.<br><br>But the crux of the matter is that Mr Lee's comments were carried in the mainstream media, which the Government expects to be responsible, accurate and objective in its reporting.<br><br>'They must adopt the model that they're part of the nation- building effort rather than going out and purveying views that will mislead people, confuse people, which will in fact undermine our national strategy,' said Dr Lee.<br><br></div>

LBY's definition of 'rebutting' opposing views is shutting up the people who would come up with those opposing views.<br><br>Oh dear... I was a school debater once, and one of the first things I learnt was that to rebut an argument is to either provide facts that undermine the argument or to provide a counterargument with facts supporting the latter.<br><br>Typing 'define:rebut' in Google yields the following definition:<br><br><strong><br>refute: overthrow by argument, evidence, or proof; "The speaker refuted his opponent's arguments"<br>refute: prove to be false or incorrect</strong><br><a href="http://wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn" rel="nofollow">wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn</a><br><br>There are several other similar definitions provided, all of them are in a similar vein. But I'll just focus on one for the sake of clarity.<br><br>So I suppose they're going to say that the Princeton definition of 'rebut' is wrong then? That to 'rebut' means to shut up the opposing side?<br><br>Truth be told, I am losing whatever remaining confidence I have in the Government from the way they're 'rebutting' Mr Brown.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br></div>
