Compassion, kindness, harmony and peace are what most religions are teaching. If a joint religious celebration can bring about that peace and harmony, why disrupt it with such pedantic and myopic observation of the religions' rituals?<br><br>If the Hindus and Muslims involved in that celebration are tolerant and loving enough to accept it, why upset that harmony?<br><br>Do we really want to regress to the state our Northern neighbours are in?</div>

Besides, YOU DON'T WANT FREE FOOD? PRATA! MURUKKU! BANDUNG! PINEAPPLE TARTS THATS SHAPED LIKE NIPPLES!<br><br><blockquote>This blatantly suggest a lack of respect for other religions.

Its not a majority opinion up north anyway where many Muslim leaders had since voiced their disagreements, not to mention the Prime Minister himself, like the post above mentioned.<br><br>That fly to spoil the pot of soup.
