              <p><span class="texto1"><strong>GAZA CITY, Jan 22 (IPS) - Eighteen-year-old
              Mona Al-Ashkar says she did not immediately know the first explosion at
              the United Nations (UN) school in Beit Lahiya had blown her left leg
              off. There was smoke, then chaos, then the pain and disbelief set in
              once she realised it was gone - completely severed by the weapon that
              hit her.</strong><br><br>Mona is one of the many patients among the 5,500
              injured that have international and Palestinian doctors baffled by the
              type of weaponry used in the Israeli operation. High-profile human
              rights organisations like Amnesty International are accusing Israel of
              war crimes.
              <br><br>Mona's doctors at Gaza City's Al-Shifa hospital found no
              shrapnel in her leg, and it looked as though it had been "sliced right
              off with a knife."
              <br><br>"We are not sure exactly what type of weapon can manage to do
              that immediately and so cleanly," said Dr. Sobhi Skaik, consultant
              surgeon general at Al-Shifa hospital. "What is happening is
              frightening. It's possible the Israeli army was using Gaza to
              experiment militarily."
              <br><br>Both international organisations and human rights groups,
              including the UN, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, have
              condemned Israel's use of unconventional weapons in civilian areas of
              the Gaza Strip.
              <br><br>Amnesty International's chief researcher for Israel and the
              Palestinian Territories, Donatella Rovera, told IPS in Beit Lahiya that
              Israel's use of white phosphorus and other "area weapons" on civilian
              populations amounted to war crimes.
              <br><br> "The kind of weapons used and the manner in which they were used indicates prima facie evidence of war crimes," she said.
              <br><br>Israel announced Wednesday it would be launching its own probe
              into reported use of white phosphorus, but has so far refused to
              comment further.
              <br><br>The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the UN's
              nuclear watchdog, said it would look into a claim made by the
              ambassadors of a number of Arab nations that Israel used depleted
              uranium in its recent attacks on Gaza. <br><br> Local doctors say a number of both widespread and unusual injuries may
              indicate that new types of weapons were used on the Gaza population
              during the war. Health officials are seeing wounds they have never seen
              before, or at least not on such a massive scale.
              <br><br> "There has been a significant loss of life here in Gaza for reasons that are unexplainable medically," said Dr. Skaik. 
              <br><br>Mona's injury is characteristic of Dense Inert Metal Explosives
              (DIME). DIMEs are munitions that, packed with tungsten powder, produce
              an intense explosion at about the level of the knee, with signs of
              severe heat at the point of amputation.
              <br><br>"If you ask a patient how it happened, how their leg was
              removed, they won't know," Dr. Skaik said. "They'll say that a rocket
              or missile exploded and took only their lower limbs off."
              <br><br>Once in the body, tungsten is both difficult to detect and
              extremely carcinogenic, and can produce an aggressive form of cancer,
              according to both military experts.
              <br><br>Dr. Skaik says the Al-Shifa hospital alone has seen between
              100 to 150 patients with this type of injury. Over 50 patients at
              Al-Shifa had two or more limbs severed, he says.
              <br><br>But because Gaza's hospitals are so poorly equipped, it has
              been nearly impossible so far to test properly for the substances and
              count accurately how many wounded Palestinians may have been hit with
              this weapon.
              <br><br>The Norwegian doctor Mads Gilbert who worked at Al-Shifa
              hospital during the siege confirmed to journalists that the injuries
              were aligned with those produced by DIME explosives.
              <br><br> Human rights groups say Israel used the weapon for the first time in Lebanon in 2006.
              <br><br>What is worrying health officials even more, however, is that
              some of the patients' organs are being ruptured with little or no sign
              of a shrapnel entry point.
              <br><br> This is something they have never seen before, they say, and also something they do not know how to treat. 
              <br><br>"Normal shrapnel has a clear path, with both an entry and an
              exit point," said Dr. Mohamed Al-Ron, another surgeon at Al-Shifa
              hospital.
              <br><br>"But someone's entire abdomen will be ripped open, and only
              after searching will we find a miniscule hole in the skin. Then we will
              find small black dots all over the organ, but we don't know what they
              are."
              <br><br>It is an indication, he continued, that whatever is entering
              the body is exploding and doing the damage once it is inside. Multiple
              organs will fail, and will continue to fail even after surgery removes
              any shrapnel.
              <br><br>"We are consulting with international colleagues, and they are
              confirming that there is something unusual going on with these cases,"
              said Dr. Skaik.
              <br><br>"We have seen plenty of nails, of metal shrapnel and foreign
              metallic parts, but there was never violence of this character or
              something that continued to damage even after the parts of the weapon
              were removed. What is being intentionally created is a population of
              handicapped people."
              <br><br>Some of the injuries, including multiple organ failure,
              mutilation and severed limbs, are so debilitating that Dr. Karim Hosni,
              an Egyptian doctor volunteering at the Al-Naser hospital in Khan
              Younis, says he wishes he could just end his patients' misery.
              <br><br>"Sometimes I wish my patients would just die," he said. "Their
              injuries are so horrifying, that I know they will now have to lead
              terrible and painful lives." (END/2009)</span></p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>                                      There are more reports on Gaza at BBC website.   Most world bodies like Amnestry International, UN humanitarian officials including the Sec.Gen. Mr Ban Kim Moon, Human Rights, Red Cross, etc have seen the destruction and illegal use of weapons.   Even 155mm artillery shells which have the power to destroy human lives and properties within a radius of 300metres were used by Israel.   This destruction and human suffering is worse than Iraq, Afganistan, Darfur, Rowanda.  Therefore, I hope Mr Ban Ki Moon will have the moral courage to pursue further through UN and not just lip-service and stop there.   I also like to see world leaders have the moral courage to make statements on this issue in the UN.</p></div>

              <p>Indeed, "might is right" seems to be the guiding principle of the Zionist action plan. Humans work on the principle of reciprocity so the stronger party has the ability to define the terms of engagement. By seeking the complete extermination of the Palestinian population, by betraying at every turn all attempts at peaceful settlement and acting like the biblical Beast, the state of Israel has chosen to define the conflict only in terms of violence, couching the issue in terms which it feels will allow it to totally shut out the idea of a two state solution.</p>
              <p>However, by doing this Israel is now divorcing itself from all pretensions of moral superiority, it is betraying everything that is holy in Judaism. Either Judaism is a blood thirsty tribal religion or the leaders of Israel are not representatives of Judaism. Every Jew will have to consider what the nature of Eloh is and what it means to be a Jew. I'm sure some have already decided.</p>
              <p>To a muslim, the stand taken by the Israeli government is unacceptable because it is satanic and so they will support the Palestinians. This is why it is important for the Isrealis to foist the neutered Mahmud Abbas and his corrupt Fatah unto the Palestinians because this will nullify muslim support. But the muslims are not stupid. I'm sure the Israel Zionist supporters know this too and so it must be that they will treat all muslims and all peoples who believe in a compassionate and holy God, as enemies. And so people everywhere must decide either to accept the actions of Israel as justified or to reject it and say that this course of action is wrong and must not be allowed to continue. In time, the Isrealis will learn that by asking people to support an unholy course, that they have taken on a greater enemy. They will find that they have lost the balance of power and that they can no longer dictate the terms of engagement. This will not be an overnight process but it has already started.</p>
              <p>I'm sure there is a lesson in this somewhere for all of us.</p>

              <p>OK. Now, let's talk about the Jenin Massacre.</p>
              <p>The counting of casualties: Numbers from between 500-800 and16,000 people slaughtered.</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">The UN authors scoured through second and third-hand resources,
                      never visiting the camp or talking to eyewitnesses. A report with such resources can
                      hardly be described as conclusive. (<span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>The UN is repeating the same way of issuing its reports on the Operation Lead Cast.)</strong></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Human Rights Watch (HRW) released the first
                      report on the Jenin massacre but only after seven days of investigation.</span></p>
              <p>Many media reports on Jenin were biased against Israel, inflating casualty numbers. TV screens around the world featured Palestinian eyewitnesses who gave 'exact' details of blood-curdling actions by IDF.</p>
              <p>It took months of investigations for human rights org and UN to finally issue reports to refute those Palestinian claims of a massacre. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>There was no massacre, no ethnic cleansing, no intentional destruction of hospitals.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Final count:</p>
              <p>Palestinian officials put the death toll at <span style="text-decoration: underline;">56</span> only.</p>
              <p>Human rights watch -  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">52</span> killed. While focusing mainly on IDF actions(as usual), <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>the report also stated that:</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Palestinian gunmen did endanger civilians in the camp by using it as a base for planning and launching attacks, planting IED within the camp and intermingling with the civilians during the comflict.</strong></span></p>

              Singaporean to support courses of action that are mutually
              beneficial.</p>
              <p>The Turks floated the idea of turning Gaza into an industrial
              zone but the Isrealis rejected the idea. Is this not a sign of bad
              faith and unprofitable thinking? An investment is peaceful
              coexistence pays of handsome dividends to those who can think
              clearly. Are we in Singapore reaping the benefits of peaceful
              coexistence or are we reaping the benefits of expansionistic
              militancy? Insecurities aside, we have to admit honestly to
              ourselves that it is peaceful cooperation that has served us well.

              that they have lost the balance of power and that they can no
              longer dictate the terms of engagement. This will not be an
              overnight process but it has already started.</p>

              <p>As I stated earlier, I fully understand the concept of "might is right" and that it operates in the real world. I also agree that the SAF has served a useful role in the defence of Singapore. But I remind you that the SAF is not an all Chinese non-muslim force. "Might is right" cannot be the only language one speaks to a weaker human being. If you do this to a child, that will be called child abuse. I'm sure you also can understand this. You must admit that Singapore has come so far because it has been pragmatic, in the full sense of the word. Any sane intelligent person can understand that the choice to only use violence when dealing with a weaker party will not ensure long term security.<br><br>You ask "what went wrong is israel is unholy so everyone must support the muslims and destroy israel?". I do not agree that Israel should be destroyed and I also do not believe "everyone" supports muslims and I don't think all muslims want the destruction of Israel but I think if there is a perception that people do not agree with the actions of Israel with regards to the current Gaza attacks, it is because it has resulted in large numbers of civilian casualties and that the objective of protecting the illegal settlers can be achieved by other means. For example, Israel could have used the C-RAM anti-missile system to protect Sderot. If Singapore was in real danger of homemade rockets being fired from Johor, we could probably have purchased the C-rams, deployed it at the border and sought international help to freeze out the Malaysian government and make them stop the attacks being conducted on their soil. This is because we are pragmatic. If we think carefully from this example, we can see that the Israeli action in Gaza was not intended to ensure the long-term security of Sderot. What then are the Isreali objectives? This then is the beginning of the deep dark hole.</p>

              <p>I hope you can provide details to back your claim that Israel reject the idea.</p>
              <p>The Turk delegation dropped plans to pump more money into Gaza and became interested in the more peaceful West Bank under Abbas, which is more economically viable..</p>
              <p>Are you green with envy that businessmen have broad interests in improving West Bank's economy?</p>
