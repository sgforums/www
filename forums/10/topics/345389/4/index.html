              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">One was forced to protect Israeli troops, the other Palestinian militants.</span></strong> A
              few streets apart from each other, Mahmoud Abed Rabbo and his cousin Magdi
              say that they were forced to serve as human shields in the battle being
              waged across their neighbourhood on the eastern outskirts of Jabaliya.</p>
              <p>Today the two feel lucky to be alive. <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">They use a similar gesture - slapping
              one palm against a cheek - to express their disbelief at the willingness of
              both sides to use civilians as human shields.</span></strong></p>
              <p>Mahmoud, who did not give his real name for fear of retaliation, says that he
              was forced to remain in his home by Hamas snipers who had taken over his
              rooftop. Magdi claims that he was held at gunpoint by Israeli troops and
              forced to act as a go-between with Palestinian fighters. “<strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">I cannot believe
              that anyone, Hamas or Israel, would put so little value on human life and
              drag civilians into their battlefield,” Mahmoud said. “It is one thing for
              those who choose to fight, it is another to be forced into it against your
              will.</span></strong>”</p>
              <p>On the morning of January 5 Israeli ground troops began to move into the
              neighbourhood. Civilians hid indoors, already terrified after more than a
              week of heavy bombardment. <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Mahmoud had more reason to be afraid than most: a
              week before, he had awoken to find Hamas fighters scouting his rooftop as a
              sniper position. He said that he had asked them to leave but was told that
              his home had become “part of the resistance”. </span></strong></p>
              <p>“I knew who they were. They were resistance fighters. I did not want them
              there but they made it clear that this is where they would set up their
              positions,” he said. “I went downstairs to wake my wife to tell her we would
              go to her sisters'. But they stopped us. They said we were to stay.”</p>
              <p>For the next two days the men insisted that Mahmoud remain downstairs with his
              family. He said he was told: “If soldiers come, you must send your children
              to warn us. Tell them there is no one here and we will escape somewhere
              else.”</p>
              <p>He added: "They would not listen when I told them to let my youngest
              children go, my family. They said no, it must look normal.”</p>
              <p>When the Israelis did eventually knock on his door, he told them that only his
              family was home. He was relieved to find that his words were true. “The
              young men were gone. Thank God - maybe the soldiers would have killed me if
              they had found them.”</p>
              <p>A little way down the road, Magdi found himself on the other end of the
              battle. Several hours after the troops moved into the neighbourhood, he
              heard a knock on the door. <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">He opened it to discover one of his neighbours,
              flanked by Israeli soldiers. Over the next two days soldiers gathered a 
              number of males from the neighbourhood and forced them to work as human
              shields, Magdi said. </span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;"> “There were maybe a dozen of us being used. Different men were doing different
              things for the soldiers. We were forced to hammer holes through walls, then
              check rooms to see if there were any fighters.” </span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;"> Magdi said that soldiers used him for a “special mission” - as a go-between to
              a group of Hamas gunmen. For more than 24 hours, Magdi said, he was forced
              to make repeated visits to a residence that the gunmen had converted into a
              fort. On each trip an Israeli officer told him that the gunmen were “surely
              dead” and that Magdi should “confirm the kill and bring back their weapons”. </span></strong></p>
              <p>There is no way to verify independently either man's story. Both Israel and
              Hamas deny using civilians as human shields and neither would comment
              directly on the cousins' account.</p>

              <p>Erik Fosse, a Norwegian cardiologist, worked in Gaza hospitals
              during the recent war."It was as if they had stepped on a mine," he <a class="external" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/tungsten-bombs-leave-israels-victims-with-mystery-wounds-1418910.html">says</a> of certain Palestinian patients he treated. "But there was no shrapnel
              in the wound. Some had lost their legs. It looked as though they had
              been sliced off. I have been to war zones for 30 years, but I have
              never seen such injuries before."</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Dr. Fosse was describing the
              effects of a U.S. "focused lethality" weapon that minimizes explosive
              damage to structures while inflicting catastrophic wounds on its
              victims. But where did the Israelis get this weapon? And was their
              widespread use in the attack on Gaza a field test for a new generation
              of explosives?</span></strong></p>
              <h3>DIMEd to Death</h3>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">The specific weapon is called a Dense Inert Metal Explosive (DIME). In 2000, the U.S. Air Force <a class="external" href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/munitions/dime.htm">teamed up</a> with the University of California's Lawrence Livermore National
              Laboratory. The weapon wraps high explosives with a tungsten alloy and
              other metals like cobalt, nickel, or iron in a carbon fiber/epoxy
              container. When the bomb explodes the container evaporates, and the
              tungsten turns into micro-shrapnel that is extremely lethal within a
              13-foot radius. Tungsten is inert, so it doesn't react chemically with
              the explosive. While a non-inert metal like aluminum would increase the
              blast, tungsten actually contains the explosion to a limited area.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Within the weapon's range, however, it's inordinately lethal. <a class="external" href="http://www.democracynow.org/2009/1/14/white_phosphorous_and_dense_inert_metal">According to</a> Norwegian doctor Mad Gilbert, the blast results in multiple amputations
              and "very severe fractures. The muscles are sort of split from the
              bones, hanging loose, and you also have quite severe burns." Most of
              those who survive the initial blast quickly succumb to septicemia and
              organ collapse. "Initially, everything seems in orderbut it turns out
              on operation that dozens of miniature particles can be found in all
              their organs," says Dr. Jam Brommundt, a German doctor working in Kham
              Younis, a city in southern Gaza. "It seems to be some sort of explosive
              or shell that disperses tiny particlesthat penetrate all organs, these
              miniature injuries, you are not able to attack them surgically." <a class="external" href="http://www.alternet.org/blogs/video/121917/did_israel_use_a_horrific_%27new_weapon%27_in_gaza/">According to Brommundt</a>, the particles cause multiple organ failures.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">If
              by some miracle victims resist those conditions, they are almost
              certain to develop rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS), a particularly deadly cancer
              that deeply embeds itself into tissue and is almost impossible to
              treat. A 2005 U.S. Department of health <a class="external" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15929896">study</a> found that tungsten stimulated RMS cancers even in very low doses. All of the 92 rats tested developed the cancer.</span></strong></p>
              <p>While
              DIMEs were originally designed to avoid "collateral" damage generated
              by standard high-explosive bombs, the weapon's lethality and profound
              long-term toxicity hardly seem like an improvement.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">It appears
              DIME weapons may have been used in the 2006 Israeli invasion of
              Lebanon, but not enough to alarm medical workers. But in Gaza, the
              ordinance was widely used. Al-Shifta <a class="external" href="http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=45503">alone has seen</a></span></strong> 100 to 150 victims of these attacks.</p>
              <h3>Gaza as Test</h3>
              <p>Dr. Gilbert <a class="external" href="http://www.presstv.ir/detail.aspx?id=82047&amp;sectionid=351021701">told</a> the <em>Oslo Gardermoen,</em> "there is a strong suspicionthat Gaza is now being used as a test laboratory for new weapons."</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">DIME
              is a U.S. invention. Did the Israelis get the weapons from the United
              States, or did they design similar ones themselves? Given the close
              relations between the two militaries, it isn't unlikely that the U.S.
              Air Force supplied the weapons or, at least, the specifications on how
              to construct them. And since the United States has yet to use the
              device in a war, it would certainly benefit from seeing how these new
              "focused lethality" weapons worked under battlefield conditions.</span></strong></p>
              <p>Marc Garlasco, Human Rights Watch's senior military advisor, <a class="external" href="http://www.democracynow.org/2009/1/14/white_phosphorous_and_dense_inert_metal">says</a> "it remains to be seen how Israel has acquired the technology, whether
              they purchased weapons from the United States under some agreement, or
              if they in fact licensed or developed their own type of munitions."</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">DIME
              weapons aren't banned under the Geneva Conventions because they have
              never been officially tested. However, any weapon capable of inflicting
              such horrendous damage is normally barred from use, particularly in one
              of the most densely populated regions in the world.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">For one
              thing, no one knows how long the tungsten remains in the environment or
              how it could affect people who return to homes attacked by a DIME.
              University of Arizona cancer researcher Dr. Mark Witten, who
              investigates links between tungsten and leukemia, <a class="external" href="http://palestinefreevoice.blogspot.com/2006/10/dense-inert-metall-explosive-experiment.html">says</a> that in his opinion "there needs to be much more research on the health
              effects of tungsten before the military increases its usage."</span></strong></p>
              <h3>Beyond DIMEs</h3>
              <p>DIMEs
              weren't the only controversial weapons used in Gaza. <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">The Israeli
              Defense Forces (IDF) also made generous use of white phosphorus, a
              chemical that burns with intense heat and inflicts terrible burns on
              victims. In its vapor form it also damages breathing passages.
              International law prohibits the weapon's use near population areas and
              requires that "all reasonable precautions" be taken to avoid civilians.</span></strong></p>
              <p>Israel
              initially denied using the chemical. "The IDF acts only in accordance
              with what is permitted by international law and does not use white
              phosphorus," <a class="external" href="http://www.csmonitor.com/2009/0114/p07s01-wome.html">said</a> Israel's Chief of Staff Gabi Ashkenazi on January 13.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">But
              eyewitness accounts in Gaza and Israel soon forced the IDF to admit
              that they were, indeed, using the substance. On January 20, the IDF <a class="external" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/jan/21/gaza-phosphorus-shells">confessed</a> to using phosphorus artillery shells as smokescreens, as well as 200
              U.S.-made M825A1 phosphorus mortar shells on "Hamas fighters and rocket
              launching crews in northern Gaza."</span></strong></p>
              <p>Three of those shells hit the
              UN Works and Relief Agency compound on January 15, igniting a fire that
              destroyed hundreds of tons of humanitarian supplies. A phosphorus shell
              also hit Al-Quds hospital in Gaza City. The Israelis say there were
              Hamas fighters near the two targets, a charge that witnesses adamantly <a class="external" href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20090119/wl_mideast_afp/mideastconflictgazaamnestyweapons_20090119180216">deny</a>.</p>
              <p>Donatella Rovera of Amnesty International <a class="external" href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20090119/wl_mideast_afp/mideastconflictgazaamnestyweapons_20090119180216">said</a>:
              "Such extensive use of this weapon in Gaza's densely-populated
              residential neighborhoodsand its toll on civilians is a war crime."</p>
              <p>Israel
              is also accused of using depleted uranium ammunition (DUA), which a UN
              sub-commission in 2002 found in violation of the Universal Declaration
              of Human Rights, the UN Charter, the Geneva Conventions, the
              International Convention Against Torture, the Conventional Weapons
              Convention, and the Hague Conventions against the use of poison weapons.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">DUA
              isn't highly radioactive, but after exploding, some of it turns into a
              gas that can easily be inhaled. The dense shrapnel that survives also
              tends to bury itself deeply, leaching low-level radioactivity into
              water-tables.</span></strong></p>
              <h3>War Crimes?</h3>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Other human-rights groups,
              including B'Tselem, Gisha, and Physicians for Human Rights, charge that
              the IDF intentionally targeted medical personal, killing over a dozen,
              including paramedics and ambulance drivers.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">The International Federation for Human Rights <a class="external" href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gdTw6JytBlqnhA8HjdXXsVMcehdQ">called</a> on the UN Security Council to refer Israel to the International Criminal Court for possible war crimes.</span></strong></p>
              <p>Although
              the Israelis dismiss the war-crimes charges, <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">the fact that the Israeli
              cabinet held a special meeting on January 25 to discuss the issue
              suggests they're concerned about being charged with "disproportionate"
              use of force. The <a class="external" href="http://www.icrc.org/Web/Eng/siteeng0.nsf/htmlall/genevaconventions">Geneva Conventions</a> require belligerents to at "all times" distinguish between combatants
              and civilians and to avoid "disproportionate force" in seeking military
              gains.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Hamas' use of unguided missiles fired at Israel would also be a war crime under the Conventions.</span></strong></p>
              <p>"The one-sidedness of casualty figures is one measure of disproportion," <a class="external" href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/3423877c-e32d-11dd-a5cf-0000779fd2ac.html">says</a> Richard Falk, the UN's human rights envoy for the occupied territories.
              <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">A total of 14 Israelis have been killed in the fighting, three of them
              civilians killed by rockets, 11 of them soldiers, four of the latter by
              "friendly fire." Some 50 IDF soldiers were also wounded.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">In contrast, <a class="external" href="http://www.mg.co.za/article/2009-01-23-israel-readies-for-fight-against-warcrimes-charges">1,330 Palestinians have died</a> and 5,450 were injured, the overwhelming bulk of them civilians.</span></strong></p>
              <p>"This
              kind of fighting constitutes a blatant violation of the laws of
              warfare, which we ask to be investigated by the Commission of War
              Crimes," a coalition of Israeli human rights groups and Amnesty
              International <a class="external" href="http://www.btselem.org/English/Press_Releases/20090114.asp">said</a> in a joint statement. "The responsibility of the state of Israel is beyond doubt."</p>
              <h3>Enter the Hague?</h3>
              <p>Israeli
              Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said that Justice Minister Daniel Friedmann
              would coordinate the defense of any soldier or commander charged with a
              war crime. In any case, the United States would veto any effort by the
              UN Security Council to refer Israelis to the International Court at The
              Hague.</p>
              <p>But, as the <em>Financial Times</em> <a class="external" href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/3423877c-e32d-11dd-a5cf-0000779fd2ac.html?nclick_check=1">points out</a>,
              "all countries have an obligation to search out those accused of
              'grave' breaches of the rules of war and to put them on trial or
              extradite them to a country that will."</p>
              <p>That was the basis under which the British police arrested Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet in 1998.</p>
              <p>"We're in a seismic shift in international law," Amnesty International legal advisor Christopher Hall <a class="external" href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/3423877c-e32d-11dd-a5cf-0000779fd2ac.html">told</a> the <em>Financial Times</em>, who says Israel's foreign ministry is already examining the risk to Israelis who travel abroad.</p>
              <p>"It's
              like walking across the street against a red light," he says. "The risk
              may be low, but you're going to think twice before committing a crime
              or traveling if you have committed one."</p>
