              <p> Extract from ChinaView dtd 27.1.09 ." CAIRO, Jan. 26 (Xinhua) -- The permanent representatives of the Cairo-based Arab League(AL) decided on Monday to file an investigation request to the United Nations(UN) on the alleged Israeli "war crimes" in its attacks on Gaza.</p>
              <p>    The delegates from 22 Arab nations agreed at the extraordinary session to ask the UN General Assembly to "form an international committee to investigate Israeli crimes in the Gaza Strip and to set up a criminal court to try Israeli war criminals," the Egyptian MENA news agency said.</p>
              <p>    The pan-Arab bloc also decided to send a fact-finding committee to Gaza to present a report on the so-called war crimes, including the use of white phosphorus and depleted uranium munitions, it added.</p>
              <p>    Moreover, AL Secretary General Amr Moussa said that he had informed International Criminal Court's(ICC) chief prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo of the matter, noting that it will be discussed at the international level. "</p>
              <p>I hope more world bodies will press for UN investigation as this is unprecedented  violation of international laws on war. Israel is the ocuppying force in Gaza and West Bank.</p>

              <h1 class="title">Israeli army used flechettes against Gaza civilians</h1>
              <p><span class="date-display-single">27 January 2009</span></p>
              <p><a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/news/israeli-army-used-flechettes-against-gaza-civilians-20090127">http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/news/israeli-army-used-flechettes-against-gaza-civilians-20090127</a></p>
              <p>Apart from white phosphorus, the Israeli army used a variety of other
              weapons in densely populated civilian areas of Gaza in the three-week
              conflict that began on 27 December.<br> <br> Flechettes are 4cm long metal darts that are sharply pointed at the
              front, with four fins at the rear. Between 5,000 and 8,000 are packed
              into 120mm shells which are generally fired from tanks. The shells
              explode in the air and scatter the flechettes in a conical pattern over
              an area about 300m wide and 100m long.<br> <br> An anti-personnel weapon designed to penetrate dense vegetation,
              flechettes should never be used in built-up civilian areas. The Israeli
              army has used them in Gaza periodically for several years. In most
              cases their use has resulted in civilians being killed or injured.<br> <br> Amnesty International's fact-finding team in Gaza first heard about the
              use of flechettes in the most recent conflict some ten days ago. The
              father of one of the victims showed the team a flechette which had been
              taken out of his son's body.<br> <br> In its latest post on Amnesty International's <a href="http://livewire.amnesty.org/">Livewire blog</a>,
              the team described how on Monday it visited towns and villages around
              Gaza and found more hard evidence of the use of flechettes.<br> <br> In 'Izbat Beit Hanoun, to the south-west of the town of Beit Hanoun,
              several flechette shells were fired into the main road, killing two
              people and injuring several others on the morning of 5 January.  <br> <br> Wafa' Nabil Abu Jarad, a 21-year-old pregnant mother of two, was one of
              those killed. Her husband and her mother-in-law told the team that the
              family had just had breakfast and were outside the house drinking tea
              in the sun.<br> <br> Wafa' and her husband were standing by the corner of the house when
              they heard a noise, followed by screams. They turned to go back into
              their house but at that moment Wafa' and several other members of the
              family were hit by flechettes. Wafa’ was killed outright.<br> <br> That same day, at the other end of the street, 16-year-old Islam Jaber
              Abd-al-Dayem was struck in the neck by a flechette. He was taken to the
              hospital's intensive care unit but died three days later. Mizar, his
              brother, was injured in the same attack and still has a flechette
              lodged in his back.<br> <br> In the village of al-Mughraqa on the morning of 7 January, a shell
              struck the room where Atta Hassan Aref Azzam was sitting with two of
              his children, Mohammed, aged 13 and Hassan, aged two and a half. All
              three were killed. The six other members of the family who were in the
              house fled to the nearest school for shelter. The team examined the
              bloodstained wall by which the three were killed. It was full of
              flechettes.</p>

              <h1>Israeli army used flechettes against Gaza
              civilians</h1>
              <p><span>27 January 2009</span></p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/news/israeli-army-used-flechettes-against-gaza-civilians-20090127">http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/news/israeli-army-used-flechettes-against-gaza-civilians-20090127</a></p>
              <p>Apart from white phosphorus, the Israeli army used a variety of
              other weapons in densely populated civilian areas of Gaza in the
              three-week conflict that began on 27 December.<br> <br> Flechettes are 4cm long metal darts that are sharply pointed at the
              front, with four fins at the rear. Between 5,000 and 8,000 are
              packed into 120mm shells which are generally fired from tanks. The
              shells explode in the air and scatter the flechettes in a conical
              pattern over an area about 300m wide and 100m long.<br> <br> An anti-personnel weapon designed to penetrate dense vegetation,
              flechettes should never be used in built-up civilian areas. The
              Israeli army has used them in Gaza periodically for several years.
              In most cases their use has resulted in civilians being killed or
              injured.<br> <br> Amnesty International's fact-finding team in Gaza first heard about
              the use of flechettes in the most recent conflict some ten days
              ago. The father of one of the victims showed the team a flechette
              which had been taken out of his son's body.<br> <br> In its latest post on Amnesty International's <a rel="nofollow" href="http://livewire.amnesty.org/">Livewire blog</a>,
              the team described how on Monday it visited towns and villages
              around Gaza and found more hard evidence of the use of
              flechettes.<br> <br> In 'Izbat Beit Hanoun, to the south-west of the town of Beit
              Hanoun, several flechette shells were fired into the main road,
              killing two people and injuring several others on the morning of 5
              January.  <br> <br> Wafa' Nabil Abu Jarad, a 21-year-old pregnant mother of two, was
              one of those killed. Her husband and her mother-in-law told the
              team that the family had just had breakfast and were outside the
              house drinking tea in the sun.<br> <br> Wafa' and her husband were standing by the corner of the house when
              they heard a noise, followed by screams. They turned to go back
              into their house but at that moment Wafa' and several other members
              of the family were hit by flechettes. Wafa’ was killed
              outright.<br> <br> That same day, at the other end of the street, 16-year-old Islam
              Jaber Abd-al-Dayem was struck in the neck by a flechette. He was
              taken to the hospital's intensive care unit but died three days
              later. Mizar, his brother, was injured in the same attack and still
              has a flechette lodged in his back.<br> <br> In the village of al-Mughraqa on the morning of 7 January, a shell
              struck the room where Atta Hassan Aref Azzam was sitting with two
              of his children, Mohammed, aged 13 and Hassan, aged two and a half.
              All three were killed. The six other members of the family who were
              in the house fled to the nearest school for shelter. The team
              examined the bloodstained wall by which the three were killed. It
              was full of flechettes.</p>

              <p>Israeli main battle tanks carry fire control computers with
              laser range finders, is that a Lie?</p>
              <p>Somehow, with accurate fire control computers, powerful
              flechette rounds kill only a handful of people... WOW.  Is
              that a Lie or a question?</p>
              <p>People like you don't help promote sympathy to the Gazans.
               You diss off everybody who is even half sympathetic to their
              cause.  </p>

              <p>I'm not sure if I'm supposed to be sympathetic to either. Quite frankly, both sides are equally screwed, but it seems there are plenty who out to exaggerate the exploits on both sides. BUt this hits hilarity when someone suggest something with the destructive force of a small artillery shell can only kill mere 2 people. For that kind of money, they could have just used a cheaper missile, or just a couple of shots from a rifle.</p>

              <p>What is the issue here that you fuckers are questioning the Amnesty International report on the use of fletchettes? Are fletchette so lethal that the case that was cited where ONLY 2 people were killed is somehow against the law of physics?</p>
              <p>Truly this kind of mentality is nowhere near to impartial.</p>

              <p>What did anyone expect? Amnesty International is run by a bunch of peaceniks who deliberately exaggerate or lie about their sources. Plenty of people there hate the US and Israelis with a passion, and quite frankly, they are only a few steps lower in terms of stupidity when compared against PETA, but definitely as bad as Greenpeace when it comes intellectual dishonesty.</p>
