              <p>Amnesty International was very prominent in spreading false
              rumours(lies) about  the Jenin Massacre. Of couse the
              International media also contributed to the quick spread of the
              lies.</p>
              <p>Even though Amnesty International later admitted that there was
              no massacre in Jenin, the lie is still being exploited by
              anti-israel organizations today, even after the truth has been

              <p>The claim that IDF did not carry out war crimes in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_jenin">Battle of Jenin</a> is only one asserted by Zionist sympathizers. There are numerous eye witness reports that attest to the abuses of human rights by the IDF. If the number of initially reported casualties and the number of bodies found are points of dispute, it should be noted that Erakat has accusations the IDF of coverups and Shimon Peres has been reported by Haaretz to have privately refered to a "massacre". Also, if the difference in casualty numbers can be used to invalidate a claim then I would like to put forward the example of <a href="http://www.rense.com/1.imagesH/Auch_dees.jpg">Auschwitz</a> and say that to use that defence is self defeating. Of course, I for one do not deny that Nazi German forces carried out massacres of Jews during WW2.</p>
              <p>The controversy surrounding the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Jenin">Battle of Jenin</a> does not detract from the fact that there is irrefutable evidence that IDF under <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariel_sharon#Sabra_and_Shatila_massacre">Ariel Sharon</a> carried out the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabra_and_Shatila_massacre">Sabra and Shatila massacre</a> and that members of the Isreali terrorist organizations such as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stern_gang">Stern Gang</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irgun">Irgun</a> who were also responsible for massacres of Arabs, such as the massacre of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stern_gang#Deir_Yassin_massacre">Deir Yassin</a> have been elevated to become Isreali leaders.

              <p>If we are going go about this, let's pull up the Arab actions during WWII when they aligned themselves with the Nazis and expelled jews from their homes and received arms from the Nazis. Quite frankly, no side in this equation is remotely free of blood and taking sides in this is meaningless as it is stupid. If you cannot emotionally detach yourself from this situation, then don;t and just shut the fuck up.</p>

              <p>Security can only be bought by establishing pacts of trust and goodwill among all parties of interest. Positive reciprocal actions and dialogue establishes trust and goodwill.</p>
              <p>The actions of the IDF in Gaza amounts to war crimes and once more raises the bar for Zionist bad faith, evil intent, satanic calculations and barbaric actions. This is indisputable and the evidence is readily available. If the Zionists are really interested in establish a secure Israel that will become "The Light Unto the Nations", they'd do something else other than increasing the suffering of their captive Palestinian slaves. As it is, the Zionist planners are not interested in getting into <a href="http://www.neveh.org/winston/parsha57/bo.html">God's good book</a>. They are interested in wiping out the Palestinians which they see as obstacles to their establishment of a Greater Israel. Which makes the fools who to try to defend the good name of the Zionists the biggest fucktards in the whole of fucktardom.</p>

Likewise, its the same for me. <strong>The issue here is that you are denying that 1200 Palestinians died during the Israeli invasion, which when compared to the number of Israelis killed by rocket attacks from Gaza, is a joke, a bad one at that. If you are so uncomfortable with acknowledging that the IDF killed 1200, then show your evidence backing it up.</strong></p>

                  Unto the Nations", they'd do something else other than increasing
                  the suffering of their captive Palestinian slaves. As it is, the
                  Zionist planners are not interested in getting into <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.neveh.org/winston/parsha57/bo.html">God's good book</a>. They are interested in wiping out
                  the Palestinians which they see as obstacles to their establishment
                  of a Greater Israel. Which makes the fools who to try to defend the
                  good name of the Zionists the biggest fucktards in the whole of
                  fucktardom.</p>

              <p>Oh yeah, Good will. What a funny term. Wait, Hamas' constitutation DEMANDS the destruction of Israel. Yeah, that is really good fucking will there. I'm sorry, you and your friend freedomclub need to go read the proper facts from reputable sources and stop digging your heads deep into the ground and spin crap from God knows where.</p>
              <p>Let's also talk about ingrained racism that Hamas spills from its own fucking television station. You don't hear of Amnesty International talking about that don't you? The Television station even had a program showing "Mickey Mouse" teaching children why they should kill Jews! Yeah, that's star quality work. You could probably still find it on Youtube. You can go say so and so about the Israelis, but quite frankly, Hamas is happily delivering people into the carnal house. Why, there was one article where some Hamas militant was glad innocents died. Apparently, the reason was that there were more matryrs. Yeah, really really star quality people we have for palestinians.</p>
