              <p class="dates">The world financial crisis is not just about money though it started on
              Wall Street, says Tiberio Graziani, editor of Eurasia magazine on
              geopolitical studies and author of many books on geopolitics.</p>
              <p>Tiberio Graziani joined RT live from Rome.</p>
              <p><em>RT: Governments worldwide are adopting protectionist measures.
              It affects all levels of society. In Italy we are seeing more support
              towards right wing anti-immigration policies. How can Italy and how can
              we all outlive the world financial crisis?</em></p>
              <p>Tiberio Graziani: First of all, we should reflect on the motives of
              this financial crunch, which also affected production at an industrial
              level, first, in the United States and then in the entire Western
              system, constituted by a famous triumvirate: the US, Western Europe and
              Japan. This crisis has affected the whole world market. As for Italy,
              the effects have begun to show slightly later and, in my view, will
              become more pronounced during 2009 and in 2010.</p>
              <p>Because the Italian economy is mainly based on small and medium
              enterprises, there’s no high concentration of industry, and therefore
              Italy tends to have more flexibility necessary to face and contain the
              crisis. Anyway, the crisis will be very deep.</p>
              <p>We’ll be able to overcome a financial crisis if we operate in a
              continental geo-economic context. It means that we should look for
              recipes in which the economies of the emergent countries such as
              Russia, China and India are going to have their part. The crisis cannot
              be resolved only through national recipes or recipes created in
              Brussels by the European Union only.</p>

              <div class="rtcut" style="display: block;">
              <p><em>RT: Lets talk about the recent gas crisis, Italy has been
              affected perhaps not as much as the Balkans and Eastern Europe, but
              still, it was among those taken hostage by it. The truth has been
              concealed. What is the real origin of the dispute?</em></p>
              <p>T.G.: The origin of the gas dispute between Kiev and Moscow is
              actually a reflection of NATO enlargement in Eastern Europe as well as
              EU expansion into Eastern European countries. These two coinciding
              enlargements were seen in Moscow as a kind of aggression in its close
              neighbourhood.</p>
              <p>This kind of enlargement began in 1989 after the fall of the Berlin
              Wall. From that moment the United States had decided to manage the
              whole planet. They chose Western Europe as a starting point to move in
              the direction of Russia and Central Asia, as it’s known that Central
              Asia has huge resources of gas and oil.</p>
              <p>The US started to influence Warsaw block countries and some former Soviet states, such as Ukraine.</p>
              <p>From 1990 Ukraine began to separate its geopolitical future from its
              natural location, or from Moscow. If we analyze the so-called ‘Orange
              Revolution’, we’ll realize that behind these achievements of the
              so-called civil society of Ukraine were interests coming from across
              the Atlantic, from Washington. We mustn’t also forget about the
              influence of so called philanthropists such as George Soros not just in
              the destabilization of Ukraine, but also in the former Yugoslavian
              republics.</p>
              <p>When Ukraine abandoned or tried to abandon its natural geo-political
              context, that of a privileged partner of Moscow, it’s evident that when
              it came to gas, Moscow tried to set market prices for it as Ukraine was
              no longer a privileged client but a customer like any other. Obviously
              gas prices went up affecting Europe because Ukraine's leaders lack
              sovereignty and are driven by other Western interests. Instead of
              looking for an economic agreement, as is usually done between sovereign
              countries, Ukraine aggravated the situation by siphoning off gas
              designated for European nations.</p>
              <p>This true reason was neglected by the Eastern European press,
              including the Italian press. In the gas dispute, the majority of
              Italian journalists focused their attention not on its real causes, but
              on the deionization of the Russian government, saying that it had used
              geo-policy as a weapon in the gas issue, but President Medvedev and
              Prime Minister Putin were only applying market prices to normal
              economic transactions concerning gas.</p>
              <p><em>RT: Ukraine is on the verge of default. Russia cannot possibly count on Ukraine paying market prices next year.</em></p>
              <p>T.G.: I believe it’s possible to find an economic agreement. Moscow
              and Kiev can also negotiate possible discounts. I’d like to stress
              again that it’s not only a problem of economic transaction, export and
              import. It’s a geopolitical issue. It’s evident, if Ukraine chooses to
              set up a Western camp with Washington’s leadership, that’ll affect not
              only gas, but also other economic issues as well. Hence, I believe,
              it’ll be possible to find an economic solution, but resistance comes
              from Kiev, because it depends on Washington’s interests.</p>
              <p><em>RT: While we’re focusing on Washington let's talk about US military bases on Italian soil, what is public opinion here?</em></p>
              <p>T.G.: Most people are aware of the presence of military bases but
              they aren’t politically conscious. Thus, in the case of the enlargement
              of a military base in Vicenza, in the north of the country, the main
              argument was environmental. And the main motive was hidden as, in
              reality; this enlargement serves the US armed forces, as they’d have
              the opportunity of contacting a nearby military base, located in
              Serbia, which also depends on Washington. In future it’ll be possible
              to operate in border countries and in the Middle East, such states as
              Syria and Iran and to some extent Russia. The Yugoslavian nation,
              Serbia in this case, wasn’t chosen by chance, but because it has some
              cultural and ethnic similarities to Moscow.</p>
              <p><em>RT: The gas crisis has strained Russia-EU relations, many EU
              states are already looking for alternative suppliers. Does Russia need
              to worry?</em></p>
              <p>T.G.: No, I don’t think Russia should worry about it. I think every
              country should look for the best opportunities in the market concerning
              energy supplies and be self-sufficient. In a wider geo-political
              context of Eurasia I believe relations between Russia and Europe,
              between Russia and Italy should be based also on economic interests:
              exchanging new high technology, military technology, energy resources
              and, obviously, cultural relations.</p>
              <p>I believe cultural relations between the European Union and Italy and, naturally, the Russian Federation should be strengthened.</p>
              <p>After WWII, more than sixty years ago, these relations declined
              because they were undermined by the intellectual class of Europe which
              supported the Westernization or Americanization of European culture. If
              we compare European and Italian literature of recent years with the
              1930s we’ll notice that many Italian writers use more incorrect
              language with many borrowed English words. It is a result of cultural
              colonization which Washington has been carrying out since WWII until
              today. It’s interesting to note that this tendency is also present in
              the countries of the former Soviet block.</p>
              <p><em>RT: What is the general line of Italy towards Russia? Can
              Russians count on Italy to play a part in improving Russia-EU relations?</em></p>
              <p>T.G.: Sure, naturally Italy along with other countries of the
              European Union is a potential partner of Russia. But to be a real, not
              just potential, partner Italy should have more liberty and total
              political sovereignty, which it doesn’t have at present.</p>
              <p>I’d like to reiterate that in Italy there are more than 100 military
              sites depending on the US, which are part of the project of American
              influence and occupation of the entire European peninsula. Under such
              conditions there are certain limits for Italy and other countries to
              express their own interests in their politics and their economy. But it
              should also be acknowledged that in recent years the economic policy of
              President Putin before President Medvedev today has laid the ground for
              Italy to become a true partner of Moscow not only economically but also
              in politics and, in my view, in a military field as well. Italy is
              located in the Mediterranean area, and occupies an important strategic
              position. Besides, Italy’s central position is also vital at a
              geopolitical level. And it would be correct if it uses it for Eurasian
              integration.</p>
              <p>I believe relations between Italy and Russia are improving, as
              Italian entrepreneurs are moving in the right direction, because they
              overcome limitations established by a political power which comes
              directly from Washington and London.</p>
              <p><em>RT: You’re very critical of Washington, you portray the US
              almost as an imperial nation almost, but we hardly live in a unilateral
              world anymore.</em></p>
              <p>T.G.: I’m very critical of Washington because it has included Europe
              in its own geopolitical space and looks on Europe only as a bridge-head
              to attack the whole Eurasian ground. It makes me critical, but, of
              course, the significance of the US should always be taken into account.
              And the US should also realize that its era as a superpower is over. At
              present, in the 21st century, on a geo-political level we have a
              multipolar system with Russia, China, India, the United States and some
              states in South America, which are also creating their own
              geo-political entity, I refer to Brazil, Argentina, Chile and
              Venezuela, and, obviously, Bolivia too. In particular, major liberties
              which these South-American countries enjoy can allow the European Union
              to leave the Western camp ruled by the US and Great Britain.</p>
              <p><em>RT: You travel all over Europe’s hotspots and breakaway regions.
              You were monitoring the election in Transdniester. There is an island
              off the coast of Sardinia in Italy that’s just declared independence,
              they say inspired by Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Is there one universal
              formula on how to deal with separatism?</em></p>
              <p>T.G.: These issues are absolutely different. In Sardinia there is a
              political movement of separatism, but this is a movement which a few
              years ago to those people who are in the government of Italy now. As
              for Transdniester, it’s necessary to view its situation from the
              geo-strategic point of view. The countries of Moldavia and Romania feel
              the weight of the United States and NATO. Transdniester is one of the
              so called frozen conflicts. I think Transdniester’s independence would
              be interesting, because in this case it’ll become an area the United
              States won’t be able to enter. It’ll be a territory of liberty from the
              Eurasian point of view, because Transdniester will have its
              sovereignty. I don’t analyze this republic judging it by its actual
              government. I only analyze its geo-strategic and geo-political
              situation. Thus, Transdniester is a republic, and it means that on its
              small territory there are no NATO bases.</p>

              <p><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>Liquid war: Welcome to Pipelineistan</strong></span><br> By Pepe Escobar
              																	<br> <br> What happens on the immense battlefield for the control of Eurasia will provide 
              																	the ultimate plot line in the tumultuous rush towards a new, polycentric world 
              																	order, also known as the New Great Game.
              																	<br> <br> Our good ol' friend the nonsensical "global war on terror", which the Pentagon 
              																	has slyly rebranded "the Long War", sports a far more important, if 
              																	half-hidden, twin - a global energy war. I like to think of it as the Liquid 
              																	War, because its bloodstream is the pipelines that crisscross the potential 
              																	imperial battlefields of the planet. Put another way, if its crucial embattled 
              																	frontier these days is the Caspian Basin, the whole of Eurasia is its 
              																	chessboard. Think of it, geographically, as Pipelineistan.
              																	<br> <br> All geopolitical junkies need a fix. Since the second half of the 1990s, I've been hooked on pipelines. I've crossed the Caspian in an Azeri cargo ship just to follow the $4 billion Baku-Tblisi-Ceyhan pipeline, better known in this chess game by its acronym, BTC, through the Caucasus. (Oh, by the way, the map of Pipelineistan is chicken-scratched with acronyms, so get used to them!)<br><br>I've also trekked various of the overlapping modern Silk Roads, or perhaps Silk Pipelines, of possible future energy flows from Shanghai to Istanbul, annotating my own do-it-yourself routes for LNG (liquefied natural gas).</p>
              <p>I used to avidly follow the adventures of that once-but-not-future Sun-King of Central Asia, the now deceased Turkmenbashi or "leader of the Turkmen", Saparmurat Niyazov, head of the immensely gas-rich Republic of Turkmenistan, as if he were a Conradian hero.<br><br>In Almaty, the former capital of Kazakhstan (before it was moved to Astana, in the middle of the middle of nowhere) the locals were puzzled when I expressed an overwhelming urge to drive to that country's oil boomtown Aktau. ("Why? There's nothing there.")</p>
              <p>Entering the Space Odyssey-style map room at the Russian energy giant Gazprom's headquarters in Moscow - which digitally details every single pipeline in Eurasia - or the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC)'s corporate HQ in Tehran, with its neat rows of female experts in full chador, was my equivalent of entering Aladdin's cave. And never reading the words "Afghanistan" and "oil" in the same sentence is still a source of endless amusement for me.<br><br>Last year, oil cost a king's ransom. This year, it's relatively cheap. But don't be fooled. Price isn't the point here. Like it or not, energy is still what everyone who's anyone wants to get their hands on. So consider this dispatch just the first installment in a long, long tale of some of the moves that have been, or will be, made in the maddeningly complex New Great Game, which goes on unceasingly, no matter what else muscles into the headlines this week.<br><br>Forget the mainstream media's obsession with al-Qaeda, Osama "dead or alive" bin Laden, the Taliban - neo, light or classic - or that "war on terror", whatever name it goes by. These are diversions compared to the high-stakes, hardcore geopolitical game that follows what flows along the pipelines of the planet.<br><br><strong>Who said Pipelineistan couldn't be fun?</strong><br><br>Calling Dr Zbig In his 1997 magnum opus The Grand Chessboard, Zbigniew Brzezinski - realpolitik practitioner extraordinaire and former national security advisor to Jimmy Carter, the president who launched the US on its modern energy wars - laid out in some detail just how to hang on to American "global primacy". Later, his master plan would be duly copied by that lethal bunch of Dr No's congregated at Bill Kristol's Project for a New American Century (PNAC, in case you'd forgotten the acronym since its website and its followers went down).<br><br>For Dr Zbig, who, like me, gets his fix from Eurasia - from, that is, thinking big - it all boils down to fostering the emergence of just the right set of "strategically compatible partners" for Washington in places where energy flows are strongest. This, as he so politely put it back then, should be done to shape "a more cooperative trans-Eurasian security system".<br><br>By now, Dr Zbig - among whose fans is evidently President Barack Obama - must have noticed that the Eurasian train which was to deliver the energy goods has been slightly derailed. The Asian part of Eurasia, it seems, begs to differ.<br><br>Global financial crisis or not, oil and natural gas are the long-term keys to an inexorable transfer of economic power from the West to Asia. Those who control Pipelineistan - and despite all the dreaming and planning that's gone on there, it's unlikely to be Washington - will have the upper hand in whatever is to come, and there's not a terrorist in the world, or even a "long war", that can change that.<br><br>Energy expert Michael Klare has been instrumental in identifying the key vectors in the wild, ongoing global scramble for power over Pipelineistan. These range from the increasing scarcity (and difficulty of reaching) primary energy supplies to "the painfully slow development of energy alternatives". Though you may not have noticed, the first skirmishes in Pipelineistan's Liquid War are already on, and even in the worst of economic times, the risk mounts constantly, given the relentless competition between the West and Asia, be it in the Middle East, in the Caspian theater, or in African oil-rich states like Angola, Nigeria and Sudan.<br><br>In these early skirmishes of the 21st century, China reacted swiftly indeed. Even before the attacks of September 11, 2001, its leaders were formulating a response to what they saw as the reptilian encroachment of the West on the oil and gas lands of Central Asia, especially in the Caspian Sea region. To be specific, in June 2001, its leaders joined with Russia's to form the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. It's known as the SCO and that's an acronym you should memorize. It's going to be around for a while.<br><br>Back then, the SCO's junior members were, tellingly enough, the Stans, the energy-rich former SSRs of the Soviet Union - Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan and Tajikistan - which the Bill Clinton administration and then the new George W Bush administration, run by those former energy men, had been eyeing covetously. The organization was to be a multi-layered economic and military regional cooperation society that, as both the Chinese and the Russians saw it, would function as a kind of security blanket around the upper rim of Afghanistan.<br><br>Iran is, of course, a crucial energy node of West Asia and that country's leaders, too, would prove no slouches when it came to the New Great Game. It needs at least $200 billion in foreign investment to truly modernize its fabulous oil and gas reserves - and thus sell much more to the West than US-imposed sanctions now allow.<br><br>No wonder Iran soon became a target in Washington. No wonder an air assault on that country remains the ultimate wet dream of assorted Likudniks as well as former vice president Dick ("Angler") Cheney and his neo-conservative chamberlains and comrades-in-arms. As seen by the elite from Tehran and Delhi to Beijing and Moscow, such a US attack, now likely off the radar screen until at least 2012, would be a war not only against Russia and China, but against the whole project of Asian integration that the SCO is coming to represent.<br><br><strong>Global BRIC-a-brac</strong></p>
              <p>Meanwhile, as the Obama administration tries to sort out its Iranian, Afghan, and Central Asian policies, Beijing continues to dream of a secure, fast-flowing, energy version of the old Silk Road, extending from the Caspian Basin (the energy-rich Stans plus Iran and Russia) to Xinjiang province, its Far West.<br><br>The SCO has expanded its aims and scope since 2001. Today, Iran, India<br>, and Pakistan enjoy "observer status" in an organization that increasingly aims to control and protect not just regional energy supplies, but Pipelineistan in every direction. This is, of course, the role the Washington ruling elite would like the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) to play across Eurasia. Given that Russia and China expect the SCO to play a similar role across Asia, clashes of various sorts are inevitable.<br><br>Ask any relevant expert at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing and he will tell you that the SCO should be understood as a historically unique alliance of five non-Western civilizations - Russian, Chinese, Muslim, Hindu, and Buddhist - and, because of that, capable of evolving into the basis for a collective security system in Eurasia. That's a thought sure to discomfort classic inside-the-Beltway global strategists like Dr Zbig and president George H W Bush's national security advisor Brent Scowcroft.<br><br>According to the view from Beijing, the rising world order of the 21st century will be significantly determined by a quadrangle of BRIC countries - for those of you by now collecting New Great Game acronyms, that stands for Brazil, Russia, India and China - plus the future Islamic triangle of Iran, Saudi Arabia and Turkey. Add in a unified South America, no longer in thrall to Washington, and you have a global SCO-plus. On the drawing boards, at least, it's a high-octane dream.<br><br>The key to any of this is a continuing Sino-Russian entente cordiale.<br><br>Already in 1999, watching NATO and the United States aggressively expand into the distant Balkans, Beijing identified this new game for what it was: a developing energy war. And at stake were the oil and natural gas reserves of what Americans would soon be calling the "arc of instability," a vast span of lands extending from North Africa to the Chinese border.<br><br>No less important would be the routes pipelines would take in bringing the energy buried in those lands to the West. Where they would be built, the countries they would cross, would determine  much in the world to come. And this was where the empire of US military bases 
              																	(think, for instance, Camp Bondsteel in Kosovo) met Pipelineistan (represented, 
              																	way back in 1999, by the AMBO pipeline).
              																	<br> <br> AMBO, short for Albanian Macedonian Bulgarian Oil Corporation, an entity 
              																	registered in the US, is building a $1.1 billion pipeline, aka "the 
              																	Trans-Balkan", slated to be finished by 2011. It will bring Caspian oil to the 
              																	West without taking it through either Russia or Iran. As a pipeline, AMBO fit 
              																	well into a geopolitical strategy of creating a US-controlled energy-security 
              																	grid that was first developed by president Bill Clinton's energy secretary Bill Richardson and later by Cheney.<br><br>Behind the idea of that "grid" lay a go-for-broke militarization of an energy corridor that would stretch from the Caspian Sea in Central Asia through a series of now independent former SSRs of the Soviet Union to Turkey, and from there into the Balkans (from thence onto Europe). It was meant to sabotage the larger energy plans of both Russia and Iran. AMBO itself would bring oil from the Caspian basin to a terminal in the former SSR of Georgia in the Caucasus, and then transport it by tanker through the Black Sea to the Bulgarian port of Burgas, where another pipeline would connect to Macedonia and then to the Albanian port of Vlora.<br><br>As for Camp Bondsteel, it was the "enduring" military base that Washington gained from the wars for the remains of Yugoslavia. It would be the largest overseas base the US had built since the Vietnam War. Halliburton's subsidiary Kellogg Brown &amp; Root would, with the Army Corps of Engineers, put it up on 400 hectares of farmland near the Macedonian border in southern Kosovo.<br><br>Think of it as a user-friendly, five-star version of Guantanamo with perks for those stationed there that included Thai massage and loads of junk food. Bondsteel is the Balkan equivalent of a giant immobile aircraft carrier, capable of exercising surveillance not only over the Balkans but also over Turkey and the Black Sea region (considered in the neo-con-speak of the Bush years "the new interface" between the "Euro-Atlantic community" and the "Greater Middle East").<br><br>How could Russia, China, and Iran not interpret the war in Kosovo, then the invasion of Afghanistan (where Washington had previously tried to pair with the Taliban and encourage the building of another of those avoid-Iran, avoid-Russia pipelines), followed by the invasion of Iraq (that country of vast oil reserves), and finally the recent clash in Georgia (that crucial energy transportation junction) as straightforward wars for Pipelineistan?<br><br>Though seldom imagined this way in our mainstream media, the Russian and Chinese leaderships saw a stark "continuity" of policy stretching from Bill Clinton's humanitarian imperialism to Bush's "global war on terror". Blowback, as then Russian President Vladimir Putin himself warned publicly, was inevitable - but that's another magic-carpet story, another cave to enter another time.<br><br><strong>Rainy night in Georgia</strong></p>
              <p>If you want to understand Washington's version of Pipelineistan, you have to start with Mafia-ridden Georgia. Though its army was crushed in its recent war with Russia, Georgia remains crucial to Washington's energy policy in what, by now, has become a genuine arc of instability - in part because of a continuing obsession with cutting Iran out of the energy flow.<br><br>It was around the Baku-Tblisi-Ceyhan (BTC) pipeline, as I pointed out in my book Globalistan in 2007, that American policy congealed. Zbig Brzezinski himself flew into Baku in 1995 as an "energy consultant", less than four years after Azerbaijan became independent, and sold the idea to the Azerbaijani elite. The BTC was to run from the Sangachal Terminal, half-an-hour south of Baku, across neighboring Georgia to the Marine Terminal in the Turkish port of Ceyhan on the Mediterranean.<br><br>Now operational, that 1,767-kilometer-long, 44-meter-wide steel serpent straddles no less than six war zones, ongoing or potential: Nagorno-Karabakh (an Armenian enclave in Azerbaijan), Chechnya and Dagestan (both embattled regions of Russia), South Ossetia and Abkhazia (on which the 2008 Russia-Georgia war pivoted), and Turkish Kurdistan.<br><br>From a purely economic point of view, the BTC made no sense. A "BTK" pipeline, running from Baku through Tehran to Iran's Kharg Island, could have been built for, relatively speaking, next to nothing - and it would have had the added advantage of bypassing both mafia-corroded Georgia and wobbly Kurdish-populated Eastern Anatolia. That would have been the really cheap way to bring Caspian oil and gas to Europe.<br><br>The New Great Game ensured that that was not to be, and much followed from that decision. Even though Moscow never planned to occupy Georgia long-term in its 2008 war, or take over the BTC pipeline that now runs through its territory, Alfa Bank oil and gas analyst Konstantin Batunin pointed out the obvious: by briefly cutting off the BTC oil flow, Russian troops made it all too clear to global investors that Georgia wasn't a reliable energy transit country. In other words, the Russians made a mockery of Zbig's world.<br><br>For its part, Azerbaijan was, until recently, the real success story in the US version of Pipelineistan. Advised by Zbig, Bill Clinton literally "stole" Baku from Russia's "near abroad" by promoting the BTC and the wealth that would flow from it. Now, however, with the message of the Russia-Georgia War sinking in, Baku is again allowing itself to be seduced by Russia. To top it off, Azerbaijan President Ilham Aliyev can't stand Georgia's brash President Mikhail Saakashvili. That's hardly surprising. After all, Saakashvili's rash military moves caused Azerbaijan to lose at least $500 million when the BTC was shut down during the war.<br><br>Russia's energy seduction blitzkrieg is focused like a laser on Central Asia as well. (We'll talk about it more in the next Pipelineistan installment.) It revolves around offering to buy Kazakh, Uzbek, and Turkmen gas at European prices instead of previous, much lower Russian prices. The Russians, in fact, have offered the same deal to the Azeris: so now, Baku is negotiating a deal involving more capacity for the Baku-Novorossiysk pipeline, which makes its way to the Russian borders of the Black Sea, while considering pumping less oil for the BTC.<br><br>Obama needs to understand the dire implications of this. Less Azeri oil on the BTC - its full capacity is 1 million barrels a day, mostly shipped to Europe - means the pipeline may go broke, which is exactly what Russia wants.<br><br>In Central Asia, some of the biggest stakes revolve around the monster Kashagan oil field in "snow leopard" Kazakhstan, the absolute jewel in the Caspian crown with reserves of as many as 9 billion barrels. As usual in Pipelineistan, it all comes down to which routes will deliver Kashagan's oil to the world after production starts in 2013. This spells, of course, Liquid War. Wily Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev would like to use the Russian-controlled Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC) to pump Kashagan crude to the Black Sea.<br><br>In this case, the Kazakhs hold all the cards. How oil will flow from Kashagan will decide whether the BTC - once hyped by Washington as the ultimate Western escape route from dependence on Persian Gulf oil - lives or dies.<br><br>Welcome, then, to Pipelineistan! Whether we like it or not, in good times and bad, it's a reasonable bet that we're all going to be Pipeline tourists. So, go with the flow. Learn the crucial acronyms, keep an eye out for what happens to all those US bases across the oil heartlands of the planet, watch where the pipelines are being built, and do your best to keep tabs on the next set of monster Chinese energy deals and fabulous coups by Russia's Gazprom.<br><br>And, while you're at it, consider this just the first postcard sent off from our tour of Pipelineistan. We'll be back (to slightly adapt a quote from Terminator). Think of this as a door opening onto a future in which what flows where and to whom may turn out to be the most important question on the planet.</p>

              <p><strong>The secrets of Obama's surge</strong></p>
              <p>By Pepe Escobar
                  																	<br> <br> Is United States President Barack Obama telling it like it is as far as his new 
                  																	strategy for the Afghanistan and Pakistan war theater - AfPak, in Pentagonspeak 
                  																	- is concerned? There are reasons to believe otherwise.
                  																	<br> <br> Obama's relentless media blitzkrieg stressed the new strategy is refocusing on 
                  																	al-Qaeda. Washington, we got a problem. Why deploy 17,000 troops against "the 
                  																	Taliban" in the poppy-growing province of Helmand, not in the east near the 
                  																	Pakistani tribal areas, where "al-Qaeda" is holed up, plus 4,000 advisers to 
                  																	train the Afghan Army, when Washington actually wants to fight no 
                  																	more than 200 or 300 al-Qaeda jihadis roaming in Afghanistan, plus another 400 
                  																	maximum in the Pakistani tribal areas? And by the way they are not Afghans - 
                  																	they are overwhelmingly Arabs, with a few Uzbeks, Chechens and Uyghurs thrown 
                  																	in.
                  																	<br> <br> President Hamid Karzai, the puppet in Kabul which has left Washington beyond 
                  																	exasperated, loved Obama's plan to "disrupt, dismantle and defeat" al-Qaeda and 
                  																	the Taliban. Especially because it involves the improbable "hunt for the good 
                  																	Taliban" (always bribable by loads of US dollars) mixed with Special Ops inside 
                  																	Pakistan, and not Afghanistan.
                  																	<br> <br> Former Pakistani premier Benazir Bhutto's widower, President Asif Ali Zardari, 
                  																	the puppet in Islamabad, loved it too. But as the Pakistani daily Dawn 
                  																	revealed, his Foreign Office diplomats definitely did not.
                  																	<br> <br> The Afghanistan-Pakistan war has got to be 2009's prime theater of the absurd. 
                  																	It took the New York Times and the usual "American officials" something like 13 
                  																	years to "discover" that the Pakistani Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) - a 
                  																	Central Intelligence Agency twin - helps the Taliban. And this while the CIA, 
                  																	alongside their ISI pals, is compiling a mega hit list in the Pashtun tribal 
                  																	areas inside Pakistan. Maybe this is what US Central Command supremo General 
                  																	David "I'm always positioning myself for 2012" Petraeus means by a "trilateral" 
                  																	love affair, as he told CNN's State of the Union.
                  																	<br> <br> The Pentagon's preferred pal is doubtless Pakistani Army Chief General Ashfaq 
                  																	Kayani, who happens to approve of what's not in Obama's presentation of the 
                  																	surge: the relentless drone war - with inevitable "collateral damage" - over 
                  																	what is for a fact Pashtunistan. As for the Pakistani masses, which have no say 
                  																	in all of this, they see the whole thing as a charade, and al-Qaeda as a threat 
                  																	to the US - not to Pakistan.
                  																	<br> <br> Obama is selling the surge basically as nation building, based on trust. A hard 
                  																	sell if there ever was one - as Washington cannot trust the ISI or the 
                  																	Pakistani government, while the Pakistani masses don't trust Washington.
                  																	<br> <br> Insistent rumors in Washington point to a troika - Holbrooke-Petraeus-Clinton - 
                  																	finally being able to convince Obama that the surge should be just the first 
                  																	step towards long-range nation building. Anyone with minimal familiarity with 
                  																	Afghanistan knows this is an impossible strategic target.
                  																	<br> <br> <strong>The Salvador option </strong></p>
              <p><strong></strong> And then Richard Holbrooke, Obama's special envoy to AfPak, finally let it slip 
                  																	on CNN: the "people we are fighting in Afghanistan" are essentially ... 
                  																	Pashtuns. This was followed by a stark admission: "In the informational side 
                  																	... we don't have a strong enough counter-informational program to combat the 
                  																	Taliban and al-Qaeda."
                  																	<br> <br> So this amounts to the State Department admitting that the Pentagon/Petraeus 
                  																	"humint" (human intelligence) component of counter-insurgency in AfPak, hailed 
                  																	as a gift from the Messiah all across US corporate media, is essentially 
                  																	useless. This also means there's no way of winning local hearts and minds.
                  																	<br> <br> In the absence of "humint", what prevails is inevitably The Salvador option, 
                  																	performed by a Dick Cheney-supervised-style "executive assassination wing", as 
                  																	investigative icon Seymour Hersh first revealed in a talk at the University of 
                  																	Minnesota on March 10, "going into countries, not talking to the ambassador or 
                  																	to the CIA station chief, and finding people on a list and executing them and 
                  																	leaving". The "assassination wing" is in fact the Joint Special Operations 
                  																	Command (JSOC) - a shadowy, ultra-elite unit including Navy Seals and Delta 
                  																	Force commandos immune to Congressional investigations.
                  																	<br> <br> So if you have such a unit killing "al-Qaeda" jihadis at random from Iraq to 
                  																	Kenya, from Somalia to countries in South and Central America (these are not 
                  																	necessarily "al-Qaeda"; let’s say they are inimical to "US interests"), why not 
                  																	let them loose in Afghanistan and the Pakistani tribal areas? Instead of a $5 
                  																	million bounty on his head, why not send a crack JSOC commando to South 
                  																	Waziristan and take out Pakistani Taliban superstar Baitullah Mehsud, who has 
                  																	just boasted his outfit will "soon launch an attack on Washington that will 
                  																	amaze everyone in the world?"
                  																	<br> <br> Well, maybe because US "humint" on South Waziristan is negligible - and even 
                  																	JSOC cannot infiltrate. JSOC by now should have been more than fully equipped 
                  																	to find Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri. Anyway, Vice-President Joseph 
                  																	Biden, to whom the unit would have to answer to, could at least come clean and 
                  																	state the "Salvador option" is not on the cards anymore. Or maybe it still is. 
                  																	The Obama administration is mum about it.
                  																	<br> <br> A priceless, self-described "hip pocket" manual prepared by the US Army 
                  																	Training and Doctrine Command - TRADOC, one more wonderful, Pentagon acronym to 
                  																	memorize - and available only to "US government personnel, government 
                  																	contractors and additional cleared personnel for national security purposes and 
                  																	homeland defense" spells out what's (visibly) going on. On page 5, one learns 
                  																	this is a US war against, yes, Pashtuns, as Holbrooke said on CNN. The 
                  																	overwhelming majority of the "insurgent syndicate", they are funded by drug 
                  																	smuggling and US allies in the Gulf such as Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the 
                  																	Emirates, and are trained and assisted by, yes, the ISI, with some - in fact 
                  																	marginal - al-Qaeda assistance.
                  																	<br> <br> Al-Qaeda is a detail here. TRADOC does not seem to understand that al-Qaeda has 
                  																	a pan-Islamic agenda while the various groups bundled as "Taliban" are 
                  																	essentially in a war against foreign occupation and interference, with no 
                  																	dreams of establishing a Caliphate.
                  																	<br> <br> On page 7, TRADOC estimates the Taliban in Afghanistan to be around 30,000, 
                  																	half of them Pakistani, and supported by the ISI. That's correct. But they 
                  																	overestimate al-Qaeda to be 2,000; these "Arab-Afghans" plus some recently 
                  																	arrived "white moors" (European Arabs) are probably no more than 700.
                  																	<br> <br> On page 10, TRADOC finally admits that Karzai in Kabul is supported by a myriad 
                  																	of "warlord militias" profiting from crime, narco-trafficking and smuggling. 
                  																	The key element here is not "terrorism" - but regional wars for control over 
                  																	ultra-profitable poppy/heroin manufacturing and smuggling routes.
                  																	<br> <br> Then there's this stark admission, by former Taliban commander Mullah Abdul 
                  																	Salam, currently governor of a town in poppy-infested Helmand province. He told 
                  																	Reuters that the Taliban are not the real enemy. If Kabul was not so corrupt, 
                  																	and capable of providing security to the rest of the country, most Pashtuns 
                  																	would not even be Taliban. No wonder the Obama administration has stacks of 
                  																	reasons to get rid of Karzai.
                  																	<br> <br> <strong>An opening in The Hague </strong></p>
              <p><strong></strong> Asia knows this whole thing is upside down. The crucial Shanghai Cooperation 
                  																	Organization (SCO), grouping China, Russia and the Central Asian "stans", all 
                  																	concerned neighbors of Afghanistan, met in Moscow last Friday to discuss it, 
                  																	ahead of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) meeting in The Hague 
                  																	this Tuesday privileged by the US.
                  																	<br> <br> This is how Asia sees it - and that's an absolutely taboo issue for Obama to 
                  																	touch upon every time he faces American public opinion: Asians simply don't 
                  																	want US military bases in Central Asia. No wonder Iran, which is currently an 
                  																	observer, and soon to become a full member, officially said the SCO is the 
                  																	right forum to solve the Afghan tragedy, not NATO. A minimum of 40% of Afghans 
                  																	are either Shi'ites or they speak Dari, a Persian language.
                  																	<br> <br> Well, at least Holbrooke admits "the door is open" for Iran to have a say on 
                  																	Afghanistan, but always with conditions attached ("plus our NATO allies"). If 
                  																	Holbrooke is clever, he should immediately buy dinner for legendary mujahid 
                  																	Ishmail Khan, the Lion of Herat, in Western Afghanistan. Khan, a complex mix of 
                  																	feudal warlord and economic developer, told al-Jazeera English "friendship 
                  																	between Iran and America" is essential to solve the Afghan riddle.
                  																	<br> What Washington has to admit is that Iran has been deeply involved for years in 
                  																	visible, post-Taliban reconstruction in Afghanistan - from roads and railroads 
                  																	to restoration of mosques, financing of libraries and <em>madrassas</em> and the 
                  																	provision of electricity. The Iranian Consulate in Herat, for instance, houses 
                  																	no less than 40 diplomats. Khan - the key Iranian liaison in Herat - was so 
                  																	successful in spite of Kabul that Karzai, under US pressure, stripped him off 
                  																	his enormous powers as local governor and gave him an innocuous ministry in 
                  																	Kabul.
                  																	<br> <br> At the UN-sponsored, US-backed international conference on Afghanistan this 
                  																	Tuesday in The Hague, Mohammad Mehdi Akhundzadeh - one of Iran's deputy foreign 
                  																	ministers - officially broke the ice, offering to help the rebuilding and 
                  																	stabilization of Afghanistan, something that Iran is already doing anyway.
                  																	<br> <br> Akhunzadeh was specifically referring to projects fighting drug trafficking - 
                  																	which badly affects Iranian society. But he was also very clear on how Iran 
                  																	views NATO: "The presence of foreign forces has not improved things in the 
                  																	country and it seems that an increase in the number of foreign forces will 
                  																	prove ineffective, too."
                  																	<br> <br> But, significantly, he tipped his hat to Obama's decision to send those 4,000 
                  																	trainers for the Afghan Army, when he stressed "Afghanization should lead the 
                  																	government-building process". As for US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, she 
                  																	described corruption in the Kabul government, ie Karzai and his gang, as a 
                  																	"cancer" as threatening to Afghanistan as the Taliban. One more sign from 
                  																	Washington that Karzai’s days may be numbered.
                  																	<br> <br> <strong>Follow the money</strong></p>
              <p><strong></strong>Did Obama's "strategic reviewers" read this Carnegie Endowment report 
                  																	(http://carnegieendowment.org/files/afghan_war-strategy.pdf)? Apparently not. 
                  																	It states flatly "the mere presence of foreign soldiers fighting a war in 
                  																	Afghanistan is probably the single most important factor in the resurgence of 
                  																	the Taliban".
                  																	<br> <br> So the question Americans must ask themselves is this: Would you buy a used car 
                  																	- sorry - war from people like Mullen, Petraeus, McKiernan? Well, former CIA 
                  																	analyst Ray McGovern, who's seen them all since John F Kennedy, wouldn't. For 
                  																	him, "they resemble all too closely the gutless general officers who never 
                  																	looked down at what was really happening in Vietnam. The Joint Chiefs of Staff 
                  																	of the time have been called, not without reason, 'a sewer of deceit'."
                  																	<br> <br> So what if the AfPak quagmire had nothing to do with "terrorists" but with 
                  																	these facts:
                  																	<br> <br> <strong>1.</strong> A Cold War mentality in action still prevailing at the Pentagon. That 
                  																	explains a Vietnam-style surge - expanding the war to Cambodia then, expanding 
                  																	it to Pakistan now. As University of Michigan's Juan Cole has pointed out, the 
                  																	rationale is the same old fallacious domino theory (communism will take over 
                  																	Southeast Asia, terrorism will take over Central/South Asia). The Taliban are 
                  																	simply not able to take over and control the whole of Afghanistan (they didn't 
                  																	from 1996 to 2001). Al-Qaeda simply can't have bases in Afghanistan: they would 
                  																	be bombed to smithereens by the 80,000-strong Afghan Army plus Bagram-based US 
                  																	air strikes.
                  																	<br> <br> <strong>2.</strong> The US Empire of Bases still in overdrive, and in New Great Game mode 
                  																	- which implies very close surveillance over Russia and China via bases such as 
                  																	Bagram, and the drive to block Russia from establishing a commercial route to 
                  																	the Middle East via Pakistan.
                  																	<br> <br> <strong>3.</strong> The fear of a spectacular NATO failure. NATO Secretary General Jaap 
                  																	de Hoop Scheffer, absolutely despised by progressives in Brussels and assorted 
                  																	European capitals, is pressuring everyone for more troops to avoid what he 
                  																	calls the "Americanization" of the war. No one is impressed - especially 
                  																	because Scheffer himself was forced to admit troops will have to stay on the 
                  																	ground "for the foreseeable future".
                  																	<br> <br> <strong>4.</strong> Last but not least, the energy wars. And that involves that occult, 
                  																	almost supernatural entity, the $7.6 billion 
                  																	Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India (TAPI) pipeline, which would carry gas 
                  																	from eastern Turkmenistan through Afghanistan east of Herat and down 
                  																	Taliban-controlled Nimruz and Helmand provinces, down Balochistan in Pakistan 
                  																	and then to the Pakistani port of Gwadar in the Arabian Sea. No investor in his 
                  																	right mind will invest in a pipeline in a war zone, thus Afghanistan must be 
                  																	"stabilized" at all costs.
                  																	<br> <br> So is AfPak the Pentagon's AIG - we gotta bail them out, can't let them fail? 
                  																	Is it a Predator drone war disguised as nation building? Will it become Obama’s 
                  																	Vietnam? Whatever it is, it's not about "terrorists". Not really. Follow the 
                  																	money. Follow the energy. Follow the map.</p>

              <p>To mark the 60th NATO Anniversary Summit Noam Chomsky talked to Robert
