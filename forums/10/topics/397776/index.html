              <p class="art-PostHeader">Temasek Review</p>
              <div class="art-PostContent">
              <p>NCMP Sylvia Lim has lashed out at the PAP for “stamping out” opposition representation in Parliament which led to the present predicament it finds itself in today.</p>
              <p>The PAP has lately introduced a series of constitutional amendments to increase the number of NCMPs in Parliament from six to nine.</p>
              <p>Ms Lim argued that while the changes were implemented to reflect the aspirations of Singaporeans to have more opposition voices in Parliament, it is a result of the PAP’s “success” in preventing the opposition from winning seats in the elections via the GRC system.</p>
              <p>The opposition has never won a GRC since the scheme was introduced in 1988. The closest it came to was in Eunos GRC in the same year when the Workers’ Party team garnered 49.7 percent of the votes.</p>
              <p>Ms Lim also noted a speech made by Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong in 2006 in which he admitted that GRCs has helped PAP recruit fresh candidates as “without some assurance of a good chance of winning at least their first election, many able and successful young Singaporeans may not risk their careers to join politics.”</p>
              <p><em>“The root causes of our current problems are the abuse of the GRC system and gerrymandering. These have curtailed the expression of the people’s desires at the elections and instead promoted the ruling party’s own agenda. The PAP has created the problem which it is now trying to solve. But we should instead tackle the root causes for a more lasting and sustainable political future for Singapore,” </em>Ms Lim added.</p>
              <p>Though a third of the electorate voted for the opposition during the 2006 general election, they are represented by only two out of eighty four seats in Parliament.</p>
              <p>While the constitutional amendments may increase the number of opposition MPs in Parliament, they will not have dent the PAP’s political hegemony so long it continues to have more than the two-thirds majority needed to introduce bills and legislation as it sees fit.</p>
              <p>With no strong opposition in Parliament to check on the ruling party, Singaporeans will have no choice but to put up with the status quo for many years ahead.</p>

              <p><br>Politics is never a fair game, if anyone think it is fair, he/she can go back and suck milk bottle again,  opposition need to find the niche in election, they must hv an election plan, just like a battleplan, dun just sit there and be sitting duck, like Obama, going thru Youtube alone is able to get that extra 20% support liao, so what is our opposition game plan. Dun alway blame on the defender tactic, ask yourself, as a conqueror, what should i do and destroy them ya.</p>

Dun alway blame on the defender tactic, ask yourself, as a conqueror, what should i do and destroy them ya.</div>

              <p>Then oppositions must challenge them, get together and brainstorm it out on how to counter it, for eg: tell citizens what is lift upgrading when they should have build a new flat for you with llift on everyfloor, upgrading is very inconvience with lots of noises and constrution going on, and if one is having an examination, god bless them.</p>
              <p>But instead of oppositions getting united, they created distrust and hatre among each other leading to resignation, coup de grace of chairmanship and so much internal politics. If your own house is not clean and straight, how on earth are you going to take on others??</p>
