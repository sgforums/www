              <p><br>Which political ruling leaders at an election dun do all these type of stuff</p>
              <p>"using of election sweetener to buy vote,<br>merrygendering of important issues during election period,<br>drawing and redrawing of election boundaries so that the opposition cannot gain foothold in a constitution by doing field work,<br>artificial economic preening during election period so that people have the feel good factor."</p>
              <p>if that leader dun do it, then i think he is not a politician. Politic are mend to be unfair and dirty. If you are not dirty and very fair, you dun fit the bills, stop kidding yourself with trust and honest. The opposition must work in a way, that if they can wins them, join them, be dirty, be unfair, put mole into their party, play games with them so that they are not so sure of your movement, look at the laws and process of election, where are the flaws to go into it, do your own field works, shows that citizens that it is common before any election there will be good economic gain and give out and after that, all pay and pay, opposition can alway draft out the statistic to show in from the 90s to 2006 as a proven facts.</p>
              <p>To wins the ruling party, you got to be more dirtier than them, the malaysia uses sodomy and affair to down their politicians, the thais use rural area peoples, the philipino use movie star, the indonesia use rupiah, how about setting up Mah Bow Tan having affair with a young sexy beautiful gal like me, the taiwanese do that to down their opponent, this is what i meant by being dirtier ya.</p>
