And to find a relationship with China that is advantageous. There are products that Australia makes uniquely well, that it makes uniquely well at certain times of the year, that is the sort of thing that China is seeking to import. [b]Seeking to compete with China on the basis of cost, on the basis of being in the same market that they're in where labour cost is critical, is a losing game.</a></strong><a href="http://www.abc.net.au/landline/content/2006/s1595076.htm" rel="nofollow"> China's great advantage is not, as we often think of it, low cost, unskilled labour. Their great advantage is low cost, skilled labour. They graduate nowadays between 500,000 and one million engineers a year. Now, in Australia we graduate about 5,000. Those engineers are paid, to emphasise, one fifteenth of what we are paid. So they are very good at using skilled labour to add value to their products. <strong>Trying to fight that head-on is a dead-end game.</strong><br></a><br><br>At least someone else shares my view.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> [/b]</blockquote>Hey thanks for that bro  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Awesome quote too  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>2 thumbs up</div>

Gahment has a strategy to concentrate in industries that China find hard to use cheap labor to advantage. I don't think it has made a claim in public that they expect SG to compete with China in terms of wage.<br><br>BUT its actions make me inclined to believe otherwise. Why open the flood gates to so much FT to compete with our poor? Will it not invite a price war due to oversupply and reduce the wages of our poor? Just because we don't give you babies?

But how do you tell if you are a true Aussie? Here are my 43 top ways to tell if you're a local.<br><br>You know you're Australian if Â…<br><br>1. You know the meaning of the word "girt".<br><br>2. You believe that stubbies can be either drunk or worn.<br><br>3. You think it's normal to have a leader called Kevin.<br><br>4. You waddle when you walk due to the 53 expired petrol discount vouchers stuffed in your wallet or purse.<br><br>5. You've made a bong out of your garden hose rather than use it for something illegal such as watering the garden.<br><br>6. You believe it is appropriate to put a rubber in your son's pencil case when he first attends school.<br><br>7. When you hear that an American "roots for his team" you wonder how often and with whom.<br><br>8. You understand that the phrase "a group of women wearing black thongs" refers to footwear and may be less alluring than it sounds.<br><br>9. You pronounce Melbourne as "Mel-bin".<br><br>10. You pronounce Penrith as "Pen-riff".<br><br>11. You believe the "l" in the word "Australia" is optional.<br><br>12. You can translate: "Dazza and Shazza played Acca Dacca on the way to Maccas."<br><br>13. You believe it makes perfect sense for a nation to decorate its highways with large fibreglass bananas, prawns and sheep.<br><br>14. You call your best friend "a total bastard" but someone you really, truly despise is just "a bit of a bastard".<br><br>15. You think "Woolloomooloo" is a perfectly reasonable name for a place.<br><br>16. You're secretly proud of our killer wildlife.<br><br>17. You believe it makes sense for a country to have a $1 coin that's twice as big as its $2 coin.<br><br>18. You understand that "Wagga Wagga" can be abbreviated to "Wagga" but "Woy Woy" can't be called "Woy".<br><br>19. You believe that cooked-down axlegrease makes a good breakfast spread.<br><br>20. You believe all famous Kiwis are actually Australian, until they stuff up, at which point they again become Kiwis.<br><br>21. Hamburger. Beetroot. Of course.<br><br>22. You know that certain words must, by law, be shouted out during any rendition of the Angels' song Am I Ever Gonna See Your Face Again.<br><br>23. You believe, as an article of faith, that the confectionary known as the Wagon Wheel has become smaller with every passing year.<br><br>24. You still don't get why the "Labor" in "Australian Labor Party" is not spelt with a "u".<br><br>25. You wear ugh boots outside the house.<br><br>26. You believe, as an article of faith, that every important discovery in the world was made by an Australian but then sold off to the Yanks for a pittance.<br><br>27. You believe that the more you shorten someone's name the more you like them.<br><br>28. Whatever your linguistic skills, you find yourself able to order takeaway fluently in every Asian language.<br><br>29. You understand that "excuse me" can sound rude, while "scuse me" is always polite.<br><br>30. You know what it's like to swallow a fly, on occasion via your nose.<br><br>31. You understand that "you" has a plural and that it's "youse".<br><br>32. You know it's not summer until the steering wheel is too hot to handle.<br><br>33. Your biggest family argument over the summer concerned the rules for beach cricket.<br><br>34. You shake your head in horror when companies try to market what they call "Anzac cookies".<br><br>35. You still think of Kylie as "that girl off Neighbours".<br><br>36. When returning home from overseas, you expect to be brutally strip-searched by Customs - just in case you're trying to sneak in fruit.<br><br>37. You believe the phrase "smart casual" refers to a pair of black tracky-daks, suitably laundered.<br><br>38. You understand that all train timetables are works of fiction.<br><br>39. When working on a bar, you understand male customers will feel the need to offer an excuse whenever they order low-alcohol beer.<br><br>40. You get choked up with emotion by the first verse of the national anthem and then have trouble remembering the second.<br><br>41. You find yourself ignorant of nearly all the facts deemed essential in the government's new test for migrants.<br><br>42. You know, whatever the tourist books say, that no one says "cobber".<br><br>43. And you will immediately forward this list to other Australians, here and overseas, realising that only they will understand.<br><br><strong><a href="http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2008/01/25/1201157638208.html?page=2" rel="nofollow">Happy Australia Day.---end of quote</a></strong><br><br>44.9 out of 10  major military platforms you want to operate will not work!!</div>
