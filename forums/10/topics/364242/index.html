              <p><span>YALA, Thailand: Suspected Muslim militants decapitated a rubber-tapper and displayed his head on a stick outside his house in the latest violence in Thailand's troubled south, police said Monday. <br><br>The attack comes amid a recent spike in bloodshed in the restive Muslim-majority region bordering Malaysia, where more than 3,700 people have been killed during a bitter five-year insurgency. <br><br>Police said the 53-year-old victim's body was found with the head, hands and lower legs removed at his makeshift house on a rubber plantation in volatile Yala province on Monday morning. <br><br>The attackers stuck his head on a stick and put it in front of the building, they said. <br><br>In neighbouring Narathiwat province, a suspected insurgent gunman riding a motorcycle shot dead a Muslim man in front of his house, also on Monday, police said. <br><br>Meanwhile a bomb hidden inside a motorcycle and triggered by mobile phone exploded in Narathiwat on Sunday evening, injuring ten people who were shopping at a weekend market, they added. <br></span></p>

              <p>The insurgents winning is actually bad for them really. Right now they can strike from the dark and is difficult to track, once they win and become independant they become an open target.</p>
              <p>It's not a matter of will. Thailand could try to exterminate them, then the world would condemn them for being too harsh. It's just that you can't please everyone..</p>
