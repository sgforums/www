              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 14px;">SINGAPORE : The Workers' Party's (WP) Lee Li Lian, a candidate for Punggol East SMC, said at the WP's rally on Tuesday that if elected, her immediate and most important task would be to establish a Punggol East town council from scratch.<br><br>She also proposed that the Workfare bonus - meant only for people with an income - be given to stay-at-home parents.<br><br>She said: "These stay-at-home parents or home makers have chosen to stay at home, to take care of the house and family so that other members of the family can go out to work and attend school and have piping hot meals to serve them when they come home. They are the CEO of the house. But they are given no or very little recognition for their valuable contribution to home and society.<br><br>"They have chosen a noble profession that is no less important than any salaried job. They have often put their careers on hold to nurture the next generation. They should not be forgotten. The Workers' Party proposes that stay-at-home parents should receive the same infant care and child care subsidy as other working mothers."<br><br>Ms Lee also spoke in some detail about what she would do for single parents, if she were voted into Parliament.<br><br>She proposed that single parents who are Singapore Citizens be allowed to purchase HDB flats, and receive the same parenthood benefit packages as married parents.<br><br>She said: "I believe the government can provide more housing options for them, such as two-room or three-room flats. Regardless of marital status, all parents love and want to provide their children with the best they possibly can. Some single parents need caregivers too but they are excluded from tax relief, caregiver relief and maid levy relief. <br><br>"Babies from single parents are also not eligible for the Baby Bonus. While having children outside of marriage should continue to be discouraged in our society, children born to single parents should not be denied the benefits that children of married parents receive. The children are innocent parties and should not start life being disadvantaged".<br><br>- CNA/ms</span></p>

              <p>
              </p><p>Finally someone speaks up for single parents. My sister and I are born out of wedlock and the 3 of us (plus my mom) are still living in a rented room after so long. I'm 19 and has moved house 7 times and we still do not have our own home as under HDB policy, single parents are not eligible to apply directly with HDB if they do not form a nuclear family. Despite approaching 2 MPs, notably, Pasir Ris GRC Mr. Teo Chee Hean 2 years ago and Mr. Heng Chee How in 1997, the then PAP candidate of Hougang, were unable to assist us. </p>
              <p>Although my mother is eligible for the single scheme now, the HDB resale flat is too much for us to afford especially the high COV (cash over valuation). All these years, the monthly income goes to rental and expenditures that sometimes, we could not even make end meets, lest talking about savings. Due to all the hardships, my mom had suffered major depression twice, which nearly took her life.</p>
              <p>We as children felt that it is unfair to the Singaporeans as we were denied of these benefits. There isn't any conducive environment for us to study and we feel inferior. </p>
              <p>Also, single parents were also denied of tax relief.</p>
              <p>I am sure there are many similar cases out there who are suffering in silence. </p>
              <p>I hope this speech will bring attention to the government on their negligence towards single parents (out of wedlock).</p>
