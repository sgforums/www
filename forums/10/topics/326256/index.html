              <p>I think I'm quite tired of all this talk about voting in the opposition and seeking political space when they are not willing to give any.This is a nation where if you question the credibility of Lee Kuan Yew,its viewed as something he can profit from via lawsuit.He's overstayed his time in office.</p>
              <p>To quote Harvey Dent(or is it Bruce Wayne?); "Y<em>ou either live long enough to see yourself become a villain or die a hero</em>."</p>
              <p><br>At this point in time Lee Kuan Yew wields close to absolute power.He wields enormous influence in the political and economic spheres by virtue of his wealth as well as enormous control of the media,via political machinery of the PAP.</p>
              <p>He is an elder statesmen,formerly respected by many, that has overstayed his time.</p>
              <p>The PAP senior cadres and associated supporters are able to generate enough  public noise that they can drown out the voices of the opposition in public.The police are not inclined to grant licenses for the opposition to hold rallies but behave rather differently with the PAP.</p>
              <p>So what to do?As far as I can see,you either become a reformist within the PAP,join a political party that actually has the cunning and intellect to wait out the old bastard or quite politics altogether.</p>
              <p>The best time to confront the PAP is when LKY finally dies.His legacy will be entrenched in the system but without his strong personality to drive it as much they will be prey.Similarly,a large party like the PAP has enormous discipline but I doubt LHL can hold it together without the influence of his father.</p>
              <p>The PAP will splinter,the excesses of the system will be exposed and <em>that</em> is the time to confront the PAP.</p>
              <p>Otherwise,next election,the civil service will work some magic, redraw election boundaries and once more we'll be stuck in our self-imposed gilded bird cage.</p>

              <p>Why worry?  The old man said himself that without him there will be his other members of Pay and Pay, without him Singapore is strong enough to survive.  Don't overrate him.   Without his manipulation of the law, media, instilling fear, attack/bankrupting the oppositions and so on he will not be able to control and run Singapore.</p>

              <p>No country need any dictators to run the country, Singapore included.     Leaders of the countries should work on the interests of the people and not self serving like LKY and his party.   </p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>I think I'm quite tired of all this talk about voting in the
                  opposition and seeking political space when they are not willing to
                  give any.This is a nation where if you question the credibility of
                  Lee Kuan Yew,its viewed as something he can profit from via
                  lawsuit.He's overstayed his time in office.</p>
              <p>To quote Harvey Dent(or is it Bruce Wayne?); "Y<em>ou either
                  live long enough to see yourself become a villain or die a
                  hero</em>."</p>
              <p><br> At this point in time Lee Kuan Yew wields close to absolute
                  power.He wields enormous influence in the political and economic
                  spheres by virtue of his wealth as well as enormous control of the
                  media,via political machinery of the PAP.</p>
              <p>He is an elder statesmen,formerly respected by many, that has
                  overstayed his time.</p>
              <p>The PAP senior cadres and associated supporters are able to
                  generate enough  public noise that they can drown out the
                  voices of the opposition in public.The police are not inclined to
                  grant licenses for the opposition to hold rallies but behave rather
                  differently with the PAP.</p>
              <p>So what to do?As far as I can see,you either become a reformist
                  within the PAP,join a political party that actually has the cunning
                  and intellect to wait out the old bastard or quite politics
                  altogether.</p>
              <p>The best time to confront the PAP is when LKY finally dies.His
                  legacy will be entrenched in the system but without his strong
                  personality to drive it as much they will be prey.Similarly,a large
                  party like the PAP has enormous discipline but I doubt LHL can hold
                  it together without the influence of his father.</p>
              <p>The PAP will splinter,the excesses of the system will be exposed
                  and <em>that</em> is the time to confront the PAP.</p>
              <p>Otherwise,next election,the civil service will work some magic,
                  redraw election boundaries and once more we'll be stuck in our
                  self-imposed gilded bird cage.</p>
