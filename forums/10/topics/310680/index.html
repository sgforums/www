              <h3><a title="Permanent Link to Escape Of Mas Selamat" rel="bookmark" href="http://www.wp.sg/wordpress/?p=69">Escape Of Mas Selamat</a></h3>
              <div class="summary">
              <p>Two weeks have elapsed since the escape of Mas Selamat Kastari from the Whitley Road Centre.</p>
              <p>Since the occurrence, the immediate priority has rightly been placed
              on his recapture. Our security forces have been hard at work in an
              island-wide manhunt, and Singaporeans too have put up with various
              inconveniences at checkpoints and other areas to facilitate this
              massive operation.</p>
              <p>Many questions have been raised about how this incident could have
              taken place in a country which prides itself on safety and security. In
              seeking to reassure Singaporeans, the Minister for Home Affairs has
              established a Committee of Inquiry under the Prisons Act “to discover
              how the escape occurred and to recommend appropriate actions to prevent
              such an incident from occurring again”. (MHA letter to media dated 7
              Mar 08).</p>
              <p>As Whitley Road Centre is gazetted by law as a prison, the
              government’s decision to convene the inquiry under the Prisons Act is
              not wrong. The problem is that the Prisons Act states that such
              inquiries shall not be open to the public. The Committee will submit
              its report to the Minister, and no part of the proceedings may be
              released to anyone except with the Minister’s written permission.</p>
              <p>This raises important questions as to how much the public will
              eventually be told, since the Minister retains the discretion to
              release the findings as he sees fit. In a matter of such high public
              interest as the escape of a high-risk terror suspect from a
              government-run facility, what assurances or checks are there that the
              public will be given full information? In the interest of transparency,
              other governments have conducted public hearings into sensitive matters
              such as intelligence failures.</p>
              <p>One option is for the President to appoint a Commission of Inquiry
              under the Inquiries Act. He can do so when he considers that having a
              Commission to inquire into any matter would be for the public welfare
              or in the public interest. This regime will allow the inquiry to
              proceed in public as the President shall direct. If there is concern
              that release of certain sensitive information will jeopardize the
              national interest, the President may direct that certain information
              not be made public.</p>
              <p>Moreover, since Singaporeans have been marshalled to assist the
              authorities to hunt for Mas Selamat, the least the government could do
              is to keep us fully informed of the inquiry and its findings.</p>

               THE opposition Workers' Party on Tuesday urged the Government to keep
              the public fully informed of the committee of inquiry's (COI) probe
              into the escape of terrorist Mas Selamat Kastari, who has been on the
              run since Feb 27.
              <p>It said that as the inquiry is being carried out under the
              Prisons Act, which means that the Home Affairs Minister retains the
              discretion ot release the committee's finds as he sees fit, this raises
              the question 'as to how much the public will eventually be told.'</p>
              <p>Said the party chairman Sylvia Lim in a statement: 'In a
              matter of such high public interest as the escape of a high-risk terror
              suspect from a government-run facility, what assurances or checks are
              there that the public will be given full information?'</p>
              <p>'Moreover, since Singaporeans have been marshalled to assist
              the authorities to hunt for Mas Selamat, the least the government could
              do is to keep us fully informed of the inquiry and its findings,' she
              added, noting the huge security forces involved in the island-wide
              manhunt, and the various inconveniences at checkpoints and other areas
              which Singaporeans have to put up with to facilitiate the massive
              operation.</p>
              <p>Ms Lim, who is a Non-constituency MP, said many questions
              have been raised about how the escape could have taken place 'in a
              country which prides itself on safety and security.'</p>
              <p>While it is not wrong for the government to convene the
              three-member inquiry, headed by retired judge Goh Joon Seng, under the
              Prisons Act, the opposition leader noted that such inquiries are not
              open to the public.</p>
              <p> 'The Committee will submit its report to the Minister, and no part of
              the proceedings may be released to anyone except with the Minister's
              written permission,' she said.</p>
              <p>She suggested an alternative option: a COI appointed by the
              President under the Inquiries Act in the interest of public welfare or
              public interest.</p>
              <p>'This regime will allow the inquiry to proceed in public as
              the President shall direct. If there is concern that release of certain
              sensitive information will jeopardise the national interest, the
              President may direct that certain information not be made public,' she
              said.</p>
              <p>Separately, the Criminal Investigation Department is also
              looking into whether criminal wrong-doing was involved in the break-out
              of the leader of the Singapore Jemaah Islamiah (JI) terror network from
              the Whitley Road Detention Centre.</p>
              <p>Home Affairs Minister Wong Kan Seng has said that there was a
              'physical breach' and 'security lapse' at the detention centre's
              compound, which has since been plugged.</p>
              <p>The panel, which will also recommend changes to prevent
              similar break-outs, is expected to complete the review in a month. The
              other two committee members are retired police commissioner Tee Tua Ba
              and deputy secretary for security and corporate services Dr Choong May
              Ling.</p>
              <p>In launching the COI on March 2, Mr Wong said he would decide
              on the part of the committee's findings that can be made public.</p>
              <p>Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew has said that the escape of Mas Selamat is a 'very severe lesson in complacency.'</p>
              <p>The search for the fugitive entered the 13th day on Tuesday.
              More than 1,100 calls and emails on potential leads have been received
              by police so far.</p>
              <p>Besides reporting sightings or discarded belongings on the
              fringes of forested areas, many Singaporeans have offered tips on how
              to nab the escaped detainee.</p>

               THE opposition Workers' Party (WP) has called for an alternative panel
              to be set up by the President to look into the escape of terrorist Mas
              Selamat Kastari.
              <p>Instead of the committee that was set up by Deputy Prime Minister
              and Home Affairs Minister Wong Kan Seng, the WP proposed yesterday that
              President S R Nathan appoint a Commission of Inquiry under the
              Inquiries Act so that investigations 'can proceed in public as the
              President shall direct'.</p>
              <p>In a press statement signed by chairman Sylvia Lim, the WP
              noted that Mr Wong's Committee of Inquiry is being set up under the
              Prisons Act.</p>
              <p>This is not wrong, since the Whitley Road Detention Centre is considered a prison under this law, said Ms Lim.</p>
              <p>However, she pointed out: 'The Prisons Act states that such
              inquiries shall not be open to the public. The Committee will submit
              its report to the Minister, and no part of the proceedings may be
              released to anyone except with the Minister's written permission.</p>
              <p>'This raises important questions as to how much the public
              will eventually be told, since the Minister retains the discretion to

              As announced by the government, the independent committee is headed by
              former High Court judge Goh Joon Seng and will look into how Mas
              Selamat, 47, broke out of the detention centre a fortnight ago and
              recommend changes to prevent similar breakouts.</p>
              <p>'In a matter of such high public interest as the escape of a
              high-risk terror suspect from a government-run facility, what
              assurances or checks are there that the public will be given full
              information?' asked Ms Lim, who is also a Non-Constituency MP.</p>

              conducted public hearings into sensitive matters such as intelligence
              failures.'</p>
              <p>Since Independence, seven Commissions of Inquiry have been
              formed, including one on the Sentosa cable car accident in 1983 and
              another on the Hotel New World collapse in 1986.</p>
              <p>In recommending that the President appoint a commission of
              inquiry under the Inquiries Act, Ms Lim noted that this would 'allow
              the inquiry to proceed in public as the President shall direct'.</p>
              <p>'If there is concern that release of certain sensitive
              information will jeopardize the national interest, the President may
              direct that certain information not be made public,' she added.</p>
              <p>She asserted: 'Since Singaporeans have been marshalled to
              assist the authorities to hunt for Mas Selamat, the least the
              Government could do is to keep us fully informed of the inquiry and its

              <p>But Ms Lim also gave credit to the security forces, saying
              they have been 'hard at work in an island-wide manhunt' and that the
              immediate priority has 'rightly' been placed on Mas Selamat's recapture.</p>

              <p>WP urges President to appoint<br>panel to probe JI leader’s escape</p>
              <p>LEONG WEE KEAT<br>weekeat@mediacorp.com.sg</p>
              <p>THE Workers’ Party (WP) is<br>urging the President to appoint<br>a Commission of Inquiry to look<br>into the escape of detained Jemaah<br>Islamiyah leader Mas Selamat<br>Kastari, instead of the<br>committee appointed for that<br>purpose by the Minister for<br>Home Affairs.<br>P a r t y<br>c h a i r m a n<br>Sylvia Lim<br>noted that<br>under the Inquiries<br>Act — a<br>new law<br>passed last<br>September —<br>the President<br>of Singapore<br>can appoint a<br>Commission<br>to look into<br>any matter<br>“for the public<br>welfare or in the public interest”.<br>He can also direct that the inquiry<br>“proceed in public”.<br>Her party’s concern is that<br>the current Committee of Inquiry,<br>as established under the<br>Prisons Act, allows the Minister<br>to “retain the discretion to release<br>the findings as he sees fit”.<br>“The problem is that the<br>Prisons Act states that such inquiries<br>shall not be open to the<br>public … This raises important<br>questions as to how much the<br>public will eventually be told,”<br>Ms Lim said in a statement,<br>even as she noted that it was<br>technically “not wrong” to convene<br>the inquiry under the Prisons<br>Act since the Whitley Road<br>Detention Centre — from which<br>Mas Selamat escaped on Feb 27<br>— is gazetted as a prison.<br>The current committee is<br>headed by retired High Court<br>judge Goh Joon Seng, with former<br>Police Commissioner Tee<br>Tua Ba and the Home Affairs<br>Ministry’s deputy secretary for<br>security and corporate services,<br>Dr Choong May Ling, on board.<br>In response, a Ministry of<br>Home Affairs spokesperson said<br>that Deputy<br>Prime Minister<br>and Home<br>Affairs Minister<br>Wong Kan<br>Seng has stated<br>that “after<br>the Committee<br>of Inquiry<br>completes its<br>inquiry, we will<br>give a full account<br>to the<br>public on how<br>Mas Selamat<br>escaped and<br>what has been<br>done to tighten security to prevent<br>such a thing from happening<br>again”.<br>Pointing out that the escape<br>of a “high-risk terror suspect”<br>was a matter of “high public<br>interest”, Ms Lim, who is a<br>Non-Constituency Member of<br>Parliament, said that if the concern<br>was that “release of certain<br>sensitive information will jeopardise<br>the national interest”,<br>the Inquiries Act allows the<br>President to direct that such<br>facts not be made public.<br>Ms Lim added that “since<br>Singaporeans have been marshalled<br>to assist the authorities<br>to hunt for Mas Selamat, the<br>least the Government could do<br>is to keep us fully informed of<br>the inquiry and its findings”.</p>

              Singapore PAP government and Police force are a disgrace to the nation for unable to catch the Malay terrorist for such a long time.
              
              If the terrorist escape from Malaysia or Indonesia,i can understand it will be hard for the police there to catch the prisoner.
              
              But,Singapore is a tiny little island,our government n police still unable to catch the terrorist.What a shame!!!!
