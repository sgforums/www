You won’t be counted… -Singapore<br> Posted on February 5th, 2008 by Mindy Yong.<br> Categories: Singapore News.<br><br> Away for over 12 months? You won’t be counted… -Singapore<br><br> By Keith Lin<br> SINGAPOREANS and permanent residents who stay abroad for a continuous
                  period of at least 12 months are now excluded from its population count.<br> The move follows Singapore’s decision to adopt a recommendation of the
                  United Nations (UN), which considers people who are away from the
                  country for 12 months or more as having their usual residence overseas.<br><br> This group includes those studying abroad, working overseas and those
                  who have emigrated but have not given up their citizenship.<br><br> With the revision, Singapore’s resident population - made up of citizens and PRs - is 3.58 million as at end-June last year.<br><br> Including foreigners, Singapore’s total population adds up to 4.59 million, below the pre-revision 4.68 million.<br><br> The change was announced yesterday by the Department of Statistics.<br><br> Calculations from its website’s figures show that in the last five
                  years, the number of Singapore residents away continuously for more
                  than 12 months hovers between 70,000 and 90,000.<br><br> In 2003, they totalled around 80,000 and 90,000 as at end-June last year.<br><br> Demographers interviewed said the revision would prevent
                  double-counting and help the authorities plan resource allocation
                  better.<br><br> Calling the move ’sensible’, Professor Gavin Jones from the National
                  University of Singapore’s Asia Research Institute, said: ‘Obviously,
                  somebody who is away for years is not going to be studying in the
                  schools here or using the MRT.’<br><br> Consultant demographer G. Shantakumar said the new measure helps the UN
                  resolve the problem of double-counting when it makes global population
                  projections.<br><br> ‘A situation where two countries count one particular person as part of their individual population can be avoided,’ he said.<br><br> The change does not affect the number of foreigners living here, which
                  is around 1.01 million as at last June, a 15 per cent rise over 2006.</em></td>

              <br> <br> Heard of that? What are you people's various opinions?<br> <br> Mine is that I do NOT support it. What repercussions will this have on
                  Singaporeans overseas? What will happen when they hear it? What if they
                  love the country and long to return once their job overseas is
                  finished? Won't they feel short changed or left out?<br> <br> I mean, it is perfectly alright for the government to calculate the
                  number of people that are overseas. But why exclude them from the
                  population of Singaporeans and PRs? If the PRs in Singapore are counted
                  in, why deprive our fellow Singaporeans overseas of being in the count?<br> <br> Of course, this may seem a small matter to you or anyone. But it might
                  make those overseas feel as if they do not belong to Singapore anymore.
                  Singapore is already facing a brain drain and this is making the
                  situation worsen.<br> <br> I personally think that what the government should do is this. It is a
                  very simple matter of alternating the figures. The government can
                  announce how many people there are in Singapore and how many are there
                  in Singapore as well as around the world, with the latter with more
                  emphasis.<br> <br> So, any other opinions?</div>

              <p>They are just following UN recommendations.  It doesn't matter to me if I am counted in or not (I have been away from Singapore for eons) . It's to prevent double counts . Tis all.</p>
