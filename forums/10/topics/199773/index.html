            <div class='col-md body'>This is a meaningless statistic released by the govt, meant to qwell claims that GIC operates with impunity and without accountability to Singaporeans, whose tax-paying cash is being used without knowledge, for quiet investments with an indeterminate profit-loss margin because of deliberate refusal to declare annual asset worth.<br><br>In truth, the figure raises far more questions that it answers.<br><br>This is typical of the govt. They think cluttering the battlefield with cannon fodder will allow them a home run.<br><br>They forget that more and more Singaporeans rank among the EDUCATED, and are less than likely to be convinced by such poor wayang kulit. In other words, they take us for fools.<br><br>Such arrogance.<br><br>My only wish is that our alternatives attract more candidates from the finance industry; who are astute at analysing statistics and figures and can hold their own against those in the ruling party. Else the ruling elite will delude themselves into thinking they can continue to swamp us with the incomprehensible language of globalisation and financial analysis.<br><br>In this aspect, Steve Chia's stepping down from politics is a significant blow.</div>

Have you suddenly confused fact with fiction?<br><br>I only recall Low Thia Khiang and Steve Chia asking the govt to open the accounts of the national reserves so Singaporeans can view for themselves the status of the balance sheets and perhaps offer more payouts than just the 'progress package'. Again i have no idea whether they were misquoted, since our controlled media will warp alternatives comment to suit the needs of their master. More so since i hardly believe Low Thia Khiang to make such foolish remarks.<br><br>But your comments are rather dismissive: just because a few said it, you whitewash the entire alternatives as out to 'loot' the national reserves for personal benefit.<br><br>So in that regard, since Irene Ng made such foodhardy comments that the alternatives are out to 'cause trouble' in parliament, along with PM's famous outburst against the alternatives (and subsequent apology through his press secretary), can i assume the entire ruling party are brigands who frequent gutter-politics?</div>
