            <div class='col-md body'>Porn will not be legalised in Singapore in the near future. No way. Simply because pornography, in whatever culture, especially in the more traditional Singapore society, isn't justified. And pornography - the consumption of pornography still carries a huge stigma with it, unlike gambling which is accepted as part of festivities and such. As much as the Singapore government is trying to open up and be more liberal, the need to keep our young, impressionable children safe will always be a top priority and legalizing pornography is certainly not going to help that at all</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree with Billybong. It is indeed doubtful that the Singapore government will furthur extend the availability of porn to the local market. Pretty much like how movies and songs are available for downloading and people do download them, with the government aware of it. Yet the authorities do not 'legalize' piracy.<br><br>Moreover, pornography isn't confined to the satisfaction of the male needs. There are other issues involved as well, such as the demeaning of the female body and how it indirectly makes women an object of spectacle. It is demaning to females and women rights groups will definitely protest.<br><br>Wheras the opening of the casino could be - in some twisted sense - be justified by economic necessity and the need to attract tourists, pornography, like piracy - would stand a miniscule chance of being legalized in the near future. The furthurest the government would extend it, in my opinion, is to allow for late night sex chat lines, or the permitting the access of pornography sites on the internet by the use of credit cards and such</div>
