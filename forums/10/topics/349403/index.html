              <p>Wednesday, 25 February 2009</p>
              <p><em>Singapore Democrats</em><br><br><img src="http://www.yoursdp.org/images/stories/TBT/TBT_SubCourt1.jpg" border="1" alt="" width="285" align="left">The 16 <em>Tak Boleh Tahan</em> activists who protested against escalating costs in Singapore last year
              are looking forward to the resumption of their trial tomorrow at the
              Subordinate Courts. <br><br>This is because legal battles are one way
              through which Singaporeans can fight for their rights and work towards
              the rule of law, however long the process may take.</p>
              <p><br>The trial is heard by District Judge Chia Wee Kiat. It commenced
              last year from 23 Oct to 7 Nov. But because it could not finish in the
              allocated period, the hearingÂ  was adjourned to 26 Feb to 12 Mar 09.
              <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The protesters face two charges: one for participating in an assembly
              and another for a procession outside Parliament House on 15 Mar 08.</strong></span><br><br>While
              some may not yet comprehend why the Singapore Democrats and Friends are
              determined <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>to challenge the PAP's unconstitutional ban on freedom of
              speech and assembly, we are convinced that with time and effort these
              Singaporeans will eventually understand what we are trying to achieve. </strong></span><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br>We
              don't do what is easy, we don't do what is safe. We do what is right
              and necessary. And we do it because it will benefit our fellow
              Singaporeans in the long run. This is what true leadership is all about.</strong></span><br><br>Leaders
              must lead and an important aspect of leadership is bringing to the
              attention of the people the pitfalls and dangers that lie ahead for our
              nation. These include the total lack of political rights for our
              citizens.<br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br>Think about it. Despite the enormous amounts of
              reserves the Government has lost through disastrous investments, no one
              is held accountable. Everyone goes about their work as if nothing
              happened. Even Ms Ho Ching's stepping down as chief of Temasek is
              billed as a strategic move. She has not been called to answer for the
              losses incurred.</strong></span><br><br>This happens only because<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> Singaporeans have
              been stripped of their rights to freedom of assembly.</strong></span> In any democratic
              nation, the people would have congregated in public and demanded
              answers from the government.<br><br>What about elections? Can't we just
              vote in enough opposition MPs and change the laws from there? If only
              it were that simple. A government that has no qualms in ignoring the
              Constitution will have no hesitation in changing the rules governing
              elections. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Already PM Lee Hsien Loong has openly admitted that he needs
              to fix his opponents and buy his support. </strong></span><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br>This is why the PAP
              has been in power for half-a-century with almost zero opposition
              representation in Parliament. Do we learn nothing from this?</strong></span><br><br>Leadership
              is not about bossing people around. It is about educating and
              persuading the people, and making the necessary sacrifice so that our
              fellow citizens may see what we see and heed our urgent call.<br><br>This
              is not to say that we don't believe in elections. As we have stated
              repeatedly we will continue to put up candidates and fight the
              elections. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>In fact we have already started preparations for the coming
              GE. </strong></span><br><br>But over and above contesting the elections once every
              four or five years, we also need to work towards political reform. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>An
              opposition in an autocratic system must fight on all fronts, not just
              the elections. Our strategy must be wholistic.<br></strong></span><br>This is why we go
              back to court tomorrow enthused and with a strong sense of purpose. We
              are filled with the knowledge that history and right is on our side. <br><br>We
              will continue to expose the police as a tool of the ruling party. We
              will continue to demonstrate the selective prosecution by the AG. We
              will continue to urge the Judiciary to uphold the rule of law in
              Singapore and to enforce the letter and spirit of our Constitution and,
              indeed, the constitution of the free and civilised world.<br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br>For
              without the rule of law all the house-to-house visits, posters, flyers,
              etc will come to nought and the PAP will continue to rule without an
              opposition in Parliament for another 50 years.</strong></span><br><br><br><img src="http://www.yoursdp.org/images/stories/TBTtrial/tbt18.jpg" border="0" alt="" width="500" align="middle"><br><br><em>Top row (l-r)</em>: Chee Soon Juan, Carl Lang, Francis Yong, Chia Ti Lik, Sylvester Lim, Shafi'ie, Govindarajan, Jufrie Mahmood, Chong Kai Xiong<br> <em>Bottom row (l-r)</em>:
