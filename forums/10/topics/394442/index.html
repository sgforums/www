              <p>Recently, I flip lot of pages in this speaker's corner forum and realize that Singaporean complain about more foreigner in our country.</p>
              <p>I wish to highlight my point,                                                                                                       </p>
              <p>I'm a Singaporean myself and I'm currently working in AMK industrial park, in a factory whereby it mainly consists of 90% foreign worker, mostly were from China, Malaysia, a small portion of Philippines and Myanmar while in the HR and finance department, mostly were locals.</p>
              <p>The foreigner were mostly friendly and get along easily, they tend to smile to you while you walk pass them and are less demanding, they wouldn't mind working more hours with less pay, sometimes they start work from 8am and finish work at 11pm and they do almost everyday and rest on sunday. While the local side, Singaporean girls especially isn't as friendly as the foreigner, when you have the intention of giving them a smile when they walk pass you, they look away and give that f*** face like people own them money, cannot be friendly wan.</p>
              <p>Now i see why Singapore require foreigner to work, the government did nothing wrong to import them, they are very friendly and is hardworking. If Singaporean weren't happy with the foreigner, I am happy.</p>
              <p>I'm fine with the government, +1 vote to the PAP.</p>

              <p>TS is probably lost in identity and does not know his place in Sing, the company he worked for started by ALL Sing and the 90% were layoff and replaced by foreigners........since his worked place has 90% foreign employees...the company he worked for will most likely move out of SG in a few years as 90% of the workforce are foreigners why even pay Singapore rent......</p>
              <p>TS will be out lookin for jobs too....</p>
              <p><em>Singaporean girls especially isn't as friendly as the foreigner, when you have the intention of giving them a smile when they walk pass you, they look away and give that f*** face like people own them money, cannot be friendly wan.</em></p>
              <p>If I were to work in that factories i would probably give TS a F... face look given that  TS is a stuck up supervisor who managed people by intimedation and threats of replacing them with foreigners and......their pay is probably low over work no bonus....</p>
              <p>Conclusion :</p>
              <p>TS managerial skills has reach its peak as he can only supervised lower skill workers. He is unable to motivate and articulate his team mate to perform. The company is not innovative and creative enough to upgrade their way of doing things. Thereby continue to hire cheap labor to maintain their status quo and wait till industry expired on them.</p>

              <p>To this day,</p>
              <p>I am still amazed by Singaporeans who believe that working long hours = good worker.</p>
              <p>We are still very much like in our colonial days, mentality like slaves, though 'slaves' were actually better taken care of by the colonial masters than the current leaders of today.</p>
              <p>I had a friend, several years ago, who said this to me:</p>
              <p>Friend: "I am very busy. I work until 10 pm everyday, and usually also on weekends. Wah, I am really busy. My work very tough, difficult, etc. Hey, how about you?"</p>
              <p>Me: "Oh I get off work on time at 5.30pm everyday."</p>
              <p>Friend: "Wah... your life so good"</p>
              <p>Me: "No. It is just that I am more efficient and productive than you"</p>
              <p>Do you know what happened to my friend? He passed away at the ripe old age of 29 years old due to an illness.</p>
              <p>I am just emphasizing that, we seemed to be proud to be slaves to our work, when in actual reality, life is not about work, but about living life to the fullest. No wonder the West always have better work-life balance, because after so many decades, we in the East STILL have that same mentality.</p>

              <p>I had a friend, several years ago, who said this to me:</p>
              <p>Friend: "I am very busy. I work until 10 pm everyday, and usually also on weekends. Wah, I am really busy. My work very tough, difficult, etc. Hey, how about you?"</p>
              <p>Me: "Oh I get off work on time at 5.30pm everyday."</p>
              <p>Friend: "Wah... your life so good"</p>
              <p>Me: "No. It is just that I am more efficient and productive than you"</p>
              <p>Do you know what happened to my friend? He passed away at the ripe old age of 29 years old due to an illness.</p>
              <p>I am just emphasizing that, we seem to be proud to be slaves to our work, when in effect, life is not about work, but about living life to the fullest. No wonder the West always have better work-life balance, because after so many decades, we in the East STILL have that same mentality.</p>
