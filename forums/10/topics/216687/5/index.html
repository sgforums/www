Is your job not suppose to speak for your people? Instead, you trash them for being unable to face the "challenges of life".<br><br>I am deeply ashamed to see someone as pretentious as you sitting on a parliament seat. Why do I say pretentious?<br><br>If this is how you daughter and father think in private with your elitism views of the society, I cannot even fathom why you should continue being an MP.<br><br>Surely, how can someone like you begin to imagine what it is like to be near bankrupt because of a business failure? How it is to be debt ridden? How it feels like to be at your prime age of 40 and yet feel insecure about holding on to your job?<br><br>Where is your compassion and understanding of the unfortunate ones who are only venting their frustruation through a virtual medium?<br><br>It sickens me to see that sort of remarks coming from a minister.You and your daughter's remarks serves to only disconnect yourselves from the people you are supposed to be serving.<br><br>This is not the kind of leadership that Singaporeans deserve, nor is what most of them want to see.<br><br>If this reflects the mindset of the people who sits together on the pedestral you have stepped on, I fear for the future of the less fortunate, less educated Singaporeans.<br><br>Regretfully,<br><br>Teoh Tian Jing<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Extracted from Mediawatch</span></div>

She subsequently shut down her blog and was later counselled by her tutor at RJC.<br><br>In an interview with The Straits Times published on Tuesday, her father tried to smooth things over by acknowledging that she had used insensitive language.<br><br>However, he said he stood by his daughter's 'basic point', saying well-educated Singaporeans such as Mr Derek Wee should 'get on with the challenges in life' rather than complain to the Government about them. 'I think if you cut through the insensitivity of the language, her basic point is reasonable,' he had said.<br><br>'Some people cannot take the brutal truth and that sort of language, so she ought to learn from it,' he added.<br><br>The MP's comments drew further criticism, especially online.<br><br>Yesterday, in his apology, he said: 'I should not have said what I did about people's inability to take the brutal truth and strong language.'</blockquote>The dad is as bright as the daughter.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Note MP Wee's apology. He is sorry for saying what he did about people's inability to take the brutal truth and strong language. He did not explain if is he holding an elitist's view.<br><br>As a MP, he should be accountable on what he has said on his first respone to tis issue. Basically, what does he mean when he say he stands by Ms Wee's basic point? Is sorry enough? Shouldn't he explain? I thought that our country are led by people with integrity, people who should explain their actions and words.<br><br>Talking about the recent election, it brought to mind an episode regarding SM Goh. During dialogue with Hougang's resident, he talks about the possiblity of having PAP's opposition MP. ie. PAP MPs who is allowed to vote against party's stand. Later, he backtracked and is quoted by the Straits Times as saying he is only trying to find a way out during the dialogue.<br><br>As a minister addressing residents during a dialogue, should he be trying to find a way out or should he be identifying the residents' concern and resolving them if possible? What about PM Lee's remarks on "fixing opposition MPs"? All these episodes trigger alarms on the altitudes of our MPs.<br><br>My apology for side-tracking from the current Wee's episode. I am just expressing my disappointment with the attitude of some of our MPs. I hope that they are just being misunderstood and their comments taken out-of-context. Still, it would be nice to have them coming out to explain their words and prove their integrity.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>(As posted to YoungPap forum on 26.10.2006)<br><br>It will be of no use too if they only know how to talk about noblesse oblige without practising it. I agree that in the first place do the elites ever know their duty to society which give them the opportunity to have all the head-start which others do not have in the public service.<br><br>Term after term, despite all the self-praises heaped upon their own select MPs, Ministers and all the scholar elites they have been caring only for their own policies or self-rewards and afraid to lose their positions or high office.<br><br>So people are left to fend for themselves and some committed suicides by jumping the MRT tracks being unable to cope up with the perpetual fee increases and creative accounting dished out on the lower and middle class.<br><br>So if our MPs and Ministers and the elites occupying high positions in GLCs etc have lost the respect of the people who give them the opportunities but they have failed to serve their due to society.<br><br>So in Singapore the elites who are called talents or scholars have gradually lost their right to lecture or teach anyone else about morality, citizenship duties and responsibility.<br><br>That is probably why with such poor records our elites are no longer trusted but were seen to be hypocrites.<br><br>When MPs fail to empathise with the poor suffering unemployed they will cause resentments if they try to be hypocritical by saying they want to look after the public donations for the family whose bread winner has just committed suicide.<br><br>That is why when Ms Wee Shu Min wrote what she wrote against Derek Wee she was instantly condemned due to the pent-up feeling of the people towards the uncaring elites.<br><br>The elites have lost the right to lecture or moralise any citizens because people have seen through their hypocrisy. The only cure is the remaking of mentality of our leaders, and all the elites so that they will do something to pay back to the people to improve their fellow citizens.<br><br>People expect them to speak up and stand up and challenge wrong policies of the past which resulted in unhappiness and inequities otherwise they will not count as elites or be respected by the people.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><span style="color: red;"> I dread to think that what MP Wee Siew Kim has written is a true reflection of what and how he feels for the less well-off. If we have many of such people in Parliament and top civil service posts, can we not expect the cost of living to keep going up?? And the poor become poorer?<br><br>And he expects all the graduates and high earners to think and do alike, i.e. just accept the challenges, work hard and aim high for their own personal gains. How about those who are at the bottom of the rat race ? Is it wrong for somebody who is more capable to speak on their behalf. Or should they be ignored and if possible eliminated ?<br><br>Do we need to see more people committing suicide (like throwing themselves at a moving MRT train) before our "elected" leaders reaslie that society as a whole is not as rich and glamorous as what they see, or pretend to see.</span></span> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"></div>
