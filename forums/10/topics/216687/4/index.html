He urged the Government to understand SingaporeansÂ’ plight.<br><br>On 19 Oct, Miss Wee, a second-year student on Raffles Junior College Humanities Scholarship Programme, a daughter of MP Wee Siew Kim, responded to him on her blog, calling him old and unmotivated and said he was overly reliant on the Government.<br><br>In dismissing his view, she wrote:<br><br>Â“Derek, Derek, Derek darling, how can you expect to have an iron rice bowl or a solid future if you cannot spell?Â”<br><br>Â“ThereÂ’s no point in lambasting the Government for making our society one that is, I quote, Â‘far too survival of the fittestÂ’Â….  If uncertainty of success offends you so much, you will certainly be poor and miserable.Â”<br><br>She concluded by telling Mr Derek Wee to Â“get out of my elite uncaring faceÂ”.<br></div>
