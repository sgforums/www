But he cannot live without bread at all. The bread is the foremost need of man. Even good morality and love come afterwards. The body needs its fuel and lubrication constantly. Philosophy, missionary zeal, lofty ideals, dedication or love cannot fill an empty stomach. Therefore, at times of dire need, man can stoop to the lowest levels to satisfy his hunger. If his efforts to satisfy his hunger fail, his patience is exhausted. He loses his balance of mind and becomes desperate. He may even begin to behave like a mad dog. At this stage, tell him to wait a little longer or try to feed him on sermons or philosophies and he will hit you on the head. Arguments will not fill his belly. The will only infuriate him. He may even resort to violence without any provocation because hunger itself is the greatest provocation. Therefore, the state should see to it that no body is left hungry.<br><br>The political parties could look into livelihood solutions for the people first rather than idealism... so they say,<strong> <span style="color: blue;"><span style="font-style: italic;">"The way to the heart is through the stomach..."  </span></span></strong><br><br><img src="http://img477.imageshack.us/img477/3548/elitegirlbq5.jpg"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In a small section under home, our dear Mr Lim Boon Heng attend JJC's (Jurong Junior College) DND. In his speech, he touch on the topic of elitism and says that the elite in Singapore do have compassion for the under privilege. He went on to say that elites like the students of JJC should take up the responsibility to society and not should any elitism.<br><br>Not to insult JJC students but are all JC students considered elites??? If I remember correctly, they are top 10 starting from the bottom of the JC ranking. Even some courses in polytechnic have cut-off points are lower than their's. If that is the case, I think all polytechnic and private students are elites too.<br><br>I think they are trying to blur the lines to confuse the public and pushing the responsibility away. LBH is making a fool out of the students and himself.</div>
