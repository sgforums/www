The language was stronger than what most people could take.<br><br>But she wrote in a private blog and I feel that her privacy has been violated. After all, they were the rantings of an 18-year-old among friends.<br><br>I think if you cut through the insensitivity of the language, her basic point is reasonable, that is, that a well-educated university graduate who works for a multinational company should not be bemoaning about the Government and get on with the challenges in life.<br><br>Nonetheless, I have counselled her to learn from it. Some people cannot take the brutal truth and that sort of language, so she ought to learn from it.<br><br>In our current desire to encourage more debate, especially through the Internet, our comments must be tempered with sensitivity.<br><br>I will not gag her, since she's 18 and should be able to stand by what she says.<br><br>The new media of the Internet is such that if you don't like what she has said, you have the right of rebuttal.<br><br>Hopefully, after the discussion, everyone will be the richer for it.

Is Derek speaking only for himself?<br><br>What a crackpot. So this is how our MP thinks. I wonder if PM Lee will stand by him. Now I'm really, really afraid of the kind of people running this country.<br><br>This is the typical case of a father failing his duty miserably in educating his children. Instead, he has the cheek to reprimand others for doing his job for him.<br><br>Apparently, our MP really thinks so lowly of the average citizens and assumes that we cannot sieve through the language and get the crux of his daughter's message.<br><br>Dear Mr Wee and Ms Wee. It is not the language that is offending us. It is the elitist ideology and the 'only the strong will survive, the weak should all die' concept from a highly educated youth (who'll probably be running some big state-owned company some day) that is offending us. Get it?<br><br>People who are born to privilege knowledge of how the system works, people like Mr and Ms Wee, should use this knowledge and their privilege position to help those who cannot see nor has the time to understand (because they are working so hard to earn a living). Is not this the reason why we elect them in the first place?<br><br>If they fail to see this point and fail in their duty, then I say remove them from office.<br><br>And if the PM is reading this, he should do wisely so as not to loose the confidence of the other 66.6% of those who stills support him.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Bottom line is anything a child does is attributed to parental upbringing...So who shall we say is responsible for this??? Your guess is as good as mine....no two ways about it....best part that it sickens us to think that he actually justifies it all by saying that life is indeed tough...Nevermind the attempts at damage control...more like problem escalation<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>C'mon....we all know the facts of life. LIfe ain't hard here and we know but to rub salt to already open wounds and for DAD to agree with DAUGHTER"S BASIC CONCEPT?!?!?!? Get Real...<br><br>So I guess we all have to subscribe to the basic concept??? HEAR YE HEAR YE....this is one more reason why we should all leave this little red dot while we can....<br><br>Personally, I can tolerate imperfections in other countries so long as they are open about it. Don't I get this feeling that things here are a little too perfect for my liking....Just peel away the veneer of the social fabric and see what we get...Don't we all already know it...let them rule the incoming migrants from INdia and PRC. Let's see how future Wee SHu Mins cope with them as from business dealing, they will not be such a gullible bunch...In fact they will bite back cause they have seen the hardships of life in CHINA AND INDIA...let's wait and see after we all have migrated to other lands.<br><br>Bottomline is parental upbringing has failed and yet he still wants to justify and pass the buck...now that is worse than the daughter's crime itself</div>
