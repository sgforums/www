It was the person behind it that raised eyebrows.<br><br>Wee Shu Min was and still is, perhaps one of our brighter talents. Considering the fact that she is under a Raffles scholarship and studying at RJC ranks her as one talent earmarked for our future.<br><br>What shocks people is the manner in which a bright emerging talent has heaped scorn on an average person, simply for mouthing legitimate issues. Worst, she conveniently assumes Derek Wee to be nothing more than a 'leech', a waste to society; one of those who is unwilling to work hard to earn his ricebowl. She goes on to sweep his concerns aside in the same 'elite' manner as some of our superfluous and aloof leaders in the current administration.<br><br>It shows the arrogant and dismissive mindset of our 'elite' class, and if left unchecked, will ultimately lead to a growing dissent among the 'peasant' population. Not only do our leaders have it, their children carry the same streak.<br><br>Like a cancer.<br><br>Is it 'predatory instincts' that provoke our people? Or simply the grave concern that is mounting?  Despite all the warning signs, people continue to accept our govt leaders 'elite' status, offering little more than apathetic complaints degrading to coffeeshop talk. And the more we say nothing, the more these so-called pompous 'elites' believe they are such. The facade mushrooms until the famed meritocracy model becomes just another flawed ideal.<br><br>Being 'politically flogged' as you so aptly put it, is merely part and parcel of entering politics. Your words are scrutinized in vivid detail, dissected and analysed between the lines. What you say is no longer private, except the words "no comment".<br><br>'Awkward privacy intrusion'? Hardly. Since Ms Wee was willing to post her audacious and brutal comments on the net, privacy has no longer any meaning.<br></div></blockquote>You are right.  Privacy intrusion, as claimed by Wee Siew Kim, has no meaning<br>and irrelevant because the Court has already ruled that blogs are not<br>private in a previous case of racist comments by 3 bloggers.<br><br>Moreover, how can one blogger (Wee Shu Min) attacking another blogger<br>(Derek Wee) be considered as intruding upon her privacy?<br>What about her intrusion into Derek Wee's privacy in the first place?<br></div>

Once they are in the place with power, who dictates or formulates the policy or decision that affects Singaporean lives, it does matter to individual who is still in Singapore.
