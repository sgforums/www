In Zaobao's report published on 9 Apr, MOH has encouraged market competition and has no objections for GP to charge at $8.<br><br>The issue is GP is not allowed to advertise, promote or provide discounts their services.<br><br>In Zaobao's report, it was reported that some GP even charge $1 per consultation for some companies staffs.<br><br>Again it was reported that each patient in polyclinics enjoyed a subsidy of $20. That is without subsidy one could have paid $28 per GP consultations.<br><br>So in your next visit to  polyclinics, you must not accept whatever services that is below par than those by private GPs. You must tell yourself that you are paying $28 and not $8 for your visit.<br><br></div>
