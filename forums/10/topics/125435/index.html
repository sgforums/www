Only that what we have now is a minimum charge of $18 per consultation to ensure that even if GPs were to charge that rate, he would still be able to afford to give a reasonable standard of care to his patients.<br><br>Without the minimum limit, the GPs will start to undercut each other to ridiculously low prices. Say, if the GP were to charge only $8 a person, he will certainly not be able to do blood tests, urine tests, give the newest and most effective drug that he thinks is best and yet remain viable right? Considering the high overheads (rental etc) that he has to factor in as well. Also, he will have to see three times his usual number of patients in the same amount of time to earn back his salary. So how long do u think the doc can afford to spend per patient?<br><br>Then u say if thats the case the docs will go out of business, and GPs will close shop etc etc.. ok, then where will that leave us? Everyone will have to cross the island and queue 5 hours to see the few GPs who still manage to survive in Singapore. We wanna pay rock bottom prices yet demand a high level of medical care.<br><br>Medical care is different from say goods and other services. We can tolerate poor service from a restaurant which is trying to cut cost but we cannot have the doctor compromise his level of professional medical care by cutting costs. Human lives are at stake here, right?<br><br>So our system now is such that there is a minimum charge for GPs ( $18 ), and then it's up to the GP himself to decide if he wants to charge the minimum or higher (up to $45 i think). So in a sense market forces still come into play, but at the same time we are ensuring a minimum standard of professional care on the part of the doctors.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Guys, please refer to the reply in today's Straits Times Forum page for a response from a practising family doctor.<br><br>i'm not a doctor myself and of course i would love to pay as little as possible and yet enjoy the benefits of excellent health care. But do u think it will be fair for us to expect good medical service when we don't even pay the docs enough to cover their operating costs? As i've mentioned in my earlier posts, a decline in medical service standards would be inevitable. We have to bear in mind that the neighbourhood clinics aren't charitable organizations.. the doctors have families to feed too. More importantly, unlike polyclinics, GPs are not subsidized by the govt.<br><br>As for how a min charge of $18 will ensure medical service standards are kept.. well, i'm not sure how SMA came up with this figure in the first place. <strong>But my guess is that this figure was probably based on the average no. of patients that a GP sees everyday, such that after deducting the operating costs, the doctor will be able to bring home a decent salary.</strong> Hence with this min. charge, the doctor will be able to do whatever he thinks is best for the patient, afford to spend time with each patient without having to worry about cutting costs to ensure that he still brings home a reasonable salary.<br><strong>Hence this $18 min charge acts to prevent unhealthy price wars and cost-cutting among the GPs, and if any GP were to compromise medical service standards even with this min. charge in place, we can hold him fully accountable since he will no longer have any reason to cut back on his services.</strong><br>However, if we do not have this in place, a GP price war will start, and service standards will drop. We then accuse the GP for poor medical service, but will that be fair for the doc? He's only trying to make sure that he brings home enough to send his kids to school, and is doing this in response to what every other GP is doing! We then legislate as someone suggested to ensure that medical service standards are kept (and how is the legislation going to be worded by the way.. medical service standards is such an intangible entity that is affected by many other factors as well) and voila! it will probably turn out that to ensure this, the GP will have to charge at least $18... and we'll be back to square 1.<br><br><strong>As for whether the $18 minimum charge will ensure quality of medical care, my answer is that it doesn't. This min. charge simply makes it inexcusable for doctors to cut costs at the expense of the quality of health care.</strong> Whether or not a doctor is a good one depends largely on his knowledge, experience and character. I'm sorry to hear about your experience with the senior consultant. I'm sure your dissatisfaction with his services was not because he was trying to cut costs but because of his attitude, or lack of efficacy in the treatment he prescribed right? That could be due to the nature of your disease, or that he simply did not have enough experience in treating your disease. Of course, such intangible factors are beyond the control of even the SMA. <strong>But what we are concerned here is that  doctors will sacrifice their professionalism if they are faced with dire financial difficulties, as will probably occur if the minimum charge of $18 is lifted and a price war ensues.(</strong>believe me, GP practices are everywhere and are very competitive)<br><br>Personally, i would rather pay $18 and be assured that my doc is doing his best and isn't cutting corners than to pay $8 for an ineffective and thoroughly unsatisfying consultation.. and probably having to visit the doc twice more for the same disease as i'm not getting any better. What do u guys think?<br><br></div>

Assuming that $18 is the min average charge for a satisfactory consultation and any lower than that quality will be compromised. Thus the min $18 rule is needed to prevent the price from dropping below $18 which can well occur if free market forces were to come in and competition to lower prices heats up.<br><br>This is the only reason i can think of to explain how SMA came up with this min $18 charge.</div>

Although there's a min charge of $18, the docs are free to charge anything from $18 to $55. In fact most doctors do not charge the min of $18... i believe the average GP consultation would be around $25? There is hence room for market forces to determine how much GPs will charge and which GPs will get to survive etc. As i mentioned, i believe the whole rationale of the $18 rule is merely to prevent unhealthy price wars below viability and hence undesirable cost-cutting measures, rather than to stifle competition among the GPs.<br><br></div>

But i would really like to know if they are doing this by cutting corners. If they are not, then my assumption that $18 is the minimum charge for a private medical practice operating with a reasonable standard of medical care to be viable is wrong. Then we would be back to the qustion of how did SMA come up with this figure of $18?<br><br>If the GP fails to recover his overheads, he has 3 options:<br><br>Option 1: Cut corners to lower cost so as to maintain viability<br>Option 2: Raise the consultation charges again<br>Option 3: Give up his practice<br><br>Ideally, we would like the GPs who are unable to cover their overheads to raise their consultation charges again, rather than to cut corners. But do all business-minded GPs think the same way? As in every other profession, there will be some who will cut corners rather than raise the price, so that they can grab a larger slice of the market share (since they can then afford to charge cheaper than the rest). And very often in medicine, the patient will not be able to recognise that he has received a lower standard of care from this corner-cutting GP, since almost all patients know next to nothing about their medical condition and its appropriate management anyway, until it's too late. And even then, it will be difficult to prove that the delay in diagnosis and treatment was because of cost-cutting measures by the doc, and not because of other factors like the fact that different individuals have different responses to a disease.. when in fact it was.<br><br>The result? Patients will all flock to the corner-cutting GP who charges less than the 'ethical' one. So what is this 'ethical' one gonna do? He is left with 2 options:<br><br>Option A: Close shop<br>Option B: Cut corners too so that he can charge lower and remain competitive with his neighbouring GP<br><br>So there we are. The patient loses eventually, whichever option this 'ethical' GP chooses.<br><br>Btw to avoid confusion, a GP refers to a doctor who runs his own private practice, whereas a polyclinic doctor is one employed by MOH and shouldn't be considered a GP.</div>
