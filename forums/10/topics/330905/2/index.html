              <p>Gopalan Nair comment on the judge behavior and tis should be discouraged. He is not fighting for the country or protesting for freedom etc. IMO he is really insulting the whole system. He literally did it despite the court of people trying their best to make the whole case as professional as possible. Strangely, people seems to think tat watever he do is always right, just because he is an opposition. He can go around and scold people as he deemed fit. Is tat the idea of democracy or wat an opposition should do ?</p>
              <p>If he go to protest for freedom and got caught and jailed, U have a reason to support him. If he try to improve democracy in singapore and get punished, U also have a reason to side with him. But tis is a clear cut case of a person who did commit a crime and shouldn't be pardoned.</p>

              <p>I think you are forgeting the context. Which trial was he commenting on? To have an asspot playing GOD, behaving dishonorably, persecuting dissidents and opposition, using the highest office in the land to "fix the opposition" (words out of the assson's mouth)..... when judges make a fool of themselves and get themselves embroiled in politically motivated case; when judges look at the rules and regulations and forget the CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS.... "build a democratic society, justice, equality..."</p>

              <p>Not you in particular... the bit about assdogs... and as for curses coming back to me... hahahahahahaha... I am a nobody and that is why it is very easy for me to let go and pass on when the time comes... I do not have delusions.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am just making the point (in that post) that you should not look at the insult (I personally do not think that people cannot insult someone if it is true) in isolation and instead look at it in context.</p>

              <p>I look at it in context and still come out with the fact tat he is insulting the judge and he deserves the punishment. Even if he is an opposition member, even if u think PAP sue people too often, I think it is not appropriate to link with other cases since tis is not other cases.</p>
              <p>He insults the judge. True or false ? Insulting judge should get punished to protect their good name and to main dignity in a court. True or not ? Should we protect such an act ?</p>

              <p>in this instance i think it isn't so much of abuse of power but they have turned themselves into the butt of the joke. they have shown themselves to be petty, narrow-minded and don't have a terribly good grasp of the english language. they seemed to have taken the meaning of 'prostituting' in the most parochial sense!</p>
