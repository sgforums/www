            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by sunniban:</div><div class="quote_body">There is a racial divide.<br>But then again its only natural, when everyone speaks their own language......<br>I guess in places when theres a common language there is more mixing.......</div></blockquote>I am kind of worried about this posting. It implies there is indeed a divide in the schools.<br><br>Schools are places where the socialisation of a society's goals are processed.<br><br>As students, teachers and parents, you guys need to ensure that the divide does not continue. We have been using the English Lnaguage for the last 4 decades and if this divide is still prevalent, it will only show that we will have an imminent danger in the future. We cannot affort this risk.<br><br>Furthermore it implies that the current PAP government has failed to ensure racial integration. We only have racial tolerance which can also mean racial "bo-chap".<br><br>As future leaders of Singapore, you people have to stand up and encourage more racial integration and mixture in your activities.<br><br>Singapore is unique and can only be successful if we have racial integration and even encourage racial inter-marriages.<br><br>Honestly we are no longer the same Chinese as China, indian as India and Malay as Indonesians or Malaysians. Its just impossible as as are already a highly Singaporean breed. Lets us not forget this.<br><br>Our race is Singaporean and that is the only race we have regardless of colour, religion or language.<br><br>For those of you who support my petiton to remove race from our IC- please log on to my new topic being posted.<br><br>Thank you.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>mm, yea its worrying indeed.<br>More has to be done.<br><br>And it starts with the little things.<br><br>For e.g. it's impolite to speak a language if there's someone who doesn't understand it.....<br><br>It's alright to speak your own mother tongue and all amongst yourselves, but when there are ppl of other races who dun understand your language, pls speak english, or any other common language.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I do not agree at all with the racial integration thing.<br><br>LetÂ’s not forget that there is a minority race here, with ties to a big neighbour, who may not take too kindly to the idea of a govt mandate to assimilate the population. I do not know what their thoughts are, and I donÂ’t intend to find out.<br><br>Education policies should be about merit, and shd be Â“racially blindÂ”. Even if there is a real racial divide, as long as there is racial harmony, I am not complaining. I have seen enough to know that not all races are after the same thing. Some may want a slower pace society, some may want a more religious society, some may want a more liberal society, and some.. just want to eat cha kway teow. I sayÂ…  forget about any national plan about integration, and just let ppl do their own thing, so long as it does not threaten peaceful co-existence. Afterall, donÂ’t we all want a lesser govt, who isnÂ’t so paternalistic?<br></div>
