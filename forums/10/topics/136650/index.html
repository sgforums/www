            <div class='col-md body'>Is there any reason why we have to pay the COE upfront to LTA instead of paying them on an annual basis? Logically speaking, the cost of a COE is basically the piece of "paper" and it doesnt make sense that car owners have to take loan to finance it. Assuming the COE at 20K and interest for a 10 years loan is 3%. A car owner will end up paying 6K of interest or 30% more for the COE.<br><br>Does LTA need so much money? Are they running into come cash flow problem?<br><br></div>

There is a saying: "You can fool some people some of the time but not all people all the time."<br><br>The younger population is not the same - more educated knowing their rights and how much they can take to support the system of meritocratic gibberish. They are not going to listen the craps about road pricing on three tiers - excise, purchase and driving. They will resist any further attempts to make them pay for a very expensive bureaucracy that never produce results except high cost burdens.<br><br>Government needed to show better reason in collecting and continuing to collect double and triple taxes under all the undebated close-door pretentious policies under previous one-man autocratic rule.<br><br>Without the younger population now to produce this kind of monies - S$500,000 for vehicle in our life-cycle and S$300,000 for HDB flats for which citizens already paid for its land, there will be no hope for any national economic competitiveness no matter what talents they employed (if indeed there are any talents).<br><br>People is supreme. The government should know it. They cannot pretend to use young leaders to put up more justifications to keep to old unworkable policies.<br><br>The first move of the people should be to express their collective desire to change - put in spoit votes to tell dictators to wake up and listen.
