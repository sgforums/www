            <div class='col-md body'><br>As with anything here in SG, it always takes crap hitting the fan before rules &amp; policies gets a re-look...<br><br>======================================<br>SPOTLIGHT ON SCHOOL RULES<br>Should schools be more flexible?<br>Students and parents complain about 'unreasonable' school rules; schools say they make exceptions<br>By Veena Bharawani<br><br>January 28, 2007<br><br>ARE our schools too sticky over rules?<br>Letting one's school shirt hang out, as shown in this file photograph, is not allowed by some schools, even outside school premises.<br><br>Are they too strict in enforcing the rules, so much so that they are blinded to anything else, including genuine cases which cry out for an exception?<br><br>Yes, say some parents and students we spoke to.<br><br>No, the rules are there for a reason, says one secondary school head.<br><br>And besides, we're open to other views, including students'.<br><br>These responses came in the wake of our report yesterday about a Eurasian student embroiled in a controversy over her hair. (See report below.)<br><br>Respondents cited hair rules as one example of how schools sometimes get carried away.<br><br>Said Ms Liane Christie, 43, who has a daughter in Sec 1 in an all-girls school in the East: 'I attended this school as a kid and we were allowed to use blue, black and white hair accessories.<br><br>'Now, my daughter who attends this school can only use black accessories. There's no logical explanation for it.'<br><br>She added: 'Girls are not allowed to use gel on their hair. I understand that it is to prevent girls from spiking up their hair.<br><br>'But my daughter once wanted to use it to neaten up her hair for an exam, as her hair is a bit layered. She managed to get away with it, but these are the rules that I don't understand.<br><br>'It just takes the focus away from educating the child.'<br><br>TOO SHORT TO TIE<br><br>Other parents shared similar grouses over 'strange' school rules.<br><br>One, who declined to give her name and has two daughters in an all-girls school (one in P5 and one in P3), said: 'The school has a rule where if your hair touches the collar, you will have to tie it up or cut it.<br><br>'My daughters have hair just above their collars, (but) they can't tie it when it hits the collar as it's too short.<br><br>'So it means that we have to visit the hairdresser frequently to cut their hair. Why do they have to be so strict about this?'<br><br>Parent Carol Sng, a private tutor, agrees: 'I sometimes see girls with hair just below the collar who have to tie up their hair. It looks very strange.'<br><br>Methodist Girls School's vice-principal Yap Tsui Lan said that while the basic schools rules are there for every one to follow, they are open to students' views on certain cases.<br><br>Explaining the collar rule, she said: 'If the students' hair is too long, it will fly all over their face and distract them. Schools had to come up with a reasonable length and so that's how the the collar rule came about.<br><br>'If hair just touches the collar, then they can bunch it up into a small ponytail and wait until it grows longer, as many of our girls have done.'<br><br>Added Mrs Yap: 'We have a number of Eurasian students in the school who have natural light brown hair and they come and explain this to us and we are fine with it.<br><br>'But if it's outlandish hairstyles or dyed hair like purple or green, of course this is disallowed.'<br><br>Generally, schools don't let students have boy-cuts or unfeminine spiky or punkish hairstyles. The New Paper understands that this is to encourage lady-like behaviour in schools.<br><br>Other teachers say that being strict about rules helps students know where their boundaries are.<br><br>A teacher, who only wants to be known as Madam N Ram, 30, said: 'I have primary school boys dyeing their hair, sometimes with their parents' blessing.<br><br>'We have to be strict when it comes to school rules or not they will take advantage of the whole situation.'<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>All right, let me tell you my experience. Recently, my school's DM asked everyone to bring their thermometer to school.<br><br>But I forgot, and during morning assembly, I was made to stand along with the others who didn't bring it as well. And, the DM even asked form teachers to take down our names and call parents!<br><br>The DM even threatened to suspend all those who did not bring their thermometer to school out of class.<br><br>This is simply outrageous! Don't you think so? When one of my classmates was  tripped over by another student in school and suffered a hairline fracture in his right hand last year, the school did a most pathetic job in handling the case. Behind the background, parents' meetings with principal, teachers involved, it exposes a sinister background in the school's management. When that boy injured his hand, what did the school do?<br><br>So it seems that one bloody thermometer is more important to them( the school) compared to a human being's life.<br><br>The DM said the next day: "Because of BIRD FLU...."<br><br>Please, there is no bird flu in Singapore.<br><br>PUI!<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">When the people fear their government, there is tyranny.
