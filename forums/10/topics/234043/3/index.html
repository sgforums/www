As such, students cannot modify their school uniform (such as shortening the skirts, etc).<br><br>But I've noticed that some school uniform (especially secondary schools) are white...and almost transparent! Some decency! I personally think wearing mini skirts to school would be more modest than wearing that kind of 'can-see-through' uniform...</div></blockquote>ha nor ha nor, when rain that time, always got a lot of free shows to see. And the Top ppl in the school just dont give a damn about it. Leave all those poor girls over there covering themselves with books.<br><br>When ask for change of colour, they will say, white is the colour of the school, it stands for purity. In the end, ask girls to cover up more or bring jacket nxt time.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"></div>

That's a farking laugh!<br><br>Punish students ONLY when they misbehave or have gone totally out of line.

And so after I dyed it, unfortunately, her hair still appeared to be streaked.<br><br>'It's too costly to go to a hairdresser and do it. It would cost $75. I'd rather use the money at the market,' said Madam Salamah, who has four other children and earns $1,800 a month.<br><br>She sent Siti to school with an explanatory note on why she did it.<br><br>'I didn't want anymore fuss. I just wanted it to be over. I thought with her hair dyed totally, she won't have any more problems.'<br><br>SEC 4: Siti with dyed hair.

Why should I do it? Hasn't my daughter been humiliated enough? Dyeing and re-dyeing is very bad for her hair and scalp.<br><br>'I paid $24 on a taxi rushing down to talk about the same issue. It's just ridiculous and a waste of time and money,' said Madam Salamah.<br><br>'Why can't they focus on more important things like her N Levels, which are coming up this year?<br><br>TEARS OF FRUSTRATION<br><br>'My daughter has come home and cried many times in frustration because of this,' added Madam Salamah.<br><br>Siti claimed all this has affected her morale.<br><br>'I really don't like school anymore. I can't concentrate because of this,' she said.<br><br>When contacted, the school declined to go into details of Siti's case and would only say in an e-mail response that they had met her parents and that the issue had been resolved.<br><br>On their hair policies in general, the school said: 'Students should not have coloured or highlighted hair when they are in school uniform.'<br><br>But what happens if a student's hair is naturally coloured? The school did not answer.<br><br>Siti's elder sister, Shahida Said, 19, a former PLMGS student, said that hair rules in the school were even stricter in earlier years.<br><br>'When I was in Sec 2, the school did not allow students to have long hair. If your hair was below your collar, you had to cut it.<br><br>'Your hair was not allowed to be too short as well, as it isn't feminine. A schoolmate of mine had to wear a wig to school because her hair was too short.'<br><br>Another former PLMGS student confirmed this incident.<br><br>Said the girl, who declined to be named: 'That girl cut her hair so short that she looked like a boy. The school gave her a wig to wear as punishment.<br><br>'The didn't want us to have long hair as they didn't want us to waste time making unnecessary trips to the toilet and comb our hair too much.'<br><br>The New Paper understands that PLMGS has since adjusted its rules and now allows students to have long hair.<br><br>[/b]</blockquote>I agree that some schools really kiam kan one lor<br>tell them they dun believe, they dun even fukcing care about the students...they just need "uniformed" robots.</div>
