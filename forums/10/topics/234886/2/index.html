Property Prices Rise at our expense</a><br><br>Yet what they gave the old was not "tangible" but were only leases that they cannot pass on to the young. Also many smart ones simply took the money and ran for their lives overseas.<br><br>That is why the "old" will always vote for them. That is why they always bring up what the previous regime did for Singapore, last time. They mean what the previous regime did for the old in Singapore. How they stole money from the "yet born" and gave it to the "old".<br><br>These are the mee siam mai hum people (born with a silver spoon in their mouth) that have no idea what is going on and only knows how to take more and more money from the people.<br><br>2010 might be a little too early though.<br><br>You need to at least wait until the old man dies; not because he has some mystical powers but that would signal the passing away of the "old" (that benefited) in Singapore and the rise of the young (that are oppressed with no benefits).<br><br>If they continue to order mee siam mai hum, that would be the beginning of the end for them.<br><br>If you are intend to be an opposition in Singapore, I advise you to do it now (to become well known) but wait until at least after old man dies to expect to win a seat. I repeat, not because the old man has any mystical powers but it would mean the passing of the "old" that benefited and the rise of the oppressed young.</div>

But have u thought about it....who allows that to happen? You, Singaporean! Would u agree wif mi that the younger generations are getting worse and soft? Comparing the quality between a foreign student and a typical singapore student, the latter seems to take everything for granted. If you want to get what you deserve, you have to work for it! No point complaining here and there and eventually still vote for govt. If u tink abt it, without foreign talents, Nus and Ntu will stop functioning because many ppl doing frontier research in spore are sadly foreigners. I feel so sad that few Singaporean are doing that. Majority of them are just satisfied wif a normal job and complain abt life without taking action. Dont u agree that if u want the government to hear from the civilians better, the civilains esp the younger generations should be more "zheng qi" and get themselves more educated and social conscious. With more knowledge ,I am sure we can do more. You must know not every Singaporean is as social conscious as u are. U know something is wrong and dare to voice out....but MANY DID NOT!!

In msia,pls dun compare wif those govt company,u are degrading urself  by doing so. In private companies, we hog 12 to 13 hours per day without even grunting. Those ginna in Singapore give them a bit hardship the next day say bye bye liao...seen this b4 personally. In Ns, all those clerks 9 to 5 just chop chop finish job and go home watch tv. Amongst all of these clerks, I only manage to find one that can come up by himself with a good idea on managing mcs and leaves. How can I say that they are hard working with this level. Maybe if fate allows and chance permit, I would like to meet you and bring u to a shipping company in Msia and let u experience a day of working life in private company.<br>Best regards</div>

In the other counties, they might work late but you don't expect them to do 2 or three jobs! There they employ two or three people to do what 1 Singaporean young person does!</div>
