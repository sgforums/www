Only foreigners can survive the Singapore salary because their government does not find ways and means to take their money and tell them it is for their own good!<br><br>FT can live in cheap housing provided for them by the HDB (HDB blocks leased to private operators as dorms) but Singaporeans cannot. If your family income is above certain levels, you are forced to buy their over-priced bigger, more expensive flats.<br><br>FT fall sick can go home for free medical or very cheap medical but Singaporeans cannot.
