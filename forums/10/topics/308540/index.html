              <p>i DO NOT think it is to attract new immigrants sons to perform the duty.</p>

              I think not all NS personnel will be called back for reservist just like i, never kena called back for seven years already. The likely to be called back is
              
              those PES A or B, in a combat vocation.

              <p><br>what is there to be surprise about that?</p>
              <p>what is implied when a person takes citizenship?</p>
              <p>i tell you 1 incident of a new immigrant.</p>
              <p>he works mainly , most of his time, outside sg.</p>
              <p>his family is entirely overseas in his original country.</p>
              <p>he dislikes sg lifestyle or working life.</p>
              <p>i thus asked him, why took up citizenship?</p>
              <p>he said he was given, so why not?</p>
              <p>then i realise he also enjoys using the passport to work in the west and elsewhere.</p>
              <p>before his son turned 18 or 19 for NS, being PR, he gave a reason to give up PR of his son who is now studying in his original motherland.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>so , the moral of my little story is this.</p>
              <p>a person who takes up citizenship does not show me why he took it up. it could be for numerous reasons.</p>

              <p>what is implied when a person takes citizenship?</p>
              <p>i tell you 1 incident of a new immigrant.</p>
              <p>he works mainly , most of his time, outside sg.</p>
              <p>his family is entirely overseas in his original country.</p>
              <p>he dislikes sg lifestyle or working life.</p>
              <p>i thus asked him, why took up citizenship?</p>
              <p>he said he was given, so why not?</p>
              <p>then i realise he also enjoys using the passport to work
              in the west and elsewhere.</p>
              <p>before his son turned 18 or 19 for NS, being PR, he gave a
              reason to give up PR of his son who is now studying in his original
              motherland.</p>

              <p>i have similar colleagues like that before;</p>
              <p>- one FT was educated in hwa chong jc and nus degree in engineering, spoke lousy english and asked me to correct/improve his cv. constantly hear him saying how sg cannot make it and how great china is. strange thing is; he has been here for nearly 10 years with no ns, and think he has moved to usa for work and living there permanently.</p>
              <p>- another FT, saw him in ncs and in the last company, quiet fella and i asked him casually if he has taken up citizenship. he said yes and added that having a red passport is for convenience and nothing else. WTF does he need to say the last statement to me for?</p>
              <p>some FTs are making a fool out of the whole citizenship thing, and thank to the foreign-worshipping, local-bashing PAP that we are in this mess.</p>

              <p>For the new citizen, since they have already taken up Singaporean citizenship, so shouldn't be any security issue (cause we don't allow dual citizenship). They have to give up their original citizenship first.</p>
              <p>If I am not wrong, only 2nd generation PR need to serve NS. And after NS, they can choose to convert to Singaporean (not sure if they decide to remain as PR, need to serve reservist or not, if yes, then maybe so...).</p>

              <p>If those ''FT - Citizens'' decided to stay and remain 'loyal'..... good lor. If they 'Run' at the 1st sign of trouble.... won't make much difference, as alot of S'porean had long ago planned the same thing.</p>

              <p>If those PR wants to stay.... <strong>then <span style="color: #ff0000;">Shut The Fu*k Up</span> and do your NS like all the others S'poreans Boys</strong>..... if NS is too much for you.... or your country have Laws against it..... <strong>then you would have to make a choice to Stay or Leave</strong>.....
