One voted against it. The rest abstained.<br><br>Voting was carried out by secret ballot.<br><br>The minutes stated: 'Therefore, the motion to replace Mr Andrew Kuan with Mr Neo Son Chai as council chairman, with immediate effect, was carried.'<br><br>The New Paper on Sunday understands that the motion to replace Mr Kuan was tabled because of some unhappiness over his leadership .<br><br>Immediately after the vote which ousted him as chairman, Mr Kuan asked to leave the meeting.<br><br>ASKED TO CLARIFY SOME ISSUES<br><br>But he was asked to stay on to help clarify some issues.<br><br>During the meeting, Mr Kuan was queried about why he had not informed the rest of the council of some of the developments within the council, and why it was not told of legal costs incurred in dealing with an issue.<br><br>According to the minutes of the meeting, the managing agent replied that the cost incurred was confidential, and it was up to Mr Kuan, as chairman, to decide whether or not to reveal it to the council.<br><br>At this stage, Mr Kuan again asked to leave the meeting. This time, he was excused.<br><br>This vote was carried out at a usual monthly council meeting and not at the annual general meeting, when leadership changes would normally be decided.<br><br>Mr Kuan confirmed on Friday that he was once the chairman of his condominium council.<br><br>He added that he had been treasurer of the management council for two years, followed by another three years as its chairman.<br><br>He said: 'I stepped down just before I joined JTC in May 2001.'<br><br>Was he voted out?<br><br>'No,' he said. 'I wanted to step down, to hand over to somebody else who wanted to take over.'<br><br>Were the circumstances surrounding the changeover contentious?<br><br>He said that they were not.<br><br>Pressed about whether or not he was voted out, he said: 'No, I was not. I actually wanted to step down because I stand for what I think is right.<br><br>'They wanted a change, and I wanted a change myself too.<br><br>'And I was preparing to go to JTC, so I was willing to pass on.<br><br>'I was looking for fresh blood for a long time.'<br><br>Did he succeed in finding fresh blood?<br><br>He said: 'I let the committee decide who they wanted to take over.'<br><br>Mr Kuan joined JTC in June 2001, as its group chief financial officer.<br><br>He left JTC in July last year.<br><br>Yesterday afternoon, The New Paper on Sunday asked to interview him again on whether he stood by his previous reply that he had stepped down as chairman voluntarily.<br><br>election agent, Mr Francis Goh, 42, replied in an SMS: 'He stands by what he said in his interview with you and he has no further comment at this stage.'<br><br>When contacted, Mr Leo Cheng Suan, a lawyer who advises on Management Council Strata Title matters, said: 'Normally, a motion would not have been required to be passed if an office bearer voluntarily stepped down.<br><br>'It is usually only passed if the other council members want to remove him.'<br><br>ACCURATE REFLECTION<br><br>His Council members contacted confirmed the minutes are an accurate reflection of what took place.<br><br>Mr Kuan's first hurdle on his road to the Presidency would be to show that he has what it takes to be Singapore's President by securing the certificate of eligibility.<br><br>If he gets the certificate, he will have to win the battle for some 2.1 million votes.</div>
