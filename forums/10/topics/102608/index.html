My dad had to be admitted to CGH for chest pain and hypertension once - about 3 years ago. They dismissed it, saying it was nothing - made him pay the 70 bucks. Later when he went to heart center for a check up 2 weeks later - the cardiologist found out he had 3 almost blocked major arteries which resulted in immediate medical attention - he was banned from driving because they were scared he may get a cardiac arrest and cause accidents.<br><br>The healthcare system is so capitalistic that the government forgot about genuinely sick people</div>

However if, as you suggested, we get the 70 bucks from the salaries of the 'upper hierarchy', then i certainly dun mind...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Anyway for the genuine needy who have trouble paying their hospital bills, they'll be referred to the hospital's Medical Social Worker (MSW), who'll look into the matter and coordinate with the hospital to help the patient. Our system is such that basic medical care is always available for all Singaporeans... it's only that if you want better service/better drugs etc,  then you must be prepared to pay more. </div></blockquote>Try getting past the red tape....<br><br>Nowhere in the world dictates that children are responsible for parents in the legislation except in Singapore. I don't mind that law but I feel also that deciding one's parent admission based on the income of the children is downright unfair while the children has to support their children as well.<br><br>Let's put it this way : the government pay their own ministers million per year each . However when it comes down to the minions - they weasle out of healthcare when Singapore's most precious resource is the human resource.<br><br></div>
