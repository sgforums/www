All investment comes with a risk and time factor.  At this moment, it is dependable on the final submission adn also depend how the negotiation be dealt with.  A PE of 3.9 times is not significantly high if you are looking to secure Singapore as one of the biggest player in port industry for the next ten years, I think it is inevitable that we need to find alternatives, especially when facing stiff competition from shanghai port which had overtaken us in terms of container load.  We need to find a niche, and this is one alternative for survival.</div>

"A real contest appears to have emerged."<br><br>One source told Reuters in London that PSA, owned by Singapore government investment arm Temasek, was expected to be able to make a firm offer in the next two weeks.<br><br>"They're not expecting to find anything problematic (in the books)," the source said.<br><br><strong>Global ambitions</strong><br><br>A counterbid has been rumored ever since Dubai announced its offer at the end of November, and speculation grew when PSA began to buy shares in P&amp;O. PSA holds 4.1 percent of the British firm.<br><br>Like Singapore, Dubai is a relatively small commercial center with global ambitions and hopes P&amp;O will extend its reach in Asia and expand its role as a regional hub.<br><br>Should Dubai's bid succeed, it will become the world's No. 3 port operator after Hong Kong's Hutchison Whampoa and Temasek.<br><br>"We are 100 percent committed to this transaction. Ours is the only serious offer on the table," Dubai Ports Chairman Sultan Ahmed Bin Sulayem told Reuters in Dubai.<br><br>He declined to comment on whether Dubai would raise its offer for P&amp;O, which values the company's stock at 443 pence per share, compared with the 470 pence indicated by the PSA approach.<br><br>A bidding war will not be a problem for the two companies, both of which are backed by wealthy governments eager to invest abroad. Analysts said Dubai Ports was unlikely to back down.<br><br>"I think they will insist on having it... It's part of their strategy to diversify," said Wadah Al Taha, head of research at the National Bank of Abu Dhabi.<br>Biggest ports group<br><br>Shipping experts say the deal is strategic for both bidders. PSA needs to strengthen its position in India, while Dubai Ports, aiming to become a global player, has also set its sights on the subcontinent.<br><br>"PSA is interested because of the P&amp;O ports in India and Australia. They (P&amp;O) are very strong in these two markets," said John Ong, a former PSA senior executive who now runs his own port consulting business, Channels &amp; Trends.<br><br>Industry watchers have long expected PSA to make a major acquisition, and a successful bid for P&amp;O would make it the world's biggest ports group.<br><br>Temasek is set to receive S$900 million ($551 million) in cash next month from a payout of excess funds by Neptune Orient Lines, a container liner it controls. It spent billions on stakes in Chinese banks last year.<br><br>Dubai, part of the United Arab Emirates, is armed with mountains of oil cash.

            <div class='col-md body'>Should we end up with P&amp;O and combined with what we already have we will have a huge cash cow to milk, by then we dun really need to chase after every deal out there or worry where the next meal is coming for the next 10 years.<br><br>If we lose this deal it may mean the reverse, we will have to worry for the next 10 years or more because competition is gonna get stiff and dubai with their new found capability and capacity will nipping at our heels every chance they get. There may or may not be another opportunity down the road like PCCW and Optus but nobody really knows how long you have to wait for it and if it is up for grabs you can be pretty sure everybody will want to bid for it.<br><br>I think it could still work, if a bidding war starts TH could bankroll PSA who will only need to sign a note for it.

All investment comes with a risk and time factor.  At this moment, it is dependable on the final submission adn also depend how the negotiation be dealt with.  A PE of 3.9 times is not significantly high if you are looking to secure Singapore as one of the biggest player in port industry for the next ten years, I think it is inevitable that we need to find alternatives, especially when facing stiff competition from shanghai port which had overtaken us in terms of container load.  We need to find a niche, and this is one alternative for survival.</div></blockquote>Also, the thread starter does not understand the dynamics of force acquistion. It's the same trick Oei Hong Leong played in NOL. If DPW increase their offer in fear of losing out to Temasek, the increment alone is a significant profit. If DPW choose not to counter, then Temasek gets control; which to Temasek, is a win-win situation.</div>
