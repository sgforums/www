              <p><strong>The Star Online, 12 Sep 2009, Seah Chiang Nee<br> </strong> <br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Need to wise up quickly to the ways of the world</strong></span></span><br> <br> “WE SAT through a talk yesterday on land investment in Birmingham and
              was shocked when my friend immediately ploughed in S$25,000 (RM60,000)
              to buy a 1,076 sq ft parcel,” an Internet surfer recently wrote.<br> <br> “It had no planning permit and might take seven years to get one,” he added.<br> <br> Yet she took the plunge. Why?<br> <br> “She was enticed by the gifts – a S$600 (RM1,440) camera, S$100 (RM240)
              in shopping and S$50 (RM120) in dining vouchers and two bottles of
              wine,” the writer explained.<br> <br> He was commenting on the government’s search for people with special qualities for posting in China.<br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>“They’ll be hard to find since 90% of Singaporeans
              – and 100% of civil servants – don’t have them; they are very naive,
              easy to be eaten alive unknowingly,”</strong></span> he concluded.<br> <br> I had long wondered before this case what ingredients were needed to pull off a successful scam.<br> <br> When I was a news editor in Hong Kong, I put this question to a retired
              head of a cheating syndicate called Tin Sin Kuk, which had existed
              among the Chinese for ages.<br> <br> The ring consisted of five or six men and women, who would select a
              victim – always a rich person – to take part in “swindling” another
              person, who was actually a gang member.<br> <br> Needless to say, the rich person himself was the target.<br> <br> Sitting in my Causeway Bay flat, the old man said: “For the cheating to
              succeed, the victim must have greed in his heart, the greater the
              better,” he said. “If he’s honest and not greedy, we cannot swindle
              him.”<br> <br> A little naivete helps, of course. High education is no safeguard, he added.<br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>Are Singaporeans too simple-minded – or greedy –
              to be able to survive unscathed in this era of sophisticated scams and
              financial sharks?<br> <br> Protected by a system of laws and a stable environment, they become
              vulnerable when exposed to sophisticated swindlers and Madoff-type con
              men.</strong></span> <br> <br> The old magic stone tricks have made way for modern online frauds,
              credit card cheats and money schemes in which black and white are not
              always distinguishable.<br> <br> <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>“The average Singaporean is honest
              and law-abiding, and tends to think the world spins like that,” said a
              retired manager. “If a well-dressed Westerner spins an investment plan,
              he’ll likely lap it up.”</strong></span><br> <br> As children, Singaporeans are over-protected by parents; and as adults, by strict laws.<br> <br> “I know of 12-year-old students who are not allowed to take a bus by themselves.”<br> <br> When he was commenting on reports of Singaporean businessmen being
              cheated in China at the time of its opening up, university researcher
              Wang Shouqing had said: “The Singapore company is good in a very mature
              environment, but not good in emerging markets.”<br> <br> His implication was that Singaporeans were too sheltered to be able to
              deal with the less scrupulous world outside. Many tend to take people’s
              words too much at face value.<br> <br> Erik Wang, Singapore’s Consul-General in Shanghai, was quoted as saying
              that there was a simple lesson for Singaporeans investing in China:
              “Know how to cheat others more than they cheat you.”<br> <br> Sharing the sentiments was controversial <span style="color: red;"><strong>Taiwanese
              legislator Li Ao, who commented on TV several years ago that
              Singaporeans were stupid because they came from “poor genes”.<br> <br> He ranked them lower in natural intelligence (despite their high education) than the people of Taiwan and Hong Kong.</strong></span> <br> <br> <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>“Taiwanese are scoundrels, but
              lovable, Hong Kong people are craftier, (Chinese mainlanders are
              unfathomable) and Singaporeans are stupider,” he said, adding that it
              was partially due to genetics.</strong></span><br> <br> One Singaporean reacted: “Some Singa-poreans can be very simplistic, because we have grown up in an engineered environment.<br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>“The average Singaporean is good at academic
              studies and works hard, but falls short on individual initiative and
              street-wise qualities, relying too much on the government for help.”</strong></span><br> <br> <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>As affluent Singapore opens its
              doors wider to foreigners, it will likely attract the wrong type of
              people to come and work their schemes here.<br> <br> In recent years, cheating has been on the rise. Many originate from half a world away – through the Internet.</strong></span> <br> <br> This column has also reported on numerous cases of retirees being
              cheated of their savings by pretty, sweet-talking Chinese women.<br> <br> A recent headline said that on average at least one Singaporean falls
              prey to lottery scam fraudsters every day, and this remains a concern
              to the police.<br> <br> Con men sell dreams and fakes ranging from college degrees to job
              contracts. They organise online “auctions” and make off with people’s
              money.<br> <br> The most prevalent are lottery scams, which is a worldwide scourge. In
              a seven-month period there were 210 Singapore victims, cheated of
              S$2mil (RM4.8mil).<br> <br> The amount is, of course, a far cry from the US$50bil (RM175bil) that
              Bernard Madoff cheated Americans of, including some of the most savvy
              investors. Such is the sophistication of this criminal art.<br> <br> Singapore has its own investment scandal, albeit on a much smaller scale as a whiplash of America’s financial crisis.<br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>An activist for clean governance Tan Kin Lian
              explained on his blog that it began in 2006 when US investment banks
              were saddled with mortgages and corporate debts that were turning bad.<br> <br> “They had to get rid of these assets.”<br> <br> They looked for countries with weak protection of consumers which were
              convinced about the merits of using “the light touch” to regulate the
              financial sector and encourage financial innovation.<br> <br> “They found Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan,” said Tan.</strong></span> <br> <br> <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>As a result, some 10,000
              Singaporeans, many of them retirees, lost S$500mil (RM1.2bil) of their
              savings to what they were led to believe was a “safe investment”.</strong></span><br> <br> So far, only a fraction of the money has been recovered.<br> <br> -------------------<br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>Latest @ <a href="http://singaporenewsalternative.blogspot.com/">Singaporenewsalternative.blogspot.com</a>:<br> <br> 1.
