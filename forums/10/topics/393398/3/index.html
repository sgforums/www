              <p>In fact I only replied to Dondontan in such a manner because he dragged LKY into the picture...and yes I have a healthy respect for our MM</p>
              <p>Please know what you guys are actually against (the policies), and don't just attack people (LKY)just because you don't like them.</p>
              <p>LYK is old, he can't manage everything like he did in the past.</p>
              <p>Also, I find it hard to believe that people cannot find work, like what you said. This is the survival of the fittest. If I can find good paying jobs with just an "O" level cert, I don't see why you can't. It all boils down to attitude, if you are gonna rely on the government to do everything for you then you better migrate. In fact Singapore desperately needs locals to fill up jobs, granted most of them are unwanted jobs which are eventually given to foreigners, it's just a matter of whether you are willing to do it or not. No matter where you go, which country you belong to, this will always hold true. It's the survival of the fittest.</p>
              <p>I'd probably get flamed for this, so to prove my points, I've read in the Strait Times about this guy from India who came over to Singapore and worked as a labourer/cleaner, and now he's a rich boss of a company. And he said that Singapore is a place where you can get rich by hard work alone. If he'd stayed in his country he'll still be as broke as before</p>
