              <p>Anyone that see MM Lee or the Prime Minister would know they are from PAP. Similarly for Dr. Chee and Low TK to be from SDP and WP. And if people start to surround them and talk about politics or elections to them, are the police going to arrest them?</p>
              <p>It is amazing that the PAP government wants to implement something that is impossible to implement. If these people are not considered as "symbols", then would wearing any T shirt with their portraits illegal?</p>

              <p>They should lock up MM LKY, and all the other PAP iconic figures.</p>
              <p>Will the cooling off day be a public holiday, or will it be an ordinary working day without any political campaigning ?</p>
              <p>If it is a public holiday - any attempt to open government grounds for free public entry should be seen as a poltical move to enhance the stakes for the incumbent ruling party.</p>
              <p> Considering that in Election 1996 - when several senior PAP Ministers had blatantly contravened the Election Laws - <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.singapore-window.org/sdp0812.htm">‘the Attorney General was very disingenuous to circumvent the words the Law, by claiming that the PAP incumbents cannot be said to be near the Polling Station, as they were INSIDE the station, and hence they did not infringe the Law. (*1) </a></p>
              <p>Can the PAP be trusted to keep to the right side of the Law during the 'cooling off' period - or is this another one of their gerrymeandering tricks of the kiasu Singapore politician ?</p>

              <p>If u had read my 1st reply to this thread...you would have seen that I'm not in favor of all policies passed down by the PAP</p>
              <p>In fact I only replied to Dondontan in such a manner because he dragged LKY into the picture...and yes I have a healthy respect for our MM</p>
              <p>Please know what you guys are actually against (the policies), and don't just attack people (LKY)just because you don't like them.</p>
              <p>LYK is old, he can't manage everything like he did in the past.</p>
              <p>Also, I find it hard to believe that people cannot find work, like what you said. This is the survival of the fittest. If I can find good paying jobs with just an "O" level cert, I don't see why you can't. It all boils down to attitude, if you are gonna rely on the government to do everything for you then you better migrate. In fact Singapore desperately needs locals to fill up jobs, granted most of them are unwanted jobs which are eventually given to foreigners, it's just a matter of whether you are willing to do it or not. No matter where you go, which country you belong to, this will always hold true. It's the survival of the fittest.</p>
              <p>I'd probably get flamed for this, so to prove my points, I've read in the Strait Times about this guy from India who came over to Singapore and worked as a labourer/cleaner, and now he's a rich boss of a company. And he said that Singapore is a place where you can get rich by hard work alone. If he'd stayed in his country he'll still be as broke as before</p>
