              <p><strong>Written by Our Correspondent</strong></p>
              <p>In a sign that the PAP will be tightening the electoral rules to prevent the occurrence of a “freak” election, the display of “any badge, symbol, set of colours, flags, advertisement, handbill, placard or posters as political propaganda” – on Cooling Off Day and Polling Day have been made seizable offences. This means the police can make an arrest without a warrant.</p>
              <p>The Cooling Off Day was proposed by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong last year to enable voters to make a “rational and informed” decision on the eve of the polls.</p>
              <p>With public sentiments against the PAP at an all-time high, there is increasing fear that voters may be swayed by the opposition at the rallies which are usually emotional affairs, to cast a protest vote against it.</p>
              <p>The additional day gives the PAP-controlled media time to react to “unforeseen mishaps” occurring in the heat of the electoral campaign such as a possible faux paus made by some senior leaders within the party.</p>
              <p>The rule will also apply to any election advertising, online or offline. Those who break the law can be fined up to $1,000 or jailed up to 12 months or both.</p>
              <p>Political websites are required to register with the Media Development Authority to engage in election advertising on the behalf of candidates during the campaign period. So far, only two NGOs – Singaporeans for Democracy and Think Center have registered with MDA.</p>
              <p>Further restrictions are also imposed on public assemblies at Speakers’ Corner which will now require a permit from the Commissioner of Police from the time of Nomination Day to Polling Day.</p>
              <p>Public gathering or protests involving even a person is now outlawed under the Public Orders Act implemented last year.</p>
              <p>Though the Singaporeans are guaranteed basic rights such as the freedom of speech and assembly under Article IV of the Constitution, a series of repressive laws were promulgated over the years by the PAP to curtail the civil and political rights of citizens so that it can perpetuate its political hegemony.</p>
              <p>The PAP has governed Singapore for 50 continuous years since 1959. While elections are held on a regular basis, Singapore lacks the other pillars of a functioning democracy such as a free press, a robust civil society and active citizenry.</p>
              <p>International NGO Human Rights Watch described Singapore as a “textbook example of a repressive state” in its annual report released lately.</p>
              <p>The next election may be the last chance for Singaporeans to reclaim their ownership of the nation after which they may soon find themselves being relegated to second class minorities, swarmed by the relentless influx of foreigners that the PAP is mass importing to shore up its eroding support base.</p>

              <p>It is a stupid rule.</p>
              <p>Anyone that see MM Lee or the Prime Minister would know they are from PAP. Similarly for Dr. Chee and Low TK to be from SDP and WP. And if people start to surround them and talk about politics or elections to them, are the police going to arrest them?</p>
              <p>It is amazing that the PAP government wants to implement something that is impossible to implement. If these people are not considered as "symbols", then would wearing any T shirt with their portraits illegal?</p>

              <p>Well, let just enjoy a good holiday, and if it a hot day, go buy herbal cooling tea to cool down, I think if you look from an opposition perspective, it is also good for them, a time for young singaporeans or new voters to hv a closer look at them, not only the govt. As many of the Singaporean lifestyle are busy, stressful and timeless or simply busy for nothing type, most have sway themselve from politics scene, you go down to Wendy, Carl Jr, or ECP or Youth corner at Orchard, you ask those young singaporeans, i bet you, other than our MM, PM, President and MOE, MOD minister, the rest not in their dictationary.</p>
              <p>When i gather around with my youth frens, they dun even care who the govt is, unlike in taiwan, the youth are very agressive in political matters.</p>

              <p>Two side of a coin, it is worthless to read too much into a cooling period. One day not going to move votes vice-verse. Singapore voters are mature enough not to be brought with extra holidays or money.</p>
              <p>The purpose of this law is to provide for a longer 'cooling period' to take the heat from ruling party. Perhap they will impose a much longer period in future to be effective.</p>
