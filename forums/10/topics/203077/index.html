Chong Sixth Form College in Tai Kok Tsui.<br><br>"The Education and Manpower Bureau has already identified our school as likely to attract crowds, and hundreds of parents are expected to queue up outside our college. Police officers will be deployed around our school," Dr Chan said.<br><br>Po Leung Kuk, the city's only subsidised sixth form college, is offering about 360 Form Six places. Competition is intense, with many students attracted by the range of subjects it offers. "I have said this many times, but parents still do not believe me. Some told me they ... wanted to show their children their love and care, so they started lining up overnight."<br><br>As was the case last year, parents will receive numbered coupons, but Dr Chan stressed it was exam results that mattered. Students would not be admitted on a first-come, first-served basis, he said.<br><br>The average scores of last year's intake were 19 points for arts students and 23 for science students. The maximum score is 30 points. The school claims between 70 and 80 per cent of its Form Seven graduates go on to university.<br><br>"Parents and students should deduct four points from last year's average scores as a reference point. If they fail to obtain a high enough score, they should not waste their time in a queue," Dr Chan said. "Many students with excellent results apply for our school, because certain subjects they want to take may not be offered by their own secondary schools."<br><br>The medium of instruction at the school is English and Dr Chan warned that students who had learned in Chinese might find it difficult to adjust. "Less than 10 per cent of our admission is from Chinese-medium schools."<br><br>Dr Chan reminded all Form Five school-leavers to plan ahead before the release of the HKCEE results.<br><br>"They should estimate what grades they will get and think of what they will do if their result is better or worse than expected, or just as good as expected," he said.<br><br>Application forms for places at the college can be downloaded at . A seminar will be held on Saturday for prospective students. Call 2390 5010 or 2392 4162 for details. </blockquote>NOTE:HK secondary education is mandatory 5 years.So 6 th form<br>=Sg JC year one.<br><br><strong><a href="http://hk.news.yahoo.com/060709/12/1pxrk.html" rel="nofollow">2.There are 8 universities in Hk.They use Different indicators to show their cut off points.<br>The different in indicators  make A level students headache</a></strong><br><br><blockquote>Some use Cut-off AL score, two U use Average AL score,few U use Mean AL Admission score</blockquote>good chance for them to refresh their maths.<br>Lucky sg students no need to take this pressure<br>and guess work.<br><br>3.On Sg national day next week,9 Aug,HK will release<br>0 level result.read the news the following day or even<br>on that days see how students run for the place,<br><br>they really has to run ,no joke.<br><br><strong><a href="http://hk.news.yahoo.com/060730/10/1qoox.html" rel="nofollow">Parents practise<br>how to choose(catch) schools and arrange sequence after  result release</a></strong><br><br>Some practise second time and some prepare take<br>leave on the D day to get a place in Form 6.<br><br><strong><a href="http://hk.news.yahoo.com/fc/news_fc_hk1hkcee.html" rel="nofollow">more on<br>HK education news and system</a></strong><br>take a good look at their enrollment sys.<br>sg ''click and click in air cond room to choose schools''<br>are much better.</div>
