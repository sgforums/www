              <p><br>If you look at the way Singapore is run, this dumb country will collapse from it's own stupid PAPist governance before long, no more loyal citizens to defend the country, everything done half hearted by everyone, no pride and intergrity left in this country.</p>
              <p>As I said, time is on Indonesia and Malaysia side, they are just watching us self-distruct, they don't even have to use their army, before long, Sinkapore economy will collapse and through even closer economy ties with them, Sinkapore will be drawn in a unbreaken knot with them, just like the way China is doing with Taiwan in the hopes of reunification.</p>
              <p>I can see PAPist running around like a headless chicken in their economic policies. During the early days, Dr Albert Winsemius plan for Sinkapore growth was ignored and the old dumb Lee wanted to try his own plan but it failed, and he dusted off the covers of Dr Albert Winsemius's plan and ate the humble pie.Dr Albert Winsemius's plan has ended long ago and the signs of PAPist still having no idea on how to grow the economy is telling.</p>
              <p>PAPist has done every citizen a disservice, by filling their own pockets and blocking good clever men and women who oppose them but wanted to serve the country from coming forward and in their quest to have people who ascrible to their rubbish and want to join, they only have lots of greedy and shameless people to join them.</p>
              <p>Money have been spend on Total Defence but no one especially PAPist really know what it is about. I'm sure, not a shot will fired and SInkapore will fall on its own through the folly of PAPist and their cronies.</p>

              <p>No war.. at least not in the near future (preditable future). That is job of regional politicians and leaders to prevent it from happening. We are confident that currently well managed in stability state, no major conflict leave aside war.</p>
              <p>Military built and NS are elements of politic. They are train to fight but not mean to fight. We have to learn to see that clearly. It is balance of power.

Evil of war we should learn more in primary and secondary education. We must know the gravity of words and topic we are talking about.</p>
