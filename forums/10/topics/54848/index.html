If there are opportunities for them to create alliances, it is for them to decide,' he said.<br><br>But would the Malaysian government object to Temasek Holdings - the parent of port operator PSA Corp - taking a stake in PTP?<br><br>He replied: 'In a global world, one has to create alliances for a strategic win-win situation. It is for them to decide who they want to be with, from which country. We leave it to them.'<br><br>Sources told The Straits Times that the thinking in government on this issue was being guided by a realisation that the PTP strategy of offering huge discounts to entice shipping lines across the Straits of Johor could not be sustained indefinitely.<br><br>It was hurting the bottom line of PTP and complicating the decision to expand the operations of the port.<br><br>Even senior ministers in the Cabinet believe that the way forward involves some form of collaboration, rather than tit-for-tat cuts in rates between the rival ports which benefit shipping companies.<br><br>PSA's strength lies in its connectivity and its overall port management, PTP has a cost advantage and a land bank that makes future expansion possible.<br><br>The neighbouring PTP, which began operations in 1999, lured Danish global container line Maersk Sealand and Taiwanese shipping giant Evergreen Marine Corp away from Singapore by offering sharply lower rates.<br><br>In Maersk's case, PTP sweetened the deal with a 30 per cent equity stake offer. With the exit of Evergreen and Maersk, Singapore lost about 15 per cent of its business to PTP, where costs are up to 40 per cent lower.<br><br>But Tan Sri Syed Mokhtar Al-Bukhary, the businessman who controls PTP, has recently been telling government officials that the strategy of dangling its low cost base cannot be a long-term strategy.<br><br>He controls about 70 per cent of PTP and 50.86 per cent in Johor Port in Pasir Gudang via Malaysia Mining Corp and Seaport Terminal.<br><br>His associate confirmed to The Straits Times that talks were under way between PTP and Temasek Holdings, but declined to offer an idea on the nature of the tie-up being explored.<br><br>PSA yesterday declined to comment.<br><br>But a spokesman for Temasek Holdings said it believed there was always scope for PSA to explore sustainable partnerships that make economic sense to all parties involved.<br><br>'As a general principle, Temasek is always open to any business collaborations or partnerships which PSA intends to undertake, whether with overseas ports or shipping lines,' the spokesman said.<br><br></div>

NST columnist seems to relish at the idea of finally having brought this   "sleeping dragon" on "its knees". Nationalistic flavour is never far behind those money talks and so-called business interests. I would view BT's report with skepticism considering the fact that diplomatic relation is now at the their lowest ever.</span><br><br><span style="color: brown;"><strong>New Straits Times (P.Y. Chin, Aug17 2003)<br>Money Game: PTP has proven sceptics wrong but must not be complacent </strong><br><br>SOME years ago, when businessman Tan Sri Syed Mokhtar Al-Bukhary started building his seaport at Tanjong Pelepas at the western tip of Johor, many Malaysian businessmen, corporate leaders and of course politicians were sceptical that Syed Mokhtar would survive financially beyond the completion of the port.<br><br>They commented the project was too massive, let alone getting foreign shippers to stop at the Port of Tanjong Pelepas (PTP), when the modern and sophisticated Singapore Port was just next door, less than 50 miles away.<br><br>Some of Singapore's shippers were also expecting the PTP to fail even before it got off the ground.<br><br>Today these sceptics had to eat their words. Not only had PTP not become a "corporate white elephant", as many would have wished, it has awakened the "sleeping dragon" (Singapore Port).<br><br>Reality has sunk in for Singapore Port officials and they know that PTP will not be fading away, that it is here to stay.<br><br>Singapore Port officials have put PTP on their radar screen day and night and hardly a week passes without some news on Syed Mokhtar and his port appearing in the Singapore newspapers.<br><br>Two weeks ago the Singapore Business Times reported that Singapore Port had been holding talks with PTP, for at least 10 months, for a possible "merger of operations" between the two to take on world trade, instead of fighting each other as competitors.<br><br>One can read many things into this report or one can just dismiss it. But as it is always said, there's no smoke without fire.<br><br>So if one assumes the report to be true, and there is no reason not to, then one obvious inference from it would be that PTP had not only awakened the "sleeping dragon" but has also brought the "dragon" to its knees.<br><br>One may not believe that could be possible given the sophistication of the Singapore Port, until one has read what PTP chief executive officer Datuk Mohd Sidik Shaik Osman told Malaysia's Business Times.<br><br>He said a few weeks ago that PTP had "re-routed between 300,000 TEUs (20-foot equivalent units) and 400,000 TEUs that would have otherwise gone through Sin-gapore".<br><br>This figure worked out to be about 50 per cent of the total cargo from Malaysia that had traditionally been shipped via Singapore.<br><br>"The leakage used to be from Malaysia. With PTP, now it is Singapore that is experiencing the leak." If this is not sufficient reason for Sin-gapore Port to get even more jittery, then the "sleeping dragon" is really sleeping, or rather has over-slept. PTP is definitely not going to go away. It is staying to become the biggest headache for Singapore Port.<br><br>Some Malaysian businessmen would say that Singapore had certainly under-estimated PTP.<br><br>Of course, Singapore Port would say that it was just observing, ready to strike at the right moment with the right strategy hitting at the right places.<br><br>But with about half of the cargo having gone back to PTP, it is difficult to see how Singapore Port would fight back. In setting up PTP, the plan has been seen as simple, with only one objective in mind: Re-divert all the cargoes that have for far too long been "leaking" through Singapore.<br><br>In simple terms, what Singapore has been doing all these years was to develop its port to an extent that Malaysian exporters and importers found it highly efficient and cost-saving to ship their exports and imports through Singapore.<br><br>Singapore was able to provide a point of re-export and re-import of Malaysian products going out and foreign products coming in. Singapore Port in essence has become a "toll-collector" or "gate-keeper", for Malaysia's export and import trade.<br><br>So, it is time that Malaysia gets back some, if not all, of the trade that passes through Singapore.<br><br>Indeed, in a wider context there is no necessity for Malaysian exporters and importers to ship through Singapore Port. And in a longer-term perspective, if Malaysia could develop its ports into top international ports of call for all foreign ships, why not go for it? After all, there is always the strong spirit of Malaysia Boleh, and Malaysians are good at almost anything Â— from building the tallest building in the world to conquering Mount Evert, sailing the Seven Seas solo and swimming across the English Channel.<br><br>At first, it was thought that the traditional re-export and re-import distribution channel through Singapore could be countered with the West Port, building it near Port Klang; the latter being the traditional gateway for Malaysian and foreign shippers.<br><br>At the same time, Port Klang and North Port were also beefed up to show that they had become more efficient in providing foreign shippers with better quality services.<br><br>Though all the ports in Port Klang gained substantially in cargo transshipments, none was able to outdo Singapore Port, which continued to flourish. Then came the PTP idea: To create an entirely different port with a different concept but with the objective remaining the same. PTP is today working beyond every of the planner's expectations and many wondered what it has that Singapore does not.<br><br>The answer is very simple: Study Singapore Port's weaknesses and limitations, and capitalise on them. As it is always said in combat, "Hit at your enemy's weak points, and you will win the fight." Singapore Port has over the years developed to such an extent that foreign ships arriving at there are finding it too crowded for their liking at times, and many ships have to wait for hours to unload their cargoes. And Singapore Port being limited in space finds it difficult to expand fast to cater to the increasing traffic.<br><br>PTP planners use this disadvantage to their advantage, turning it into an opportunity.<br><br>What the planners did was to site PTP in an area where there is a vast hinterland, which could be leased out in parcels for transshipment storage. Singapore lacks the hinterland to provide for such facilities.<br><br>With this strategy, PTP has been able to draw Maersk Sealand and Evergreen Marine Corp to call at the port, with more coming soon.<br><br>PTP handled about 2.66 million TEUs at its six wharves last year, though its current capacity is about five million TEUs.<br><br>But with the completion of the two new wharves by early next year, PTP's container capacity would increase by 750,000 TEUs. PTP has set itself a target of 3.5 million TEUs by year end.<br><br>It certainly looks like PTP is not going to go away for a very, very long time. Singapore would now have to accept the fact that there is a strong competitor at its doorstep, who is not only sitting there pretty well but also stealing its business.<br><br>For now Singapore Port could have under-estimated PTP. But given the resourcefulness of Singaporeans, it would not be long before Singapore Port fights back with a vengeance.<br><br>It is advisable for PTP not to remain complacent and continue to bask in its glory that it could take on the mighty Singapore Port.<br>END.</span><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>We should have confidence that Singapore will handle the competition well, as Singapore also did with most competitors.<br><br>If eventually the PTP have the experience and the skills as of Singapore's port, the only problem with us would be the costs.<br><br>Although we always say that the high cost is appropriate for our quality work, but this tactic may not work for long. This change of attitude of the low cost yet quality work is because of China open-markets. Because they provide cheap costs and quality work (even it is not of high quality, eventually they will become one).<br><br>That's why recently businesses start retrenching people alot, because they have to consider retrenchment as a corporate strategy to improve productivity. Globalisation has made world competition ver shiong. Singaporeans now must understand that now, we may not work for a company for as long as 10 to 20 years. Singaporeans must learn diverse skills to survive.</div>

Chin's article "Money Game: PTP has proven sceptics wrong, but must not be complacent" [NST, Aug 18]. As a Malaysian living abroad I am happy to see Malaysia succeed, particularly in areas where Singapore has previously triumphed.<br><br>But when it comes to the port industry, I believe Malaysia needs to be more circumspect about the perceived "success" of Port of Tanjung Pelepas.<br><br>According to its own management, PTP remains unprofitable. As an old port industry hand, I find this to be a problem given that PTP has been attracting so much new business that it is nearly 70 per cent full.<br><br>Based on commercially viable tariffs, any well-run port (even if fairly new) ought to be breaking even at utilisation rates of 50-60 per cent.<br><br>It is well known, however, that PTP attracts business by offering rock-bottom prices to shipping lines. This would be fine if the shipping lines' cost savings were passed on to Malaysian shippers.<br><br>However, the majority of PTP cargo is either long-haul transhipment between Europe and the Far East, or short-haul transhipment between Asean countries and the rest of the world. There is little cargo of Malaysian origin that goes through its gates, so any cost savings are pocketed directly by PTP's foreign customers. Therefore, by undercutting Singapore at the expense of its own profitability, I fear PTP becomes only a means for Malaysia to subsidise foreign trade passing through the Straits of Malacca.<br><br>In the spirit of Malaysia Boleh, I hope Malaysia takes a second look at the structure of its port industry, and decide on how to develop it in a manner that maximises profit for the country.<br><br>Our champion port, Klang, is the real gateway for Malaysian trade, by virtue of its proximity to the Klang Valley. With an abundance of gateway traffic to pick up anyway, shipping lines might be enticed to conduct transhipment activities with further incentives. Overall, Malaysia should decide how to best allocate its investment ringgit for the port industry, such that growth can be achieved in a profitable manner. It is always satisfying to beat Singapore, but if we lose money in doing so, there may not be much "success".</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>38 years ago, there was no competition. They rest of ASEAN had their problems and were just trying to survive.<br><br>Malaysia was a primary resource produce up to the 80s and only during the 80s they started industrialising. Its only late 90s when they moved into services. And since 2002 then they stole away BMW, Exxon Mobil, DHL and Shell's data centres.<br><br>I base my assumptions on a number of factors.<br><br>When PSA and SingTel was the monopoly, they were bad and arrogant. They gave bad service to their customers. Now, they are more humble when competition come in.<br><br>Same with Air Asia, Silk air had a 10 year lead over Air asia, and now, they are tripping over themselves to follow. ... years squandered due to arrogance. SIA had a commanding lead while MAS was in trouble and once MAS cleaned up their shit, they became the AP's 3rd best airline.

Just because you have some personal problems with me doesn't give you the right to drag the whole country down just to spite me. I am calling a spade a spade.

            <div class='col-md body'>And also, I agree with the letter which you posted. Port Klang (westport and northport) is their main port. PTP is a transhipment port which is meant to steal business away from PSA. Port Klang is their main export port. They are very quiet but their TEUs are much higher than PTP.<br><br>That is what malaysia is all about. They set up one company for domestic usage and one company for international competition. Even their tourism industry has that kind of distinction (Malaysia Truly Asia and Cuti-Cuti Malaysia .. 2 different themes)<br><br>PSA is not hurting because of PTP taking away Maersk and Evergreen ... those are just bad PR. PSA is hurting because less Malaysian exporters use PSA to exxport their goods compared to the 80s. If you notice the border crossings, its mostly cars and food trucks. Gone are the big trailers that bring stuff into the country for export. Loads of PSA business has gone to Klang.<br><br>The next will be the air-freight business. Senai will be transformed into a huge air freight area. Watch as Fedex relocates out of Singapore into Senai, citing cost expenses. We can forsee all this at the layman level. I just hope that the government can do something BEFORE we lose a big customer.</div>
