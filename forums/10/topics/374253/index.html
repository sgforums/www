              <p>when we talk about infighting, we really mean internal strife. like how chiam was ousted form the SDP he founded, how JBJ left WP, how the supposedly hopefuls of WP were ditching it for other parties. PAP doesn't even need to fix them. they'll kill off each other.</p>
              <p>now we have infighting in the most literal sense, in PKMS. for those who hope singapore can execute a japanese style DPJ, think again. didn't someone just say PAP is safe for at least 2 general elections?</p>

              <p><br>Bcos that political chimpanzee CSJ, who Atobe is supporting, is incapable of bringing Singapore to any where else, not the least to say through the next decade. Anarchy for any fence squatter is not a blessing but a bane. Anarchy is about lack of social control and dissolution of society.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> It will never be followed by decades of peace but a struggle to restore human society and creation of a new acceptable constitution.</span></strong></p>

              <p>The reason for SDP and CSJ being in their position is that LKY is terrified that when an SDP and a CSJ - or any other Opposition - should takeover the Government, there will be 52 years of skeleton that will be discovered in all the cabinets.</p>
              <p>The reason for SDP and CSJ continuing to be where they are is due to ignorant Taiwanese "hum" who pretend to be Singaporean continueing the PAP propaganda as if it is the general Bible Truth.</p>

              <p>The name reflect quite accurately to the real personality and the character behind the moniker - when one study the contents of the thinking that has been printed in this Speaker's Corner.</p>
              <p>Are you not admitting your character is similar to a "hum" that splurge uselessly with every burp of ignorance across every thread in total disabandon to sensibility or relevance to the issues ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This is the kind of willful ignorance that you have displayed, and to think that you dare claim to be a Singaporean ?</p>
              <p>How many Divisions do you believe there is in the Politics of Singapore ?</p>
              <p>Do you think that there is the big league and little league for politics ?</p>
              <p>This is the kind of ignorance that you spread with the intelligence of a "hum" -breathing useless waiting to be returned to the sea without any means of mobility.</p>
              <p>Do we need a Taiwanese "hum" to tell Singaporeans who should be our political leaders, and how our politics should be run ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The reason for SDP and CSJ being in their position is that LKY is terrified that when an SDP and a CSJ - or any other Opposition - should takeover the Government, there will be 52 years of skeleton that will be discovered in all the cabinets.</p>
              <p>The reason for SDP and CSJ continuing to be where they are is due to ignorant Taiwanese "hum" who pretend to be Singaporean continueing the PAP propaganda as if it is the general Bible Truth.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Should we immunise a "hum" with the real Singapore Political History ?</p>
              <p>Obviously, you have not been accepted as a Citizen, as you have not been through any immersion course for new immigrants.</p>

              <p>Can anyone beat the X-rated mind in producing lies and half-truths plagiarized from the true Outlaws holding the guns ?</p>
              <p>What 66 per cent are you claiming - when half of the Singapore Electorate did not get to vote by the cunning design of a bloated constituency and sly changes made to the legislation to block any success by any other political parties except the PAP ?</p>
              <p>Your myopic vision has stunted your brain, which explains for your frequent vision in a wall of text that you cannot discern simple English not arithmetic clearly printed.</p>
              <p>We should commend the creativity of an infertile X-rated mind to always compare ourselves downwards with the worst countries in our neighborhood.</p>
              <p>Have you no other originality except to plagiarized the PAP bogey-man stories of anarchy and destruction of states like Myanmar ?</p>
              <p>Even if you take the negative view of Myanmar's anarchy - have you forgotten to add that the anarchy was caused by the ruthless acts of violence by the Military Junta to preserve their illegal hold on power ?</p>
              <p>Obviously, it was inconvenient for the infertile X-rate mind of a kid attempting to wear an adult's shoe.</p>
