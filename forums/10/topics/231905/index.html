            <div class='col-md body'><br>(Updates after meeting, adds Army chief comments)<br>By Nopporn Wong-Anan<br>BANGKOK, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Thailand''s military government<br>summoned Singapore''s ambassador on Tuesday to express its anger<br>at ousted Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra''smeeting with one of<br>the city-state''s cabinet ministers at the weekend.<br>"We weren''t too happy about it," an official who attended the<br>30-minute meeting between top Thai Foreign Ministry mandarin Krit<br>Garnjana-goonchorn and Ambassador Peter Chantold Reuters. The<br>official declined to give further details.<br>Singapore described Thaksin''s talks with Deputy Prime<br>Minister S. Jayakumar as "private".<br>But the meeting, less than a week after Bangkok cancelled<br>Thaksin''s diplomatic passport,upset army-appointed Prime<br>Minister Surayud Chulanont, who said the Foreign Ministry would<br>have to take some "diplomatic actions".<br>Thaksin also used his Singapore visit to give his first<br>televised interview since a military coup on Sept. 19. Hehas<br>spent most of his time since then in exile in London or Beijing,<br>where he has declined interview requests.<br>The billionaire businessman, who won election landslides in<br>2001 and 2005 before opponents started a street campaign against<br>him,promised to quit politics and return to private life for<br>good.<br>However, no Thais got to see him telling CNN "enough is<br>enough" as cable television operators complied with a directive<br>from the Council for National Security (CNS), as the generalswho<br>ousted him now call themselves, not to air Thaksin footage.<br>"We have sought cooperation and given guidelines to<br>television operators on how to keep stability and unity in the<br>country," CNS leader and army chief Sonthi Boonyaratglin told Channel 3 television. "It is their decision."<br><br>ANONYMOUS CALLS<br>No television stations aired the interview, but some morning<br>news bulletins read out international news agency reports of the<br>interview published in the domestic press.<br>Thaksin denied any involvement in New Year''s Eve bombs in<br>Bangkok that killed three people. The army and its interim<br>appointed government have stopped short of blaming Thaksin<br>explicitly, but have blamed the eight blasts on "politicians who<br>lostpower."<br>Thaksin appealed to be allowed to return home to defend his<br>name in person. Sonthi knocked down his request.<br>"Our national reconciliation is gradually improving, which is<br>what we all would like to see. His return won''t do the country any good," he said.<br>Staff at CNN in Bangkok, which is still officially under<br>martial law imposed after the coup, said they had received a<br>number of anonymous phone calls on Tuesday apparently aimed at<br>unsettling Thai employees.<br>In a separateinterview with the Wall Street Journal, Thaksin<br>accused "the old elite" of being behind the coup -- an apparent<br>swipe at the Privy Council, the secretive panel which advises<br>revered King Bhumibol Adulyadej.<br>He also said the interim, post-coupadministration, which<br>introduced capital controls in December to stem a rise in the<br>baht and then tightened up foreign investment laws, was taking<br>the country down the road to economic isolation.<br>"Whether we like it or not, we have to live under<br>capitalist system," Thaksin told the newspaper. "And to live in<br>it successfully, we have to open up our economy and society.<br>Competition is unavoidable, so we have to prepare for it."<br>Thai media had reported Thaksin also met with Wong Kan Seng, another Deputy Prime Minister, while in Singapore but this has<br>not been confirmed.<br>((Reporting by Nopporn Wong-Anan, editing by Ed Cropley and<br>Karen Iley; Reuters Messaging:<br>nopporn.wong-anan.reuters.com@reuters.net; +662 648 9739))<br>Keywords:THAILAND SINGAPORE/<br><br>======================================================<br><br>FYI! the reaction from Thail gov to  our sinkapore gov.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I heard from cable news on TV that Thailand has cancelled an invitation to visit Thailand by Singapore's foreign minister, as a protest for this Thaksin matter.<br><br>I hope the leadership of Singapore will be more sensitive from now on, especially since SG is seen as the principal foreign party involved in the saga which eventually brought down Thaksin.<br><br>It is actually neccessary to deliberately keep a low profile for some time until the situation normalize, in my opinion.<br><br>Also, as a response to a previous poster,<br><br>I dont think Thailand is bullying Singapore. I think they suspect Thaksin might be planning something with Singapore. And of course it cannot be compared to visits to London or HongKong, because as I recall, Thaksin didnt meet any top officials there. He had nowhere to go, so he went to London, HongKong, Bali. Play golf, met businessmen, but I dont recall he met any officials.<br><br>Meat Pao.</div>
