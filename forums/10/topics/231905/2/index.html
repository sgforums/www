So he is innocent till proven guilty in a court of law.<br><br>But in my view, you are wrong if you handle politics like you would with personal relationships. In politics, there are no permanent friends and no permanent enemies. Thaksin was a good friend of Singapore when he was in power. It was in our interests to have him as a friend.<br><br>But the moment the Thai king supported the military coup, which is totally undemocratic, Thaksin is finished. As long as there is a monarchy in Thailand, there is no political future for Thaksin.<br><br>Thaksin is no longer valuable as a friend. He is a liability. As he still enjoys popularity in Thailand, he will be a threat to the military junta. And to be friend of a threat to Thailand is to be an enemy of Thailand.<br><br>Far from treating Thaksin as a friend, Singapore should have thrown him to the dogs the moment it became clear the Thai king wanted him out, We should have condemned him in the worst possible way, claim to have been hoodwinked by him and inadvertently trespass Thai sensitivities....offer to sell shares in Shincorp to Thai businesses at the market rate and offer to donate money to Thai charities as a goodwill gesture. Grovel to appease the new rulers and condemn Thaksin in the worse possible way. Cut our losses and build bridges with the victors.<br><br>Keeping Thaksin as a friend is only worthwhile if he can return to power. As long as the Thai royal family is around, that is impossible. Therefore, dump Thaksin and embrace Surayud.<br><br>Appeasing a victorious enemy is better than supporting a defeated friend.</div>

Yes, if you believe in safeguarding human rights and freedom of speech, there is nothing wrong with Thaksin visiting his friend and speaking to the press. It is the latter that riles the Thai government more.<br><br>I do not believe in unfettered freedom of speech. Singapore should have muzzled him or if we want to avoid recriminations by doing so, arrange for CNN reporters to interview him in Hong Kong. Let the Thais find fault with our competitors.<br><br>I criticize the Singapore government for giving ground to Thaksin's rights. A defeated friend is not worth it.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Thaksin was the official elected prime ministor of Thailand. He been a friend of Singapore.<br><br>Just because he been out by a coup, which till now is not able to come out with evidence of his so call corruption ... to justify his removal, thus it is we have cannot view that Thaskin is a wrong or a criminal .<br><br>Question do you be-friend people when they are rich and doing good, and when they fall , you turn your back on them and shut your door ?<br><br>If you think we should not let Thaksin visit us on social visit then - you better review your view of friendship.<br><br>It is not Thailand business to tell us what to do, when Thaksin is on social visit. It is not their official business - as first they are not the legal election government, they just install themselves by pointing gun at everyone and took it.<br><br>Look at the mess they did to the economy and their management - if they want to mess up their foreign relationship , go ahead. At the rate they are going, who knows when another coup will overturn them, maybe the general will come here for a social visit also , then the new coup leader will protest again . </strong><br><br>you are assuming everycountry will play by the politcal rules set by singapore?<br>if you are on a social visit, why do we need to inform the world thaksin is visiting jaya for a lunch? and at this crunch time when our temasek issues is still not settle? i seriously think we singaporean could improve on our political sensitivity to our neighbour. i dont think anyone of our neighbour want to bully singapore or in anyway dare to. we are military and financially strong nation. if we keep having conflicts with malaysia, thailand, indons and still beliving going by the book is correct.  we simply has lost the human touch of things.<br>A good lasting bi-relationship could not be built on sole financial benefits.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This is Thailand's internal politics. Singapore was wrong enough to get involved. For those fervently for Thaksin's human rights, would you carry arms in defense of his rights? If not please explain why?<br><br>Simple.<br><br>It is none of your business. Singapore has nothing to gain. I repeat again. Singapore has nothing to gain. If there is, please start cleaning your rifles.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Taksin just wanted to bring anxiety to the present Thai Garmen.When they kicked him out he didnt get enough sleep now is his turn to jee siow the Army Generals.The 2dpm couldnt careless either cuz very soon they will be replaced...sorry,I mean step down! Someone here said Taksin went to SIngapore to look for property ,well ah... I dont think any of the two Dpm would make a good property agent,eating BKT is more like it&gt;haha.This man is a billionaire and with that kind of money he could make a comeback if he wanted to but I guess sometime life is more precious than wealth and power.</div>
