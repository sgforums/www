Do you think your majesty Lee will be smiling and do nothing?<br><br>Oh, I am a Thai, BTW.</div></blockquote>Chee is an undischarged bankrupt and therefore unable to leave the country for anywhere. But if your government will pay off his debts and let him have a free trip to Bangkok and conduct an interview there, I am sure there will be no objections from Singapore. Chee Soon Juan is a clown who has lost all credibility in Singapore. Having him on CNN will only discredit him further.<br><br>On the other hand, Thaksin remains a threat to the current Thai government. He still enjoys popular support in the provinces and after a series of errors by the Bank of Thailand, even the middle classes are wondering if this interim government can do it. Thaksin is a far more serious threat to the Thai government than Chee can ever be to the PAP in Singapore.<br><br>I have said it before and I say it again. The Singapore government has made a grave error in this affair. Thaksin has every right to enter Singapore and he has the right to speak to the media (such liberties as I presume Thais enjoy in their own country as well). To prevent Thaksin from speaking to CNN will be to deny him his freedom of expression and legally Singapore was right in allowing him to do so.<br><br>However, I take the view that national interests should come before respecting such personal liberties. Singapore should have dumped Thaksin the moment the Thai king supported the coup and we should not have allowed him into the country. Friend or not, he is now a liability to us. Like a tampon, we should be intimate with him when he still serves his purpose as a friendly leader of a neighbouring nation but like a tampon, when his usefulness has clearly ended he should be discarded promptly.<br><br>Thaksin obviously wants to garner international support as he is after all, the deposed leader in an undemocratic military coup. Why should Singapore support his efforts to fight back unless he can return to power? I hope none of our leaders are daft enough to think that it is possible.<br><br>Thailand is a kingdom. It may be a constitutional monarchy but the king is highly revered and his power is more than nominal. Thaksin's political future does not rely on the military junta or even the people of Thailand. It depends on the Thai king. The moment the king supported the coup leaders, Thaksin is finished and we should have spit him out like a tasteless wad of chewing gum.<br><br></div>

I think Singaporeans (in the island) must stand up to the Lee's and have them admit their mistakes of supporting crooked despot like Thug-Sin, which later brought destruction to Thailand and now Singapore.<br><br>I am pretty impressed that Mr. Kishore Mahbubani, one of my all-time favourite author, came out to warn Singapore that Thug-Sin is 'unfair' and 'unkind' to Singapore. I would elaborate his warning that Thug-Sin is the clear and present danger. This guy has no sympathy for anyone. If he is greedy enough to exploit from his home country with helping hands from the Lee's, what could guarantee Singapore won't be next in line?<br><br>What Mrs's Ho's Temasek and the Lee's should do now to recoup the damage is not to go after Thailand but Thug-Sin.</span></div></blockquote>It is not government threats that stop Singaporeans from criticizing the government over this affair.<br><br>The leftist who support civil liberties have no reason to attack the Singapore government for allowing Thaksin to exercise his right to freedom of speech. Those on the right look at the recent policies by BOT that have resulted in billions being wiped off the value of shares and have little incentive to support the current Thai government, whom they see as anti-business. The punters who visit Bangkok's massage parlours are secretly hoping that the new government will not be as strict as Thaksin was with the go-go bars in Patpong. The academics still view a military coup as an affront to democracy, whatever the motivation.<br><br>Ideologues of all forms do not find good reasons to criticize the Singapore government in this particular affair. The only ranting you will hear are from the anti-PAP crowd who are against everything the Singapore government does anyway and has no credibility. I am a pragmatist and I believe it is in our interest to cut our losses and move on. Dump the loser friend and embrace the victorious general. Democracy and freedom of speech aren't what they are made out to be. It is in our interest to support Surayad.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There is just too much both our contries share in common. We face a common threat of terrorism; Singaporeans just love holidaying in Thailand; we face common economic challenges with the rise of China and India. Aren't those reasons sufficient enough to augur us to maintain a strong and lasting friendship of cooperation? Yeah, there might be differences and huge question marks as to the motiffs of certain actions which probably stem from either arrogance or naivity from leaders of either side, which is regrettable.</div>

For once I applaud the singapore government for honoring Thaksin, politically may be incorrect, but it is a clear support for democracy and the democractic process...
