Or did your vivid imagination lead you to 'believe' that you actually provided factual figures in the first place?<br><br>The impartiality, not 'neutrality' as you put it, of any board of directors is subject to scrutiny, and for each board of directors, there is a panel reviewing their individual performances, on top of the chairman.<br><br>In the case of the old NKF, while the likes of Matilda Chua, Loo Say San and Richard Yong were revealed as 'compliant poodles' bowing to the whim and fancy of TT Durai, do we have any reason to doubt the credibility of UOB and its board?<br><br>Can you suggest why we should begin to doubt any board of directors for that matter? Are you suggesting that every member of such a panel within their own private firm are in collision to 'dupe' their respective shareholders?<br><br>At least there are appointees within each private company who monitor the activities and performances of their senior staff. Can the same be said of our cabinet ministers?<br><br>Instead of making hollow accusations that statistics and reports from Forbes lack credibility, what proof do you have that the profit findings are inaccurate? Making such contentious claims merely exposes your own inadequacy to respond when shown the data. The Forbes report was used because it summarised the net profit declared by SIA in a lump sum, making it simple to interpret. Sowing confusion by referencing various statistical data will merely befuddle the issue, rather than provide clarity.<br><br><blockquote>Anyway, I have never said UOB and SIA are bad...</blockquote>Should i take your statement above seriously? Or do you have selective memory?<br><br><blockquote>Creative and SIA are prob two names most can name, but hey, they are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">faltering</span> too...</blockquote>How else should i interpret your claim above other than 'bad'?<br><br><blockquote>Performance is measured by RESULTS, not whether they are public or private?<br>Look ard you and I hope u can still say our govt sucks when compared to the rest of the world...</blockquote>I totally agree that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">results</span> govern the determination of monetary incentive. But for every denomination, there must be a formula to determine that. In layman terms, it is termed 'performance indicators'.<br><br>What tangible performance indicators have the government revealed to evaluate the results of their ministers? Mah Bow Tan was just quoted recently in claiming that HDB flats will be kept '<span style="text-decoration: underline;">affordable'</span> in the near future, but what does he mean by <span style="color: red;"><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">affordable</span></strong></span>? A single 3-foot flat is already a 6-figure sum, and HDB was recently <strong><span style="font-style: italic;">unable to respond convincingly </span></strong>to a comment that HDB flats are sold at a <strong><span style="color: darkblue;">discount</span></strong> and not a <span style="color: darkblue;"><strong>subsidy</strong></span> as claimed by HDB.<br><br>More lip service from Mah?

I don't really care how government rewards its officers, as long as its service level is upheld.<br><br>The way to justify the increase in civil service pay is not to always draw a comparison with private sector pay. PM should spell out concrete measures for greater transparency in the way government sets and achieves targets eg. improving public transport, reduction waiting times at polyclinic etc. If government can make those targets, then it can rightly justify higher pay for its officers.<br></div>
