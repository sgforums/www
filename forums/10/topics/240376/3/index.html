Making such contentious claims merely exposes your own inadequacy to respond when shown the data. The Forbes report was used because it summarised the net profit declared by SIA in a lump sum, making it simple to interpret. Sowing confusion by referencing various statistical data will merely befuddle the issue, rather than provide clarity.<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><strong>Do not put words into my mouth. At no point had I said Forbes lack credibility. The prob I had was that you had read but one positive report while ignoring others. </strong><br><br>quote:<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Originally posted by BillyBong:<br>What tangible performance indicators have the government revealed to evaluate the results of their ministers? Mah Bow Tan was just quoted recently in claiming that HDB flats will be kept 'affordable' in the near future, but what does he mean by affordable? A single 3-foot flat is already a 6-figure sum, and HDB was recently unable to respond convincingly to a comment that HDB flats are sold at a discount and not a subsidy as claimed by HDB.<br><br>More lip service from Mah? Do we measure our ministers in this manner? By word of mouth and generalisation?<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><strong>We are in agreement here though. I dun have positive words for MBT too. When he was in Sports, he dreamt an impossible 2010 to paint a rosy picture. Nicoll highway started construction during his days, I believe.

Or merely pointing out the loopholes in your own claims, which you now conveniently sweep aside? I do not see how your earlier statements can put SIA and Creative in bad light and good light at the same time, even when read in its entirety.<br><br>Furthermore you persist in generalisation when it comes to 'perception'.<br><br>It is definitely 'Common knowledge' that service standards have dropped in SIA when placed among rising competitors. The claims the locals make of SIA serving westerners better than locals are not completely unfounded. And to a certain extent, i tend to agree.<br><br>But this is surely a separate issue from measuring their profit margins, where the numbers declared show a resurgence. These figures were even admitted by SIA to be conservative, in the face of intense competition and cost-cuts throughout the industry.<br><br>Have you been confused between these two distinctions? Or has the recent SIA bashing by locals in the ST forum section skewed your views?<br><br><blockquote><strong>Do not put words into my mouth. At no point had I said Forbes lack credibility.

Our people chose not to vote him out of office despite the years of lip service and empty promises from this man. He left a s-h-i-tload while in sports, he stirred up another while in transport and he's overwhelming odds on to leave HDB in another mess.</div>
