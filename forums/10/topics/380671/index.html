              <p><strong>Q3 labour numbers: Singapore job losses continue to grow as economy 'recovers'<br></strong></p>
              <p>Singapore’s ‘jobloss recovery’ gathers momentum. From the glowing
              inches generated by Singapore’s main stream media on Q3 labour numbers
              released by MOM, the casual reader might be tempted to plow his bets
              into an economy that’s “turned the corner” and “definitely out of a
              recession”. But upon further reading, he/she might want to ask the
              question: <strong>if total employment increased by 15,400 jobs, why did the rate of unemployment go up? </strong></p>

              <p>Is the present increase in jobless numbers due to newcomers entering the workforce and unable to find employment ?</p>
              <p>Or are there not more workers being retrenched, as businesses downsize - even as the Government spend money to help employers to continue to keep workers, and at the same time spending money to get workers to continue 'upgrading incontinuing the late education' ?</p>

              <p>Unemployment is creeping up as the economy recovers in Singapore.</p>
              <div class="entry-body">
              <p>Jobless numbers tend to lag behind economic recovery, as Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong <a href="http://business.asiaone.com/Business/News/Office/Story/A1Story20091014-173652.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">said</span></span></a> a fortnight ago, and overall unemployment is still below 3.5 percent.</p>
              <p>But it's clear the government scheme to keep unemployment low by helping people defer job search and further their studies has had only a temporary benefit.</p>
              <p>Unemployment rose to 5 percent among the local population in September.</p>
              <p>Job seekers at the end of training courses are finding there are still not enough jobs to go around.</p>
              <p>Between 83,000 and 100,000 local residents are unemployed, according to the Manpower Ministry which gave both seasonally adjusted and non-seasonally adjusted figures.</p>
              <p>The only good news is more than 15,000 new jobs were created in the third quarter, after more than 6,000 jobs were lost in the first quarter and well over 7,000 in the second quarter. "Nevertheless, the gains were significantly lower than 55,700 in the third quarter of 2008," the ministry said today.</p>

              <p>The ministry <a href="http://www.mom.gov.sg/publish/momportal/en/press_room/press_releases/2009/20091030-employment.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">reports</span></span></a>:</p>
              <p>"Preliminary estimates show that the seasonally adjusted overall unemployment rate rose slightly to 3.4% in September 2009 from 3.3% in June 2009.</p>
              <p>"Among the resident labour force, the rate increased to 5.0% in September 2009.</p>
              <p>"This followed the decline from 4.8% in March 2009 to 4.6% in June 2009, when some residents then had deferred job search and pursued courses amid the difficult job market."</p>
              <p>The report continues:</p>
              <p>"The unemployment rates were still below the peak (overall: 4.8%; resident: 6.2%) experienced in September 2003 (due to the SARS outbreak).</p>
              <p>"On a non-seasonally adjusted basis, the overall unemployment rate decreased from 4.1% in June 2009 to 2.9% in September 2009, as students who looked for work during the mid-year school vacation have returned to school and this year's tertiary graduates have started to secure employment.</p>
              <p>"Nevertheless, the rate was higher than 1.9% in September 2008. Among the resident labour force, the non-adjusted unemployment rate was 4.1% in September 2009, also lower than 5.9% in June 2009 but higher than 2.8% in September 2008. "</p>
              <p>And then comes the rub.</p>
              <p>"An estimated 83,800 residents were unemployed in September 2009. The seasonally adjusted figure was 100,300."</p>
              <p>The ministry said:</p>
              <p>"With a recovering economy, total employment is estimated to have grown by 15,400 in the third quarter, ending losses in the first and second quarters of 2009 (-6,200 and -7,700 respectively). Nevertheless, <strong>the gains were significantly lower than 55,700 in the third quarter of 2008</strong>.</p>
              <p>"Services employment rose by 13,400 in the third quarter, significantly higher than the gains of 7,500 in the first and 3,800 in the second quarter this year, but lower than 34,300 in the third quarter last year.</p>
              <p>"Construction continued to add workers (8,100), higher than the increase in the preceding quarter (4,700) and comparable to the first quarter of 2009 (8,300). <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Manufacturing shed workers for the fourth consecutive quarter</span></strong>, but the decline (-6,600) was substantially lower than in the first two quarters this year (-22,100 in 1Q 09 and -15,900 in 2Q 09)."</p>
              <p>Job vacancy rates in all sectors remain well below their levels <strong>before</strong> the recession, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said in its Macroeconomic Review yesterday.</p>
              <p>Overall,there were only <strong>33 job openings per 100 jobseekers</strong>, compared to an average of 72 during the 2005-07 period.</p>
              <p>And hirings are not likely to pick up much.</p>
              <p>Three-quarters of the 635 firms polled intend to maintain headcount, the MAS report pointed out.</p>
              <p>The outlook is most pessimistic for the manufacturing sector, it added.</p>
              <p><a></a></p>
              <p>Apart from the biomedical industry, which will see increased employment arising from new investment, such as Medtronic setting up operations in Singapore, most manufacturing companies are not looking to hire in 2010 due to the uncertain business outlook.</p>

              <p>This is a basic fundamental in economy recovery, employement will slack behind an economic recovery, firstly, employers are wary about the uncertainties of the recovery therefore do not want to commit to hiring until full stability set in, secondly, during the downturn, employers would had restructed their human resources by trimming away the unwanted ones just to stay sustainable,  and when economy recover, they are poised to not to fall into the same mistake of over employing resulting in the paid of paying retrenchment later.</p>
              <p>Therefore, no doubt the economy is recovering, but you will see a slow down in employment in the first two quarters, once both quarters presented a good picture of recovery direction, employment will bounce back as employers will be snatching for peoples. So, at the moment, it is still very much an employer market</p>
