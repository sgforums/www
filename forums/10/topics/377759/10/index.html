              <div class="quote_body">
              <p> </p>
              <p>A "zwei-siao-hog" is already bad enought, do you need to be a "Fascist Hog" as well to achieve the superlative level of being The Worst Hog ?</p>
              <p>"Fascism" has a reputation for not being logical, nor objective, nor are they respected to be worthy of being considered for anything by any Human Standards.</p>
              <p>Do you need to prove yourself so badly ?</p>
              <p>Can we trust a "zwei-siao-hog" to be honest with its own accuracy of what its reply is intended ? </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Can the above reply in "blue" be a correct extract of the issue raised by "yoyayou" on Page 2 of this thread - which the "Fascist Hog" attempt to be diligent in repeating the issue ?</p>
              <p>Or has the "Fascist Hog" now been exposed for attempting to cheat with its own argument by creating a new dishonest debate to prove its "zwei-siao" positon to be correct ?</p>
              <p>The reply by the "zwei-siao-Fascist-Hog" on Page 2, 04 Oct '09, 6.48PM is not displayed in its actual form  as shown above, when the correct and accurate version from Page 2 is as follows:- </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If the "Fascist Hog" intention is to be dishonestly clever, it should first learn to drop off its "zweil-siao" characteristics by at least being honest with itself.</p>
              <p>It is no use to be dishonest when it is convenient for the moment.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Was fireng's question stupid, or does the stooopidity of a "Fascist Hog" forget its own demand for logic in the replies from others; and its demand for the standards of Democracy as part of the "Basic Social Skills" in debate ?</p>
              <p>Obviously again, its "Fascist Standards" are applicable only on others, as such Fascist standards will undermine its own "zwei-siao" position as a pretentious "Bavarian Hog" ?</p>
              <p>Can a "Fascist Hog" answer which should come first - the chicken or the egg ?</p>
              <p>If the Government cannot accept the plans from the Opposition, do you think that it is any good for the Opposition to offer any to the Government ?</p>
              <p>What makes the "Fascist Hog" so certain that the Government will even listen to the Citizens - if the Citizens were to accept the plans from the Opposition ?</p>
              <p>In the other thread - <a rel="nofollow" href="/forums/10/topics/378577">‘SDP calls on Dr Teo to stand with Bukit Panjang residents’ (*1) </a>- the people are calling for their existing wet market not to be demolished - and had even recruited the assistance of their Elected MP from the "albino gorillas".</p>
              <p>Did the Government even listened to the call from its own "albino Gorilla' ?</p>
              <p>Did the Government even listened to the voice of those residents ?</p>
              <p>Did the Government even appreciate the "Fascist Hog" for turning the spotlight on the stoooopidity of its statement to have the Citizen accept the Opposition plans first ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Have you grown tired of your "play-turd" now, and elevate the simple "turd" into some "ATurddy" with a common prick that a "zwei-siao-hog" can only wish to have ?</p>
              <p>Is a "Fascist Hog" qualified to comment on anyone's ability to "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">stand up for the people and democracy</span></em>" - when CSJ is consistenly mowed down by the "Fascist Hog" even as CSJ is the most pro-active and vocal towards the "albino gorillas" in demanding the return of the democratic rights to the people of Singapore ?</p>
              <p>It is quite obvious by now that the "zwei-siao-hog" cannot possibly be good at any form of debate, nor even to fulfill its boasts of keeping to its own version of "basic social skill" at democratic debate.</p>
              <p>Can the "zwei-siao-hog" be any good at "name-calling" when it displayed such poor skill at handling its own "turd" - and have to downgrade to its more familiar "mud" ?</p>

              <p>You certainly deserve the superlative title as being the "worst" hog ever.</p>
              <p>The act of a "Fascist Hog" confirms again that "Fascism has a reputation for not being logical or objective".</p>
              <p>Is there any logical outcome to a reply that has no relevance to the flow of its own argument that had been unplugged for all the dumbness and pretentions exposed ?</p>
              <p>Certainly, the "Fascist Hog" is not worthy of being considered for anything positive by any Human Standards - nor by the standards of Basic Social Skills as promoted by a pretentious "Bavarian Hog" with "Fascist" tendencies.</p>
              <p>Can we trust a "zwei-siao-hog" to be honest with its own accuracy of what it offers as a reply to what has been posted ?</p>
              <p>Obviously accuracy in facts have never been intended in any of the replies from a "Fascist Hog" - when one reviews its present response that shy from making any reference to the issues raised, which exposed the butt of a "Fascist Hog" that trotted into an argument that it cannot even control its own outcome.</p>
              <p>Obviously, accuracy in details have not been intended by the "zwei-siao-hog" that is interested only in using this forum as its own stage - to vent its impotence in its own frustrations with the political status quo.</p>
              <p>The spotlight is on the "Fascist Hog" with its show of superlative tantrums as it vent its impotence in a display of its stooooopidity in the language of the "zwei-siao-hog" that it discover from the textures of the turd that it seek comfort in.</p>

              <p>Obviously again, its "Fascist Standards" are applicable only on others, as such Fascist standards will undermine its own "zwei-siao" position as a pretentious "Bavarian Hog" ?</p>

              <p>I do not want know what you guys think. However, I believe that the PAP government needs to understand that they can't rely on a stable economy to misguide the population. Debates have always centred on the economy, but civil society is important too. Civil society should not be sacrificed for a stable economy. Rather, a good economy should produce a civil society. Historically, people have engaged in political discussions when they have secured basic survival needs.</p>
              <p>Since Singapore's economy has been developed, I can only dream of a day when Singaporeans are free to criticise or praise the government openly and to discuss the merits and demerits of the PAP's policies. There will be a day where intellectual discussions can take place in any direction.</p>

              <p>Is the Swiss Society not based on civility in the conduct of politics between the Swiss Government and the Swiss Citizens ?</p>
              <p>The Swiss Government does not take it on itself to know all that is best for the Swiss Citizens, and have conducted countless "Referendums" as an honest process of continuing consultation - that allow the Swiss Citizens to participate on hot issues that affect the country and the citizens.</p>
              <p>The PAP Government has been blind sided by the success of the first generation of political leaders, who were able to challenge and check each other's views in honest robust debate before policy implementation.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, the renewal process had taken place since the early 1980s, which saw the Old Guards leaving the PAP.</p>
              <p>This has resulted in a single old guard in LKY is left at the helm to press his views and values on the succeeding leadership, that will not dare to provide the same robust challenges and honest debate as LKY had received from his own contempories.</p>
              <p>For twenty years, the succeeding political leadership has been conditioned to LKY's style of arrogant condescending style of governance, that perpetuate the same old political monolithic ideology, with the same old political baggage, and with relying on the same supposedly tested models to handle every event.</p>
              <p>Can Civil Society develop under such circumstances ?</p>

              <p>Was fireng's question stupid, or does the stooopidity of a "Fascist Hog" forget its own demand for logic in the replies from others; and its demand for the standards of Democracy as part of the "Basic Social Skills" in debate ?</p>
              <p>Obviously again, its "Fascist Standards" are applicable only on others, as such Fascist standards will undermine its own "zwei-siao" position as a pretentious "Bavarian Hog" ?</p>
              <p>Can a "Fascist Hog" answer which should come first - the chicken or the egg ?</p>
              <p>If the Government cannot accept the plans from the Opposition, do you think that it is any good for the Opposition to offer any to the Government ?</p>
              <p>What makes the "Fascist Hog" so certain that the Government will even listen to the Citizens - if the Citizens were to accept the plans from the Opposition ?</p>
              <p>In the other thread - <a rel="nofollow" href="/forums/10/topics/378577">‘SDP calls on Dr Teo to stand with Bukit Panjang residents’ (*1) </a>- the people are calling for their existing wet market not to be demolished - and had even recruited the assistance of their Elected MP from the "albino gorillas".</p>
              <p>Did the Government even listened to the call from its own "albino Gorilla' ?</p>
              <p>Did the Government even listened to the voice of those residents ?</p>
              <p>Did the Government even appreciate the "Fascist Hog" for turning the spotlight on the stoooopidity of its statement to have the Citizen accept the Opposition plans first ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Have you grown tired of your "play-turd" now, and elevate the simple "turd" into some "ATurddy" with a common prick that a "zwei-siao-hog" can only wish to have ?</p>
              <p>Is a "Fascist Hog" qualified to comment on anyone's ability to "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">stand up for the people and democracy</span></em>" - when CSJ is consistenly mowed down by the "Fascist Hog" even as CSJ is the most pro-active and vocal towards the "albino gorillas" in demanding the return of the democratic rights to the people of Singapore ?</p>
              <p>It is quite obvious by now that the "zwei-siao-hog" cannot possibly be good at any form of debate, nor even to fulfill its boasts of keeping to its own version of "basic social skill" at democratic debate.</p>
              <p>Can the "zwei-siao-hog" be any good at "name-calling" when it displayed such poor skill at handling its own "turd" - and have to downgrade to its more familiar "mud" ?</p>

              <p>It is little wonder that it has the snout of a "zwei-siao-hog" from all the puckering done in its formative years.</p>
              <p>The pretentious "Bavarian Hog" could redeem its "zwei-siao" position if it only learn to focus on issues that it has some intimate knowledge of, and not based on its ideal fantasies. </p>
