              <p><br>well change must come but definitely nt when opposition have little experience and still weak. When they have 3/8 of the seats the nex elections and they consolidate on that, let the people see what they can do and then we get the confidence and they build on that.</p>

              <p>Blind rage? Sorry, don't think I have any blind rage, just reason and logic. I can't do anything when you mistaken reason and logic with blind rage.

              <p>Like I said, change doesn't go down with folks who had it good with this current regime. If you go ask around in Eastern Europe, where the communist regime used to rule and was overthrown. I am sure there are some who still wish that they were under the communist rule, because though many are marginalised by communist rule, there are some who benefited from it.</p>

              <p>If you can't take the heat from the public complaint or you
                              think it is unfair that Singaporean complaints too
                              much....my message to you is
                              ............<strong>Quit. </strong></p>
              <p>If you think that Singaporean owe the government a living than
                              you should
                              <strong>Quit</strong>. <strong> </strong>Basically you
                              can't take the chanllenge if you think the people owe the
                              government a living.</p>
              <p>Or the people have unreasonable expectation....that is because
                              the governing political party  has compared itself to
                              World standard.</p>
              <p>Like i say if you cannot take it QUIT....In the US the GOP was
                              voted out because the American don't accept what they did in both
                              foreign polices and domestics.</p>
              <p>The first generation politician has served the first and second
                              generation Singaporean well. But the 3rd and 4th generation is
                              asking their elected official for a deliveration.</p>
              <p><strong>The rule of the game is the party that delivered
                              survived.</strong> <strong>The political party that turn
                               its own people are doomed to fail.</strong></p>

              <p>Are you kidding me?</p>
              <p>U addressed your whiney shit to EVERYONE who works in the government? Do you know how many people that categorisation consists of, how ridiculously varied and wide and general to the point of stupidity that is? Do you know you're talking about how many different agencies of different levels, how many different departments, from the ministries (about 19)  to the stat boards which number over 100 to the armed forces (which have about 10,000 regulars) to the People's Association, to the CDCs to the Prime Minister's Office to the National Bank? <br><br>From the prime minister to the chief of Army to the friendly 50 year old Aunty librarian in your neighbourhood library who's been at her job for the past 30 years to the stupid no brain toads in SCDF to the tens of thousands of dumbo teachers in primary schools who signed on to the MOE cos they can't get a job after graduating from dumping ground NUS Arts to the ah-lian kindergarten teacher in PAP who did some education cert in ITE to the 55 year old NParks Landscaping gardener uncle to the Attorney's General at the AG Chambers to the Chief Justice to the 50 year old aunty clerk who works in the AGC to the kindly sweet 50 year old aunty PA of the minister of defence?</p>
              <p>Yes I have seen that sweet 50 year old PA of Defence minister around in Gombak when I went there once. She could your mother or aunt, if you weren't such a lowlife and retard, so I highly doubt she's related to you.<br><br>You might as well address to "people in Singapore" or to "earthlings".<br><br>Fucking retard.</p>
              <p>Your speech should be directed to A POLITICAL party. Not to the people working for the GOVERNMENT.  Fucking fucktard, must be one of those FARMER RETARDS who don't know what is partisan and non-partisan, has never heard of the word and has lived under a rock all his life like a fucking loser farmer worm.</p>
              <p>Education really does separate the dumb from the dumber.</p>

              <p>U seem to get it down-pat, something i do laud because your compatriots in this thread seem way dumber than you, the TS is one example.</p>
              <p>If u have a lot to lose, like me, a lot of people I know, a lot of my friends and 66.6% of Singaporeans, you tend to value stuff and feel a sense of belonging. Why do you think the refugees of civil-war torn countries or the little kids who saw their siblings get blown up by land mines in Cambodia don't feel much sense of belonging? you, my friend are akin to them.And I'm heartened you finally got the formula right.</p>
              <p>When someone hates his country, its cos he has nothing to lose; He's got nothing. Bleak future due to his inherent lack of qualities that are in demand (eg Angel3070), feel 'marginalized', whole day kao peh *most likely jobless hence got time*, No family, nothing.</p>
              <p>Suicide is a good analogy. People only finally do it when they feel they have nothing to live for.</p>
              <p>What you believe in and how you behave towards your surroundings is a statement on how much you are worth. And I can see that TS is worth..almost nothing hahah.</p>

              <p>U seem to get it down-pat, something i do laud because your compatriots in this thread seem way dumber than you, the TS is one example.</p>
              <p>If u have a lot to lose, like me, a lot of people I know, a lot of my friends and 66.6% of Singaporeans, you tend to value stuff and feel a sense of belonging. Why do you think the refugees of civil-war torn countries or the little kids who saw their siblings get blown up by land mines in Cambodia don't feel much sense of belonging? you, my friend are akin to them.And I'm heartened you finally got the formula right.</p>
              <p>When someone hates his country, its cos he has nothing to lose; He's got nothing. Bleak future due to his inherent lack of qualities that are in demand (eg Angel3070), feel 'marginalized', whole day kao peh *most likely jobless hence got time*, No family, nothing.</p>
              <p>Suicide is a good analogy. People only finally do it when they feel they have nothing to live for.</p>
              <p>What you believe in and how you behave towards your surroundings is a statement on how much you are worth. And I can see that TS is worth..almost nothing hahah.</p>

              <p>The kiasu kiasee mentality is due to living under 50 years of repressive rule and also due to indoctrination in the education system.</p>
              <p>This is how PAP secures their rule for so long; by creating a slave mentality among the people. This is also why Singapore can never be a great country.</p>
              <p>Those people in the 1950s who were not under the repressive rule of PAP or trained under PAP education system, their mentality is different.</p>

              <p>BTW, there's a good chance that at the end of all this, you live in a walkover constituency and can really, do ...nothing.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> my family has several properties, we can easily register with different addresses with the voting office and vote. last I checked, all the constituencies we fall in are votable.

              <p>In the past, the older generations were easily "convinced", perhaps due to their lack of knowledge. But as all these elderly move on, the strength of the party will also die off with it. Why do you think they need to learn hip hop to please the younger generations? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
