              <p>well it's kind of simple actually.</p>
              <p>Let's look at a company like Microsoft. Assuming the top to middle management all go off and the management team from a department comes on to take the job. Wow.</p>
              <p>LTK has been managing only hougang all these years and now asking him to manage singapore? Sylvia Lim has been teaching in a polytechnic all these years and suddenly she holds a key ministerial position?</p>
              <p>And the only other party which has a ward is Chiam See Tong's PPP but he looks so blur now and there is no clear successor in sight.</p>
              <p>Don't these people use common sense? lol</p>

              <p>Change is not for everybody, especially those who had it good with this current regime. Afterall, if your family has millions, why would you want to put yoru family's fortune at risk for the benefit of your average brethrens. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
