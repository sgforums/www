              <p>somehow, they cannot reconcile the fact that those who detest people like CSJ can also detest the MIW...</p>

              <p>and if MIW does anything right (no matter how rare that is) it must be slagged off even if they have to lie about it...</p>
              <p>frankly, they do a grave disservice to the hardworking opposition people out there who actually try to serve the people and better the lot of their precinct.. who would lump the good work with the attention-whoring of CSJ and PKMS..</p>

              <p>It is only in true form of a "Fascist" that it will deny responsibility and prefer to indulge in who started the verbal slug-fest.</p>
              <p>Going by your grand performance in fulfilling your redefinition in your "Basic Social Skills" at treating your innocent victims to your "Fascist" methods in debate - do we need to dig through the history of this Speaker's Corner to unravel the mystery of the slug-fest ?</p>

              <p>It is dangerous to be "wishy-washy" as a "Fascist Hog", obviously the loose bag with the tiny nut is obstructing the goose-stepping short legs. </p>
              <p>It is simply not possible to be goose-stepping on four legs, and will make the "Fascist Hog" look simply ridiculous.</p>
              <p>If you want to look impressive even as a pretentious "Germanic Hog" - despite all the "zwei-siao" character now - you have to go for the obvious orchiectomy.</p>
              <p>As for the lobotomy part, you can always delay the procedures, as it makes no difference in keeping the hog's upper body upright and in balance with the weightier bottom.</p>

              <p>Did I aim to insult people, or only specific breeds of nature's miscreants that insult others with their "zwei-siao" stupidity ? </p>

              <p>Your brilliance in basic social skills in a democratic debate is as amazing as your "zwei-siao" standards of "logic and errors" to justify your pretentiously false position.</p>

              <p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><em><span style="color: #0000ff;">Stupid question, should ask if the common people can accept any plan from the opposition first. And see if the alternative party can be voted into power by such a ticket.</span></em></span></p>
              <p>Obviously to a "zwei-siao-hog" accustomed to perpetuating false positions is less vulgar than the truth spoken about its being naturally "zwei-siao" .</p>

              <p>Does a normal person debate normally with a "Fascist Hog" that pretend to be some kind of quality "Bavarian" porky ?</p>
              <p>It is only in true form of a "Fascist" that it will deny responsibility and prefer to indulge in who started the verbal slug-fest.</p>
              <p>Going by your grand performance in fulfilling your redefinition in your "Basic Social Skills" at treating your innocent victims to your "Fascist" methods in debate - do we need to dig through the history of this Speaker's Corner to unravel the mystery of the slug-fest ?</p>
              <p>Have you forgotten your favorite turd ?</p>
              <p>Can turd go for lobotomy or even an orchiectomy ?</p>
              <p>Your ambivalence in treating others with your "Fascist" methods can be fatal to the well-being of a pretentious "Bavarian Hog".</p>
              <p>It is dangerous to be "wishy-washy" as a "Fascist Hog", obviously the loose bag with the tiny nut is obstructing the goose-stepping short legs. </p>
              <p>It is simply not possible to be goose-stepping on four legs, and will make the "Fascist Hog" look simply ridiculous.</p>
              <p>If you want to look impressive even as a pretentious "Germanic Hog" - despite all the "zwei-siao" character now - you have to go for the obvious orchiectomy.</p>
              <p>As for the lobotomy part, you can always delay the procedures, as it makes no difference in keeping the hog's upper body upright and in balance with the weightier bottom.</p>

              <p>Have you grown tired of your "play-turd" now, and elevate the simple "turd" into some "ATurddy" with a common prick that a "zwei-siao-hog" can only wish to have ?</p>
              <p>Is a "Fascist Hog" qualified to comment on anyone's ability to "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">stand up for the people and democracy</span></em>" - when CSJ is consistenly mowed down by the "Fascist Hog" even as CSJ is the most pro-active and vocal towards the "albino gorillas" in demanding the return of the democratic rights to the people of Singapore ?</p>
              <p>It is quite obvious by now that the "zwei-siao-hog" cannot possibly be good at any form of debate, nor even to fulfill its boasts of keeping to its own version of "basic social skill" at democratic debate.</p>
              <p>Can the "zwei-siao-hog" be any good at "name-calling" when it displayed such poor skill at handling its own "turd" - and have to downgrade to its more familiar "mud" ?</p>
