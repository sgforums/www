              <p>sorry, i wasn't intending to 'personally' attack anyone. are u saying that in this internet platform, i can hurt their..<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> feelings..?</p>
              <p>I was merely reacting to what I saw. Have you seen anything as amazingly stupid as what I exposed above (indian rojak cabinet)? maybe not too long ago. all u have to do to get a frequent dose is to read the other posts made by the same people daily i guess,,.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>so what do you think of the scenario? i think the cabinet I designed for Chee dog's new government is simply swell..now we just need to put his grandma somewhere..maybe grandma can be MM. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Or the people have unreasonable expectation....that is because the governing political party  has compared itself to World standard.</p>
              <p>Like i say if you cannot take it QUIT....In the US the GOP was voted out because the American don't accept what they did in both foreign polices and domestics.</p>
              <p>The first generation politician has served the first and second generation Singaporean well. But the 3rd and 4th generation is asking their elected official for a deliveration.</p>
              <p><strong>The rule of the game is the party that delivered survived.</strong> <strong>The political party that turn  its own people are doomed to fail.</strong></p>

              <p>education serves to improve a person and refine him but looking at you.........those negro dudes must have raped u every night or worse while u were doing time in prison in the usa.and even if u were educated in the usa i think u have been educated to the brink of pure insanity.some people are able to study and then lead normal lives and lead happy lives with almost everyone...</p>
              <p>....however some after education simply turn insane and start to yell,scream n abuse people.that is what i noticed bout u.u arent able to be educated as a birth defect.its nothing to insult u or anything but if u were to be educated u would be no better than a butcher or a madman as a side effect.in fact i think u behave even worse than a madman n a butcher combined.</p>
              <p>YOU MAY APOLOGISE TO THOSE YOU HAVE OFFENDED.but seeing that u are insane you probably wont. go seek help before u get murdered or something.</p>

CSJ and his cronies went to Golden Shoe carpark hawker centre and managed to irritate the lunch crowd away.

It shows that the SDP are just paying lip service to democracy and service to the common people when they keep yelling about "democracy and knowing about the truth" at the top of their lungs and canvassing from table to table.

              <p>Like i say if you cannot take it QUIT....In the US the GOP was
                  voted out because the American don't accept what they did in both

              <p>The first generation politician has served the first and second

              <p>Dear Arapahoe,</p>
              <p>How's life in the US? Heard you mentioned it is a great country to be in, having no social problems, all lovey dovey and definately much better than our country Singapore, so stressless a life that you are free to engage in time consuming debates around the world. I guess you must be living a good life, since you are the one living there.</p>
              <p>I wish you well, and will not hold it against you, for abandoning your country and your people, as well as our forefathers who had given us our today. It is your right to find greener pastures, to live a life you believed that you owe no one.</p>
              <p>I admire your willingness to speak up, a good trait, but unfortunately you lack any credibility for what you say or complain, simply because you are not the one who is living the life affected, after all being sanitised and protected in the comfort of your aircon room in your detach house, with a continental car bought cheaply, etc, etc in USA.</p>
              <p>The world has changed, and affected every country differently. We in Singapore feel it the most, being the 1st to suffer recession due to our dependence on the world for our products and services, having no natural resources to fall back on.</p>
              <p>What used to be a life whereby if we put in the hours, we will be rewarded, but now, even after putting in the hours, it may not be enough, for competition is keener with globatilisation.</p>
              <p>Not competition from each other, foriegn talents or foriegn workers. BUT THE WORLD, as each nation clamour to sell their products at the lowest price and at the highest quality.</p>
              <p>It is not any govt's fault, not CEOs fault, but humanity's fault. It is our insatiable desire for the latest goods that had driven us all into a greedy consumerist world, from handphones to stocks. Once upon a time, a colour tv and a fix line was good enough for a family, but now, the wonders of goods and the aquisition of it never fails to amaze me. I too am guilty of this fault, for I, like you, am human too.</p>
              <p>Thus, we all have to work harder and smarter. Times are really bad, and we are not out of the financial crises yet. This is not the time to nitpick and fight against each other. This is a time for unity and morale confidence building.</p>
              <p>Only the ambitious, dissatisfied will attempt to seek this crisis opportunity to tear the social fabric - when the nation is at its weakest point, to fulfill their selfish agenda. The enemy's enemy may not be your friend. Politics had always been about manipulation.</p>
              <p>My words may seem harsh, but i speak from my heart, of facts and realities you can easily ascertain. I only talk to you because I feel you are different from the other rabble rousers. You have no hidden agenda unlike them in their desire to destroy instead of building up.</p>
              <p>So please, do not be made use of by others for their self serving agenda. You may have quit the country, but i do not hold it against you as mentioned. However, you are not the one living here to experience it for yourself, to understand the realities and life here. Hearing from others, or being concern is comprehensible, but nothing like living here would you be able to comprehend better.</p>
              <p>Criticise whomever, by all means, but it must be either backed up by credible evidence or solutions. If not, there is no need to be hostile, and demand others to be silenced, just like the rabble rousers, whom cry for freedom and yet so quick to deny it to others, a perfect example of the kind of 'democracy' that is to come from them.</p>
              <p>Threats, of leaving, or any kind is a double edged sword. It may make some react and change, but more often than not, it makes others to be defensive, and adopt all kinds of measures detrimental to others as well.</p>
              <p>It doesnt matter who comes or goes to our country, for as long as there are people like me, and there are many, there will always be a Singapore. Our forefathers had always lived within their resources, and look towards a better future, so too can we who remain.</p>
              <p>Come back, stand for elections or form a team if you think you can do better, or whatever you say, is of no sincerity at all, sadly........</p>
              <p>(PS: I am not from any party or affiliated in any way to them, only just an ordinary joe Singaporean born and bred, and doubt if any political officials would deign to even come to this site, let alone read posts.)</p>

              <p>The biggerest perception with SG govt is that it derseve to be where it is....well Wake up as you mention the world have changed. <strong>PAST GLORY are reserved for the previous generation tittle benefit. It is not for the younger generation to live in the PAST and continue to Claim the benefit. </strong></p>
              <p>There are plenty of Singaporean out there with potential resources and skills...basically they have given up Singapore govt and taken matter into own hands. isn;t that speak louder than my post? what are you telling folks who have left?</p>

              <p>As much as I would like to leave you with a special thought to help you cope with your pathetic X-rated abilities displayed, but considering the regressive state that you are trashed into - will you know where to place it ?</p>
              <p>Maybe you should go for another brain transplant and pray that the brain will accept you this time - considering that there is no medicine to prevent sheer stupidity</p>
