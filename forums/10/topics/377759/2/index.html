              <p>Dear Arapahoe,</p>
              <p>How's life in the US? Heard you mentioned it is a great country to be in, having no social problems, all lovey dovey and definately much better than our country Singapore, so stressless a life that you are free to engage in time consuming debates around the world. I guess you must be living a good life, since you are the one living there.</p>
              <p>I wish you well, and will not hold it against you, for abandoning your country and your people, as well as our forefathers who had given us our today. It is your right to find greener pastures, to live a life you believed that you owe no one.</p>
              <p>I admire your willingness to speak up, a good trait, but unfortunately you lack any credibility for what you say or complain, simply because you are not the one who is living the life affected, after all being sanitised and protected in the comfort of your aircon room in your detach house, with a continental car bought cheaply, etc, etc in USA.</p>
              <p>The world has changed, and affected every country differently. We in Singapore feel it the most, being the 1st to suffer recession due to our dependence on the world for our products and services, having no natural resources to fall back on.</p>
              <p>What used to be a life whereby if we put in the hours, we will be rewarded, but now, even after putting in the hours, it may not be enough, for competition is keener with globatilisation.</p>
              <p>Not competition from each other, foriegn talents or foriegn workers. BUT THE WORLD, as each nation clamour to sell their products at the lowest price and at the highest quality.</p>
              <p>It is not any govt's fault, not CEOs fault, but humanity's fault. It is our insatiable desire for the latest goods that had driven us all into a greedy consumerist world, from handphones to stocks. Once upon a time, a colour tv and a fix line was good enough for a family, but now, the wonders of goods and the aquisition of it never fails to amaze me. I too am guilty of this fault, for I, like you, am human too.</p>
              <p>Thus, we all have to work harder and smarter. Times are really bad, and we are not out of the financial crises yet. This is not the time to nitpick and fight against each other. This is a time for unity and morale confidence building.</p>
              <p>Only the ambitious, dissatisfied will attempt to seek this crisis opportunity to tear the social fabric - when the nation is at its weakest point, to fulfill their selfish agenda. The enemy's enemy may not be your friend. Politics had always been about manipulation.</p>
              <p>My words may seem harsh, but i speak from my heart, of facts and realities you can easily ascertain. I only talk to you because I feel you are different from the other rabble rousers. You have no hidden agenda unlike them in their desire to destroy instead of building up.</p>
              <p>So please, do not be made use of by others for their self serving agenda. You may have quit the country, but i do not hold it against you as mentioned. However, you are not the one living here to experience it for yourself, to understand the realities and life here. Hearing from others, or being concern is comprehensible, but nothing like living here would you be able to comprehend better.</p>
              <p>Criticise whomever, by all means, but it must be either backed up by credible evidence or solutions.

              <p>Dear Arapahoe,</p>
              <p>How's life in the US? Heard you mentioned it is a great country to be in, having no social problems, all lovey dovey and definately much better than our country Singapore, so stressless a life that you are free to engage in time consuming debates around the world. I guess you must be living a good life, since you are the one living there.</p>
              <p>I wish you well, and will not hold it against you, for abandoning your country and your people, as well as our forefathers who had given us our today. It is your right to find greener pastures, to live a life you believed that you owe no one.</p>
              <p>I admire your willingness to speak up, a good trait, but unfortunately you lack any credibility for what you say or complain, simply because you are not the one who is living the life affected, after all being sanitised and protected in the comfort of your aircon room in your detach house, with a continental car bought cheaply, etc, etc in USA.</p>
              <p>The world has changed, and affected every country differently. We in Singapore feel it the most, being the 1st to suffer recession due to our dependence on the world for our products and services, having no natural resources to fall back on.</p>
              <p>What used to be a life whereby if we put in the hours, we will be rewarded, but now, even after putting in the hours, it may not be enough, for competition is keener with globatilisation.</p>
              <p>Not competition from each other, foriegn talents or foriegn workers. BUT THE WORLD, as each nation clamour to sell their products at the lowest price and at the highest quality.</p>
              <p>It is not any govt's fault, not CEOs fault, but humanity's fault. It is our insatiable desire for the latest goods that had driven us all into a greedy consumerist world, from handphones to stocks. Once upon a time, a colour tv and a fix line was good enough for a family, but now, the wonders of goods and the aquisition of it never fails to amaze me. I too am guilty of this fault, for I, like you, am human too.</p>
              <p>Thus, we all have to work harder and smarter. Times are really bad, and we are not out of the financial crises yet. This is not the time to nitpick and fight against each other. This is a time for unity and morale confidence building.</p>
              <p>Only the ambitious, dissatisfied will attempt to seek this crisis opportunity to tear the social fabric - when the nation is at its weakest point, to fulfill their selfish agenda. The enemy's enemy may not be your friend. Politics had always been about manipulation.</p>
              <p>My words may seem harsh, but i speak from my heart, of facts and realities you can easily ascertain. I only talk to you because I feel you are different from the other rabble rousers. You have no hidden agenda unlike them in their desire to destroy instead of building up.</p>
              <p>So please, do not be made use of by others for their self serving agenda. You may have quit the country, but i do not hold it against you as mentioned. However, you are not the one living here to experience it for yourself, to understand the realities and life here. Hearing from others, or being concern is comprehensible, but nothing like living here would you be able to comprehend better.</p>
              <p>Criticise whomever, by all means, but it must be either backed up by credible evidence or solutions. If not, there is no need to be hostile, and demand others to be silenced, just like the rabble rousers, whom cry for freedom and yet so quick to deny it to others, a perfect example of the kind of 'democracy' that is to come from them.</p>
              <p>Threats, of leaving, or any kind is a double edged sword. It may make some react and change, but more often than not, it makes others to be defensive, and adopt all kinds of measures detrimental to others as well.</p>
              <p>It doesnt matter who comes or goes to our country, for as long as there are people like me, and there are many, there will always be a Singapore. Our forefathers had always lived within their resources, and look towards a better future, so too can we who remain.</p>
              <p>Come back, stand for elections or form a team if you think you can do better, or whatever you say, is of no sincerity at all, sadly........</p>

              <p>Or is the Germanic Hog pretending to have some superior insight from the point of view of some cartoon game character ?</p>
              <p>Can the "swei-siao-hog" have any ability to discern the difference in the manner that Party Politics are managed between the SDP and the PAP ?</p>
              <p>The PAP is organised into three separate groups that consist of the CEC, the Cadre, and the General Membership - in which a select few from the General Membership will be "chosen" to join the privileged Cadre Group; and the Cadre Group will be given the role of "electing" candidates for positions in the Central Executive Council.</p>
              <p>Candidates for positions in the CEC does not necessarily have to be members from the General Membership, and neither will it be drawn from the Cadre Group.</p>
              <p>In fact, the candidates for the CEC posts are selected from the streets of Singapore, to be interviewed by a privilege council formed by members of the inner CEC core, and subsequently offered for the Cadre Group to rubber stamp the wishes of the Master's Voice in the PAP.</p>
              <p>It is unlikely that anyone can depend on the "swei-siao-hog" to be objective to note the difference in the SDP democratic practices in the conduct of internal party business.</p>
              <p>There is no intermediate Cadre Coup between the Central Executive Council of the SDP and its General Membership.</p>
              <p>Anyone from the General Membership is entitled under the SDP Constitution to be nominated by other members to stand for office in the CEC, and will be subject to being accepted by the larger General Membership.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Only a "hog" bred in the Animal Farm managed by the PAP will believe that all farms are managed in the same "swei-siao" manner that the "hog" limited experience have only known.</p>
              <p>In its confused "swei-siao" state of mind, we can be quite certain that the "hog" will eventually seek its "cow father and cow mother".</p>

              <p>Afterall, a "Hog" will not move a muscle on its own at independent thinking, or to be pro-active on any issues, but will prefer to be "zwei-siao" to tow whatever lines that comes its way - even if it drag the hog to the abattoir.</p>

              <p>What can a "hog" possibly understand about the word <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/foolhardy">‘foolhardy’ (*1) </a>- when the life of a "zwei-siao-hog" is as foolish in its inability to be pro-active for it own preservation ?</p>
              <p>From its poor self-preserving attitude, everything else is "foolhardry" to a "hog".</p>
              <p>Is it any wonder that "hogs" are bred for the slaughter house for its meek "zwei-siao" care-free view towards its own kind ?</p>

              <p>Dear Arapahoe,</p>
              <p>How's life in the US? Heard you mentioned it is a great country to be in, having no social problems, all lovey dovey and definately much better than our country Singapore, so stressless a life that you are free to engage in time consuming debates around the world. I guess you must be living a good life, since you are the one living there.</p>
              <p>I wish you well, and will not hold it against you, for abandoning your country and your people, as well as our forefathers who had given us our today. It is your right to find greener pastures, to live a life you believed that you owe no one.</p>
              <p>I admire your willingness to speak up, a good trait, but unfortunately you lack any credibility for what you say or complain, simply because you are not the one who is living the life affected, after all being sanitised and protected in the comfort of your aircon room in your detach house, with a continental car bought cheaply, etc, etc in USA.</p>
              <p>The world has changed, and affected every country differently. We in Singapore feel it the most, being the 1st to suffer recession due to our dependence on the world for our products and services, having no natural resources to fall back on.</p>
              <p>What used to be a life whereby if we put in the hours, we will be rewarded, but now, even after putting in the hours, it may not be enough, for competition is keener with globatilisation.</p>
              <p>Not competition from each other, foriegn talents or foriegn workers. BUT THE WORLD, as each nation clamour to sell their products at the lowest price and at the highest quality.</p>
              <p>It is not any govt's fault, not CEOs fault, but humanity's fault. It is our insatiable desire for the latest goods that had driven us all into a greedy consumerist world, from handphones to stocks. Once upon a time, a colour tv and a fix line was good enough for a family, but now, the wonders of goods and the aquisition of it never fails to amaze me. I too am guilty of this fault, for I, like you, am human too.</p>
              <p>Thus, we all have to work harder and smarter. Times are really bad, and we are not out of the financial crises yet. This is not the time to nitpick and fight against each other. This is a time for unity and morale confidence building.</p>
              <p>Only the ambitious, dissatisfied will attempt to seek this crisis opportunity to tear the social fabric - when the nation is at its weakest point, to fulfill their selfish agenda. The enemy's enemy may not be your friend. Politics had always been about manipulation.</p>
              <p>My words may seem harsh, but i speak from my heart, of facts and realities you can easily ascertain. I only talk to you because I feel you are different from the other rabble rousers. You have no hidden agenda unlike them in their desire to destroy instead of building up.</p>
              <p>So please, do not be made use of by others for their self serving agenda. You may have quit the country, but i do not hold it against you as mentioned. However, you are not the one living here to experience it for yourself, to understand the realities and life here. Hearing from others, or being concern is comprehensible, but nothing like living here would you be able to comprehend better.</p>
              <p>Criticise whomever, by all means, but it must be either backed up by credible evidence or solutions. If not, there is no need to be hostile, and demand others to be silenced, just like the rabble rousers, whom cry for freedom and yet so quick to deny it to others, a perfect example of the kind of 'democracy' that is to come from them.</p>
              <p>Threats, of leaving, or any kind is a double edged sword. It may make some react and change, but more often than not, it makes others to be defensive, and adopt all kinds of measures detrimental to others as well.</p>
              <p>It doesnt matter who comes or goes to our country, for as long as there are people like me, and there are many, there will always be a Singapore. Our forefathers had always lived within their resources, and look towards a better future, so too can we who remain.</p>
              <p>Come back, stand for elections or form a team if you think you can do better, or whatever you say, is of no sincerity at all, sadly........</p>
              <p>(PS: I am not from any party or affiliated in any way to them, only just an ordinary joe Singaporean born and bred, and doubt if any political officials would deign to even come to this site, let alone read posts.)</p>

              <p><br>Another confirmation of the plagiarising efforts of a X-rated kid that is becoming less inhibitted towards posting a "Wall of Text" ?</p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #0000ff;">"Our forefathers always lived within their resources and can look towards a better future"</span></em> - as they did not have the PAP to rob them of their resources, dis-possess them of their land from which they can live even through WW-2 when the Japs were intensely watching and starving everyone then.</p>
              <p>Can this and future generation survive with a new set of circumstances created by the PAP - who have changed the free-spirit of our forefathers to make every Singaporean to become an economic digit, to make our survival dependent on the PAP system ?</p>
              <p>It is simply disingenius to plagiarize a "Wall of Text" that can be so easily shredded into bits- especially when the wall is built from ideas that you have also plagiarized from others, which you have no ability to defend.</p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #0000ff;">"Criticise whomever, by all means, but it must be either backed up by credible evidence or solutions" </span></em>- this is an understatement from a X-rated mind.</p>
              <p>Where are your credible evidence or solutions when you criticize others ?</p>
              <p>Where were you when the evidence and solutions were made available ?</p>
              <p>Did you choke on the evidence when these were presented to your X-rated vision ?</p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #0000ff;">"My words may seem harsh, but i speak from my heart, of facts and realities you can easily ascertain."</span></em></p>
              <p>You must be hallucinating with some self-indulging thoughts of yourself being in some supreme X-rated role in some X-rated maso-sadistic acts to believe that your hollow words can be harsh, and that your unsubstantiated statements are realities that only a kid will useless hope to be ascertained by any adult..</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>"Only the ambitious, dissatisfied will attempt to seek this crisis opportunity to tear the social fabric - when the nation is at its weakest point, to fulfill their selfish agenda.... Politics had always been about manipulation. "</em></span></p>
              <p>The X-rated Kid must be commended for its ability to contradict its own position.</p>
              <p>If it can admire the "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">willingness to speak up</span></em>" which it believes to be "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">a good trait</span></em>" - why has the X-rated Kid not done so with the above statement, but had prefer to make innuendoes that confirm it "lack <em><span style="color: #0000ff;">any credibility for what you say or complain</span></em>" ?</p>
              <p>If politics is about manipulation, the X-rated kid has shown its poor performance in attempting to manipulate the debate towards acheiving its dubious goals - simply due to the often said fact that it can plagiarize with such skills, but simply flop with the poor skill at delivering the easily copied message.</p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #0000ff;">"It is not any govt's fault, not CEOs fault, but humanity's fault"</span></em></p>
              <p>Is this suppose to be the X-rated genius excuse to blame our economic woes on the fault of "humanity" ?</p>
              <p>Who does the X-rated kid believe will form the "humanity" that is at fault - if it is not the fault of the government nor the CEO ?</p>
              <p>Should the common folks bear total responsibility for the economic faults that exist, when the million dollar paid politicians and CEOs are absolved ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This again reflects the bankrupt mind of a X-rated kid that is too keen to plagiarized the prosaic styles without the substance to solidify its position.</p>
