              <p>education serves to improve a person and refine him but looking at you.........those negro dudes must have raped u every night or worse while u were doing time in prison in the usa.and even if u were educated in the usa i think u have been educated to the brink of pure insanity.some people are able to study and then lead normal lives and lead happy lives with almost everyone...</p>
              <p>....however some after education simply turn insane and start to yell,scream n abuse people.that is what i noticed bout u.u arent able to be educated as a birth defect.its nothing to insult u or anything but if u were to be educated u would be no better than a butcher or a madman as a side effect.in fact i think u behave even worse than a madman n a butcher combined.</p>
              <p>YOU MAY APOLOGISE TO THOSE YOU HAVE OFFENDED.but seeing that u are insane you probably wont. go seek help before u get murdered or something.</p>

              <p>I spoked to some older folks before, some are just resigned to their fate with the PAP, ask them to vote in an opposition, they will say "No, what's the point, PAP will rig the election and win anyway. They will know who I voted for and take it out on me."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The best part is, they don't agree with their policies, kept complaining to me about how cost have risen. But I always retort back (just to get back at them), "Who did you vote for?

              <p>....however some after education simply turn insane and
              start to yell,scream n abuse people.that is what i noticed bout u.u
              arent able to be educated as a birth defect.its nothing to insult u
              or anything but if u were to be educated u would be no better than
              a butcher or a madman as a side effect.in fact i think u behave
              even worse than a madman n a butcher combined.</p>
              <p>YOU MAY APOLOGISE TO THOSE YOU HAVE OFFENDED.but seeing that u
              are insane you probably wont. go seek help before u get murdered or
              something.</p>
              <p>im not telling u off........im telling u to seek professiona
              help....anonymously or whatever!</p>
