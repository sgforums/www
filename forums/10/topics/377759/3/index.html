              <div class="quote_body">
              <p><br>How did the brilliance of a "swei-siao-hog" conclude that the <em><span style="color: #0000ff;">"SDP takes over..... Same nonsense as PAP"</span></em> ?</p>
              <p>Or is the Germanic Hog pretending to have some superior insight from the point of view of some cartoon game character ?</p>
              <p>Can the "swei-siao-hog" have any ability to discern the difference in the manner that Party Politics are managed between the SDP and the PAP ?</p>
              <p>The PAP is organised into three separate groups that consist of the CEC, the Cadre, and the General Membership - in which a select few from the General Membership will be "chosen" to join the privileged Cadre Group; and the Cadre Group will be given the role of "electing" candidates for positions in the Central Executive Council.</p>
              <p>Candidates for positions in the CEC does not necessarily have to be members from the General Membership, and neither will it be drawn from the Cadre Group.</p>
              <p>In fact, the candidates for the CEC posts are selected from the streets of Singapore, to be interviewed by a privilege council formed by members of the inner CEC core, and subsequently offered for the Cadre Group to rubber stamp the wishes of the Master's Voice in the PAP.</p>
              <p>It is unlikely that anyone can depend on the "swei-siao-hog" to be objective to note the difference in the SDP democratic practices in the conduct of internal party business.</p>
              <p>There is no intermediate Cadre Coup between the Central Executive Council of the SDP and its General Membership.</p>
              <p>Anyone from the General Membership is entitled under the SDP Constitution to be nominated by other members to stand for office in the CEC, and will be subject to being accepted by the larger General Membership.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Only a "hog" bred in the Animal Farm managed by the PAP will believe that all farms are managed in the same "swei-siao" manner that the "hog" limited experience have only known.</p>
              <p>In its confused "swei-siao" state of mind, we can be quite certain that the "hog" will eventually seek its "cow father and cow mother".</p>
              <p>  </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>How did the "zwei-siao-hog" discover that the <em><span style="color: #0000ff;">"PAP does have many capable personnel but all are forced to toe the party line."</span></em> ?</p>
              <p>Obviously the value judgment of a "zwei-siao-hog" will believe that "<em>one who toe the party line</em>" will be more superior then "<em>one who is capable of independent thinking and pro-active responses</em>".</p>
              <p>Afterall, a "Hog" will not move a muscle on its own at independent thinking, or to be pro-active on any issues, but will prefer to be "zwei-siao" to tow whatever lines that comes its way - even if it drag the hog to the abattoir.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Coming from a "zwei-siao-hog" this is an understatement considering the "swei-siao" passions affecting his vision towards CSJ.</p>
              <p>Can a "zwei-siao-hog" understand the actions of anyone outside the Animal Farm ?</p>
              <p>What can a "hog" possibly understand about the word <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/foolhardy">‘foolhardy’ (*1) </a>- when the life of a "zwei-siao-hog" is as foolish in its inability to be pro-active for it own preservation ?</p>
              <p>From its poor self-preserving attitude, everything else is "foolhardry" to a "hog".</p>
              <p>Is it any wonder that "hogs" are bred for the slaughter house for its meek "zwei-siao" care-free view towards its own kind ?</p>
              <p>  </p>

              <p>ATurdy, go suck on CSJ's dick since you like him so much. There are better alternatives than a chimpanzee and his fellow cronies or gorillas in white, and with much more human sense. CSJ and his cronies went to Golden Shoe carpark hawker centre and managed to irritate the lunch crowd away. The hawkers were very pissed as they depend on the lunch-hour crowd to earn their daily keep. It shows that the SDP are just paying lip service to democracy and service to the common people when they keep yelling about "democracy and knowing about the truth" at the top of their lungs and canvassing from table to table. The common people couldn't have their lunch and the hawkers lost their customers that day.</p>
              <p>So you piece of shit, ATurdy, better wake up your idea and learn that SDP is just another self-serving party.</p>

              <p>True but the ruling party can change the rules of play of the civil service. But what it means is that the government must learn to be less self-serving and serve the common people more. Look at the taiwanese parliament, it is a mockary of democracy with its catfights, but none really want to serve the people.</p>

              <p>I guess it all depends on what they people at the top thinks or wants.</p>

              <p>Like you say, high ranking people in the ministries and stat boards should learn to differentiate what their roles are, but given the political culture that has been inculcated into the minds of the people since independence, it will take a mighty long time before the civil service can separate between political and its social role. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>most politicians are self-serving asswipes..</p>
              <p>now.. for those who keep talking about destruction of the
              incumbent without a clue of what to replace it with, look at what
              happened to each "revolution" in history...</p>
              <p>you guys rant and rant about it but never ever learn anything,
              do you?</p>
              <p>the French revolution - was enforced by the guillotine.. even
              the people who started the goddamned revolution lost their
              heads..</p>
              <p>the latest ones? take Iran for example.. it was easy to depose
              the Shah.. but no one had a clue what to do later... and the
              Ayatollahs took over.. what is going on in there now?  they
              are creating imaginary and making enemies just keep the people
              almost united in their hatred against someone.. anyone...</p>
              <p>what about the PRC?  millions died when Mao didn't have a
              clue and went on his Cultural and whatever revolutions...</p>
              <p>the Cubans which threw out the despots who were supported by the
              US? look at the mess they are in now because the only way they
              could survive was to be a proxy state of the Soviet Union...</p>
              <p>and the biggest messes of them all? look at the African
              continent..</p>
              <p>Singapore is way too small to be able to survive that kind of
              mess.. whoever wants to "destroy" the MIW better have a plan..</p>
              <p>it's easy to bring down someone or something.. but the hard part
              is the building.. or rebuilding..</p>
              <p>why do people like CSJ and the late Jeyaratnam fail
              dismally?</p>
              <p>it wasn't a "lack of democracy", it wasn't "the people's fault"
              or whatever.. it was due to their total and utter lack of a plan or
              a clue where to go to if they happen to defeat the MIW..</p>
              <p>and frankly, you look at their plans.. it is a plan for defeat..
              they won't have a clue what to do if they won.. they never had a
              clue...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and i wish people learnt to differentiate the Civil Service from
              the gabrament..</p>
              <p>gabraments come and go.. the civil service will still be there

              <p><br>you really don't know??</p>
              <p>wah!!<br>the country is in a mess.. they are forced to accelerate growth to at least 8% so that the people will not revolt.. and it already is happening.. look at the Tibetans and the Uighers..</p>
              <p>the country doesn't give a flying rat's ass about anything other than surpression of a dissenting voice so much that in their mad rush to industrialisation, they have willingly sacrificed their very country where the rivers are poisoned and the air is toxic..</p>
              <p>and that's just the tip of the iceberg...</p>
              <p>the people have had their sense morality taken away from them during the Cultural Revolution where Mao proclaimed that everything except his rantings was bad.. Confucius, Taoism, Buddhism and all their historic moral teachings were throw out the window and burnt along with a lot of other things...</p>
              <p>then Deng came in and told them that to be rich is glorious..</p>
              <p>now you have a few generation of PRC people who are going out to get rich without ethics or morals..</p>
              <p>think about how messed up that is  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
