Got a split headache when i was in bed last night,, my brain is filled with your egyptian words..  Can you just cut your answer short a bit, and use a bit formal english?? at least can you type in the english words properly? getting your idea across does not need writing paragraph after paragraph.. i only can understand simple things..compact and right to the point. because i have got problem with understanding not only your english but also your idea. i do not need "deep analysis" as it might be beyond me.  Keep in mind that you are talking with a simple person.<br>by the way,, tink = think?? haf = have?? hope my guess is right.. as it took me whole morning coffee break to work them out.<br>Thanks god..<br><br>P.S. please do not tell me every singaporean walking on the street can understand what you are saying.. as it does make me feel bad.. even a simple person still has got self-respect.<br><br>[/b]</blockquote>for sure,there`s miminal things that i can do ensure that you do understand the things from my view points<br>do take good care of yourself and don be bothered by words that seem overly alien to you. so i`ll try to use very simple english to converse with you<br><br>yes you`re right!<br>getting ideas across does not need writing paragraph after paragraph, but you don`t seem to get the idea from some of us most of the time<br>if my type of english is too difficult for you. i do apologise for it.<br>i supposed you really took quite an amount of time to read through my post and i do thank you for that..<br>what i`ve hoped more was of your understanding and less of your difficulties in my writing style<br><br>and also if you`re not here to discuss about problems in details<br>what`s the point in being here at all??<br>i hope the english here is simple enough for you to understand.</div>
