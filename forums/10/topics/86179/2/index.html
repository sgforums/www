It's because of the dirt cheap labor there that companies are blosoming up like mushrooms after a heavy rain. If want to blame anybody blame the companies, companies have loyalties to $$ not countries, it's what I call "the greed of corporations" both local and abroad in korea, japan and even united states.<br><br>Let's say a pair of NIKE shoes retails in the states for lets say USD50, lets also say the labor component to manufacture that pair of NIKE shoes traditionally in america is 20% which is USD10, but because of cheap labor or labor laws or currency exchange rates which favor foreign businesses in china the same money can manufacture 10 pairs instead of 1pair, so american companies export manufacturing jobs to china thereby cuting costs back home, then re-importing goods manufactured from there back to america and continue to sell that pair of NIKE shoes for USD50, profit margin goes thru the roof. The same can be said for electronics, software, manufacturing companies.<br><br>Notice recently when America sought to punish China, it slapped tariffs which mainly affected CTV(china television corporation) and not american companies, in a way it used CTV as a scapegoat to appease the critics but that did not in any way help common americans regain back their jobs.<br><br>I guess if there was no China in this world, it would be some other country with cheap labor cost instead the end result will be the same.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Relationship with China, USA and Malaysia should be conducted on a more mature basis - not so emotional.<br><br>Remember, we may not have all the clouts to play it big or that big - like being able to lead in international play field.<br><br>As a smaller player - lower profile, our opinion will then be more substantial and valuable. We got to balance up a little big and try not to play it too big.<br><br>This is a period of maturing for Singapore foreign policy. Take into consideration other national feelings and aspirations too. When we recognize their desires, it is easier to be friends and win them over.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The First thing need to do is to boycott the Chinese tops here. It is so surprising that there are a bunch of tops obout China, while some people here are still saying boycotting China. I hope they know the advantages of doing that.<br>Boycott is not the answer to the problem. Qing China was so week because it boycotted itself from the rest of the world.<br>People here need to think about saying and doing things that benefit each other. Otherwise, have it ur way. But the Chinese will survive.</div>
