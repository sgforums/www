            <div class='col-md body'>Where will boycotting lead us to? Virtually everything around us is made in China. Let's say we boycott chinese goods and buy Taiwanese and japanese goods instead. The cost of labour in Taiwan and japan is higher than China and this means our cost of living will skyrocket like never before. (prices of goods soar)<br>Our economy is so bad already. So many people are living in dire straits.  We will be bankrupted if we do so.</div>

I understand some of you have your unpleasant run in with China citzens or vice versa. But it does not show well on us if we call them derogative names. What we lack here perhaps is a in depth understanding of them. Going to Geylang to copulate with some of the prostitutes who are of China nationality doesn ot increase our understanding of them as a people and them as a nation. I have worked with China people and have even taught some of them in university. Sure, I do not like some of them initiately 'cause I thought they were arrogant and dogmatic. However, after teaching them and interacting with them during tea breaks or sharing sessions, I came to understand them better and their thoughts as to why some things are and why some things are taboo.<br><br>Citizens of China, I hope too that you will all understand of stance too. We too are a proud people who do not wish to kowtow to anybody's wishes. I do not understand LHL's actual purpose for going Taiwan. But, let the politicians slug among themselves and we as bystanders try to comprehend what they are trying to do {or at least perceive <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> since most politicians are bloody liars :p}<br><br>The reason I am not closing this thread for now is I rather you all open up your feelings here and talk than to remain in a myopic state by not understanding each other's views. So I hope both sides tone down a little and use less colourful rhetoric during your subsequent debates.<br><br>Thanks  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

They are more comfortable typing in Chinese just as we are more comfrotable typing in English. Just install software packages that reads other languages and you will be able to read it. If you can't read it, just ignore it. It is just another hate message anyway.</div>
