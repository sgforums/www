That is not the issue of money, it is all about race. that is the reality of such a world. it is ugly but that is real.

For the god sake, in the eyes of those white, you are just chinese,, or chinks whatsoever. to say it again, it is all about the race. the essential thing or the only chance for chinese to stand up is to face up the reality and do sth about it wherever you are.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>back to the topic. some products made in china are not of high quality for sure.. there is no doubts about it. But what they are doing right now is exactly what japaness did in 1970s. In order to get the share of a well established market,, they have to get their product price low. and it will take some time to develop into that stage of producing high end products on the market.. takes time.. as chinese, you would not feel proud when chinese can make fantastic products? why are you starting put shit on it?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yes. for sure you are a singaporen. or whoever you are. you are supposed to talk and do sth in the interests of singapore. the thing is you are trying to justify the kind of boycott against a country. for what? crappy quality of their goods? i suppost not. you are trying to put on some kind of punishment on that country out of a mixed feeling against it.  You reckon doing this kind of things will be in the best interests of your beloved country? I doubt it. Let alone you have got such capacity of doing so. A city country like singapore is always shifty in this kind of matter. it is understandable.  And also when you are taking about interests, there is nothing like justice. As interests are always against justice.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Precisely true.Deep inside all those who claim who love China , lies the seed of capitalism and love of money only.Look at China in the 60s and 70s, would so mnay people speak up in defence of China, how misguided they may be?The day when I can say proudly that I have the same blood as those mainlanders, is when they learn how to be great nation.Perhaps they should look to the Ming Era as a guide.Other dynasties and rulers have only brought shame and misery.And as every  Chinese knows, we can become backstabbers to our own kind if not checked.Look at China and Taiwan.God bless my forefathers who chose to break free of that insidious place and culture.</div>

Do you think that doing so is really because made-in-china product is shitty? Is it just purely product quality issue in most of people's mind in this forum? I doubt it.  It is totally out of political reason.<br><br>Nobody expects your singaporeans standing up for PRC as long as you are not against it for bloody no reason. If somebody just tries to take any chance to sneak his idea  of putting chinese down, this opinion is supposed to be "condemned" other than crappy chinese product. Business is business. if a certain kind of product can be sold on the market at whatever the pricce it should be, that means this product is viable on the market.  But your guys are not just talking about business but politics or country or people instead.<br><br></div>
