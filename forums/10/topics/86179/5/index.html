In my opinion, there is no such thing like "right or not" in this matter. That is related with the competition about the living space for the chinese people. I noticed you used the word "wiser".  in my understanding you are not trying to convince me with "right or wrong". it is "wise.. it means taiwan will benefit from what they are doing in there.. as they have got much stronger country to rely on but not china. you reckon it is gutful or gutless behaviour?  if Japan were in the situation, taiwan will lean towards japanese. even though chinese have got such a strong sentiment against japanese because of what they have done against chinese in the past.  As to the justice, taiwan is chinese territority, isn't that right? i would not think you will argue about this. and if this "country" will take the side of chinese would-be enemy, what chinese will do?  I really do not know how much you know about china. if your judgement is still based on the so called regime, that would be very very dangerous. Assume china is "democratic" country, it will do the same thing when in current situation. Once again, it is not all about regime, but all about whole nation.  and i suppose that a lot taiwaness are holding the same opinion as you do. but to me they will put themselves into a big diaster in the nearly future.. as a showdown time is coming shortly in this matter.<br><br></div>

I can only say I have no problem moving around in different countries (not as tourist but a common folk on the street). Have it ever occur to you that you are partially responsible for how people respond to you?<br><br>As for the situation in Malaysia, again, I shall not explain too much. I will just say that the Chinese Malaysian are doing much better than the Malay Malaysian. I do not know what kind of discrimination is this when the Chinese has bigger cars, house and everything compared to the Malays. If second class citizens means those things, I guess I do not mind being a second class citizen.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Lastly, I am amazed by the fact that someone overseas is telling me, a Malaysian, that I am being discriminated in Malaysia when I said I am not. </div></blockquote>buddy,, let me tell you a thing,, you are just another chinese, typically good at comforting yourself. in terms of money.  like japanese they are rich for sure,, you reckong they get respect from whites or other ethinic group of people?? Do not be silly. but it is always good to think positive and know how to comfort yourself in such a cowardly way. as you are avoiding the truth.<br><br></div>
