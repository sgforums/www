            <div class='col-md body'>for your info, Japan had recalled most house appliances to be re-made in Japan as they realised that China is copying their products and also their sales were affected after having [Made-in-China] labels or imprints on the products...such as Pioneer, JVC, etc...<br><br>to be honest I find Made in Malaysia more reliable than those Made-in-China products...<br><br>this CB china even copied CISCO switches (even the software codes were copied from CISCO) ... if u remember, the brand is XINWA or XINHWA brand.....later they kena sued by CISCO until jialat jialat!!!!...<br><br>PLEASEEEEE!!!!!  Singapore companies...DON'T manufacture things in China la...coz i won't buy!!!!!!!!<br><br>Japanese products are safe and professionally designed....see beh cool and class....<br><br>Another important thing to note is baby toys....those selling at $1....remember those plastic balls selling at $1 shops?  those are killer products......stupid and cruel bosses are importing such cheap products....u know why i label them as killer products?  The plastic balls have very sharp edges due to their no-QC molding and production......children can cut or even severe their fingers if they insert their fingers in between those gaps between the plastic balls....<br><br>I still prefer those FISHER brand children toys....</div>

There are a lot of china women in singapore and most of them are doing decent jobs. u guys should not always mention china gals in geylang, I believe chinese ppl also feel shame on those chickens. There are many other female china talents in singapore and they are doing so well in NUS, NTU and MNCs.<br><br>What I suggest is that you guys should not have so much bias on china and china ppl, china is not in 60s and 70s anymore and you should go there to take a look.<br><br>DONT BELIEVE WHAT MEDIA PORTRAYED ABT CHINA!
