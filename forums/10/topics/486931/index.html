              <div id="post_message_1609481"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Communism vs Democracy (Unite): the ball is at President Xi JinPing's feet.</span></strong><br> <br> I believe that in all forms of politics: communism, autocracy, democracy
               etc etc, the main focus should be care for poor people and the 
              elimination of corruption. In this essay, I focus on the latter 
              (corruption) and other points too.<br> <br> Chiefly, WRT corruption, there are 2 main methods of targeting this, 
              perhaps of equal importance: firstly, those against corruption should be
               people who are honourable themselves and who place charity above their 
              own needs: healing the wounds of society by uplifting the impoverished. 
              The second is transparency and freedom of speech so that whistle blowers
               cannot be silenced.<br> <br> <strong>China proclaims itself</strong> to be a bastion of the 
              elitism/authoritarianism (communist/ central government): i.e. that its 
              leaders are wise and charitable men, above corruption and are able to 
              stem out/suppress corruption as well as promulgate policies to uplift 
              the impoverished. <strong>America/West is bastion of freedom</strong> (democracy/ 
              transparency) type politics: Unfortunately, each emphasis (or 
              overemphasis, to the exclusion of the other) has its own problems. 
              China's Mandarins say they are not corrupt, but without real 
              transparency, this isn't believed and many times, the corruption is so 
              bad, that even with state censorship, it still shows). Even in 
              relatively more transparent places e.g. <a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asiapacific/hong-kong-s-cy-leung-says/1426416.html">Hong Kong, where Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying says<em> "if the government met student demands and allowed candidates to be 
              nominated by the public, Hong Kong’s poor and working class could 
              dominate the elections"</em></a>: which proves that such elitism breeds 
              inequality and thus social discord: to the extent that a permanent 
              social underclass is formed: even the HKG Chief Executive declared the 
              majority of Hong Konger's working class= poor:  Chinese communism has 
              failed to uplift the poor and perhaps made the situation worse.<br> <br> In the USA, there is so much freedom of speech that voices of integrity 
              and charity are drowned out by radical (/greedy) capitalist interest: 
              large corporations and banks pay large sums of $$$ to politicians as 
              lobby fees such that as as I understand, banks have lobbied their way to
               being granted <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/100880857#.">leverage
               ratio on savings deposit reserves of 20:1: i.e. meaning a widespread 
              wipe-out of private savings accounts should these bank investments 
              decline by just 5%!</a>: so much of government/ taxpayers funds have 
              been used to bail out rogue bankers that people now call the the USA a 
              lame duck government and even the Chinese Yuan is fast replacing the USD
               as the reserve currency of the world (welcome communism everybody). 
              Terrorist like ISIS dance circles because USA is now too $$$-poor to 
              fight back.<br> <br> <strong>So the answer lies in-between and Hong-Kong is that in-between.</strong> Returned to China in 1997, the Hong-Kongers still have a penchant for 
              the higher ideals in Marslow's hierarchy of needs: i.e. freedom, (their 
              bellies filled by the freedom to trade and prosper as introduced by the 
              British prior): unfortunately, the lack of transparency and audience for
               citizen's feedback to the government have made many Hong Kong citizens 
              (especially the young) relatively poor as under Chinese rule, Hong Kong 
              has become an exploited colony with its property prices driven 
              stratospherically by rent-seeking investors from China: charity and 
              welfare for the young and the citizenry has since become a scarcity, 
              thus the eagerness for young Hong Kongers to obtain the universal 
              suffrage that they have been promised: true universal suffrage and not 
              one pre-vetted by Beijing: their only hope for a better life being 
              effective political leverage.<br> <br> Unfortunately, Hong Kong remains still a colony, once British, now 
              Chinese in every way but name: it doesn't even have its own army and 
              depends upon China for territorial sovereignty: it is in this regard 
              that China defends its veto mandate on Hong Kong political leadership 
              candidates moving forward.<br> <br> <strong>Thus, having contrasted the two essentially differing political systems</strong>:
               i.e. elitist (authoritarian) vs freedom (democratic) government systems
               of East vs West, and alluding the 1997 Hong Kong separation agreement 
              that 2 systems of government should coexist in China ("one country two 
              systems"), I propose that the go between would be for 50% of politicians
               in Hong Kong to be fully elected by Hong Kong citizens and 50% of 
              politicians be appointed by the Chinese central government. Hong Kong 
              residents being defined by the measure of their citizenship and diluted 
              by double citizenships: e.g. a PR might be considered only a 'half 
              citizen' with 33% electoral choice (e.g. A USA Citizen with HK-PR and 
              Malaysian-PR) has a 25% voting weightage (50% USA, 25%HKG, 25%M'sia): as
               the case may be. Neither HKG nor China appointed politicians will have 
              final say except through consensus; although greater interest would 
              prevail: Hong Kong being China's pride as the most stable and advanced 
              political system balancing elitism(communism) with 
              transparency(democracy): an opportunity for <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/24/world/asia/32-terrorist-groups-smashed-in-xinjiang-china-says.html?_r=0">the restive XinJiang region </a>to
               flourish in their own culture and an advancement of current political 
              methods spearheaded by the Chinese Central government on behalf of the 
              world.<br> <br> <strong>The chance to try out this novel (best of both worlds) system is now 
              at the foot of China and China is fortunate to be given this opportunity
               to shine as a true world political power (a chance that America abused 
              and has since ransomed to corrupt $$$-bankers).</strong><br> <br> <strong>Will the young have a future/ a voice?</strong> Will peace prevail in Hong
               Kong as a microcosm of the world? The outcome of the umbrella movement 
              and how China handles it will tell.<br> And I hope that there is more wisdom in Chinese president Xi JinPing 
              than to just stab at the fire button (eliminate the students) because 
              his legacy will be the future of this world.</div>

              Hello, I am from Singapore, NOT Hong Kong although both are Chinese majority countries (or part thereof). Fact is, humans are all part of societies and how society is ruled/ organised is promised much on the particulars of such political control/ governance: e.g. democracy, communism, colony, federation etc: each title highlighting a unique system/ relationship, itself highlighting that unique relationship between rulers and the ruled.<br><br>Integrity of rulers or the electorate (democracy) is essential for a country to operate optimally and peaceful revolutions e.g. Ghandi, Nelson Mandela etc have achieved improvements in citizen's lives by eradicating colonialism or apartheid rule respectively. The people's power movement in the Philippines toppled the corrupt Marcos administration and has perhaps installed progressively more honest leaders ever since: it remains work in progress however.<br><br>So I conclude that it is integrity, wisdom and steadfast commitment to the good of fellow men that drives such peaceful and productive revolutions towards the creation of a more robust, peaceful and happy societies that give all a fair/ good chance at a happy/ productive life.<br><br>HKG students want real universal suffrage because that will give poor Hong Kong some leverage in obtaining the social benefits that they have been deprived of and now badly need to survive. Already, a sizeable number of Hong Kong citizens, for lack of public housing, are victims of rent-seeking rich landlords: have to settle for subhuman existance living in cage-homes (Pict as appended): when a large % of the population views communist China as aggravating if not fueling wealth divides, one cannot fault them for associating the Xi JinPing administration with inhumanity if not greed and bias. Thus the people's insistence on universal suffrage: I.e. the real right to vote for the majority interest.<br><br><img id="vBCodeIMG" class="vbimgcodelimit" title="Resized image - click to view original size" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/02/07/article-2275206-17669A13000005DC-794_634x431.jpg" border="0" alt="" width="514"><a style="color: #005688;" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2275206/Hong-Kongs-metal-cage-homes-How-tens-thousands-live-6ft-2ft-rabbit-hutches.html">"Where home is a metal cage: How tens of thousands of Hong Kong's poorest are forced to live in 6ft by 2ft rabbit hutches"</a><br><br>The selfish current China endorsed HKG leadership has treated the HKG poor like 'nature': I.e. wild animals who deserve to stay in cramped and dirty cages: I thus do not totally blame them for occupying (camping enmasse@) the CBD and other main HKG streets in protest to obtain the universal sufferage (fresh air): that they had originally been promised of to begin with.</div>
