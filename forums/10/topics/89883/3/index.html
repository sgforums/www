The current ruling party, DPP was formed in 1986 as an opposition party, two years before Chiang died. When LDH took over in 1989, Taiwan oredi has a vibrant economy with democracy. What did LDH do? amended the constitution for direct election of HIMSELF as the President of ROC, is that what you mean by "bringing real democracy" to Taiwan?<br><br>LDH split KMT by chasing James Song out, james later formed the new People First Party, Lee was later fired from KMT but was not welcome in DPP so he formed the Taiwan Solidarity Union. Is this what you mean bringing "his country to a new height by bringing in more opposition parties.."??<br><br>Taiwan took the last train in the Asian Crisis. Overall thanks to China, the communists when Ju Rong ji refused to devalue RMB and thus saving China and Taiwan from being dragged in.<br><br>Singapore do not discriminate Taiwanese. Many local Taiwanese earned themselves names for being loudmouthed. They are also known in Hong kong as "got money no culture." How did Singapore discriminate them?<br><br>Singapore jealous of them? bu yao yi xiao ren zhi xin du jun zi zhi fu.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>As a political party, they have their own vision, which leads to their goals and ideals. As with any body fully supportive of the expression of one's ideas without persecution, they should have a right to state, and fight for their stand in the matter, regardless of how the rest of us will disagree with.<br><br>There is no reason to put someone down for his belief, unless it is a dangerous faith which could eventually lead him to do something to endanger our lives. Notwithstanding that, he should be free to speak his mind without any personal attacks.<br><br>Of course, his ideas are up for debate, as there are compelling reasons as to why certain views are more prevalent than others, and such reasons might cause people to switch stands; however, debate should not include personal attacks on one's character, which is a severly underhanded method to use in a fair sparring of ideas.<br><br>SDP advocates muslim girls to wear the Tudung to secular classes. They have a reason for that! Their ideal is to promote freedom of expression, which is what is written in our constitution, yet is hardly practised successfully. The PAP administration disallows the practice for fear of a social gap. Both are valid viewpoints, and as such the issue is up for debate. What I do not understand is why some people, especially certain PAP members, start personal attacks upon the opposing side? Has political debate degenerated to such an extent that the few politicians left here need to smear personal mud on one another, instead of targetting policies/ideas?<br><br>A visit to the SDP's website has proven their consistency in discussing ideals/policies, and so far, they have not engaged in personal attacks, such as printing disparaging claims that "So and so is strangulating Singapore!" Using labels such as that in the topic title are examples of generalisation meant towards facilitating personal attacks. Note that I mentioned "facilitate". The title itself does not state much, however, the debate it incites polarises the debaters into two camps, each defending or attacking the integrity of the party.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I am both amazed and inspired by the rebutes made by Atobe. It shows that even in a masked democratic society that we live in, people can still judge the right from wrong and view political issues with in depth understanding;with reference to many sources across the web.<br>However,given the one up manship and undisputed order of dictatorship maintained by the ruling party, the fruit of all discussions will still lead to despair for the current generation.<br>Looking on the bright side, the next generation of Singaporeans will stand a much better chance in the political arena due to the expotential increase of knowledge and information brought to them. Death is something even our lao Lee cannot fight. Without the political dominance and influence of lky and other aging sentinels and heavyweights in the ruling party, color can be then added to our otherwise dull and bleak political scene.</div>

It is extremely difficult for the opposition to find any even better alternatives to convince the ppl to make changes. There is nothing the opposition can do.<br><br>Secondly, PAP continue to field more new and better candidates at each election, more than the opposition parties put together. We may not like lao lee and even xiao lee, but there are still Teo CH, George Yeo......we can't say we don't like all of them. In the meantime, opposition strong men are still only Chiam, Low......and Chee (who is not much of a fight.)<br><br>We cannot expect the opposition parties to be strong only when relative to a weak PAP. The reality is that PAP is strong and opposition parties therefore need to be even stronger, if they want to be of any impact.<br><br>Politics is never clean. Look at Taiwan, it took LDH to split KMT from within for ah bian of DPP to be elected. See what DDP did to switch the votes, the bullets that could turn in flight, simultaneous voting of president and memorandum, military not allowed to vote..... Singaporean politicians should never resort to such tricks.<br><br>What else can they do to grow? I don't know. They have to count on themselves, for a start, at least make sure that each of them keeps their accounts clean; plan their attack, especially against PAP members, be united during election.....<br><br>As far as PAP is concerned, the only thing you can count on them is that they would continue to attack the opposition parties whenever, and wherever possible. That is politics and they are politicians.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Bugger SDP with a pine cone, I say. If that bastad Chee was alive in the 1930s, he would probably be a Nazi. Bloody agitator, I bet 80% of SG doesn't give a hoot if the son of a bitch dies on his heroic hunger strike  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>I am especially impressed by his fuking stupidity regarding the tudung issue. True, we do have race problems in Singapore, but purposely provoking so as to cause dissention and communal tension is attacking the stability of our nation. I may not like some PAP policies, but I admire them for bringing us to the stage where we can stay at home and complain over the internet instead of starving on the street.<br><br>That fateha.com guy is also an asshole. Sure we need to discuss racial issues, but surely we can do it in a civilized manner, not like Chee who screams on his soapbox like some Hitler wannabe or like this Osama worshipper.<br><br>Thanks to the efforts of Chee, the opposition has lost alll credibilty. And no, I don't agree that PAP is the cause of it. People have voted SDP over PAP b4 (Bukit Gombak) when they are unhappy. Its because of Chee, thats why, and Steve Chia.<br><br>The only opposition leaders I admire are Chiam See Tong and JBJ, who sadly the PAP forced into bankrupcy. If we had more leaders like them, we defintiely would have an opposition capable of standing up to the ruling party.<br><br>BTW, Francis Seow can stay in the US and that Chinese racist fellow can stay in AUstralia. We don't need them. Chee is invited to migrate too  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
