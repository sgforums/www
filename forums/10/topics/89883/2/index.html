What if he only knows how to pull the trigger but does not know how to aim? what if he is not strong enough to control the recoil? somebody else get shot! If the opposition fails, who suffer? the ppl.<br><br>The opposition need to show better alternatives, how they can do better. The ppl of singapore are not stupid. Voting for the opposition is to keep PAP in check. You can say they are using the opposition to ensure that PAP perform. But don for a moment believe that ppl want an opposition just for a change. As it is, the opposition parties are not cooperative, they do not have enough ppl to contest in all constituencies, many only work just before elections. If oppositions want to win votes just by running down PAP, they have to do a lot more. Mind you, PAP is not stupid, they know how to lure ppl to join their party.<br><br>We have also seen many opposition members ran away and lived comfortably in australia and US, after their bids in elections failed. In this aspect, ppl like Dr. Chee and Jaya remain credible opposition because they continue to stay in singapore to fight.<br><br>Even if PAP were truely rotton, we want to be sure that the opposition who take over would not be more rotton when they have the power.<br><br>Giving the opposition a free trial of ruling of singapore just to see if they can do better? this is probably just the wet dreams of some politicians wanting to become president or PM.</div>
