              <p>the problem is the GRC system. When you have some micky mouse new bird, he comes into the same team as say....GCT or LKY, who do you vote for? Can i cast seperate vote for the old man and the newbie?</p>
              <p>These newbies have no political experience and here they ride on the popularity of a senior minister. Then along the way, u have pple like gan kim yong, vivian, teo ser luck etc being brought into the spotlight time and again so they can be seen doing the good work. When time is ripe and they have become "heavyweight", the process goes on and on. And the party renews again and again, forever and ever.</p>

              <p><br>In every organisation, every team, every party, every family or every conglomorates, there must be a system, and that system must change to the interest of that particular organisation, if the introduction of a 4 4 2 formation works for a football team, PAP introduction of GRC proves to work for them, that is the way it is. And it shouldn't be ending up with the opposition complaining and grumbling all the way to the end, just like football, if the opposition cannot beat a 4 4 2 formation of their opponent, they can just sit there and complain or grumble, they will lose the game, so the opposition must find a way to change their formation or way of playing to counteract it.</p>
              <p>Same goes to opposition parties in singapore, instead of every day complaining and grumbling about GRC formation which had been around since donkey years, they should format a new strategy to counteract the GRC system, not complaining and grumbling everday about not fair, not good, no standard etc etc...because if you do that, at the end of the day, still PAP wins.</p>

              <p><br>As long as you play your game along the framework of the legal aspect, you are in for a game, but if you just sit there and grumble at the change of rules and regulations, and end up refusing to take any challenge to figure out the flaws in the new rules and regulations, so be it. Alway remember, as opposition, PAP is playing on homeground ya.</p>
