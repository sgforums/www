              <p>hello,</p>
              <p>look if some of u haters hate singapore that much then go to other country la, be a "PR" on other nation. I dont get it, i know this place is all about expressing our views on singapore but it looks like u all insulting more than praising. All these pure rage offensive words and these "fuck pap" talk, u guys actually think that posting in sgforums can help? u think the goverment actually come in speaker corners?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Everyone has a good and bad things. But looks like u guys ONLY see the negative side of singapore. Not even one bit of the positive side here. The good people from singapore here are trying to put singapore outside this name known as "one little dot or 'isn't that a part of china' crap". By organizing youth olympics, put up in the top 10 of the best economy around asia, try bringing in tourist attraction by creating IR, universal studio and some others. Come on, we have our very own vegas here. Yes i know our money may have sometimes involve in these (like some of u said) but u think the goverment just going to leave it be? They confirm thinking of ways to earn back our money and such like for example, that money from the goverment that they give us, remember?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>U guys just complain like as if the goverment are abusing us. U think they like taking our money? they are humans too u know. All of these has some disadvantage and flaws if they do some certain actions. So they need to think ahead. U think this important role is easy? <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">THIS ISN'T EMPIRE EARTH OR WORLD OF WARCRAFT. THIS IS REAL LIFE</span>.</strong> I dont mind reading some critics here and there but this is too much and i never expected it to be in a forum. There i rest my statement here. For those who agree of what i said</p>

              <h1>1. Lee Hsien Loong, Prime Minister, Singapore</h1>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Annual salary</strong>: $2.75 million</span></p>
              <p>The highest-paid politician by a staggering margin, Lee Hsien Loong has often defended his extravagant salary. In a recent U.S. trip, Loong highlighted how American politicians, because of their low annual salaries, may have other interests — future pursuits, perhaps — that could distract them from their public service. "Our attitude is: you must pay for the quality of the person you want," he said of his high earnings. "You want the best person and you want him to be properly motivated." Still, rhetoric aside, there are many who justly suggest Loong's annual income is far too high for governing Singapore, a tiny nation of less than five million people. The P.M.'s salary of $2.75 million per year is more than 80 times that of the average Singaporean family.</p>

              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Annual salary</strong>: $309,800</span></p>
              <p>Canadians are world class when it comes to grieving about taxes. And who could blame us? Last year, according to the Fraser Institute, the average Canadian family lost 42 per cent of their household income to taxes. Because of this, the ire of the Canuck taxpayer always falls on figures with public salaries, and no such official earns more in Canada than Harper. Wherever you stand on the P.M.'s annual salary — is it too much, or too little? — the Conservative leader earns a wide margin more than the average Canadian. As of the last census, full-time Canadian workers made an average of only $41,401 each year.</p>

              <h1>Political salaries revealed: Are we paying too much?</h1>
              <p>Prime Minister Stephen Harper announced in his recent throne speech that the government will table legislation to freeze the pay of the prime minister, cabinet ministers, MPs and senators. What will this actually mean in dollar terms? Probably not much. According to the Canadian Press, the 1.5 per cent wage increase that the 308 MPs and 105 senators received last year amounted to a total burden on governemnt of about $1 million. A one-year wage freeze is not likely to put much of a dent in the deficit or the pockets of our representatives, especially considering how much federal salaries have increased in the past 10 years. Here's a look at the basics of federal salaries, and a comparison to what they were in 2000 (calculations do not include non-taxable expense allowances, pensions or travel allowances).</p>

              Because you are also another elitist and a YPAP member so that's why you say all these.

              <p>dare82, u hate PAP doesn't mean i say anything that u being a member of the anti-pap gang if there is.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And i dont want to repeat myself, "u think this important role is easy?" try understand this right and put yourselves into their shoes. I'm just a normal citizen working as a clerk and yes, my salary is low but i bet my salary lower than yours because i'm just here to part-time as an assistant here like filing up forms and stuff. We all have similar objectives here, work for food, enjoyment, live a normal life etc. The only difference between us two is that i can see the tough time the goverment go through. I repeat the statement again, "each move they make, there's flaw and some disadvantage so they need to think ahead". U guys mostly complaining about what? they taking your money? That is purely pathetic. If they take away your home i understand but money? if they taking your money, u will be starved to death and be feed on grass.</p>
              <p>Just a small amount of money they took and u guys make a big fuss. Have u guys even seen what saddam hussein does to the citizens in iraq? have u seen places like africa? We live here so comfortable with air-cons, civilised country, sentosa resort etc yet people in africa suffer earthquakes, economy but hey look, i dont think they whine as much as u guys do. Is best that our goverment trying to help us here and u guys dont feel one bit appreciated. We already live in a mini-version of USA here... somesort like that and what more u can ask? more money? is that the only thing u guys think about? </p>

              <p>Naturally speaking grumbling and complaining is part and parcel of humans, they grumble and complain on anything, fair or not fair.

Today coffee shops are full of foreigners, grumbling there, no one listen or bother, Hong Lim park need apply for licence, and anything more than two peoples grumbling and complaining about the govt together is consider an offence. So, this maybe the only outlet for them to vent their anger and speak their mind, if we stop it, IMH is going to be overloaded.</p>
              <p>Anyway, as i counted, only a few are here everyday telling us abt PAP History and unfairness of govt, it dun matter much. I would suggest you let them be as most are not young and will not be grumbling for long...on the other hands, if they really get out of here and stop grumbling and complaining, then i may lose my job here.</p>

              <p>butbutbut I think singapore is great. it sucks in quite a few ways, but if you travel to several countries you will learn to appreciate that we are very fortunate people.</p>
              <p>I think people can generally be classified into 2 halves. I call them the half empty and half full... like the glass. the haters see only the bad, ignore the good and condemn that singapore sucks. or else, they are less exposed, and haven't had the opportunity to see the ugly things about the world.</p>
              <p>and I don't even mean war, sickness, poverty, and all those clear cut examples. I mean I'm talking about things which we take for granted like safety, cleanliness and a relatively decent freedom of speech - ok so we don't have complete freedom, but many countries face terrible censorship from the government.</p>
              <p>I think if one is objective, one would see that the glass in SG is more than half full. Just that people being people, many of us are natural pessimists, either that or we are simply not as exposed. Ironically, not being exposed to the world (and we aren't the worst either. A study by National Geographic a few years back showed that many Americans couldn't identify on the map, Mexico, which is just below US, Japan, and Iraq, which is a country they were at war with for years.) is perhaps the country's fault, but that doesn't mean that the country sucks.</p>

              <p>I read this analogy in another forum by another forumer.  I think I can use it here.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It's like paying top dollar for a luxury car.  Everything is good and nice - nice leather seats,  nice wheels, good steering, nice finishing and interior etc.  The problem is that the brake system is faulty.  But will the driver think it's okay because heck, majority of the car is fine and dandy, it's ok with a little faulty brake system.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It's the same situation with Singapore.  We pay top dollar for our ministers.  Most of the things are more or less fine and dandy.   A "bit" of imperfections here and there - MS escaping, high cost of living, low wages, liberal immigration policies, expensive HDB flats, billion dollars lost in investments with no public accountability - but heck we have a nice country with no natural disasters, nice shiny buildings, nice public transport, everything is clean and nice.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Guess people are not justified in asking for improvements to the system or that their interests and welfare are protected after paying top dollar?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I know the driver of the luxury car will kpkb to the car dealer if he finds out about the faulty brake.  He sure as hell won't say, it's ok, since the rest of the car looks ok. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
