              <p>We are living in an undemocratic (globally) society where the prevalent form of government is fascism, where it is the "merger of state and corporate power" -according to Mussolini. In addition, policies are being implemented not to further the interest of the common people, but to further enrich the power and wealth of this corporate-political elite. At the same time, surveillance societies are being set up globally to check any dissent or opposition. In this context, public opinion engineered by the MSM is designed to keep the masses distracted on a diet of entertainment and infotainment (what an insult!) and to prevent this "true nature" of society from being perceived.</p>
              <p>This group of people does not care about human concerns. If they can earn more profits, they'll sacrifice human life (Like Bayer corp, when it sold HIV-infected drugs to Europe with the approval of the FDA and the corporate-induced carnage in the Congo).</p>
              <p>If society doesnt wake up to this fucked up reality, the planet and humanity will be fucked and it'll be all YOUR (in the broadest sense) fault.</p>

              <p><br> The billions spent by Obama and McCain were from contributions
              <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">voluntarily</span></strong> given by
              US Citizens to the individuals or political party of
              their choice and regulated by legislations as to the amount given -
              <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>WITHOUT</em></span> any political <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>RECRIMINATIONS</em></span> from
              the political party that succeed in the process to form the next
              Govenment.</p>
              <p>In our Singapore environment, the incumbent Ruling
              Political Party is afraid of the overwhelming support
              of Singaporeans given to the Alternative Parties, and
              will create all measure to prevented financial and morale support
              to be given by creating an environment
              psychological fear of recriminations after the
              election.</p>
              <p>In a mature political environment like the USA, large
              corporations and huge public personalities freely and openly
              support the various candidates of their choice WITHOUT any
              consequential recriminations.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Do you seriously think that politics in Singapore do
              not cost BILLIONS as well ?</p>
              <p>The incumbent Ruling Party will spend BILLIONS of Public Money
              in so many different ways, and no less than the obvious dubiously
              named economic progress payments as the Elections date gets
              closer.</p>
              <p>In terms of proportions, is it not shameful that for a small
              country of 4.5 million residents of which 3 million PLUS are
              citizens, only less then half the population will actually
              participate in the election process - due to the
              shameless shenanigan of the incumbent political party in
              hampering a genuine election process ?</p>
              <p>For all the seeming cost expended, it is encouraging that the
              political process in the USA managed to have an overwhelming
              turnout of their eligible population that is far bigger in
              numbers than Singapore - and which truly give legitimacy to the
              incoming President-elect Obama.</p>

              <p>Correct. We don't actually know how much the PAP spent on elections simply because our media is not doing its job as a free media! It will never do any investigative reporting and will only tell us what the PAP wants us to hear.</p>

              <p>Oh yeah, the party that got arrested before the 1963 elections under the ISA for being communists.</p>
              <p>Another lesson for Singapore, don't easily believe accusations of "terrorists"-the new "communists", since in both cases, it could just refer to dissidents and political opposition.</p>
              <p>Under the the "Violent Radicalisation and Homegrown Terrorism Act", HR 1955 awaiting senate vote in the US:</p>
              <p>"The term `homegrown terrorism' means the use, planned use, or threatened use, <em><strong>of force or violence </strong></em>by a group or individual..."</p>
              <p>What is the difference between force and violence in the physical sense? Or are they supposed to mean two things?</p>
              <p>Besides the sense of physical violence, force could mean:</p>
              <p>1.  Intellectual power or vigor, especially as conveyed in writing or speech.</p>
              <p>2. A capacity for affecting the mind or behavior</p>
              <p>Substituted into the definition of HR 1955, these two definitions of "force" makes HR 1955 seem designed to criminalise dissent. Now, is this too far-fetch'd a conclusion to reach?</p>
              <p>So when people call for the killing of terrorists, without realising that it is governments that sponsor terrorist attacks in the first place, it all becomes a big farce.</p>

              so-called act of aggression could be repulsed as self-defence.</p>
              <p>Hitler dressed up prisoners as Polish soldiers and had them
              attack a German radio station so that he could start WWII by

              <p>The US Govt staged 9/11 so that they could expand police powers

              <p>Official story: 19 hijackers, 15 of them from Saudi Arabia, hijacked four planes and crashed two of them into WTC 1 and 2, collapsing them. One into the Pentagon. One crashed in Pennsylvania.</p>
              <p>Problem with official story #1: Some of the alleged hijackers are still alive, reported the BBC</p>
              <p>Problem #2: If 2 planes crashed into the Twin Towers, then what caused WTC 7 to collapse in the same exact manner almost 8 hours later?</p>
              <p>Problem #3: Why did eye-witnesses report ground-level explosions that totally wrecked the lobby of the Twin Towers?</p>
              <p>Problem #4: If the jet fuel weakened the support structures of the Twin Towers, then according to the official pancake theory, why wasn't the steel core left standing? Instead, the steel cores were photographed after the collapse as having been cut diagonally (by thermite, thermite residue found by 9/11 researchers).</p>
              <p>Problem #5: If a plane hit the Pentagon, then where is all the debris, including the tail section, fuselage and especially the engine made of titanium which couldnt have been destroyed by the flames? And why was the hole made in the Pentagon not big enough for a jet liner? What hit the Pentagon?</p>
              <p>Problem #6: If the government's official story is true, then why did the CIA/FBI confiscated all CCTV cameras around the Pentagon immediately after the crash and refused to release them except for 5 frames, which is inconclusive?</p>
              <p>Problem #7: If a plane crashed in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, then again, where is all the debris and human bodies? Shouldnt there be the wreckage? Go check out the photos. In fact, a cornerer said that it wasnt a crime scene because there were no human bodies.</p>
              <p>Problem #8: Why did Dick Cheney order NORAD to stand-down when it was known that hijacked planes were in the air?</p>
              <p>Problem #9: What a coincidence that more than 6 anti-terrorist exercises were taking place on 9/11 envisioning the same scenario.</p>
              <p>Problem #10: Why did the US Govt invade Afghanistan, blaming Bin Laden for 9/11, when 1)war plans for the invasion already existed before 9/11 and 2)the FBI does not list Bin Laden as responsible for 9/11 because of lack of evidence.</p>
              <p>So, given all these inconsistencies, the official story just doesnt stand. It is more likely that it was another false-flag operation carried out by the CIA/MI6/Mossad or a combination, to set into motion global change, which we have experienced.</p>

              <p>Again, another instance of media conditioning.</p>
              <p>A conspiracy is defined as two or more people planning in secret to commit an illegal act.</p>
              <p>If someone believed there is a conspiracy, it does not mean he is crazy or suffering from mental instability.</p>
              <p>Why do we have anti-trust and anti-monopoly laws? Are you saying that our legal system is based on crazy premises? That could get you charged for libel (Oops, I shouldnt be saying that).</p>
              <p>Nowadays, people think "conspiracy" and immediately switch off. Got to hand it to the media, such efficient conditioning to prevent people from questioning the official story.</p>

              <p>And if the official story doesnt stand. The justification for the War on Terror just doesnt stand. Is your saviour president-elect "change" willing to open an honest investigation into 9/11 to question the corporate-political agenda of a War of Terror that increases profits?</p>
              <p>I conjectured that it was carried out by intelligence agencies. Comparing the official story with its loopholes, one is likely to believe that the government is hiding its involvement in 9/11.</p>

              <p>Well what was the point of posting that link? What views did that documentary put forward?</p>
              <p>Yes, its conjecture. But the evidence that destroys the official story suggests a totally different scenario, along the lines of government involvement. If the official story doesnt hold, if the 19 hijackers are not the real culprits, then who is responsible? Either the government or a third party terrorist group that we havent heard about.</p>
