              <em>Gandhi Ambalam</em> &amp; <em>Maurice Neo</em><br><img src="http://www.yoursdp.org/images/stories/graphics/election_08.jpg" border="1" alt="" width="185" align="right"><br>What
              have the American presidential and the Malaysian parliamentary
              elections, both of which took place this year, have in common and what
              lessons have they brought for Singapore?<br><br>One was in faraway
              America mandated to take place once every four years and the other an
              equally mundane affair. But they both had a profound impact on the
              already receptive psyche of Singaporeans.<br> <br>What was considered "unthinkable" unfolded in America. For the
              first time in the country's history an African-American was elected to
              the highest office of the land. A monumental achievement indeed,
              considering the fact that it was only in the 1960s that the Civil
              Rights Movement took place, one that was met with fierce resistance
              from the some groups in the white community.<br><br>Earlier in Malaysia
              a political tsunami swept aside the well-entrenched racial politics of
              the ruling elite that dominated the country for more than half a
              century. The elections there ushered a historic new era in the
              country's politics.<br><br>Can we in Singapore be insulated from these
              two phenomena? There is no doubt that the PAP leadership through its
              well-oiled propaganda machine will try. Contrary to ground sentiment,
              the authoritarian ruling elite keeps mouthing the same old refrain that
              Singaporeans are not ready to accept changes to the status quo. But is
              this the true reflection of the average Singaporean?<br><br>A survey
              last year of close to 2,000 Singaporeans by two academics at the S
              Rajaratnam School of International Studies found that over 91 per cent
              of all races polled said they would accept a prime minister of an
              ethnic group other than Chinese.<br><br>In Malaysia one of the biggest
              changes is the move from the debate on race to the question “Who are
              the politicians serving?” It was clear from the electoral results that
              across the board Malaysians demanded better service from politicians
              and did not buy the racial claptrap from the ruling elite. Malaysians
              wanted good governance not racial politics.<br><br>In the same vein,
              Singaporeans are not convinced by PAP's worn-out insistence that
              Singaporeans vote along racial lines, hence the necessity for the Group
              Representation Constituency (GRC) system.<br><br>Wasn't it in 1981 that
              the late Mr J B Jeyaretnam was elected to parliament in a by-election,
              defeating a candidate from the 'majority' community in the Anson ward?
              In the 1984 general elections that followed, Mr Jeyaretnam again
              defeated a Chinese candidate, who was endorsed personally by the then
              prime minister Mr Lee Kuan Yew as "ministerial material", with an
              increased majority.<br><br>The GRC system was concocted by the PAP and
              implemented in the 1988 general elections. The claim that the scheme
              was to maintain "minority" representation in Parliament was pure
              fiction. It was clear to independent political observers that the
              system was introduced to perpetuate PAP's stranglehold on power.<br><br>Lately,
              in continuing to propagate this racial myth, our state media has
              resorted to scaring the people that racial tension in Malaysia
              increased after the landmark elections this year. Perhaps what is most
              frightening for the Singapore autocrats is that Malaysia can no longer
              use racial fear as the instrument of policy in elections.<br><br>Instead,
              what the Singapore Governemnt fears now is the contagion from Malaysia.
              The new found self belief and the ability to overcome fear propagated
              by the ruling elite is just the thing Singaporeans need.<br><br>The PAP
              goes to the extent of dismissing the Pakatan Rakyat's push for a less
              race-based politics, even to the extent favoring the cronyism of
              “Umnoputras”.The reality of the move towards democracy in Malaysia
              seems too much for the Singapore state to accept. The new dawn in
              Malaysian is too close for comfort.<br><br>As a result the racial myth
              in Singapore is still being perpetuated to instill fear. Prime Minister
              Lee Hsien Loong recently regurgitated the that voters in Singapore are
              not ready to accept a non-Chinese prime minister anytime soon. He was
              echoing what his father said in 1988 when Lee Sr rejected Mr S
              Dhanabalan, who was far more qualified than Mr Goh Chok Tong in Mr
              Lee's own words, as prime minister.<br><br>But in America, Mr Brack
              Obama was elected president riding on the winds of change. The American
              people had the final say of who they wanted as their leader, back or
              white. Mr Obama's message of hope and change also resonated with many
              Singaporeans. But alas in Singapore it is the prime minister who has
              the last say of who gets to be the leaders. <br><br>Is it not clear from the rhetoric by the Lees that it is the PAP that is not prepared to accept a non-Chinese as prime minister?<br><br>But
              can the PAP continue to stem the tide of change that is fast reaching
              our shores, change not only from nearby Malaysia but also from faraway
              America?</p>

              <h2>Are Singaporeans ready for “change” ?</h2>
              <p class="date">Posted by wayangparty on November 28, 2008</p>
              <div class="entrytext">
              <div class="snap_preview">
              <p><strong>By Fang Zhi Yuan, Chief Editor</strong></p>
              <p>“Change we can” for the United States of America.</p>
              <p>Change can we ?</p>
              <p>In an <a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/Think/Story/STIStory_305716.html?sunwMethod=GET">interview</a> with The Sunday Times last week, Mr Tan Kin Lian said: “I need to know that people want the <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>change</strong></span>. If not, then there is no point.”, when asked his chances of running for public office.</p>
              <p>What is the definition of “change” to ordinary Singaporeans ?</p>
              <p>Will the “change” factor which generated a political tsunami across
              the causeway in Malaysia in March 2008 arrive at Singapore’s shores too
              ?</p>
              <p>Many netizens, bloggers and forumers have been agitating for change
              - a change in the PAP system of governance or the even the government
              itself.</p>
              <p>Will this translate to actual votes on the ground for the “change” to materialize in reailty ?</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, sentiments in cyberspace is hardly reflective of
              that in the general population. This group of politically conscious
              netizens form only a minority of the number of net users, let alone the
              entire electorate. <em>(just compare our traffic ranking with Xiaxue’s and it’s not hard to see why).</em></p>
              <p>For every one netizen you found on the net calling for change, there
              are 10 others out there who doesn’t bother to keep themselves updated
              on the nation’s current affairs and politics. “Change” to them simply
              means changing a dress, a car, a job or a partner.</p>
              <p>Nevertheless, there is a growing chorus of discontent at the
              grassroots level against the PAP’s high-handed and often callous manner
              in which they formulate and implement their policies without taking
              into consideration the views and feelings of the citizens.</p>
              <p>A “change” to usher in more opposition MPs into Parliament to check
              on the PAP will definitely be welcomed by many quarters, even by some
              within the establishment itself though that can hardly qualify to be a
              radical change.</p>
              <p>The escape of Mas Selamat, the Lehman brothers fiasco and now the
              Town Councils’ loss of public monies have shown Singaporeans that we
              cannot trust the PAP to check on itself and there is a need for an
              alternative center of power to pressurize it to uphold basic standards
              of accountability and transparency.</p>
              <p>By and large, Singaporeans are so used to the stability and
              prosperity under years of PAP rule that many still prefer them to lead
              the country if only for the lack of a credible alternative to challenge
              it.</p>
              <p>The myth of the infallibility of the PAP has been so entrenched in
              the collective consciousness of Singaporeans that it may take another
              generation it to be uprooted completely.</p>
              <p>Real change will only be possible when the mindset of Singaporeans is changed. To quote from Dr Chee Soon Juan: “<em>The
              biggest struggle is not against the PAP, it is against what the PAP has
              done to our minds. Once we break the mental shackles of fear and
              helplessness, half our battle is won.”</em></p>
              <p>Until then, netizens yearning for “change” may have to waited for another couple of years to have their thirst quenched.</p>

              <p>the US is "the beacon of freedom and democracy" and you don't even know how Bush stole the elections... through huge number of people being denied the right to vote because of things like parking violations, and the wilful disenfranchisation of those whom they KNOW will vote against the GOP...</p>
              <p>when he was losing his lead, he stopped the vote count by activating his cronies in the Supreme Court... (judicial independence?)</p>
              <p>and in Malaysia... why do you think Dr.M is sometimes called Mr.10%?</p>
              <p>you idiots cry for change.. but change into what? has anyone come forward with a proper roadmap for the country? has anyone come forward with any plans at all?</p>
              <p>you rant and foam at the mouth with the other nutter andyboy about opposition politics while refusing to see those who are already working hard and quietly while you guys go lick the ass of attention whores.. anyone who makes noise against the MIW??</p>
              <p>your enemy's enemy may turn out to be your worst enemy... you just don't know it or refuse to recognise it...</p>
              <p>take your blinders off.. stop reading the bullshit in the interweb... go ask around.. and when i say ask around, i mean go ask those who are NOT connected with anything, those who refuse to give their loyalty to something as idiotic as a "political party".. those who are not apathetic and refuse to be sucked into party politics and loyalties..</p>
              <p>you will suddenly see that these people treat almost all politicians with the same contempt, no matter which party they come from...</p>
              <p>mostly, wake the hell up... you are doing a massive disservice to the opposition by your idiocy simply because by mere association, you taint those who are working hard for the people in opposition wards...</p>
              <p>just like some attention whores taint those who are truly working for the people...</p>

              <p>Right. Fox (Faux) is fair and balanced.</p>
              <p>Please look beyond the Democrat-Republican/Left-Right paradigm, its simply clouding the true state of politics. In politics, nothing matters except power. Under Bush (R), there was torture, eroding civil liberties, invading other countries. Even when the Democrats took over Congress, nothing changed. The FAA got passed, more evidence of the corporate-bought political landscape in the US. Now, when the Whitehouse is occupied by a democrat, do you expect any so-called "change"? Even when Obama has demonstrated the same allegiance to the corporate establishment as Bush has?</p>
              <p>4/8 years of republicans, then switch to democrats, after that, switch back to republicans. In the end, its just a way of maintaining the charade of choice to the American people. No matter the merits and demerits of democracy, no democracy exists today; only fake democracies.</p>

              <p><br>Obama never started out as a favorite and was never taken seriously from the very beginning - which was in 2004, when he emerged from the woodworks in his speech made on his first appearance at the 2004 Democratic Convention.</p>
              <p>In the recently concluded US Election Process, Obama was given the slimmest of chance even to win the Primaries, and the media had given Hillary Clinton as a better candidate to defeat John McCain.</p>
              <p>Obama-fever only set in when his message of "Change" sounded more logicable in the light of the worsening economic and foreign military situations with each passing day of the months throughout the campaign.</p>
              <p>It was only as the three public debates that allow the US Electorates to view the two candidates under close public scrutiny for their body-language, tone, and contents of their replies to the various questions posed - that the opinions began to favor Obama.</p>
              <p>John McCain was handicapped by the records of George Bush's Administration, and his no-win position was reluctantly endorsed by the hard core of the Republican Party, and one can only wonder if his decision for Paillin as his running mate was ever his own choice.</p>
              <p>The US Electorate that voted for Obama were not merely the shop floor illiterate Union Workers, with the majority of the US Electorates having received college or University education, and are far more politically conscious than the apathic Singaporeans of similar ages.</p>
              <p>From the urban city workers to the rural agricultural heartlanders, Obama supporters come from across a wide cross-section of ethnic and racial groups, from all the different religious and social groups, from young and old.</p>
              <p>All who had voted Obama were those who have got tired of George Bush's cowboy type gung-ho unilateral politics, which was supported by an incompetent war mongering and oil grabbing hands of Cheney - who was all the more surprisingly disappointing for his experience expected to provide guidance to "Georgie boy".</p>
              <p>It is silly to compare the US Media enthralment in Obama with the mass hysteria in the closed German Society that Hitler mass media had stirred up - with the help of his Storm Troopers to press-gang the German civilians to participate, and with the state print and broadcast media dutifully publicising the events.</p>
              <p>To its credit of the US Mainstream Media has succeeded in maintaining some degree of political independence from the various political parties, as the machinery of the US media simply depended on the subject of public interests for its profitability.</p>
              <p>This independence can be seen in the US Mainstream Media during the publicity given to the Watergate Affair that resulted in Nixon's downfall.</p>
              <p>If anything at all, the US Mainstream Media has yet allowed itself to be subjected by any jingoism to feed the public fervor in any slanted ways.</p>

              <p>Obama-fever only set in when his message of "Change" sounded
              more logicable in the light of the worsening economic
              and foreign military situations with each passing day of
              the months throughout the campaign.</p>
              <p>It was only as the three public debates that allow the US
              Electorates to view the two candidates under close public scrutiny
              for their body-language, tone, and contents of their replies to the
              various questions posed - that the opinions began to favor
              Obama.</p>
              <p>....</p>
              <p>The US Electorate that voted for Obama are not merely the shop
              floor illiterate Union Workers, as the majority of the US
              Electorates have received college or University education, and
              are far more politically conscious than the apathic Singaporeans of
              similar ages.</p>
              <p>From the urban city workers to the rural heartland, Obama
              supporter come from across a wide section of ethnic and racial
              groups, from all the different religious and social groups, from
              young and old.</p>
              <p>All who had voted Obama were those who have got tired
              of George Bush's cowboy type gung-ho unilateral politics, which
              was supported by an incompetent war mongering and oil
              grabbing hands of Cheney - who was all the more
              surprisingly disappointing for his experience expected to
              provide guidance to "Georgie boy".</p>
              <p>To its credit of the Mainstream Media in maintaining some
              degree of political independence from the various incumbent
              parties, the machinery of the US media simply depend
              on the subject of public interests for its profitability.</p>
              <p>This independence can be seen in the US Mainstream Media in the
              publicity given to the Watergate Affair that resulted in Nixon's
              downfall.</p>
              <p>If anything at all, the US Mainstream Media has yet allowed
              itself to be subjected by any jingoism to feed the
              public fervor in any slanted ways.</p>

              <p>Of course, the US MSM isn't owned by <em>only</em> 5 corporations. And they sure didn't beat the war drum for the invasion of Iraq to get rid of WMDs, which were found (according to Rumsfield). And the Pentagon didn't wage a PR campaign for war by sending former military personnel<em> to act as objective commentators </em>for the MSM in covering the War on Terror (how do you defeat a tactic?)</p>
              <p>Naturally, "change" and "yes we can" sounds better than not vague statements like "I want to expand the War on Terror in Afghanistan and invade Pakistan if necessary, to combat Islamic terrorism" right? Hmm...sounds like the Bush Doctrine to me.</p>
              <p>Even if the MSM didn't fawn over Obama in the earlier stages, when it came down to the Obama-McCain standoff, the sycophantic MSM was obviously on Obama's side, not that there was any real competition going on. McCain/Palin was ridiculed for the pathetic team they were (see how andrew mixed Tina Fey with Palin above) while Obama/Biden got a free ride from the MSM. When it comes down to the corporate conglomerates that decide the direction of the US, via legalised bribery (lobbying), how can any informed person see any "change" that is coming?</p>

              <p>The  original OP question was whether or not Singaporeans were ready for a different racial group to be PM. The answer is yes, Singaporeans are.</p>

              <p>Chinese in some SEA countries get attacked every few years. Chinese in Western countries stand out and when their businesses pop up everywhere, the local westerners dont like it.</p>

              <p>for presidents wise, singapore has only 2 chinese, 2 malay, 1 indian, 1 eurasian.</p>
              <p>for prime minister, it is 3 chinese.</p>
              <p>but let's say one of the indian or malay minister steps up and take over the current PM, don't think it will be that big of a hoo haa. the biggest hoo hah should be that we have a malay pm because we want a malay pm. it should be we have a good pm who happens to be malay.</p>

              <p><br>Are you suggesting that the US electorate consisting of 100 Million plus of different ethnic, racial, religious, aethiest, and a multitude of different interest groups, are a bunch of monolithic humans with sponge brains of similar quality to absorb whatever that is dished out by the print and broadcast medias ?</p>
              <p>Given the vast number of different TV that range from the red necked Fox Channel, to the moderate CNN, to the liberal CBS - these are three out of an army of 100 plus broadcasting stations, and a mileau of radio broadcasters on the airwaves - do you seriously expect anyone to believe that all can syncronise their thoughts in unison idealogue towards Obama despite their varied roles and agenda ?</p>
              <p>The internet chat rooms and blog sites are the most uncontrolled media in cyberspace, as in this Speaker's Corner where any meeting of the minds are subjected to intense debate and passionate arguments.</p>
              <p>Can there be such a co-incident in the stars all being aligned in a straight line that the majority of the 100 Million Plus US Citizens would have given Barack Obama their votes to push the Electoral College system to cast identical votes of confidence to Obama too ?</p>
              <p>Surely you under-estimate the vitality in the various unbridled checks and balance debate mechanism that result in no single mass hysteria suddenly sweeping the entire opinion of a country ?</p>
              <p>In the history of the US Electoral System only on some very rare occassions of crisis that the cry for leadership will result in such overwhelmingly persuasive electoral results - as had occurred with the arrival of Franklin Roosevelt, John Kennedy and Ronald Reagan.</p>
              <p>All of these three late presidents were similarly inpirational orators that focussed on hope in a period of crisis - and so is this moment in the US History that Obama has managed to convince the US Electorate with his inspirational oratory of hope.</p>
              <p>Is it not amazing that Singaporeans have succumbed to the LKY propaganda to look at such oratory skills of hope with suspicion, as it will clearly undermine his own political agenda ?</p>
              <p>Was it not a 37 year old LKY giving the best in his youthful oratory skills to inspire a generation that emerged from WW-2, and pressing hope for self-goverment that moved a majority of Singaporeans to support him - AFTER he had arranged behind the scenes to remove those who threatened his electoral prospects ?</p>
