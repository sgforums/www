The justification for the War on Terror just doesnt stand.

              <p>Not only profits (Haliburton, the Caryle Group, all the defence companies [arms merchants in general]- they're not nameless), the war plans for the Afghanistan invasion and the PATRIOT Act was already conveniently waiting for a suitable justification; justification which 9/11 provided.</p>
              <p>And besides, the US government already has a track record for carrying out terrorist attacks.</p>
              <p>During the Cold War, the CIA funded the Gladio network in Western Europe which bombed public places and blamed it on the communists. In 1962, Operation Northwoods was drafted and it stated:</p>

              <p>Fortunately, JFK didnt go through with it.</p>
              <p>But the precedent is clear, governments have planned and carried out terrorist attacks to further their political aims. Are we to expect anything is different, especially in today's focus on terrorism?</p>

              <p>If you mean evidence like the Northwoods Documents to prove that the US Govt planned 9/11, then you'll never know. I'll believe that terrorist attacks are usually staged by western intelligence agencies for the benefit of some political agenda, given the historical precedent and their fingerprints all over recent terrorist attacks. It is the exception when terrorism is the act of some fanatical muslim plotting to destroy western civilisation.</p>
              <p>Who really stands to benefits when civil liberties are reduced and police powers are stepped up?</p>
              <p>Well, Operation Northwoods was targetted at Castro. Its only fitting that Castro knows the whole modus operandi of the CIA.</p>

              <p>Do you really need the headlies, I mean headlines to read "9/11 was an inside job" to believe that false-flag operations do take place?</p>
              <p>How about putting together a worldview based on information which you already know instead of relying on what people say to form your worldview?</p>
              <p>From the evidence, one can deduce the the US Govt had complicity and even staged the attacks to justify geopolitical and political aims. If you want to rely on sanitised and whitewashed information that refuses to engage in straight talk because it is politically incorrect, then how can you perceive the true nature of things?</p>

              <p>Official story: 19 hijackers, 15 of them from Saudi Arabia,
              hijacked four planes and crashed two of them into WTC 1 and 2,
              collapsing them. One into the Pentagon. One crashed in
              Pennsylvania.</p>
              <p>Problem with official story #1: Some of the alleged hijackers
              are still alive, reported the BBC</p>
              <p>Problem #2: If 2 planes crashed into the Twin Towers, then what
              caused WTC 7 to collapse in the same exact manner almost 8 hours
              later?</p>
              <p>Problem #3: Why did eye-witnesses report ground-level explosions
              that totally wrecked the lobby of the Twin Towers?</p>
              <p>Problem #4: If the jet fuel weakened the support structures of
              the Twin Towers, then according to the official pancake theory, why
              wasn't the steel core left standing? Instead, the steel cores were
              photographed after the collapse as having been cut diagonally (by
              thermite, thermite residue found by 9/11 researchers).</p>
              <p>Problem #5: If a plane hit the Pentagon, then where is all the
              debris, including the tail section, fuselage and especially the
              engine made of titanium which couldnt have been destroyed by the
              flames? And why was the hole made in the Pentagon not big enough
              for a jet liner? What hit the Pentagon?</p>
              <p>Problem #6: If the government's official story is true, then why
              did the CIA/FBI confiscated all CCTV cameras around the Pentagon
              immediately after the crash and refused to release them except for
              5 frames, which is inconclusive?</p>
              <p>Problem #7: If a plane crashed in Shanksville, Pennsylvania,
              then again, where is all the debris and human bodies? Shouldnt
              there be the wreckage? Go check out the photos. In fact, a cornerer
              said that it wasnt a crime scene because there were no human
              bodies.</p>
              <p>Problem #8: Why did Dick Cheney order NORAD to stand-down when
              it was known that hijacked planes were in the air?</p>
              <p>Problem #9: What a coincidence that more than 6 anti-terrorist
              exercises were taking place on 9/11 envisioning the same
              scenario.</p>
              <p>Problem #10: Why did the US Govt invade Afghanistan, blaming Bin
              Laden for 9/11, when 1)war plans for the invasion already existed
              before 9/11 and 2)the FBI does not list Bin Laden as responsible
              for 9/11 because of lack of evidence.</p>
              <p>So, given all these inconsistencies, the official story just
              doesnt stand. It is more likely that it was another false-flag
              operation carried out by the CIA/MI6/Mossad or a combination, to
              set into motion global change, which we have experienced.</p>
