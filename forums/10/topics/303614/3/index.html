How did you arrive at that figure?<br><br>I'm assuming this figure doesn't include land cost.<br><br>Of course, if you think Govt should give out land for free, then should charge only on construction cost.</div></blockquote>And why should they include land cost, if HDB takes the land from the govt without paying? If they include land cost into their calculations, then it is NOT land cost, but opportunity costs, since the land was never sold to HDB in the 1st place.<br><br>hehe, thanks to people like you who easily believe in them, everything is inflated.<br><br>Let me give you a list of highly 'subsidized' things in Singapore (oh man, we are so 'lucky')<br><br>1. HDB is highly 'subsidized'<br>This became a heated argument after someone whacked them in ST Forum displaying what he believed to be the base cost of a HDB flat.<br>Later on, the HDB admitted that the so-called subsidy is a MARKET subsidy. A MARKET subsidy is NOT a subsidy.<br>They merely calculated a supposed value that the flat should cost on the open market, and then put a discount on that value.<br><br>2. University fee is highly 'subsidized'<br>This is one of my favourites. Whole day, the govt were trumpeting that they were highly subsidizing our school fees. Then we realized that most times, the govt likes to calculate something called Opportunity Costs.<br><br>Opportunity Costs, if you would know, is not a cost at all, but is in fact a harping of how much they could have made on the land if they had used it for something else. But to plant such costs into the total costs of our education is, to me, never correct.<br><br>In fact, if you look all around, all costs are inflated. Our govt really uses Opportunity Costs to the maximum.<br><br>I think they learnt their trade from one industry the most. HOTEL.<br>Rack rates are always inflated and almost never actually charged on customers.</div>

So resale price would be based on this rental.  This rental is influenced by condo's rental.  In other words, when condo's price is high, rental is high, HDB's rental in that location is also high.  Market mechanism will push the HDB's resale price high according to its rental yield.<br><br>Now if HDB were to sell at near the cost price across the board as someone suggests in this forum, then HDB would not be able to purchase the old flats at market's valuation (see above) for renewal (enbloc).  In this case, the HDB estates will rot like a dead rat.<br><br>Please think before you write.<br><br>thank  you.<br><br></div></blockquote>By the way, for those cash-poor, SINGLE-asset rich Singaporeans like me, when prices increase, there is no benefit for you and I, because we don't rent out our flat since we are staying in it.<br><br>The only ones who benefit from SINGLE-asset Singaporeans is IRAS (ie our govt).
