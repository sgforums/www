            <div class='col-md body'>ST Forum 17 Jan 07<br><br>IN REPORTING on plans to promote community ties among residents of HDB estates, the article, 'Community ties: It's the basics that count' (ST, Jan <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">, quoted common misperceptions of the Residents' Committees (RCs), raised at focus- group discussions.<br>The purpose of the People's Association (PA) grassroots organisations (GROs), including the RCs, is to foster active citizenry. As part of the process, they organise community activities, but this should not be construed as their having sole responsibility or a monopoly in holding such activities.<br><br>It is to the credit of many individuals and groups that they also do their part in organising activities, jointly with the GROs or separately.<br><br>We are delighted that some residents of Block 176 in Woodlands Street 13 hold social and community activities, and not leave everything to the RC.<br><br>That RCs are party-political - which is cited by some as the reason they are reluctant to join as members - is a misperception. There is much media and public attention when RC members visit households with their advisers. In contrast, the many frequent visits by RC members on their own, and the good community service they render, do not attract such notice.<br><br><span style="color: red;">RCs are part of the PA (a government body) grassroots network, and thus an extension of the Government.</span> RC members serve in the interest of residents, regardless of political affiliation. Any RC member who takes part in party-political activities does so in his personal capacity.<br><br>Recruitment is a challenge for all voluntary organisations. RCs have fared well, with membership of about 11,000 and average growth of 2.6 per cent in the last three years. About 40 per cent of RC members are professionals, managers, executives or businessmen, while more than one third are below 45.<br><br>The PA appreciates the efforts of grassroots volunteers in strengthening community ties. We would like to invite more people to join the grassroots movement for on-going leadership renewal and to improve our activities, so as to better serve residents and build a more cohesive community.<br><br>Ooi Hui Mei (Ms)<br>Director<br>(Corporate Communications)<br>for Chief Executive Director<br>The People's Association<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ST Forum 22 Jan 07<br><br>I HAVE some questions after reading the letter explaining the role of residents' committees (RCs) by People's Association (PA) corporate communications director Ooi Hui Mei (ST, Jan17).<br>Firstly, her statement: 'RCs are part of the PA (a government body) grassroots network, and thus an extension of the Government.' What is implied here?<br><br>Are RC activities aimed at explaining or disseminating government policies? If the constituency's representative in Parliament is from an opposition party, does the RC work with him/her?<br><br>Secondly, does community interaction come under the purview of a ministry?<br><br>If I and my neighbours in Simei decide to set up an association to serve the residents' needs, must we inform the RC?<br><br>Will the Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports object to our registration as a society?<br><br>I think it is timely to question the point of having officially mandated RCs and a PA.<br><br>Perhaps, Singaporeans are unwilling to form civic society organisations because of the baggage of the past, where neighbourly interaction is made to take place under a government-run body.<br><br>Removing such constraints may lead to more willingness by young Singaporeans to organise themselves in ways that improve society, such as forming networks of neighbours.<br><br>Such groupings will be more vibrant and motivated, and be more embedded in the online and offline lives of local residents.<br><br>Harminder Singh<br><br></div>
