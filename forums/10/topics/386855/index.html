              <p><strong>Should PRs and new citizens be allowed to interfere in Singapore’s domestic politics?</strong></p>
              <p>The PAP government has never failed to emphasize on the “fact” that “Singapore’s politics are reserved for Singaporeans only” as outsiders do not have a stake in the country to deter foreigners from “interfering” in local politics.</p>
              <p>Foreign journalists often have their work permits canceled without warning like in the recent case of Daily Telegraph journalist Benjamin Bland or banned from entering Singapore altogether like the Chief Editor of Asia Sentinel John Berthelsen who was once “deported” unceremoniously by the police upon his arrival at Changi Airport.</p>
              <p>Foreigners are required to apply for a police permit even when speaking indoors and they are almost always not given when the topic touches on local politics. For example, a Swedish human rights activist’s permit to hold a workshop for SDP members was rejected with no reasons given.</p>
              <p>Being a non-partisan public institution, one would expect the Singapore police to apply the law equally to all political parties, but this is not often the case.</p>
              <p>Not too long ago, Chinese Daily Lianhe Wanbao hosted a public forum which saw a famous Taiwanese orator heaping generous praises on PAP leaders though the topic of discussion was supposed to be on China’s development in the future.</p>
              <p>Since foreigners are not allowed to “interfere” in Singapore politics, then one should expect PRs to fall within the ambit of the unwritten rule as well.</p>
              <p>However, PRs are often given ample space in the Straits Times Forum to voice their support for the PAP government, the latest being a Pakistani Sam Ahmed who wrote a letter urging Singaporeans to be “more appreciative” of their own country.</p>
              <p><strong>It is strange that letters critical of the PAP are almost always censored while those few lauding it are published to sway public opinion to its side.</strong></p>
              <p>The Straits Times should have rejected these fawning letters to curry favor with the ruling party on the ground that they are “interfering” in domestic politics which are for Singapore citizens only.</p>
              <p>With the PAP giving Singapore citizenships freely to foreigners, these new citizens will form an increasingly influential voting bloc in the future, but are they ready to partake in the political life of Singapore?</p>
              <p>As many of them came to Singapore in the prime of their lives without ever serving National Service, life here is a bed of roses for them especially if they come from developing countries like India and China.</p>
              <p>A new citizen from India and YPAP member Mr Fredric Fanthome wrote an article for Contact Singapore in which he expressed his admiration for Singapore’s “efficiency” – “everything works here!,” he wrote.</p>
              <p>Mr Fanthome holds a senior position in a local SME. Armed with a decent-paying job and saved from the hassle of National Service obligations, it is little wonder that Mr Fanthome is so infatuated with the PAP.</p>
              <p>However for a Singapore man growing up in Singapore in the 1970s and 1980s, it is a different story altogether.</p>
              <p>During his younger days, he witnessed his parents being able to afford a HDB flat relatively easily, but when it comes to his time, he has problems servicing the hefty mortgage loan as a result of sky-rocketing prices in the last few months.</p>
              <p>He has to compete with an increasing number of foreigners like Mr Fanthome who are lured to Singapore by jobs which offer higher pay than their homelands.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, he has the mandatory 4 week reservist obligation to fulfill annually when the newcomers have none. It is only natural that the Singaporean will feel bitter and angry towards the PAP government.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, <strong>such genuine grouses on the ground are incomprehensible to the new citizens who are courted by the PAP actively from the very beginning to rope them into grassroots organizations and the party itself to shore up its support base.</strong></p>
              <p>Mr Fanthome can therefore be forgiven for dismissing online critics of the PAP as “anonymous hordes which spray venom at the government” for not being born and bred in Singapore as his perception of the PAP is somewhat colored and skewed by the propaganda churned out by the state media daily.</p>
              <p>As the new citizens have a limited understanding of Singapore politics, can we really trust them to make an informed decision during the elections?</p>
              <p>It is only natural to expect new citizens to vote for the ruling party which gives them the opportunity to start life afresh in Singapore in the first place.</p>
              <p>Since their support for the PAP is based largely on gratitude, they may be ignorant of the more important issues at stake such as the direction the nation is heading in the future.</p>
              <p>Many of them also <strong>appear not to be aware of the lack of accountability and transparency in Singapore’s political system which allows one dominant party to ride roughshod over all other political parties, state institutions and the people.</strong></p>
              <p>It may take some time before new citizens come to the same conclusion as the locals – that they are not getting a fair deal from the ruling party and by then it will be too late.</p>
              <p>Foreigners now make up 36 per cent of the population, up from 14 per cent in 1990. The percentage of new citizens is unknown, but is likely to be on an upward trend.</p>
              <p>In a small country like Singapore, a sizable number of new citizens in the electorate will have a significant impact on the outcome of the election.</p>
              <p>There are two ways to counter the unfair advantage enjoyed by the incumbent as a result of the rising number of new citizens:</p>
              <p>1. New citizens are not permitted to vote within the first five years of their residency in Singapore to give them ample time to familiarize themselves with the political situation in the country so as to help them to make a calm and rational decision.</p>
              <p>2. Old citizens are given one additional vote to give them more say in the running of their nation, especially those who have spent the two most precious years of their lives serving the nation.</p>
              <p>Of course it is impossible to expect the PAP to do anything which will hurt their interest when the massive immigration we are seeing now is part of its grand design to perpetuate its political hegemony forever whether we like it or not.</p>
              <p>The only way out for locals is to stand up and be counted at the next general election and vote for sufficient opposition MPs into parliament to deny the PAP’s its traditional two-thirds majority.</p>
              <p>Only then can we put a brake to its runaway liberal immigration policy to replace locals with their new pets from China, India and elsewhere.</p>
              <p>Singapore politics should be reserved strictly for citizens born and bred in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Even among citizens, a clearer distinction must be drawn between old and new citizens to acknowledge the sacrifices the former have made to the nation.</p>

              <p>I oppose Singapore turning into land of aliens and the degrading of citizenship. PAP is buying votes by easily granting citizenship to aliens. They know their days are numbered so they are building up a new group of loyal voters. I oppose this policy.</p>
