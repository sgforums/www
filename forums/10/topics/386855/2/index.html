              <p>Not necessary! New citizens who took up Sg citizenship doesn't necessarily mean their former country won't take them back if they decide to return!</p>
              <p>Our rule on a single country citizenship may not be followed by other nations. Some countries recognise dual citizenship. Some countries recognise citizenship by race, birth even as a person has emigrated then return.</p>
              <p>It is wrong to assume that new citizens are more vocal or proactive and therefore harder for the PAP to control. The PAP has learnt lessons from Singapore's turbulent 50s, 60s to bag tactics like divide-and-rule, revolving-door, scare-tactic etc.</p>
              <p>As with the Myanmarese riot/protest at Singapore's Myanmar Embassy. The thousands of Maynmar protesters have breached our laws. Solution? Hunt down the 3 ring leaders and sent them packing - divide-and-rule. PAP knows how to deal with them. </p>
              <p>In the words of LKY, these new citizens are carefully selected. I know because I had an adjunct India born Professor, told us he rose from India's padi field to controlling billion dollar company in Singapore. Everytime, his lecture started with PAP's anthem. Fanatical pro-PAP but ignorant to a point of distainful of things local.</p>
              <p>Given their upper class status, their distance from the man-in-the-street. Given time, they can form the scions of our society - raj, tai-tai or uppity class snobs. What set me thinking hard and worrying is that if these folks jump into politic, it spells deep trouble for the locals. Their ignorant, distainment and snobbery of things local.  </p>

              <p>The big deal is the 13 yrs cycle of reservist duty. Technically, it is 13 yrs cycle. Actually, the liability is up to 50 yr old for officer, 40 yr old for non comm officer. As many reservists discover, SAF can play many technicalities on you.</p>

              It is strange that letters critical of the PAP are almost always censored while those few lauding it are published to sway public opinion to its side.

              Strange? It's so clear and obvious that Singapore is a dictatorship with lky familee dynasty ruling and controlling everything including the media. The police has been reduced to political tool as much as the court and the media is churning out propaganda
                                <br><br>
              Singapore is the SEA's cuba, a cankerous blight to the whole region. Only that Fidel Castro still has the idealism and back to defy US while Singapore leaders boot lick anybody they think they ought and stamping on everybody else that couldn't fight back. Basically a timid country.

                                That's a smart thought thumb up for you. For me I'd think 5 years from date of issue is the ideal span
