              <p>Dear Mr Speaker Sir,</p>
              <p>I am glad to return to this forum after a lapse of about 2 years. Over the last 2 years I had been tolling day and night over 2 jobs in large MNCs with a large percentage of Ang MOs. IN 1 of the 2, I was summarily forced to resign after my National Service without a good reason despite achieving superb results - above 130% of targets and assessment from my American boss. After he left the company, my division was transferred to the hands of an Aussie (apparently my boss for just a day) who appointed an ANG MO person who was supposed to help me oversee during my NS. "help" becomes an interesting and convenient word. My Aussie boss happens to be just 1 day being my official boss....</p>
              <p> In short, if my bad experience is of any trends, many MNCs are placing Ang Mos instead of the usual locals in the past in the name that locals are not as capable. We all know capability is a subjective matter, not to mention our laws does not protect executive and management personnels.</p>
              <p>Many recruiters were surprised why I had not pursue a legal action on the organization who wrongfully removed me. Who wants a prolonged court hearing where its your words against their words when due compensation was already paid with all letters of indemnity being signed (I have to admit I signed them under duress as I was sick and obviously shocked). Besides why the inconvenience to attend court, fight a legal case, spending good money on lawyers without confidence of winning when we saw so many failed cases, tarnished reputations and sadly wondering if I get suppport or sympathy from the judge when obviously our government who is so dependent on foreign investors.... Don't mean or imply defarmation, just fair comment- just my feelings.... </p>
              <p>In my current work place, the number of Ang MOs are increasing and key management positions are given to Ang Mos and foreigners (Indian Nationals..maybe they are cheaper?). Many of the decisions are based on who knows who- which is understandable except that this is now within the Ang Mo community. The interesting thing is that these people do not walk the talk but just keep talking without actually really doing anything substantial. Guess who takes the pains when issues came up. Bingo! the locals- Singaporeans! I felt sad seeing so many capable people being bullied and let down by their Ang Mo bosses who does not work hard nor smart but flying first and business class, taking credit and passing blame to others, treating the locals with talent like overly paid secretaries- arranging conference calls, meetings....reminding me of the pilot syndrome....</p>
              <p>I longed for the days when the government was more restrictive on foreigners joining our ranks. Many of us have good management experience but now if our government's policy of getting so many foreigners into our country, I wonder why do we SIngaporean have to die for this island and how are we going to get to the level hierachy without the due experience.</p>
              <p>It is ironic that I have just been given the National Service Medal and placed in Military reserve. As much as I am proud of what I have done for my country, I wonder if I am proud of what my government has done to us.</p>
              <p>From Coffee shops to senior management positions, foreigners are taking Singaporean's positions. Sometimes by force (where I experienced first hand- without knowing why even till today- because I suppose there isn't any) and some by opportunity cost as well as who knows who.... what a pathetic state of affairs</p>
              <p>Increasingly I feel like a second class citizen. As much as I appreciate the finances (in comparison to local companies), I wonder when the next bad experience will come. As much as I worked over time, over weekends, cleaning the shit of my ang mo bosses- with so many of them - I have 4 bosses- direct and dotted included.... I wonder why they are paid so much more than I am, with all the full facilities and expat packages, when I am actually the guy doing the job, taking the accountability and having to keep answering "what value I bring to the organization" when I wonder what my bosses bring other than talking or teaching me " how to suck eggs" kind of advice.</p>
              <p>Can any politician or anyone out there bother to give me some encouragement....Don't try to psycho me.... as I am just pissed. As I lick my wounds, I recalled watching MONEY NO ENOUGH ...where the bak Kua company was messed up by the chao ang mo... I wonder when our government will realize the folly as much as the loss of national integrity and dignity as we kneel down and kowtow just to attract more investors to our shores.... where have the back bone and strength of our Lee Kuan Yew spirit gone to??? Our government is sick!</p>
              <p>Increasingly I wonder if it is still worth to let me and my family - including my son to serve NS when he is due......I wonder who am I...... what is the meaning of Singaporean? Why we need our government at all when we are left to fend for ourselves...</p>
              <p>So as much as I have a job...I wonder where is my soul and where is my identity and pride...</p>

              <p>I love being a Singaporean as I enjoy the following benefits.</p>
              <p>1) Get free GST credits/dividend packages and $$ packages worth a few hundred a year without the need to pay higher GST taxes etc.</p>
              <p>2) A passport that allows free travel everywhere</p>
              <p>3) Freedom of speech</p>
              <p>And I don't have the following downside of being a Singaporean</p>
              <p>1) No need to do reservist, which will cause you your job.</p>
              <p>2) Don't contribute to CPF, where the money is locked away from you forever.</p>
              <p>3) Pay exhorbitant prices for homes that last for 99 years</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The solution is simple. Be a Singaporean, but don't live in Singapore. You will fully appreciate the benefits of being a Singaporean.</p>

              <p>They can get baby bonuses for having kids.</p>
              <p>So next time, their kids can continue to contribute to CPF and if they are male, serve NS. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Not directed to anyone de hor... Just my viewpoint:</p>
              <p>You can always do something about it. Just whether you succeed a not.</p>
              <p>But before every success, one must always have tried. There might be lots of failures along the way, but must still try. Just like Thomas Edison... He didn't invent the light bulb trying only 1 material, or 2, or 10, or even 100 (he even tried using a strand of hair).</p>
              <p>But by accepting that you can do nothing, and just talk and accept the situation, you are definitely not doing anything. The pre-requisite for success is thus not even fulfilled.</p>
