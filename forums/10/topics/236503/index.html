            <div class='col-md body'>ST Forum 7 Feb 2007<br><br>In the article excerpting a speech by Mr Ngiam Tong Dow, 'Maximising the lie of the land' (ST Review, Feb5), there is the claim that Singapore's rules governing en bloc sales of private property are innovative and that the 'happy outcome is that both the individual and public interest are served'.<br>Singapore's en bloc rules have led to people being forced from their homes and neighbourhoods, and to rampant speculation in the property market.<br><br>Rather than maintain their buildings, owners are incentivised to suspend maintenance in order to maximise profit at the expense of those who truly want a home instead of just an investment.<br><br>Why use the sinking fund to repair the building when you can just wait until things deteriorate and you can persuade your neighbour to give up and sell out?<br><br>Mr Ngiam says he is 'glad to see that the invisible hand of pricing has often worked its wonders'.<br><br>In fact, it is the distorting hand of government that has permitted the abrogation of property rights and the distortion of pricing.<br><br>If the market was truly efficient, the price of flats would fully reflect the value of the building and the land they stand on.<br><br>With construction costs running at about $200 per square foot, how does one explain the sudden jump in value of a property from $1,000psf to $2,400psf simply by destroying the existing building?<br><br>It is because the prospect of an en bloc sale encourages short-term thinking and treats buildings as tradable assets, instead of homes.<br><br>If one takes the example of Ardmore Park, it is hard to understand any reason for the destruction of pretty much every building on the street and the surrounding neighbourhood. These were sound, desirable residences. What exists now looks like a war zone.<br><br>In most other economies, these buildings would increase in value, given their location and quality. If an owner wanted to profit from the increase in valuation, he would sell to a new buyer, not vote for the destruction of the property.<br><br>When a building does go en bloc, it is not a triumph of the majority over the individual, as Mr Ngiam asserts, but rather the triumph of the developer, the estate agent, and a few speculators.<br><br>The environmental cost of destroying perfectly sound buildings because of this price distortion is inexcusable.<br><br>The real cost is borne by those forced to live through the destruction of the existing building and eventual construction of a replacement.<br><br>The reality on the ground is quite different than the idyllic picture painted by Mr Ngiam.<br><br>Rather than an efficient market in which willing buyer and willing seller set prices, the en bloc rules have had the unintended consequence of distorting the market, disincentivising building maintenance and upkeep, raising housing costs and destroying the quality of life for tens of thousands of residents of Singapore.<br><br>Waleed Hanafi<br><br></div>

So if the property is 20 years old, such a SP that is deemed an 'owner' if he/she has lived there for 12 yrs, to distinguish them from the 'investors' who may or may not have lived there for a substantial period of time. My argument would be that these 'owners' should be given more voting rights in the en-bloc process, since they are the ones that have a larger stake in the condominium than anyone else.<br><br>In other words, if a condo has 50% SPs who have lived there for (in the above example) more than 12 years, these SPs should have a greater say in the sale than SPs who have lived there for less. Such a percentage can be determined by the government in the same arbitrary way they have determined the 10 year boundary for en-bloc sales.<br><br><blockquote>Secondly,when more than 80% of the sub-divided building units wanted to sale their apartments,the small % of the units owners have to follow,this is a democratic way to decide the matter i.e the minority has to oblige the majority in order to progress!!!</blockquote>If we're now talking about the 'democratic way' then I draw the analogy with the General Elections where only Citizens (and not foreigners or perm residents) are allowed to vote. This is because only citizens have been deemed by most governments to have a personal, social and financial stake in the country. If that is the case, should not 'owners' who have a personal, social as well as financial stakes be the only ones allowed to vote for enblocs, as opposed to 'investors' who have purely financial stakes in a property?<br><br><blockquote><br>Thirdly,we cant hve everyone to agree cauz this is a strata titled deed property and not individual owned property,thus the rights n interests belong to all units owners,which mean majority counted in all matter related to the titles.</blockquote>That is an inaccurate reading of the Land Titles (Strata) Act. Only when the Strata Titles Board ratifies the sale, then and only then, are all SPs required by law to collectively sell their lots and common property in accordance with the CSA. Prior to that, everyone is, as far as the law is concerned, individual SPs. The CSA as a binding contract, may require those who sign it, to surrender some of their ownership rights, but anyone who has not signed it, is considered by law an individual SP and may act accordingly.<br><br>The 'agreement' only occurs when the STB agrees to the sale, and not before then.<br><br><blockquote>I hve been living in the present condom which housed 285 units for more than 20 yrs and now a chairman of the MCST,can tell u that most of the units owners want to en-block sale due to old age of the estate and too good the property market now!!!</blockquote>This is what I do not understand - are all developments built by construction companies with a lifespan of 10-20 years only? If the place is run down, is it not the responsibility of the management council to ensure that the place is well maintained and even upgraded if the sinking fund allows? In many countries in the West, buildings last for more than 40 years, easily. The onus is on individual owners to renovate their interiors, but the exterior is exceedingly well maintained and the property is well built. So the question is - if a place is run down, whose fault is it - the management council for failing to perform their duty of upkeeping, or the developers for building properties which generall begin to deteriorate in less than 20 years?<br><br>Even more legally conflicting is this - you say you are the chairman of the MCST, that is you have a legal obligation to your property to upkeep, maintain and even upgrade should the funds allow. Yet if you join the sales committee of the enbloc sale, as many MC members do, your obligation to SPs is to ensure a fast and efficient sale of the property. Do you not see this as a conflict of interest, should ANY members of the MC become members of the SC? Out of 5 enblocs in my neighbourhood, *everyone* of them have sale committees that comprise of management council members. Consequence - maintenance drops, place is 'encouraged' to run down, to 'encourage' owners to agree to the en-bloc. Sometimes this happens even before the 10 year mark happens, as in 2 cases, when the MC held back anything but urgent repairs when the property was only 8 years old, in anticipation of enbloc sale. Their sinking fund is HUGE now, but it all goes to the developers.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Landmark ruling on figuring loss in en bloc sales</strong></span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">(SINGAPORE) The prospect of CPF losses cannot be used to stop an en-bloc sale, the Strata Titles Board (STB) ruled yesterday. In a landmark decision, it said the principal amount withdrawn from CPF accounts and the accrued interest cannot be taken into account when determining whether a financial loss has been suffered by owners involved in such a sale.<br><br>The board made the point in a decision approving the $385 million collective sale of Waterfront View in Bedok to a joint venture between Far East Organization and Frasers Centrepoint.<br><br>Waterfront View is a privatised HUDC estate. The STB tribunal, with the boardÂ’s deputy president Alfonso Ang presiding, did not agree with the view of Yeo Loo Keng and his wife Cheryl Lim Pui Yew - who are objecting to the collective sale of Waterfront View - that their Â‘net proceeds of the sale are insufficient to redeem our mortgage and CPF chargeÂ’ and that this amounted to a financial loss. The Yeos had an outstanding mortgage of $341,118.90 as of Oct 11 last year, which they could repay from their $660,377 share of proceeds from the en-bloc sale, even after making allowed deductions.<br><br>The CPF Board wrote to the couple in November last year, confirming that Â‘if the sale proceeds after deducting the outstanding housing loan owing to the mortgagee DBS Bank Ltd is insufficient to fully refund the principal amount withdrawn and accrued interest to both your CPF accounts, the CPF Board does not require both of you to make good the shortfall to your CPF account in cash.<br><br>Â‘Instead only the net sale proceeds (i.e. the selling price less outstanding home loan) is required to be refunded to your CPF accountÂ’, the CPF Board said in its letter.<br><br>The STB tribunal said in its ruling that the section of the Land Titles (Strata) Act that should apply is Section 84 (A) (7) b, which allows the board to throw out a collective sale application if it is satisfied that the proceeds to be received by any objecting party are insufficient to redeem any mortgage or charge on the property.<br><br>In view of the CPF BoardÂ’s statement that it will allow the redemption, the Yeos could, with the proceeds of sale, redeem both the bank mortgage and discharge the CPF charge on their property. DBS Bank has the first charge on the property and CPF Board has second charge.<br><br>The tribunal said it is therefore satisfied that the YeosÂ’ objection does not come within the ambit of this clause in the Act.<br><br>The Act also defines a financial loss - which could be grounds for STB to throw out a collective sale application - as having been incurred by an owner if the sale proceeds he receives, less any deductions allowed by STB, are less than the price he paid for his property.<br><br>The STB tribunal further ruled that the privatisation fee for converting Waterfront View from a former HUDC estate to a private estate - $19,535 per unit - be allowed as a deductible expense in determining whether a financial loss has been suffered by owners in a collective sale. This is because the process of converting the title is a necessary expense, without which Waterfront View will not be eligible for en-bloc sale.<br><br>Additionally, the tribunal upheld earlier decisions by STB on the following deductibles - that <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">interest</span> </strong>and renovation costs <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>not be allowed </strong></span>but that the cost of legal fees and stamp duty at the time of purchase of the property be allowed.<br><br>It also ruled that a penalty the Yeos paid to DBS Bank for early loan repayment should not be an allowable deduction because it is a Â‘private contractual matterÂ’ between the bank and the Yeos.<br><br>Under the grounds of decision read by Mr Ang, the Yeos Â‘do not suffer a financial loss based on the net proceeds of sale less the allowable deductions - legal costs and stamp duty at the time of purchase and the costs of privatisationÂ’.<br><br>The couple bought their apartment at Waterfront View in 1994 for $515,000 and will receive a gross sum of $660,377.35 in the collective sale. Â‘They had not suffered any financial loss even if deductions allowable are taken into account,Â’ the tribunal said.<br><br>It turned down an application by the majority ownersÂ’ counsel, Michael Kuah of Lee &amp; Lee, to require the Yeos to fully bear the costs of calling expert witnesses and law firm Lee &amp; LeeÂ’s fees for the STB hearing. Among other things, the tribunal said the objections raised by the Yeos were Â‘not frivolousÂ’ and they were acting within their rights in objecting to the collective sale.<br><br>BT understands the costs of the entire application to STB - including about $60,000 legal fees charged by Lee &amp; Lee for the proceedings, plus a further $20,000 for expert witnesses, and the costs of placing notices in the newspapers - could work out to about $300,000 to $400,000. The amount has already been set aside through sums of about $1,000 per unit, collected separately from the majority owners. Leong Yung Chang of Veritas Law Corporation, representing the Yeos, said his clients are considering whether to appeal against the STB ruling.<br><strong></strong></span><br>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Now that I read about the case, I am now indeed somewhat shocked.<br>The interest that was paid on the mortgage must have been substantial enough to warrant the Yeos to claim that they have suffered a loss.<br>But it seems that the tribunal doesnt allow interest as a deductible.<br>What is the rationale behind this?<br><br>Furthermore, I am somewhat disturbed that the definition of "financial loss" which doesnt include the interest. Isn't interest a legitimate financial cost when a mortgage is taken up?<br><br>Can anyone comment?</div>

Legal fees, stamp duty, privatisation costs are necessary expenses paid by everyone involved in any flat purchase/development. Interest however is a personal expense along with renovation costs.<br><br>In political terms, the STB has to balance between encouraging and facilitating en-bloc sales on the one hand, and being equitable on the other. If financial loss includes CPF losses, a substantial number of en-bloc sales might be blocked due to the financial loss clause. People keen to sell their places, and do not suffer such losses, will be obviously put out by such a decision if they have a single person in their property that will suffer from CPF losses.<br><br>Of course they have forgotten that the financial loss clause was put into the Land Titles (Strata) Act to protect individuals who might be forced to sell and not receive any profits after deductions. This clause is built specifically for the individual and not for the collective interested in selling the development. By excluding CPF losses, the collective is given greater consideration.<br><br>The damning nail in the coffin for the couple is the CPF letter which states they do not have to make good their CPF shortfall, which means in effect they can spend the rest of their lifetime paying the outstanding amt. This gives STB the leverage to point out that this is the couple's own problem, and should not be used against the collective interested in selling.<br><br>I hope the couple brings this up for appeal at the next level - the Supreme Court. I think it's a lopsided definition of financial loss that is rapidly favouring en-bloc sales rather than protect the individuals who will suffer from it.</div>
