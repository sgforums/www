            <div class='col-md body'>Surfing through Yawning Bread, I came across a few items that peaked my interest. Originally, i had the same feeling while running through the papers but Alex Au has beautifully articulated them into words for me.<br><br><strong><span style="color: red;">1. Extra lighting for Rally:</span></strong><br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="color: darkblue;"><a href="http://www.yawningbread.org/photo_essay/pew-05/pew-0504.htm" rel="nofollow">Closeup of additional lighting</a><br><br><a href="http://www.yawningbread.org/photo_essay/pew-05/pew-0506.htm" rel="nofollow">Taken from a block of flats</a><br><br><a href="http://www.yawningbread.org/photo_essay/pew-05/pew-0507.htm" rel="nofollow">In comparison to the WP rally the night before</a></span></span></strong><br><br>Perhaps the Ruling Party would care to answer where the additional lighting came from? Party funds or state funds?<br><br>It is interesting to note that the WP rally in hougang by Low Thia Khiang attracted an estimated 120,000 people compared to the few hundred at Eric Low's identical campaign. See the picture below:<br><br><img src="http://www.yawningbread.org/arch_2006/pic-581b.jpg"><br><br><strong><span style="color: red;">2. Staged crowd?</span> </strong><br><br>This picture is a shot of PAP supporters in the Sembawang GRC. Does this look suspiciously like a posed shot our media 'skewed' into the main headlines to create a deceptive appearance?<br><br><img src="http://www.yawningbread.org/photo_essay/pew-05/pei-0511.jpg"><br><br><strong><span style="color: red;">3. Why did the police move in and confiscate WP flagpoles from supporters? </span></strong><br><br>Was the action at the Hougang Rally a bit high-handed and unnecessary? The supporters were just chanting support for the WP after the rally and were peaceful. Flag waving is hardly considered 'rioting' and this coming after a convincing rally should surely be within bounds.<br><br><a href="http://www.yawningbread.org/arch_2006/yax-581.htm" rel="nofollow">Police removal of WP flags from supporters (see lower section of the article)</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>quoted from sammyboy website in their coffeeshop forum (nt porn)<br><br>"<br>Well, in a rather obscure place much away from the peering public, had this breakfast with this very well regarded senior journalist/ editor from SPH. Here are the journalist's personal (because this person is a known rebel amongst the SPH folks) views/opinion and assessment (not in any particular order). Given that this journalist has had top level access to a lot of people this is perhaps not only interesting but has a ring of credibility.<br><br>PAP worried that this time they were not returned on nomination day.<br><br>Many are really concerned with the kind of damage that LKY is doing with his interviews (CNA, Foreign media etc.). A very seasoned media personality had to tell LHL about this on friday, that LKY needs to be more subdued. Will the PM tell his Mentor father?<br><br>The entire ISD is busy trying to dig up something on Sylvia. WKS is personally supervising it. They want to destroy her before she becomes big. There is a big chance that they could have stumbled something about her. The PAP will use it during the closing stages.<br><br>Actually GCT didnt want to be part of electioneering and wanted to play a laid back role. He got pitchforked into this to his own surprise. It sounds like a conspiracy to have him discredited. What is not clear is whether GCT screwing up by making confusing statements is intentional or accidental. GCT is not even invited or even consulted for some of the strategy meetings. He gets his information from secondary sources. By end of this year, GCT would be out of the cabinet and sent to Batam to retire or would be called as Travelling Minister, because he would be constantly made to travel.<br><br>The PAP big guns are going to land up in Aljunied from Tuesday, and it will see a flurry of activity, threats (both covert and overt). LKY himself may be seen there, though a section of the PAP dont want him, because he is pissing off people.<br><br>PP may be a close shave, but looks like the odds favour CST, because of the stupid, contradictory and disparaging statements made by GCT.<br><br>Additional precautions are being taken to prevent outbreak of rioting, violence, shouting on the streets or stadiums on thursday and friday. Riot police have been asked to be on standby. They do expect (or even want) some violence or rioting so that they can make a few arrests, and put the fear into the hearts of the people. so, make sure that the AP urge people not to become violent at their rallies repeatedly.<br><br>I think if CST and LTK were to stand on the same stage and speak the same language, especially at PP, Aljunied and CCK, the PAP would be pissing in the pants.<br><br>PAP actually happy that WP havent aggressively touched the core issues yet -- Jobs, CPF cuts, HDB window rivet, NKF, cost of living etc. Their strategy is to keep the WP busy with the Gomes issue, so that other important issues get less airtime. APs, should just move on and raise the bigger issues.<br>"<br><br>by Serenditpity</div>
