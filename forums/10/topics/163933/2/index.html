            <div class='col-md body'>i agree with death sentence provided it is because of murder...as for drug trafficking and so on..maybe impose a longer duration of imprisonment like life sentence.<br><br>but after seeing so many ppl got hanged fr trafficking drugs and yet ppl still wanna bring in these harmful substances to wrack families and lives. i think death sentence for all drug traffickers r justifiable.<br><br>i especially hate those in the name of human rights and showing mercy always trying to reduce punishments and do away with things like death sentence.<br>The judicial system here is good and i want it to maintain that way. Cpuselling and warning shld be given for those with 'lighter offence' but when the crime turns serious...something must be done. To effect justice and to warn the public.<br><br>You break the law, you pay for it. No mercy should be given.</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>but the methods for death sentence shld be direct and straight forward. I personally find tt lethal injection although is more humane seems unatural.<br>Imagine inserting tubes into the arms of the convict and he knws those tubes r killing him. this method does not bring about the severity of death sentence. i feel tt direct killing is appropriate because tt is wat the death sentenced offender deserves. no point making it look nice but end result is the same.<br><br>when it comes to punishment, do it with a clear conscience.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Referring to the letter by Alvin Chong, "What is the law doing about tricksters?" (ST, Nov 19), the law in Singapore seems like it cannot handle a simple fraud case. It likes to go for steady bom pi pi, bombastic cases. Wah, power ah, another drug trafficker is going to be hanged. Wah, showing off how powerful is the law in Singapore, showing off how strict the law is ah. F/U/C/K lah C/B, what is the use when it couldn't help the common people, bloody hell!!! And so let us continue and see more people continue to be conned by those tricksters, while the law goes for bombastic cases and let the people to fend for themselves.</div>

They do it anyway. The sad fact is, that many innocent people die in the countries with death sentence because the system isn't perfect.

They do it anyway. The sad fact is, that many innocent people die in the countries with death sentence because the system isn't perfect. It still happens that innocent are punished and offenders walk free around and smile.</div></blockquote>Yes, Criminals of violent crimes are usually not rational calculators<br><br>We also have studies that suggest that most criminals either did not think they would get caught (rightly so, since the vast majority of crimes remain undetected), or deliberately blocked out all thoughts of the consequences of their actions.<br><br>Yet, i remain unconvinced that individual deterrence completely doesn't work. The thing about all these research is that they do not know about those who *have* been deterred. These criminals are criminals because they have committed the crime and have been caught.<br><br>Re Innocent deaths, I agree. That imo is the strongest argument agaisnt the death penalty. We must recognize that the Criminal Justice System does not always get things right, and there is no going back from murdering someone. Morally speaking, i would rather we just keep them in jail for the rest of their lives.<br></div>
