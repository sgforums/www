This means, its the talents inside and not the company name.<br><br>Another example is a basketball champion called dream team players can all join a new basketball team called donkey and still be the best team in the world. Brand and name is nothing. Its the talents. the humans. you can retain the brand name called 'dream team' but without the players who are now in a brand called 'Donkey' , it will be just an arse team.<br><br>Capable talents can join any new or donkey team and emerge the best team.   Its which talents want to form a new team.<br><br>Brand is known to have value. But if all the talents leave, what happens to the brand? The brand can continue to attract new talents but the performing team has gone to join another newly created team.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>What do we know about family business? When the founder started the business, family members and relatives are roped in to help. The business prospers. Then it grew until envy set in. Then accusation of unfairness, inequalities, etc. amongst family members set in. The next  generation take over, greed and self-interest prevail, and quarrels and differences surfaced. The business breaks up, sold or declined. This is textbook case-study. If there was a strong patriarch and nepotism exists, the business will never to be broken up - because that is the very nature of patriarchy and nepotism!</div>

If you wait till your MP cheat your money, it might be very late because everybody else will cheat you first! Now you tell me how opposition MPs can check corruption?

I think complicated? Not sure whether I could think that way. Actually hor, SGreans are practical fools except the MPs. Why didn't they swamped the MP office or parliament and declare we can run the country. Also, anyone can petition parliament and put forward questions to the MPs or ministers. You don't need to be in opposition to do that. Now you owe me trillion dollars for this piece of advice to leak dark secrets recipe to you.</div>

I think even a fool would not have choose these option. Again, it is so simple bcos there r available opposition parties, just cast ur vote to them, confirmed u see no blood &amp; protest. But whether they can rule wisely, it is reali up to them to prove. If prove wrong, u still have another 5 yrs to cast ur vote again, right? At least it give u time to see who rule better. As for petition, remember the casino, I remember a petition on internet opposing the casino but no use. Actually, I think even u send in 100 or more petition oso no use. That y S'porean oredi give up on them. HaHa <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> But u can try to see whether it work or not lah urself. Indeed, I dun need to be in the opposition but dun forget the gahman play by the rule of voting. If less vote, mean less power for them. Same rule (greed r everywhere) again, u need to pay me infinite dollars for chatting with u.</div>
