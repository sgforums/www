This need not necessary be the rule because the child also develop her own personality and abilities. Otherwise how do we explain musical talents from unmusical parents. Tyrants have offsprings that are docile. Stalin's daughter, Svetlana was just an ordinary woman, married to an Indian.<br>So to use the child to judge the parent, is stretching things too far. What if the child is retarded? What would that say about the parents, to you?<br>Your daughter/father analogy is therefore flawed.<br></div></blockquote>To an extent, I feel that there is a difference between genes and character and they aren't really comparable.<br><br>As for this case, I think my point was not related to inheriting of genes but how the father appeared to be shy in apologising or getting his daughter to do so, which can be inheriting of behaviour. I did not mean just because the daughter had character flaws then it was inherited from the father. What I meant was, if the father set a bad example, then it might have an influence on her and he should be mindful of this.<br><br>As I wrote in my blog, even the PM had the gutso to apologise for the "fix opposition" remarks during the last GE. While WP took issue with this, I personally feel it is not as offside as someone calling those of a lower class names.<br><br>Regards</div>
