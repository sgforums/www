And I doubt anyone can, giving absolutely convincing reasons.<br><br>I always think that singapore has many highly educated people, except me, sec 4  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> ,  who are eligible political critics. They can play a role in ensuring future singapore leaders are kept on their toes by bombarding them with logical questions that the layman also have in their mind but does not have enough info on the subject to ask questions properly.<br><br>Its not juts up to ruling parties to be clean and honest. The People technically have the deciding power to condem a gov if they are not honest or if they are corrupt.<br><br>If this power is taken away from the People of a democracy, and left to the ruling party, then, it is a nightmare in the making.<br><br>Of course, currently, I have to have to have to have to say singapore is very clean and green lah. So not yet worry lah.  Like this say is safe.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>As can be seen from my IF scenarios, the People must understand, not to rely on political parties of the future to regulate themselves. The People themselves must have the ultimate power to make right what is done wrong, if there is a need. This  is the only way I think we can prevent bad people from holding on to power, like Iraq , Marcos, Kim etc.  Lucky, singapore not yet like this. (talk like dis is safer  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> ) But we should understand this concept 1st.<br><br>Andrew way to go!<br><br></div>
