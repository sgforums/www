But whether they can rule wisely, it is reali up to them to prove. If prove wrong, u still have another 5 yrs to cast ur vote again, right? At least it give u time to see who rule better.

If you want to be in politics, you have to be in a political party, so that people know where you stand and what your objectives are. Whether a petition is effective or not depends on how strong the support is. At end of day, it is POWER!</div>

Plus competition led to brain storm. Most of our MP have slacken down alot. It oso test Singaporean adaptability and Flexibility to different rule. If it led to chao, I think Singapore is a total failure. But if we can adjust well, it mean we can take on bigger challenge. Opposition can check on govt &amp; govt can check on opposition. A balance between Yin &amp; Yang. 2 opp VS 80++MP is too big difference. Do we have to wait until all our hard earned money being cheated by greedy MP before we make noise? How sure r we that our MP r not corrupted? bcose there r no one to check on them. </div></blockquote>Maybe you could ask Slyvia or Low TK or Chiam ST if they honestly think that they could take over the govt anytime.<br><br>Anyway, our present political system is such that even before we cast our votes the incumbent party already wins the elections as there are not enough opposition candidates to contest the elections.<br><br>But we don't need to topple the govt to see any improvement in the present situation. We only need to vote in more opposition candidates into the parliament. And here, i agree that we shouldn't be conned by the PAP that voting in the opposition would bring chaos to the country. PAP will still be the ruling party but with more opposition MP in the parliament there will be more people to check on the govt.<br><br>PAP has been in almost total control for far too long we certainly need more opposition to rein in its runaway power.
