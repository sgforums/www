Guess what they said? Some actually choose to be homeless</span>. It is a way of life style for them!!! Can u believe that? I ask why? well, they still receive a min. amount of help from gov, such as food at certain centre or food coupon, and if they have a pet with them, they get a bit more $$, etc.. Some are elder that dun live well with family, but yet dun 1 to end in old folk home, some are alcoholic /drug   addictive who refuse to quit or go to rehabilitation, other able elder simple refuse to work. Oh one more thing, if u pity them, dun give them cash, instead buy them some hot drink&amp;food and offer to them. Reason why? Coz if u give them $$, they'll just go buy cigarette and alcohol.<br><br>For social benefit to be approve, there is a few catch, such as the applicant is work able, they must try looking for job. If u cant find, the job centre will help, meaning u must go a certain amount of interview per month to justify u being jobless and not just sponging on the gov, etc It is hard to help those that dun even want to help themselves. Sometime ppl juz give up.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> </div></blockquote>Well..... then it seems that <strong><span style="color: red;">Gazelle</span></strong> have a point when he said that there are some in S'pore who chose to be homeless..... strange as it seems.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>

A stronger UK helps Singapore simply we are english educated people and there is no sign of relaxing on Singaporeans studying English.<br><br>at the moment, i feel that the country's population is being diluted by immigrants at alarming speed. for instance, based on a graph i saw and my memory, more than 60% of population growth in uk is currently due to immigrants. surely, many of these immigrants compete with the young graduates for jobs at lower salaries, more willing to accept worser conditions of living (hence cost of living) . Will these immigrants share the same values as the traditional British?<br><br>but the underlying strength as shared by EarlNeo is in their minds. Their idealistic views of what a human being should be probably sustain them. This strength is now challenged by capitalism : it is capitalism which brought the london prices to such astronomical levels which directly make lives so difficult for the young people. My question and concern is : Will we see the young people in UK turning selfish and only go for the money ? Will we see a sharp U-turn in their attitudes to have a " benevolently democratic" government ?<br>Will the current young people behave as benevolently as their grandparents when they reach their old age themselves when they are told that they are going to receive their pensions only at age 75?<br><br>UK, in my opinion, is the last major English stronghold of humanity versus unfeeling robotic capitalism. UK is a lot more "humane" than USA, probably due to their much longer cultural heritage. Will this last "hope" for english speaking people falter?</div>

Ppl working or studying there still get benefit, such as free health care, just not all benefit such as the social benefit, etc. Workers with family(that are given work permit), their children too get free education. And after working there for 5yrs, ur statue can be change to PR. (more or less guarantee, if u din commit any crime, etc). Reason is; there is a history of ppl that came there work a while then once got PR, quit and sponge on the system. there is a huge different bet getting PR, citizen and ppl that work there with on work permit. Over there, getting work permit is very hard. U cant do it, only company that employ u can and it will cost them, beside.. they need to prove why they hire u. such as they cant find ppl of ur expertises or u are special individual (those head hunted). Show that u had advertise the job for a few time and fail to get any applicant, etc. So that the ppl there is taken care of 1st, not just letting outsider in to fight the job with the local. Or if there is a shortage of ppl in ur field, etc... Basically, they have enough rule that will make the local feel that their job is secure. Another thing, u have to pay the foreigner the same pay as the local with the same benefit. So if u do the math, it is more expensive to hire foreigner . Unlike here, ppl used s'pore as a stepping stone to go else where and it is so easy to get foreigner worker or apply for their work permit.. and often it is alot cheaper to just hire foreigner.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by hloc:</div><div class="quote_body">Not all of us are young &amp; single.... althought I am Mr. Green ..... and also not all of us can earn a decent pay in some foreign land.

But discourage ppl bring in the whole family if they cant support them. Coz if only one work and the other 2 or more sponging on the system, it will be bad for their economy. But if u can support them till u get ur PR, the likelyhood of them sponging on the system is alot lower.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by hloc:</div><div class="quote_body">Yeah.... that seems to be the problem. Everyone knows and wants to BEAT the system. Everyone wants to get benefit/welfare/free stuff without paying for it..... And if I had to paid my taxes, die die also wants more &amp; more to make my taxes worthwhile..... and in the end, the next GEN will pay for it. But Hi... Exclamation I did my part why should I care if the younger GEN have to suffer to support me. </div></blockquote>That is why they have alot of inbuild check and agency set up so that it is not being exploited. But it is not perfect. And if the system dun do well, they try to change it and adapt it with the changing time. Then again, the gov need to have both the opposition and it ppl support before and drastic bill is passed.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by hloc:</div><div class="quote_body">And that my friend.... is why I think Daddy !! is feeling sorry for the youth in UK..... but pls correct me if I'm wrong..... Confused<br></div></blockquote>Yes i understand why Daddy!! pity the youth. But I wont, since i came from a sg background, where u have to work hard and fight for what you want, no free lunch, type of society. Looking at the youth there, they are behaving just like the rich spoilt brat here, with the only exception that the brat there are poor. What i do pity is those honest ppl working hard with the intention of providing a better future for their children might be in for a bad ride.</div>

I was also quietly satisfied that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">we realised our vision of reaching the 1984 Swiss standard of living</span> last year. In 1984, we had set this as a target to be achieved by 1999, but we missed it by one year because of the crisis.''</span><br><br><span style="color: darkred;">Was reaching an economic growth rate of 7.7% in Year 2000 sufficient justification for claiming that Singapore has reached the Swiss Standard of Living pegged at 1984 ?<br><br>Is the Swiss Standard of Living so intangible that it lasted momentarily in a percentum expression only ?<br><br>What had GCT in mind when he mentioned the Swiss Standard of Living for Singaporeans to work towards to ?<br><br>In an interview that GCT gave to Asiaweek magazine printed in 2001, he explained: </span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">''In 1984, the government said it wanted Singapore to be a developed country by 1999, with living standards equivalent to Switzerland's in 1984. The OECD recently reclassified Singapore as a "more advanced developing economy." Are you on track for 1999?<br><br>In 1984, when we talked about the Swiss standard of living, I was using a simple measure of per capita income. By 1999, we would like to achieve the 1984 per capita income of Switzerland. Are we on track? If you look at most of the economic indicators, the answer is yes.''</span><br><br><span style="color: darkred;">Unfortunately, the economic downturn in 1987 disrupted the progress, and another one in 1997 shook Singapore to the core before the speech quote and the Asiaweek interview were both made.<br><br>Should we look at the SWISS Standard of Living merely in economic numbers or in the totality of the SWISS Life - its politics, social, cultural, intellectual, - that make up the Swiss way ?<br><br>All that is mentioned in GCT's National Day Rally Speech of 2001 was addressed to Singaporeans to emulate and conform, somehow they were not quite applicable to the Government, its Ministers, and the Civil Servants.<br><br>Such is the half-measures of our Political Leaders towards making structural change is what is hampering our movement forward - as can be seen in LHL's famous remarks of <span style="font-style: italic;">''all stones were turned over, inspected, and placed back as they were best left alone''</span> - when he head the Economic Restructuring Committee after the 1997 downturn.<br><br>Can Singapore achieve a SWISS Standard of Living that is recognised as equal to any country in the First World - when the Singapore Political System is locked in a Third World mould ?<br><br>Can economic progress be lasting when political policies hampers the development of political, social and cultural creativity that is essential to a thriving and living economy ?<br><br>The SWATCH watch was the Swiss answer to all the SEIKO, CASIO, Citizens, and ALBA - can Singapore emulate the private enterprise and initiative of the Swiss to recover from the debilating challenge of the Japanese watch industry that knocked out the Swiss historical leadership in this area ?<br><br>Such a creative initiative from the Private Sector can only come about when the Political System encourages the Individual to be responsible for all issues - big and small.<br><br>Hong Kong is another example of Private initiative and creative enterprise that continue to maintain the Hongkongers reputation of being survivalists in nywhere in the World.<br><br>It is the Political System that moulds the People.<br><br></span><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Morning <strong>EarlNeo</strong>. 1st of all, I would like to thx U for sharing your information about life in UK with us. I always like real life account instate of those from newspaper.... since most, if not all newspaper write about stuff to catch their target reader..... and are either Pro or Anti any given Govt around the World. So, thxs again.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from"><strong>Yes they always do, <span style="color: red;">but the different is that the ppl get to say YES or NO. If they dun like it, they protest, If it dun work, they vote the opposition</span>. That is why they have labour party is leading the country now instead of the conservative.. during last election most think labour not making the country better, they vote more for the liberate party as a wakeup, that is 1 of the reason blair step down for brown. Here.. we are force into submission</strong>.[/quote]<br>Mmm.... let me see. If the Govt knows that the country can't support a welfare system any longer.... due to high cost or some other reason.... and decided to stop or at least lower the payout. This would of course make the citizen very very unhappy. The citizen then protest or vote for the opps to force a change in the policy..... <strong><span style="color: red;">EVEN IF IT REALLY IS HARMING THE COUNTRY</span></strong>..... but Hi..... I want my welfare...... That my friend, is my fear. I don't want to sound like a dictator supporter.... But sometimes a Leader have to make a policy that is not popular. And if everytime they have to worry for support, they will end up with policy that is good for the short term but can't be support on the long term.<br></div><div class="quote_body"><blockquote>That is why they have alot of inbuild check and agency set up so that it is not being exploited. But it is not perfect. <span style="color: red;">And if the system dun do well, they try to change it and adapt it with the changing time</span>. Then again, the gov need to have both the opposition and it ppl support before and drastic bill is passed.</blockquote><br>And that is the point I was talking about..... I pay my taxes... wait for my PR... wait for my turn on the benefit. Then at some point in time the Govt come say that my 5yrs change to 7yrs... or they now have a change in policy due to some other ppl leeching the system. I know in UK there are many parties that are against Foreginer. And very often these parties will use foreginer as Scapegoats for the jobless rate or leeching of welfare. Again <strong>No Guarantee </strong>for my hardwork.... <strong>What I'm trying to said is POLICY changes all the time</strong>. Today I'm welcome..... Tomorr I'm a leech on the system....<br><br>[quote]<strong>Yes i understand why Daddy!! pity the youth. But I wont, since i came from a sg background, where u have to work hard and fight for what you want, no free lunch, type of society. <span style="color: red;">Looking at the youth there, they are behaving just like the rich spoilt brat here, with the only exception that the brat there are poor.</span> <span style="color: blue;">What i do pity is those honest ppl working hard with the intention of providing a better future for their children might be in for a bad ride</span>.</strong></div></blockquote><strong><strong>Thxs again for highlighting why I'm against a WESTERN style Welfare System in S'pore</strong>. The 1st few GEN on welfare will think that it is a helpful and safetly network for incase they need it. But the later GEN would comes to a thinking that since THEY have to pay for it..... why not make the BEST of it by leeching the system. And in the end.... <span style="color: red;"><strong>it is the honest tax paying ppl and their children that have to suffer because the policy will have to change to stop the leeching</strong></span>.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br></strong></div>
