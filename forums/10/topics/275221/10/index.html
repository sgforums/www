Instead they carry on owing if they stay in London.  "That temporary ride into debt is definitely worthwhile" is true only if they can work and save at the same time.  The location where they can work and save at the same time is some other places outside London, such as Singapore?  Feel free to correct me.<br><br>LONDON (Reuters) - More than eight million British adults are in serious debt, an increase of 30 percent in the past year, largely due to rising interest rates, according to research published on Thursday.<br><br>Some 8.2 million people, equivalent to 18 percent of the adult population, have 10,000 pounds or more of unsecured debt -- such as credit cards, overdrafts, loans and store cards -- according to a quarterly survey by debt consultancy Thomas Charles.<br><br>The number of people struggling to meet debt repayments has also increased.<br><br>A quarter of those with serious debts --10,000 pounds or more -- concede they frequently have problems meeting repayments, up 9 percent on the year.<br><br>The poll of 2,115 British adults, conducted by YouGov, also shows that people in London are the most likely to be struggling with debt.<br><br>Around 40 percent of those living in the capital with debts of 10,000 pounds ore more say they have regular problems repaying their dues.<br><br>This compares with 20 percent in the rest of the south and just 18 percent in the Midlands and Wales.<br></div></blockquote>I believe anyone who's graduated is also an adult.  Hence I am mystified by your interpretation of the term "adult population".  Whether they choose to take the student loan is entirely up to them.  Whether they can repay their loan whilst saving is their own judgment &amp; spending habits.  There is only so much a government can do.  It is a balancing act between providing sufficient funds for British universities &amp; providing students the opportunity of higher education.  The statistics about London's debt reflects mostly on the cost of living in the city.  Those studying at London universities are given higher student loans which have interest of close to nothing.  Alternatively, students could forgo the student loan &amp; rely on their families for funds.  The burden on graduates with debts places emphasis on themselves rather than the Old Man's Scholarship.  It is fair in my opinion.</div>
