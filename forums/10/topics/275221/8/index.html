One of the reasons is precisely because education is free and some have the grades to enter university though not necessarily the funds.  In order for places like Cambridge, LSE &amp; Imperial College compete with top institutions in the rest of the world the charging for university is a must, else the funding drags them down.  The only way to do this is to give student loans, which is perfectly reasonable.  The government recognises the need for an educated workforce and hence uses taxpayer money to grant loans that will be paid back.  It's an ideal situation, government &amp; taxpayers help graduates through their studies, and graduates help contribute &amp; repay the investment by the people.<br><br>The other thing is the fact that although we pay huge taxes, and sorely feel it throughout our university life, we come out from recognised institutions and gain crucial experience/jobs that aren't always available in a place like Singapore.  That temporary ride into debt is definitely worthwhile, which is why the trend is British graduates going to Singapore for expat jobs &amp; not the other way round.</div></blockquote>The artice says "adult population" so the graduates did not manage to pay off their debts.  Instead they carry on owing if they stay in London.  "That temporary ride into debt is definitely worthwhile" is true only if they can work and save at the same time.
