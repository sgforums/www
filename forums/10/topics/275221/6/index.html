These calls for alot of innovation, something which Asian countries can't compete, because we lack the thinking out of the box solutions. We are so controlled, our thoughts and emotions, that I think that it's hard for Asians to test out new ideas. Maybe we are just born like that, who knows.<br><br>What the government choose to do, is focus on low cost (by importing 3rd world countries labour, to compete with citizens for wages), instead of innovation.

            <div class='col-md body'>Thxs <strong>EarlNeo</strong> for sharing your view of life in UK..... since most, if not all of us haven't even set foot there before..... You bring before us a few very intresting facts......<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from"><strong>Actually, 1kGBp per year is consider expensive to THEM, <span style="color: red;">it was free 5 yrs ago</span>. the gov scare that the funding to the uni isnt enough to give the uni over there a decent chance to compete with the world uni, so they try to raise more fund by starting to charge the student.</strong>[/quote]<br></div><div class="quote_body">Govt policy does change..... for better or worst. <span style="color: red;">Therefore is it not possible that the welfare system most of us praise the WEST of could also change with time</span>..... Now 50% of your last drawn pay when U retired...... but only 25% 10yrs later.... <span style="color: blue;">just when it is time for U to get it</span>, who can guarantee those welfare will last forever  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"><br><br><blockquote><strong>i think i know why it din work out for them. <span style="color: red;">Coz there is just too many ppl wanting to go there, hence the rule to become a PR there is very hard</span>. But easier then USA. If u are not a PR there, then u dun get all of the benefit that i mention. <span style="color: blue;">Meaning u get to pay the same high TAX but not all of the goodies. Worse is that they just raise the min. of yrs u need to work there b4 becoming a PR is 5yrs. Up from 3yrs in the past.</span></strong></blockquote><strong>Thx U for highlighting the fact that PR is not easy at all to get in the WEST. <span style="color: red;">We have alot of ppl in this forum whos answer to every 'unhappiness' with the Govt is to MIGRATE somewhere</span>.... some even think that they could get welfare just by being there.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  So, as you, yourself had said..... if any of us were to migrate over to the UK now..... <span style="color: blue;">it will be 5yrs of full taxes without benefit, with only a 'HOPE' of getting PR after 5yrs</span>...... Or is PR guarantee at the end of the 5th yrs - [b]pls enlighten us</strong>.<br><br>[quote]<span style="color: red;"><strong>Think ur fren made a mistake of bring his family there. Surviving there alone with a decent pay is alot easier then here</strong></span><strong>. <span style="color: blue;">If u really know the system well, anyone with a brain can beat it.</span> there is alot of mean to earn $$$ Infact alot easier then here.

            <div class='col-md body'>Indeed a lot of British students are in debt when they graduate.  One of the reasons is precisely because education is free and some have the grades to enter university though not necessarily the funds.  In order for places like Cambridge, LSE &amp; Imperial College compete with top institutions in the rest of the world the charging for university is a must, else the funding drags them down.  The only way to do this is to give student loans, which is perfectly reasonable.

It's an ideal situation, government &amp; taxpayers help graduates through their studies, and graduates help contribute &amp; repay the investment by the people.<br><br>The other thing is the fact that although we pay huge taxes, and sorely feel it throughout our university life, we come out from recognised institutions and gain crucial experience/jobs that aren't always available in a place like Singapore.

I started with an intention to  teach or work in area (research) that can better benefit the human... that is why i took up the free PhD scholarship there after doing my degree in UK. Would have stayed there if not for my parent over here.<br><br>When i am back, financially I am way behind. One of my poly mate is now a millionaire. Others are married and most of them are doing better then me. Beside that, i had change my goals from doing something great to a more selfish one. That is to gain financials freedom and retire by age of 45yrs, where i will decide where to go from there. So itis more of catching game.<br><br>In fact, in term of a lot of things, I am way behind. But in term less materialistic measurement, in term of mental development such as thinking outside the box, creativity and way to do thing differently, I think i have become more humble and are less restrictive in my perspective and more willingly to get out of my comfort zone. I felt that I had progress from a rather tunnel vision to an open view, really get to see and experience what life have to offer and live it to the max. Cos over there, the society is created by the brit to suit their need. hence I have to adapt and change myself to fit in. In doing so... u start to understand their action and the how they think.<br><br>Some of the thing i observe there; The weather there might be gloomy but the ppl there aint. I see old folk (husband&amp;wife), in their 70s&amp;80s still very much active &amp; in love. Driving or using the public transport, travelling the country, enjoying their time in the garden, etc.. instead of being dump in the old folk home or trap inside their home. Despite the problem they face, u can see that ppl are generally well manner and enjoying their live, peaceful and a lot less hectic. The main reason why ppl work is so that they can provide for their family. So if you have to work more then 44hrs per week... where does that leave u? A family that dun include u? I can carry on and on....<br><br>In term of vision, i would say I am way ahead most of my peers, coz i now have a wider view.I'd saw and know what other countrys (beside UK) have to offer and i dun really see the need to accept what that is being offer to me if I dun like it.

A stronger UK helps Singapore simply we are english educated people and there is no sign of relaxing on that.<br><br>at the moment, i feel that the country's population is being diluted by immigrants at alarming speed.  for instance, based on a graph i saw and my memory, more than 60% of population growth in uk is currently due to immigrants.  surely,  many of these immigrants compete with the young graduates for jobs at lower salaries, more willing to accept worser conditions of living (hence cost of living) .  Will these immigrants share the same values as the traditional British?<br><br>but the underlying strength as shared by EarlNeo is in their minds.  Their idealistic views of what a human being should be probably sustain them.  This strength is now challenged by capitalism :  it is capitalism which brought the london prices to such astronomical levels which directly make lives so difficult for the young people.  My question and concern is :  Will we see the young people in UK turning selfish and only go for the money ?  Will we see a sharp U-turn in their attitudes to have a " benevolently democratic" government ?<br>Will the current young people behave as benevolently as their grandparents when they reach their old age themselves when they are told that they are going to receive their pensions only at age 75?<br><br>UK, in my opinion, is the last major English stronghold of humanity versus unfeeling robotic capitalism.  UK is a lot more "humane" than USA, probably due to their much longer cultural heritage.  Will this last "hope" for english speaking people falter?</div>

Then one day, i decide to ask them and my mate. Guess what they said? Some actually choose to be homeless. It is a way of life style for them!!! Can u believe that? I ask why? well, they still receive a min. amount of help from gov, such as food at certain centre or food coupon, and if they have a pet with them, they get a bit more $$, etc.. Some are elder that dun live well with family, but yet dun 1 to end in old folk home, some are alcoholic /drug   addictive who refuse to quit or go to rehabilitation, other able elder simple refuse to work. Oh one more thing, if u pity them, dun give them cash, instead buy them some hot drink&amp;food and offer to them. Reason why? Coz if u give them $$, they'll just go buy cigarette and alcohol.<br><br>For social benefit to be approve, there is a few catch, such as the applicant is work able, they must try looking for job. If u cant find, the job centre will help, meaning u must go a certain amount of interview per month to justify u being jobless and not just sponging on the gov, etc It is hard to help those that dun even want to help themselves. Sometime ppl juz give up.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>By the way, they are call the homeless bunch.. and consist of not just the old, but teen and young adult. Most of them will try to sell u a magazine... it is a charity that write and print magazine for them to sell... all the money gather goes back to the homeless guy selling it. Bottom line, if the homeless there choose not to remain so... they can, coz there is a safety net build in by the system to help them get back on their feet.</div>
