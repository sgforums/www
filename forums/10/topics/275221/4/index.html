It is like GST. U only need to pay it for everything u purchase. So if u are poor... u spend less u get tax even less.<br><br>But if u take VAT out of the equation, ppl there get more for paying a lesser % for their tax, pension, NHS contribution (30~33%) for mid income earner, unlike here, we pay 5~8% tax + 37%CPF = 42~45% when we work. But over there u get free education, free health care, a better pension scheme that pay for as long u live (50% of last income not just S$500 per month), social benefit, interest free student loan,etc. I wonder why they can provide so much more when their minster get paid much lesser then our MP here?<br><br>Oh one more thing, when i first open a bank account there, they give me 50 pound cash (S$160) as a door gift.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> Too much completion there. Alot of bank. With saving interest rate as high as 5~8%. Over 80 credit card issuer company... and none of them charge annul subscription fees. There is way to raise fast cash of up 20K pound interest free loan (for up to a yr or more) by using credit card free interest balance transfer. Basically owing several interest free credit card debt total of up to 20K and not needing to pay back for a year. What most of my mate did was either use these 10k~20k save park it at  a high interest rate account or use it to invest... but have to be careful.<br><br>It really depend on how u use the easy credit and whether it is a good debt or bad debt. What i believe that raises concern for the British youth is that they belong to the latter instead.</div></blockquote>Earl from our understanding in England there is a major shortage of affordable house and apartment and many young adults are struggling to service their mortgage due to the estremely high interest rate 10%? May I know how are your mate handling the situation? Or you mate already have houses and apartment fully paid off by their papa and mama?<br><br></div>

U are comparing the earning of a s'pore with UK. btw, 1GBP = S$3.25 and they got pay a min wages of 5.30GBP 2yrs ago.. could be more now. where our old folk in those fast food corner getting only S$3~4 per hour. and out fix bank saving interest is like wat? 3% and in UK they give 5% and up to 8%<br><br>So if bank give u 5% saving interest when u bank money in them... is charging 6% or even 7%Is that consider alot? Else where does bank get it income? bank here give u 1~3% for saving then charge u 3~4% or more for loan... same what... all of them still earn 1%. Unless it is compound interest we are talking. But do u know 3 yrs ago their fix rate mortgage loan interest was as low 3.5%? Those that had opt for that fix rate are earning like sh!t....but sadly, most ppl tend to opt for a variable rate. cos it it more affordable. there is lot of risk and restriction that come with fix rate. Thing in UK just dun work the way we do thing over here..... here most of thing is gov control... they dun even let oversea bank in here.. ? why coz we lost lah... scare gena eaten up. Who still want to bank with them if barclay come in with a saving interest of 5%? Over there.. it is open market and free for all... when there is competition, the service will improve and customer is really the king. Here, with little or no choice... if the gang up.. we are lan lan lah...<br><br>The main problem, like Daddy!! had point, out with UK.. is not that they dun earn enough,... it is that they spend too much and dun save enough and dun work long enough. Current youth population attitudes toward work and their earning abilities and their expenditure habit dun telly, hence resulting a possibility that their system might break down. Infact they are earning too much for too little work... super high cost man hour... that is why all their car maker company all close down.<br><br>Interest rate is been constantly adjust depending on inflation, economy performance, GDP, etc I am not pro in it... but know enough that interest is normally not the problem, but a mean to address a problem.<br><br>I hope I did clarify ur question. What really interest me is why would ppl be interested in the affair of another country that far away unless u have dealing with it... like daddy!! Not that is a bad thing to know more around u...I am just curious that is all.<br><br>As for Gazelle, i suggest u read up more on the impact that interest rate have on the country as a whole since u seem to have a great interest in interest rate.</div>
