Of course Gazelle can argue that it's not free because someone else has to pay for it. But, with free University education it gives all citizens an equal stepping stone, instead of like Singapore, if your parents can't afford to pay for your University fees, you end up daft like some of the pro P4P in here.<br><br></div>

I read a report which stated before that the bone structure in a man's mouth is herbivorous.  Man has a natural gene to be kind.  I saw it in my children when they were toddlers.  They all have natural compassion for others.  One cried when he saw Pinnochio suffered when he smoked a cigar.  When one grows up to adulthood, one realized that a balance between pragmatism and idealism is needed to survive the real world.<br><br></div>

Whereas more developed countries focus on innovations. I mean look at Nokia a well known brand originating from a Nordic country, every few months you get new innovations and gadget in your handphone. These calls for alot of innovation, something which Asian countries can't compete, because we lack the thinking out of the box solutions. We are so controlled, our thoughts and emotions, that I think that it's hard for Asians to test out new ideas. Maybe we are just born like that, who knows.<br><br>What the government choose to do, is focus on low cost (by importing 3rd world countries labour, to compete with citizens for wages), instead of innovation. This is equivalent to chasing a rock falling in a well, we can only go deeper.<br><br>Are you at work? I hope I am not taking up too much of your time.<br></div>
