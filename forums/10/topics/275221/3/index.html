In UK ppl paid 30~33%% tax(including NHS too) for mid income (18k+pound[abt S$55k] annual pay i think) and 17.5% VAT (Something like GST) [= abt 50%]. But on the bright side i get free health care for life. So what if i have to queue 6 month for a non life threatening expensive operation? (not all, coz my mate waited only 2 weeks for his heart scan). If I am rich, i can always seek private specialist. At least over there, the poor is taken care of with free medical service. Unlike here, u work and slog all ur life (5-8% income tax, 37% CPF, 7%GST = 50%) and toward the end of ur life, if u r broke or use up ur medisave... what can u do but pray to the god... that u die a fast painless death.

If the young is hit, you lose your free medical services and pensions sooner or later.  Stop day dreaming.  Look into the future.<br><br>While the young is hit now, when these same young people grow old, who pays for their pensions and free medical services ?<br><br>Can a British youth have a choice not to pay for others' medical bills and retirement pensions?<br><br>Can a British youth afford a roof over his head other than paying someone else's mortgage ?<br><br>He is crying out "Please help me get out of here !!!

(total 3k pound for a degree) but from the student loan they took up to sustain their school days. If you do the math, I am sure 10k is really peanut for those holding a decent degree. I believe what concern them is those aveage youth without any decent qualification that worries them. By debt, I am sure the 10k are mostly bad debt from credit card and over draft. (do u know the bank there give a 2k over draft to most ppl; meaning u get to have a -2k in your bank balance? And the credit card there offer 1 yrs no interest balance transfer for up to 10k? Try to match that here in s'pore) With all those easy credit temptation... it not surprising why youth there fall into the debt trap.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Daddy!!:</div><div class="quote_body">EarlNeo, in general the younger working population pay for the free medical services and pensions.

Needless to say for city outside london.<br><br>What about those that can't find job or those with low income? Beside the usual free educational system, they have benefit that provide low rent council house (30 pound [S$120] per month for 2~3 rm flat, u even get to buy back the house after staying there for 20yrs with the initial cost price+inflation minus the rent u had paid) and even pay allowance/food coupon/milk powder, etc for those without job [abt 6k pound per year]. I know all this coz a mate of mine is a single mum in her 20s living off social benefit.<br><br>What I'm trying saying is that the poor and needy is being taken care of. Even those youth in debt.

That is why there are agency that is being set up such that the system is not being misuse. The system is not base on SELFISHNESS as you had quoted. Think of it more in the mind frame of distributing the wealth of rich (Since the rich are tax way more) to help out and take care of the poor and old.<br><br>yes if the youth is hit, where will the next pool of NHS/ pension $$ come from? That is why they get free education, interest free student loan, benefit to help their family, etc.. offer everyone a chance to get out of poverty and make education available to everyone, not just those that can afford. How can you view paying your share of the tax and carrying the burden selfish? Beside that, If I pay my share, what so wrong with having a pension and free health care?<br><br>Those 10k debt are mostly bad debt as a result of irresponsible spending and normally associate with uneducated youth. Once trap inside the debt trap, most such youth are unable to get out due to the high interest rate that came alone with credit card. Do u know that there is a minimum wages law, of rate 5.30 pound per hour [S$16 per hour]. What i think they are concern about is the way this certain group of youth spend $$ and  getting into such bad debt is rising.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Daddy!!:</div><div class="quote_body">I wonder why you people keep pulling Singapore into the picture.

The 6 month i stated is the max for any operation a year ago when i was last there. They are actually trying to cut down the wait period to 3~4month.. max.. duno if succeed or not.<br><br>But one thing i know is dental health isn't fully cover!! so dun have to wait... :p I think dental consultation is free (that is why dentist there is richer then most GP). Also you dun have to wait for gp consultation and prescription. And there is a max. charge for prescription. the max they can charge u is 6.45pound per prescription. So anything above that is free. Think they did that to prevent misuse of NHS, where ppl just go for free prescription like Paracetamol or aspirin.<br><br>Dun really like their their NHS, but neither do i like our current system in s'pore.

It is like GST. U only need to pay it for everything u purchase. So if u are poor... u spend less u get tax even less.<br><br>But if u take VAT out of the equation, ppl there get more for paying a lesser % for their tax, pension, NHS contribution (30~33%) for mid income earner, unlike here, we pay 5~8% tax + 37%CPF = 42~45% when we work. But over there u get free education, free health care, a better pension scheme that pay for as long u live (50% of last income not just S$500 per month), social benefit, interest free student loan,etc. I wonder why they can provide so much more when their minster get paid much lesser then our MP here?<br><br>Oh one more thing, when i first open a bank account there, they give me 50 pound cash (S$160) as a door gift.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> Too much completion there. Alot of bank. With saving interest rate as high as 5~8%. Over 80 credit card issuer company... and none of them charge annul subscription fees. There is way to raise fast cash of up 20K pound interest free loan (for up to a yr or more) by using credit card free interest balance transfer. Basically owing several interest free credit card debt total of up to 20K and not needing to pay back for a year. What most of my mate did was either use these 10k~20k save park it at  a high interest rate account or use it to invest... but have to be careful.<br><br>It really depend on how u use the easy credit and whether it is a good debt or bad debt.
