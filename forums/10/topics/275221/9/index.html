Unfortunately, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">a lot of people do not qualify for them</span> because of a lack of history. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sub-prime loans thus look attractive because they don't bother to check for credit history</span> and other things</strong>.<br><br>This then leads on to further problems when the people in question default. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The crisis exists because too many people default and then banks are reluctant to lend</span>. Liquidity goes to zero. Simply put the crisis is a series of chain reactions that will eventually hit consumer spending if this lack of credit continues.<br><br>Kinda scary when one thinks about it.</span><br></div><div class="quote_body">----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Please dont make silly baseless accusation just because you choose to suck atobe's di.ck.<br><br>Are you now arguing the the caused of the subprime saga is not because of Americans living beyond their means by taking up huge housing loan which they cant afford?<br><br>Are you also supporting Atobe's claim that people who take up subprime loan are people who are less educated, and under previleged?

The economy grew, but mainly because American families were persuaded to take on more debt, refinancing their mortgages and spending some of the proceeds. And, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">as long as housing prices rose</span> as a result of lower interest rates, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Americans could ignore their growing indebtedness</span>.<br><br>Even this did not stimulate the economy enough. To get more people to borrow more money, credit standards were lowered, fueling growth in so-called "sub?prime" mortgages. Moreover, <strong>new products were invented, which lowered upfront payments, making it easier for individuals to take bigger mortgages</strong>.<br><br>Some mortgages even had negative amortization: payments did not cover the interest due, so every month the debt grew more. <strong>Fixed mortgages, with interest rates at 6 percent, were replaced with variable-rate mortgages, whose interest payments were tied to the lower short-term T-bill rates</strong>.''</span><br><br><span style="color: darkred;">From your third reference site taken from an individual's blog - with his financial expertise unknown- it had this headline : <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong><a href="http://www.mymoneyblog.com/archives/2007/02/our-savings-rate-is-negative-should-we-worry.html" rel="nofollow">''Our Savings Rate Is (Still) Negative: Should We Worry?</a></strong></span> - did you not link the three together ? </span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">''The problem with this data is that it doesnÂ’t separate out the very rich and the poor, and thus really reflect how the majority of people are doing. Even though the net worth numbers make things look better, the top 20% of households by wealth have 15 times the net worth of the median household.<br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The top 20% by income make 50% of the total income</span></strong>. Only half of Americans even own stock, let alone have capital gains to worry about. What would happen to these charts if you took out the top 20% richest people? Are the big earners also the big spenders? Or are the lower <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">80% of people both spending too much and not seeing any gains in net worth</span></strong>? ''<br><br><span style="color: darkred;">All your three referenced site besides telling of Americans spending more than they have - also confirmed the preamble of the sub-prime problem which began with the heavy borrowings, and with [i]<strong>''new products were invented, which lowered upfront payments, making it easier for individuals to take bigger mortgages''</strong></span>; and confirming that only the <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">''.. top 20% by income make 50% of the total income''</span></strong></span> - which leaves the bottom 80% being the ones linked to the problems, with this 80% having the <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">worst credit record</span></strong> holding the bulk of all the financial borrowings - as illustrated in my own previous reference given :</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><a href="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/cndy/2007-08/14/content_6025028.htm" rel="nofollow">''Subprime lending refers to loans to people who have <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">poor credit histories</span></strong> and <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">low incomes</span></strong>. These high-risk housing mortgages thus come at high interest rates. Over time, these mortgages have come to be bundled into other forms of securities and sold in the global credit markets.''</a></span><br><br><span style="color: darkred;">The sub-prime issue is about mortgages due to low interest packages designed by the Bank for anyone to borrow without checks made; and the situation encouraged by the poor monitoring from the Regulators.<br><br>Is Fingolfin_Noldor post not the same but making it clearer from his own first hand knowledge being a resident in the US ?<br><br>Did you celebrate too early again ?

This is my logic.<br><br>1)  Banks in America offered mortgage loans like free money by a design of the loan structure quite sophisticated that it is not seen in Singapore.  Innovation!<br>2)  People on the streets, especially those who are rejected by banks' credit analysts, take up the loan since it is free and requires little or no down-payments.<br>3)  Why I say Americans are smart people because they repackage the high risk loans into mortgage backed securities.  Some even issue CDOs on these loans.  They then sell these securities, targeting the rich idio.ts mainly in Europe.<br>4) People on the street default and whoever bought this securities made big losses.<br>5) So who is the big winner ?   Investors lost, Banks lost but rescued by central banks, people on the street lost because they are made bankrupt.  The main winners are the developers and the economy.<br>6) The people who are made bankrupt only remain bankrupt for not many years.  they come out of it and start borrowing again.<br><br>Americans are really smart and they screw.ed the Europeans through their investment bankers.<br><br>Feel free to correct me.
