            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE: Singapore's biggest taxi operator ComfortDelGro has announced that it will raise its fares, likely from 18 December.<br><br>Many in the industry see it as a move to help taxi drivers manage rising overhead costs.<br><br>But most customers are not quite convinced. Even some taxi drivers are not too pleased with the hike.<br><br>Industry players said ComfortDelGro's decision is not unexpected, given rising prices and the recent increase in Goods and Services Tax (GST).<br><br>In fact some taxi operators, like Premier, said that fares should have been raised six months ago.<br><br>ComfortDelGro has remained tight-lipped on details, but many believe that the flag-down rate will be raised by at least 30 cents.<br><br>ComfortDelGro said it "doesn't comment on price increases".<br><br>But comment on price increase is what many people want to do.<br><br>"I can accept it if they raise prices by 10 cents, but not beyond that. I feel that as customers we are already paying a lot of fees, like CBD and peak hour charges. It (taxi fare) is just too high," said a member of the public.<br><br>"I do sympathise but we customers also feel the brunt of transportation prices going up; everything has gone up," said another.<br><br>"I just feel there should be a longer time for the public to give some sort of feedback. Two weeks and before Christmas, (when the fare will rise), is really short. There's nothing much we can do about it," said a third.<br><br>Others think that what they can do is to simply go for alternatives, and that's the main concern of some taxi drivers.<br><br>"The fare goes up, a lot of people don't take taxi.....No passenger!"<br>said a cabby.<br><br>"Fuel prices are high now. If fares increase, it's enough to cover our costs, but for the customer, it might be a little difficult," said another taxi driver.<br><br>For these taxi drivers, they would rather have lower rental fees to help them manage rising overhead costs.<br><br>Smaller cab companies tell Channel NewsAsia that they are likely to follow the new fare rates to be published by ComfortDelGro, the market leader.<br><br>Bigger operators, like SMRT, say that they are still "looking into the matter". - CNA/ir<br><br></div>
