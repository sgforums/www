            <div class='col-md body'>There are a few halls of residence in NUS that are supposed to be run separately from NUS adminstration. (of course that's a rather vague term).<br><br>Raffles Hall is one of them. They impose compulsory meal plans on students, and if students opt to go without meal plans, they still need to pay 60% of the amount for meals. (eg compulsory meal plan = $200 a month, if you forgot this, you still have to pay them $120 ANYWAY).<br><br>That's not all. They force you to buy their Raffles Hall t-shirt. They make you pay, then they claim that they have run of t-shirts, and they can't give you one. And since "the fund has closed", they can't refund you the money either.<br><br>What can you do? It's like an unwritten rule that if you b itch about it, they'd try and catch you doing things that are deemed to be against the hall rules. So if you keep quiet about the t shirt money (a sizeable $12), they'll let it go.<br><br>Isn't that akin to protection money???<br><br>In another hall, King Edward VII, it seems the security guard has some kind of quota to reach to catch people breaking the rules (and of course, getting subsequently fined). He therefore pounces on any group of people which consists of more than 2 people and tells them to shut up even though they are merely talking.<br><br>What the Fuck is all of this about???</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Me thinks you should just go rent a room at clementi. I know its a little costly and got to travel more, but you would have no rules to adhere to. Basically, you're buying yourself more freedom; of course still got to depend on the tenant but I'm sure it's easy to find an accomadating one these days given the market situation. Any agents here? Maybe they can enlighten us on the rates.</div>
