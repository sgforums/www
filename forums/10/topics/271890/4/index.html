            <div class='col-md body'>LHL's speech in parliament about sums up the sentiments of most Singaporeans and the decision taken is a right one. To their credit, even the WP is not supporting this repeal motion. Sylvia is smarter than many Opposition leaders ...she understands how the majority of Singaporeans feel about this issue and it is the majority's view that prevails at the ballot box. As I have said before and echoed by LHL, all that the gay community has done with this motion is to invite a  backlash against them. They will find that there will be less room for them in future.<br><br>Homosexuals have been emboldened by the lattitude given to them so far. It's as the Chinese saying goes, 'de chun jing chi', give them an inch and they want a yard. The gay community has awakened the sleeping giant of the conservative majority who will now seek to oppose them and reduce whatever freedom they have been given.</div>

I've seen guys here who stared at other people's trodgers while peeing in the men's room get hammered afterwards ... true, a society's values are not always fixed, but the society's permissible boundaries are always defined by her CURRENT values ...<br><br>and that's the whole point of keeping the law, which I think, many are missing ... this law is kept as a reflection of the society we live in, we don't see police squads breaking up sunday night discos, we don't see taskforces and vigilantes rounding up brokebackers ... we don't have surveillance teams busting into brokebacking people ...<br><br>so why keep it on the books if it's never, or rarely going to be used (I can think of some examples perhaps, say gay rape ? ) ... cos this law reflects the acceptable norms and permissible boundaries of our society, I don't see it as limiting the space for people of different orientation, but preserving the space of people in the mainstream, as the powers that be has mentioned before, brokebackers are now employed as civil servants, etc etc ... they are not being driven underground, they even have their own parades now ... so what's the problem ? I don't see it as an intrusion of privacy ... let me give you another example, there's another obscure piece of law in the books that criminalizes intercourse with animals ... I have a friend who worked in emergency services, and he has a whole collection of stories about responding to calls from women(especially rich tai tais), who got stuck with their pet doggies while bonking them ... do we see these women being hauled up through the court system ? ... do we see them being splashed on the newpaper ? ...<br><br>nothing has changed for anybody, really ... but the larger society has certainly spoken on where she stands ...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Anyone thought of this possibility?<br><br>With the advent of the Pink Dollar, perhaps in the near future 377A will be amended to decriminalise intercourse between <strong>foreign</strong> men, yet retained against citizens to protect "family values".<br><br>After all, most rich gays are foreigners. The government claims it treads a tightrope between pragmatic economics and heartland Asian values, and this is a perfectly plausible way to maintain the balance.<br><br>Just like in Korea(?) where locals are forbidden to enter casinos. Double standards are certainly very familiar to our govt.</div>

The Chinese civilisation traditionally do not discriminate against homosexuality. A number of Emperors including Han Wu Di had official history records in which they engage in homosexual activities. The Chinese Idiom of Long Yang Zhi Pi or Ge Xiu Zhi Pi all derived from incident in which rulers engaged in homosexual activity. Homosexual activities were only seen as a problem if the ruler engage in it excessively, but that applies to heterosexual too. The above idioms were no doubt negative in their meanings, but were mean to criticise the rulers for over-doing it rather than just doing it.<br><br>Among the people, gay prostitues were common activities, if you read Dream of Red Chamber, you could see that boy prostitutes and occasional homosexual activities were common among the society. In fact, people don't tend to classify gay as a separate issue and most people who engage in homosexual activities see no meaning to the word gay. They are just largely Bi-Sexual as Xue Pan, Jia Bao Yu and most other male characters in the novel are. You might think that a novel is not a good source of reference, but it is rather the way which the novel was written in which the writer himself, do not seem to think that homosexuality was an issue that provided the clue to the society then.<br><br>Gay, rather than being "imported" from "demoralised" western society as often perceived was actually being "discriminalised" by western society. The current 377 code was a product of Victoria Era British penal code. The Chinese throughout their 5000 years of history had not even think of discriminating against homosexuality. They almost don't even differentiate it. Modern China's stand against homosexuality was also likely to be an import along with Marxism.</div></blockquote> Official records of homosexual activities do not mean Chinese society condoned such activities. If you read Water Margin, revolution against local authorities might be common at that time, but you think it was ever something acceptable in the society? If you read "jin ping mei", or stories about Emperor Qian Long visiting prostitutes, don't you believe that prostitutes were ever accepted in Chinese society, try marry a prostitute and see how your folks respond. Homosexuality is recorded as one of the 10 sinful acts in Shan Shu, and is always an act of "corrupt public morals" "shang feng bai su". Han Wu Di was recorded to have favored a second wife, instead of the emperess, and it was his son who became emperor after he died, not another man. Was he born a gay? hardly</div>
