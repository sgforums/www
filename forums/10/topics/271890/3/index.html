            <div class='col-md body'>Singapore to keep anti-gay legislation<br><br>By John Burton in Singapore<br><br>Published: September 22 2007 07:30 | Last updated: September 22 2007 07:30<br><br>Earlier this year, Lee Kuan Yew, SingaporeÂ’s elder statesman, raised hopes among the city-stateÂ’s gay community that a long-standing law banning homosexual acts would be abolished.<br><br>Mr Lee acknowledged that some people were Â“genetically born a homosexualÂ” and Â“canÂ’t help it. So why should we criminalise it?Â”<br><br>The about-face by one of SingaporeÂ’s most powerful politicians did not seem motivated by politics, although Mr LeeÂ’s parliamentary constituency does contain the largest number of gay bars in the city.<br><br>Instead, Mr LeeÂ’s mellowing attitude appeared linked to SingaporeÂ’s ambition of becoming a global city with a buzz that attracts highly skilled foreign talent.<br><br>However, as it completed the most extensive revision of the countryÂ’s penal code since 1984 this week, Singapore decided to keep the Victorian-era law, inherited from British colonial rule, that makes it an offence for any male to Â“commit an act of gross indecencyÂ”.<br><br>The ministry of home affairs said a public consultation had found a majority of Singaporeans wanted to retain the law.<br><br>Â“We are generally a conservative societyÂ” and Â“we should let the situation evolveÂ”, it said, although it promised it would not actively prosecute people under what is known as Section 377A.<br><br>The government has often cited public attitudes for retaining the law.<br><br>In conjunction with the ministryÂ’s decision, the state-guided press published a survey by a local university that revealed that 69 per cent of those questioned held negative attitudes towards homosexuality.<br><br>Criticism of homosexuality has formed part of the ideology of the PeopleÂ’s Action party since it came to power in 1959, with Â“sexual deviationismÂ” portrayed as a symbol of western decadence in contrast to SingaporeÂ’s Â“Asian valuesÂ”.<br><br>Gay activists complain that official attitudes have hardened since Mr LeeÂ’s son, Lee Hsien Loong, became prime minister in 2004.<br><br>Shortly after he came to power, officials cancelled what had been an officially sanctioned Â“gay raveÂ” party on the resort island of Sentosa, claiming it increased the chances of spreading the HIV/Aids virus.<br><br>Authorities have enforced rules banning films seen to promote a gay lifestyle, causing HBO not to broadcast Brokeback Mountain in Singapore when it recently aired the Oscar-winning film in Asia.<br><br>Police last month cancelled a lecture by Douglas Sanders, a Canadian academic, because of concerns that he would speak on behalf of decriminalising Section 377A.<br><br><a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/ab347a00-685a-11dc-b475-0000779fd2ac.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/ab347a00-685a-11dc-b475-0000779fd2ac.html</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Firstly, there is no such thing as an anti-gay legislation.<br><br>There is just this law making it an offence for a man to have sexual relations with another man.<br><br>Now it is already clear, what a person does within the privacy of his bedroom is his own business. Provided there is no complaint.<br>This goes the same for heterosexual relationships.<br><br>What is it that the homosexuals <span style="text-decoration: underline;">really</span> want, with the repeal of Section 377A?<br>To put it bluntly, they want freedom to screw backside.<br>It ought to be impressed on these buggers that the anus is for defecating faeces<br>And if homosexuality isn't about anal intercourse, why be very particular about its repeal.<br>Two men can be buddies, and how far this buddyship goes is up to them.<br>But they want their mutual fetish to be the norm, when it is actually a perversion.<br>Same sex weddings, all have this common aim.<br><br>The family unit is what that keeps the world sane. Break up the family, and there will be greater anarchy looming up ahead. Already the family unit is deteriorating, and the world is in the sad state it is now. It is, and will be, the family unit that will hold the world together.<br>Gays are just one factor that is hastening the onset of anarchy.<br><br></div>

As such, I feel although the section is really a non issue ( since it is not enforced actively), I feel changes can be made to criminalise PDA of same sex, but let's not criminalise what they do in private. This is a protection of the welfare and rights of the public, and is in line with the current perspective of the population.<br><br>We have progressed pretty far, but laws are made to protect the rights of the people, and it is fair to respect the rights of the majority</div>

The Chinese civilisation traditionally do not discriminate against homosexuality. A number of Emperors including Han Wu Di had official history records in which they engage in homosexual activities. The Chinese Idiom of Long Yang Zhi Pi or Ge Xiu Zhi Pi all derived from incident in which rulers engaged in homosexual activity. Homosexual activities were only seen as a problem if the ruler engage in it excessively, but that applies to heterosexual too. The above idioms were no doubt negative in their meanings, but were mean to criticise the rulers for over-doing it rather than just doing it.<br><br>Among the people, gay prostitues were common activities, if you read Dream of Red Chamber, you could see that boy prostitutes and occasional homosexual activities were common among the society. In fact, people don't tend to classify gay as a separate issue and most people who engage in homosexual activities see no meaning to the word gay. They are just largely Bi-Sexual as Xue Pan, Jia Bao Yu and most other male characters in the novel are. You might think that a novel is not a good source of reference, but it is rather the way which the novel was written in which the writer himself, do not seem to think that homosexuality was an issue that provided the clue to the society then.<br><br>Gay, rather than being "imported" from "demoralised" western society as often perceived was actually being "discriminalised" by western society. The current 377 code was a product of Victoria Era British penal code. The Chinese throughout their 5000 years of history had not even think of discriminating against homosexuality. They almost don't even differentiate it. Modern China's stand against homosexuality was also likely to be an import along with Marxism.</div>
