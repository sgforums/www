Seriously, you are who you are and there is no one to blame but yourself.</strong><br><br>frankly i dont quite concurred what u had said. there is nothing wrong when u blame the govt for not getting a desire job becoz the govt has fail to create jobs in the relevant sector for u. that what very top minister of ruling party should do for the citizen of every country. i dont think it is ridiculous to expect everyone from singapore to be gracious. why not let one be themselves instead of expecting to be someone they are not. eg. i encourage those who give up their seats to others but i dont it is necessary to criticise those who do not. Do you ever stand up and clap your hands when u or your friends see someone who give up their seats to the elderly or pregnant women. if not, you are not contributing to the causes of graciousness of opening appreciating someone who did a noble act.<br><br>robert teh isnt just blaming PAP for nothing. they way LKY marginalise the opposition is for all to see. that is something definitely not gracious isnt it?<br></div>

Seriously, you are who you are and there is no one to blame but yourself.</div></blockquote>Agreed we as singaporeans are to blame for such behaviour but i believe society and meybe the govt should shoulder some blame.<br><br>How so u ask? Singapore is a very competitive country, there are people who work very hard and earn little. We work long hours as well. It is different from Oz "mate" whereby u can have a comfortable life doing part time work and ask the capitalist "the hell do u work so hard for? do u rly need so much $?" The wage system in Oz protects low income earners by taxing the high income earners. Therefore allowing Ozzies to follow their heart. I would have luved to be a blue collar worker under the sun using my hands and enjoying laughs and a beer with a colleague whilst i lay bricks. Try that in Singapore "mate" and try that in Ozzieland. I would be working overtime for pay that could hardly afford beer which would be a luxury. Chicks would be like eeeww bricklayer? Can u even afford yerself? much less a family  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">. Ozzieland? tradesman? good money aye buddy? *pat on the back  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>This inbreeds a selfish nature within the low income earners in SG. Tired after work i see a pregnant woman in the MRT..... give up my seat? Woman i pity you but tough luck i'm not doing too well myself..... let the rich give up their seat..... life hasnt been treating me well.<br><br>But i'm not doing too bad some say? $2k+ average stuff mah aiyo....dun say until so chiam..... try buying a small car and a mortgage  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"> after that lets see what u can save... capital appreciation? on a 99 year lease? 60k for a decent small car that you have to scrap after what 10 years?<br><br>The big tickets in life ie car and house are cheaper in Oz as compared to Sg dude. Why dont you try spending the same amount of $ for a house in Oz for a "house" in Sg? Lets see how much harder you have to work for the same "luxury".<br><br></div>

So I can see that nearly all the MPs are too afraid to get involved with real problem feedbacks. One of them went into the topic and informed me I have been idealistic citing examples like Indonesia or Fillippines said to be caused by democracy. I responded with rationale and because of them the MP replied again agreeing that certain parts of the constitution need amendments. I asked "if he finds my suggestions objective or reasonable why not convey them to the higher up ministers". There were no replies after that. So the issues and problems brought up in my proposal are conveniently side-stepped and forgotten.<br><br>Everyone of the MPs seems to be afraid of being involved in some negative feedback which may affect his or her career.<br><br>Can we have good leadership or talent in government if our MPs adopt this kind of attitude or policy to avoid carrying bad or unpleasant news to the emperor to be free of getting into troubles with their own career themselves.</div></blockquote>mmmm... food for thought</div>
