            <div class='col-md body'>This idea may seem very far-fetched, but I believe that Singapore should design and manufacture its own replacement for the A-4. This has been done by other countries in the past, such as Japan (FS-X), Taiwan (AIDC Ching-kuo), China (J-10), and Israel (IAI Lavi).<br><br>No doubt buying western fighters such as more F-16s is a cheaper and more practical solution, but Singapore Aerospace has been gaining experience through upgrading aircraft and I think that a locally designed aircraft should be possible 20-30 years down the road.</div>

Of course all AEW platforms are expensive. They do give you value for money though.... LALEE would never be able to carry a powerful radar to detect enemy fighters some 250km away. E-2C happens to be one of the smallest platform to carry a meaningful radar that is powerful enuff to give you a 360 degree coverage. However, given the radar is mechanically steered, it is not as effective as electronically steered phased array like Phalcon and Erieyes or the MESA radar for the RAAF Wedgetails.

Taiwan Ching Kuo project also got lots of help from  Lockheed Martin, so is the Japanese F2 project. Look, all these countries have many years of experience building the latest generation of combat aircraft (license built) but they still cannot come up with a decent trainer or combat aircraft design without the help from the Americans.

We have to realised that it is just not viable from economic point of view or from technical point of view. We do not have the scale to justify such an ambition.

It stands for Low Altitude Long Enduring Eudurance. Long Enduring means long life span. I think the navy was complaining that in event of war the e-2c is too tax to provide air defense coverage for the island and for the navy when they are in south china sea. a fleet of LALEE can be rotated to provide coverage for the fleet while at sea. There is no crew fatigue to take care off. the lalee can carry 2000kg payload, since there is no operators equipment to carry. The payload can be used just to carry the radar. most probably the radar coverage is like the seaking aew type</div>

The Americans, Russians, British and French did not just learnt to design advanced jet in a short period of time. They have been doing that since the first jet was built after the WWII.<br><br>Yes, ST Aero has learnt fast, fast track their knowledge and experience but they are not even near where the Japanese, Koreans, Taiwanese, Israeli, Indians and the Chinese are today. These countries set out to build some of the most advanced aerospace industry. ST Aero is at least 1/2 a decade behind these countries in  terms of the technical capabilities (a credit to ST Aero itself already given it got nothing much to start with and have achieved so much in so little time). To counter your statement, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Rome was not built in a day</span> and ST Aero or Singaporean aspiration of building a locally designed fighter is a case of <span style="text-decoration: underline;"> the heart is willingly but the body is NOT</span>.<br><br>Is ST Aero insists on building a locally designed fighter, it would at best be a design copy of a third generation fighter (albeit it could have the best avionics), but lack critical advanced aerodynamics design and capable FBW controls. That is for sure.</div>
