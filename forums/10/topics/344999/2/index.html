              <h1>Washington's homeless told to move along for inauguration</h1>
              <p><a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hJuMxr4cypQQrwmAm7sZPm0lwC8w">http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hJuMxr4cypQQrwmAm7sZPm0lwC8w</a></p>
              <p>WASHINGTON (AFP) — Before sunrise on Thursday, Frank Mearns will
              leave the place he calls home, a stone's throw from the White House,
              and join thousands of others in Washington who are upping sticks and
              moving out for the presidential inauguration.</p>
              <p>But Mearns isn't
              about to make a quick buck by renting out his pied-a-terre. Nor is he
              heading out of town on an inauguration escape holiday.</p>
              <p>He's one
              of Washington's army of homeless who are being cleared from the center
              of the US capital ahead of the historic inauguration of Barack Obama.</p>
              <p>"There's a sweep on Thursday at 5:00 am," Mearns said.</p>
              <p>"Everyone's got to be out of here and stay out until next Thursday," the 37-year-old said.</p>
              <p>"Here"
              is a space on 14th Street and New York Avenue, in the heart of a zone
              in the center of Washington that will be closed to traffic and heavily
              policed during the inauguration.</p>
              <p>"Here" is also home to Mearns and a dozen other homeless people each night.</p>
              <p>Five
              of his fellow street dwellers work full-time but can't afford to pay
              the high rents in the Washington area. Another is a man who was
              displaced from his home in New Orleans by Hurricane Katrina. And there
              are a handful of women in the group.</p>
              <p>"There's a lady who's been
              on the streets for 10 years and been raped seven times. She sleeps next
              to the guy from Katrina and if he's not here, she sleeps somewhere
              else. She sleeps here for safety. She doesn't know where she'll go next
              week," Mearns told AFP.</p>
              <p>According to Michael O'Neill of the
              National Coalition for the Homeless, up to 1,200 people live rough in
              the security zone, including on Pennsylvania Avenue, the grand
              boulevard which the inaugural parade will march down.</p>
              <p>The effort
              to clear the streets of Washington of its homeless population was
              unlike anything that former homeless man David Pirtle has witnessed.</p>
              <p>"I
              was on the streets when George W. Bush had his second inauguration in
              2005 and it was nothing like this. There were no large-scale sweeps. I
              slept on Pennsylvania Avenue the night before and the night after the
              inauguration," said the 34-year-old who now works for the National
              Coalition for the Homeless.</p>
              <p>"But as hard as the administration is
              going to try to make this look sanitary, the homeless are not going to
              be invisible. You can't make 6,000-12,000 people disappear," he said,
              citing official figures for homelessness in Washington-proper and the
              greater metropolitan area, including suburbs in Virginia and Maryland.</p>
              <p>A
              dozen shelters will be open round-the-clock in Washington from Sunday
              until Wednesday, the day after Obama takes office, to provide temporary
              housing for the homeless.</p>
              <p>The shelters will be equipped with televisions, showing live coverage of Obama's swearing-in.</p>
              <p>But
              they have only around 2,800 beds. And "things happen" in shelters,
              according to Mearns, who will be staying with an activist friend for
              the week.</p>
              <p>Between one and two million people are expected to pour
              into Washington, a city of 400,000, for the inauguration, some paying
              tens of thousands of dollars a night for a hotel room and to attend
              lavish inaugural balls.</p>
              <p>Given the huge numbers expected,
              unprecedented security measures are being put in place to try to ensure
              that the January 20 inauguration runs smoothly and safely.</p>
              <p>"I
              don't fault the people who are putting this together for trying to make
              it a safe event because if there are a couple of million people crammed
              into the middle of Washington, it could be a target for something,"
              Pirtle said.</p>
              <p>"But you can do it and work with the community," he added.</p>
              <p>Washington
              Mayor Adrian Fenty has estimated that the inauguration will cost the
              city some 47 million dollars (35 million euros), while Maryland and
              Virginia have estimated their outlay at 12 million and 16 million
              dollars respectively.</p>
              <p>"We are showing our priorities as a nation:
              throwing a multi-million dollar party while trying to shovel our poor
              and our homeless under the carpet," Pirtle said.</p>
              <p>"It's an
              inauspicious start to our new administration of hope that Obama wants
              to work for," he added, blaming city and security officials rather than
              the president-elect, who he said was "stuck in the middle.</p>
              <p>Presidential
              Inauguration Committee spokesman Kevin Griffiths said he would "check
              what our interaction has been with the local authorities about the
              homeless," and stressed that the organizers have been at pains to make
              the historic investiture as inclusive as possible.</p>

              <p><span class="std nobr"> - </span></p>
              <h2><em><span style="color: #ff0000;">Obama Takes His Oath of Office Again</span></em></h2>
              <p><em><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Updated 8:31 p.m.</strong><br><em>By Anne E. Kornblut and Michael D. Shear</em><br> President Obama took the oath of office -- again -- on Wednesday, out
              of what a White House lawyer described as "an abundance of caution."</span></em></p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #ff0000;">"We believe that the oath of office was administered effectively and
              that the president was sworn in appropriately yesterday. But the oath
              appears in the Constitution itself. And out of an abundance of caution,
              because there was one word out of sequence, Chief Justice Roberts
              administered the oath a second time," said White House Counsel Greg
              Craig in a statement issued early Wednesday night. </span></em></p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #ff0000;">Obama and Chief Supreme Court Justice John Roberts had both seemingly <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/01/20/AR2009012002321.html">stumbled over the 35-word oath</a> during Obama's swearing-in as president on Tuesday, leading some to
              question whether he had properly committed the
              Constitutionally-mandated speech act that made him president of the
              United States.</span></em></p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #ff0000;">A president is required by the Constitution to say: "I do solemnly
              swear that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the
              United States, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect
              and defend the Constitution of the United States."</span></em></p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #ff0000;">At the inaugural, Roberts had mixed up the words, saying instead:
              "...that I will execute the office to President of the United States
              faithfully..."</span></em></p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #ff0000;">And so, at 7:35 p.m. today, according to the White House pool
              report, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Roberts re-administered the oath in the Map Room of the White
              House. </span></span></em></p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #ff0000;">"We decided it was so much fun -- " the first time, Obama joked while sitting on a couch.</span></em></p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #ff0000;">Obama stood and walked over to make small talk with a reporter as Roberts donned his black robe.</span></em></p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #ff0000;">"Are you ready to take the oath?" Roberts asked.</span></em></p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #ff0000;">"I am, and we're going to do it very slowly," Obama replied.</span></em></p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #ff0000;">The private swearing-in ceremony took 25 seconds.</span></em></p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #ff0000;">After a flawless recitation, Roberts smiled and said, "Congratulations,<br> again."</span></em></p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #ff0000;">"Thank you, sir," Obama replied, to a smattering of applause.</span></em></p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #ff0000;">"All right," Obama said. "The bad news for the pool is there's 12 more balls."</span></em></p>
