              <p><strong>Will you be happy with whatever government we will get then?</strong></p>
              <p>that is what the PAP has been using that theme for the last few decade....during election.....FEAR. if not "them".... "who"   A single party has prove its weakness in finding 21st century solutions. It ideas evolved in the same premises.</p>
              <p>So how can you continue to buy that argument? Aren't you tired?</p>
              <p>SG travel far and see the world and will have to find its own solution to continue. There are no patriach politics.  Its time to turn that Page.</p>

              <p><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/jan/20/barack-obama-inauguration-us-speech">http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/jan/20/barack-obama-inauguration-us-speech</a></p>
              <p>When Barack Obama steps up to the podium to deliver his inaugural
              address, one man standing anonymously in the crowd will be paying
              especially close attention. With his cropped hair, five o'clock shadow
              and boyish face, he might look out of place among the dignitaries,
              though as co-author of the speech this man has more claim than most to
              be a witness to this moment of history.</p>
              <p>Jon Favreau, 27, is, as
              Obama himself puts it, the president's mind reader. He is the youngest
              chief speechwriter on record in the White House, and, despite such
              youth, was at the centre of discussions of the content of today's
              speech, one which has so much riding on it.</p>
              <p>For a politician
              whose rise to prominence was largely built upon his powers as an
              orator, Obama is well versed in the arts of speech-making. But today's
              effort will tower over all previous ones.</p>
              <p>It is not just that
              Obama has set an extremely high bar by invoking the inaugural speeches
              of Abraham Lincoln as his inspiration - admitting to feeling
              "intimidated" when he read them. It is also that, as he begins his term
              with the US in an economic crisis and two wars, he knows he needs to
              kick start his presidency with a soaring rhetoric that both moves and
              motivates the American people.</p>
              <p>The tone of the speech could be
              decisive in determining how the public responds to his first 100 days,
              as Franklin Roosevelt's famous line "the only thing we have to fear is
              fear itself" helped to determine his.</p>
              <p>Obama aides have let it be
              known that a key theme will be restoring responsibility - both in terms
              of accountability in Washington and the responsibility of ordinary
              people to get involved. Rahm Emanuel, Obama's chief of staff, talks of
              a "culture of responsibility" that would "not just be asked of the
              American people; its leaders must also lead by example."</p>
              <p>In
              composing the high notes of the speech, Obama has leant on Favreau,
              whom he discovered almost by chance four years ago when the younger man
              was working on John Kerry's failed presidential bid. "Favs" has since
              studied Obama's speech patterns and cadences with the intensity of a
              stalker. He memorised the 2004 speech to the Democratic national
              convention which first brought Obama into the limelight. He is said to
              carry Obama's autobiography, Dreams From My Father, wherever he goes.
              As a result, last November when Favreau sat down to write the first
              draft of the inaugural address, he could conjure up his master's voice
              as if an accomplished impersonator.</p>
              <p>That skill had been put to
              almost daily use in the 18 months of brutal campaigning on the
              presidential trail. Favreau would be up most nights until 3am, honing
              the next day's stump speeches in a caffeine haze of espressos and Red
              Bull energy drinks, taking breaks to play the video game Rock Band. He
              coined a phrase for this late-night deadline surfing: "crashing".</p>
              <p>He
              crashed his way through all Obama's most memorable speeches. He wrote
              the draft of one that helped to turn Iowa for Obama while closeted in a
              coffee shop in Des Moines. For the presidential election, he wrote two
              speeches: one for a victory, one for defeat. When the result came
              through, he emailed his best friend: "Dude, we won. Oh my God."</p>
              <p>The
              tension between such youthful outbursts and his onerous role has
              sometimes cost the 27-year-old. In December, pictures of him and a
              friend mocking a cardboard cut-out of Hillary Clinton at a party,
              Favreau's hand on her breast, were posted on Facebook to his huge
              embarrassment.</p>
              <p>Obama is an accomplished writer in his own right,
              and the process of drafting with his mind reader is collaborative. The
              inaugural speech has shuttled between them four or five times,
              following an initial hour-long meeting in which the president-elect
              spoke about his vision for the address, and Favreau took notes on his
              computer.</p>
              <p>Favreau then went away and spent weeks on research. His
              team interviewed historians and speech writers, studied periods of
              crisis, and listened to past inaugural orations. When ready, he took up
              residence in Starbucks in Washington and wrote the first draft. The end
              result will be uttered on the steps of the Capitol.</p>
              <p>Obama's mind reader has crashed his way through yet another deadline.</p>
