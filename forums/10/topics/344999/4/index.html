              <p>When Barack Obama steps up to the podium to deliver his
              inaugural address, one man standing anonymously in the crowd will
              be paying especially close attention. With his cropped hair, five
              o'clock shadow and boyish face, he might look out of place among
              the dignitaries, though as co-author of the speech this man has
              more claim than most to be a witness to this moment of history.</p>
              <p>Jon Favreau, 27, is, as Obama himself puts it, the president's
              mind reader. He is the youngest chief speechwriter on record in the
              White House, and, despite such youth, was at the centre of
              discussions of the content of today's speech, one which has so much
              riding on it.</p>
              <p>For a politician whose rise to prominence was largely built upon
              his powers as an orator, Obama is well versed in the arts of
              speech-making. But today's effort will tower over all previous
              ones.</p>
              <p>It is not just that Obama has set an extremely high bar by
              invoking the inaugural speeches of Abraham Lincoln as his
              inspiration - admitting to feeling "intimidated" when he read them.
              It is also that, as he begins his term with the US in an economic
              crisis and two wars, he knows he needs to kick start his presidency
              with a soaring rhetoric that both moves and motivates the American
              people.</p>
              <p>The tone of the speech could be decisive in determining how the
              public responds to his first 100 days, as Franklin Roosevelt's
              famous line "the only thing we have to fear is fear itself" helped
              to determine his.</p>
              <p>Obama aides have let it be known that a key theme will be
              restoring responsibility - both in terms of accountability in
              Washington and the responsibility of ordinary people to get
              involved. Rahm Emanuel, Obama's chief of staff, talks of a "culture
              of responsibility" that would "not just be asked of the American
              people; its leaders must also lead by example."</p>
              <p>In composing the high notes of the speech, Obama has leant on
              Favreau, whom he discovered almost by chance four years ago when
              the younger man was working on John Kerry's failed presidential
              bid. "Favs" has since studied Obama's speech patterns and cadences
              with the intensity of a stalker. He memorised the 2004 speech to
              the Democratic national convention which first brought Obama into
              the limelight. He is said to carry Obama's autobiography, Dreams
              From My Father, wherever he goes. As a result, last November when
              Favreau sat down to write the first draft of the inaugural address,
              he could conjure up his master's voice as if an accomplished
              impersonator.</p>
              <p>That skill had been put to almost daily use in the 18 months of
              brutal campaigning on the presidential trail. Favreau would be up
              most nights until 3am, honing the next day's stump speeches in a
              caffeine haze of espressos and Red Bull energy drinks, taking
              breaks to play the video game Rock Band. He coined a phrase for
              this late-night deadline surfing: "crashing".</p>
              <p>He crashed his way through all Obama's most memorable speeches.
              He wrote the draft of one that helped to turn Iowa for Obama while
              closeted in a coffee shop in Des Moines. For the presidential
              election, he wrote two speeches: one for a victory, one for defeat.
              When the result came through, he emailed his best friend: "Dude, we
              won. Oh my God."</p>
              <p>The tension between such youthful outbursts and his onerous role
              has sometimes cost the 27-year-old. In December, pictures of him
              and a friend mocking a cardboard cut-out of Hillary Clinton at a
              party, Favreau's hand on her breast, were posted on Facebook to his
              huge embarrassment.</p>
              <p>Obama is an accomplished writer in his own right, and the
              process of drafting with his mind reader is collaborative. The
              inaugural speech has shuttled between them four or five times,
              following an initial hour-long meeting in which the president-elect
              spoke about his vision for the address, and Favreau took notes on
              his computer.</p>
              <p>Favreau then went away and spent weeks on research. His team
              interviewed historians and speech writers, studied periods of
              crisis, and listened to past inaugural orations. When ready, he
              took up residence in Starbucks in Washington and wrote the first
              draft. The end result will be uttered on the steps of the
              Capitol.</p>
              <p>Obama's mind reader has crashed his way through yet another
              deadline.</p>

              <p>The old jia liao bee should also take note that his son was only 49 years old when he was "coronated" in 2001. Obama was 48 y.o. when he took office afew days ago.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Seems like Greater Mortals don't use the same yardstick to measure themselves with. Greater Mortal's son 48 y.o. will have the necessary experience to run Singapore, while Lesser Mortals like Barack Obama won't. I would think the Kim il-Sung had the same thinking when he died and handed the reins of power to his son Kim Jong-il.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you compare the two in wikipedia, Obama's credentials more than exceed LHL's by leaps and bounds. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>The old jia liao bee should also take note that his son was only 49 years old when he was "coronated" in 2001. Obama was 48 y.o. when he took office afew days ago.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Seems like Greater Mortals don't use the same yardstick to measure themselves with. Greater Mortal's son 48 y.o. will have the necessary experience to run Singapore, while Lesser Mortals like Barack Obama won't. I would think the Kim il-Sung had the same thinking when he died and handed the reins of power to his son Kim Jong-il.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you compare the two in wikipedia, Obama's credentials more than exceed LHL's by leaps and bounds. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p><br>True.   lhl has no political experience to enter politics, so what is the fuss from old evil dictator about obama lack of experience.   From BG jumped to PM, ridiculous!    It is "magic" from old dictator that this materialised.</p>
