              <p><span class="update"><span>SINGAPORE: An airport security lapse has raised further concerns about complacency and what has been done to strengthen procedures. <br><br>The passport mix-up - which allowed a man to fly out of the country using his son's passport – is the third security breach in six months. <br><br>Mr Ang Heng Soon managed to check in for a Tiger Airways flight after mistakenly using his son's passport. <br><br>The mistake was not spotted in spite of four levels of checks, enabling him to board his flight to Vietnam. He came back later after spotting his own error. <br><br>"This is yet another incident of human error, but it's within the same home team, and we've seen a build-up of various incidents within various departments and this is troubling," MP Indranee Rajah said. <br><br>"It's really two things, as I see it - one, the complacency that has entered into the day-to-day routine. And two, the sense of a lack of danger that if something can go wrong, it will," she added. <br><br>The MP intends to raise this and other wider security concerns in Parliament. <br><br>"If incidents like this continue, then it sends a signal that there are chinks and loopholes that can be exploited, and it would serve as an encouragement to people who want to test our security," she pointed out. <br><br>Law lecturer Mahdev Mohan at the Singapore Management University agreed. He added that while there cannot be a perfect system, officers need to be very aware of the wider implications of such human errors. <br><br>"To some degree, I think we need a transparent system of accountability where either an independent body is tasked purely - and by independent body, I mean persons outside the home team - into looking at procedures and seeing possibilities of slip-ups and perhaps even testing the system from time to time to see what are the loopholes in the system. <br><br>"And if the reports of this were made publicly available, there would be a level of scrutiny that would come to bear." <br><br>While investigations are ongoing, Home Affairs Minister Wong Kan Seng said scrutiny and supervision on the ground is being tightened. - CNA/ac <br><br></span></span>

              <p>Altho blames can always be conveniently pushed to the 'operators' like this case the security man,  what the people need and want is security.</p>
              <p>The people don't really care which 'operator' is not doing his job properly as much as is security up to scratch.</p>
              <p>The job of ensuring operators do the job properly lies in the supervisors.</p>
              <p>If security lapse, it means the supervisor did not ensure his operators do their job.</p>
              <p>The supervisor's existence is primarily to ensure the operators do their job.</p>
              <p>Securing per se is done by the operator. But national security cannot be viewed in the same way. Its more than just the responsibility of an operator who is the one actually doing the job. The responsibility must go up the chain of command.</p>
              <p>For instance, since the supervisor is tasked to ensure operation is proper, what if this supervisor is a cork up or low performer?</p>
              <p>In this case, the responsibility lies in the supervisor of the supervisor.</p>
              <p>Based on commonsense , its not difficult to extrapolate this logic to derive at who is ultimately responsible.</p>
              <p>An operator simply does the securing based on policies set up there. If the policy is flawed, it will cascade down the effect to the operation.</p>
              <p>Responsibility always goes up.</p>
              <p>In china middleages, the king is never wrong. Thus, I exclude this scenario.</p>
              <p>The commindor-in-chef should be responsible for the Directivity of Operations.</p>
              <p>The directivity of operations should ensure that the super supervisor is supervising his operator and ensuring his operators are in a operationally-ready state.</p>
              <p>The buck stops at the top.</p>
              <p>Else, next better player.</p>
              <p>No one owes no one nothing when he is paid and fully and overcompensated.</p>

              <p>Any security lapses, the lower level staff are to go while ministers continue to be scott free, shake legs and enjoy drawing their million dollar salary.    Good life to be ministers here.  Anyone want to join PAP and draw million dollar salary?</p>
              <p>Even a CEO makes mistakes, he is asked to leave.   If the ruling party continues to behave such there is no gurantee that there is not going to be corrupt free.</p>

              <p>A good system deserving of a hundred thousand dollar paid Minister (isn't there more to expect from one which draws multi million), is one which has numerous checks and balances to counter the possibility of human error.</p>
              <p>Extra caning by the courts, Mas escape from Whitley, 2 accused escaping from courts, Ah Hao's escape to Malaysia, Richard of NKF escaping to Hong Kong, ganster gunman escape to Malaysia after murder, etc.</p>

              <p>... this is fast becoming common; security lapses..</p>
              <p>.. but hey, although the 'Security System' they have in place is WORLD CLASS, it guarantee that there will be no lapses &amp; we must all accept this an 'move on'... cannot fault anyone, otherwise it will be unbecoming for our ministers to work in fear of being liable for any mistakes or lapses due to complacency...  </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>... don't worry, they are already hard at training the home team on how to expediently recapture any escapees, and limping terrorists... do not fear, they are World Class... we should all be proud...</p>
