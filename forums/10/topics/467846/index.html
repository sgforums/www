              <p>Unless they continue to stay in their HDB unit despite owning private properties, if not it makes good sense for them to release their HDB (public) back for those who really need it.</p>
              <p>It is fine if they purchase private property for investment purpose but not way should authorities allow owners to rent out the whole HDB unit to make MONEY!</p>
              <p><span class="content-area-content">

              <p>I READ with interest the report ("Khaw shares ideas to lower 
              prices of HDB flats"; Monday), which said that about 40,000 entire HDB 
              flats are being sublet, and that up to another 40,000 owners rent out 
              rooms.</p>
              <p>These are just the official figures. The real number is likely to be 
              higher as I know of people who do not seek permission from the HDB to 
              rent out their flats.</p>
              <p>Recently, my mother-in-law wanted to buy an HDB flat near my home, to
               help with our childcare arrangements. However, there was no one willing
               to sell but several wanting to rent out their entire flats.</p>
              <p>I called an agent of such a flat and asked if the owner would 
              consider selling, but she said the owner was living in a private 
              condominium unit and wanted only to rent out the flat to make money.</p>
              <p>There are some HDB flat owners who have emigrated, but still hold on to their units to earn rental income.</p>
              <p>This reduces supply and drives up prices.</p>
              <p>HDB flats are primarily for owner occupation and are not investment assets.</p>
              <p>The Ministry of National Development should consider disallowing the 
              renting out of flats, and tighten policing and supervision. It should 
              also review its policy of allowing people who own private property to 
              retain their HDB flats.</p>

              To ahtansh.
              
              This what I have written within this sg forum. I see HDB as a public housing for all Singaporeans, rich or poor. The HDB market should be separated totally from private property market. And the banks shouldn't be allow to give loan base on HDB flat as collateral. In the past, I think in 1997 or 1998, during the global monetary crisis, when I read in the ST that HDB flats were allowed to be used as collateral for bank loans, I saw many Singaporeans were going to be homeless and bankrupt. And I also saw that either the HDB or the banks in Singapore would be bankrupt during the 1997 global monetary crisis if the HDB flats were disallowed from being passed as collateral for bank loans. It was intended to save Singapore banks from collapsing I supposed.
              
              The only way to bring down the HDB flat prices is to disallow HDB flat owners from using their HDB flats as collateral for bank loans to purchase new flats or buying private property, like in the past since HDB is a public housing scheme from the government and subsidize by the government. This HDB flat prices increases in the late 90s when the government allowed the banks to give loans to the HDB flat owners and using the HDB flat as collateral. HDB should go back to the basic again whereby they provide HDB loans to Singaporeans regardless whether they are first or second or third timeâ€¦HDB flat buyers in the open market. This system would protect the HDB owners from creditors should they go bankrupt. I believe this too would actually bring down the private property market tremendously and reduces the numbers of bankrupt Singaporeans due to investment in the private property market or HDB resale market.
              
              Because of letting HDB flats to be use as collaterals and letting the banks to manipulate the property market in Singapore, many Singaporean families were homeless. Remember that HDB flats is only meant for Singaporeans and Singaporeans should refrain and be protected from the influence of buying and selling trends in the HDB resale market for fast profits gainâ€¦.ended up many too became homeless.

              Totally agree, I also believe that HDB should decouple with private property.  Owner of private property should not be allow to own HDB, and similar PR who tend to leave SG for good and instead just rent out the HDB should not allow to own it too.  Of course, the policy can be adjust like giving an ample time for the private property owner some time to sell their flat or property.
