            <div class='col-md body'><p>Good or bad got to depends on the terms and conditions signed by them.<br>For example, how much US pay singapore on the leasing of the land and use of facilities, or worse Singapore need to pay US for borrowing their army.Also whether the US army need to abide by the law. You know in Okinawa, the US army many times involved in raping case.<br>Last is if the US army base in singapore is allowed to attack nearby country or any vessel sailing across the malacca strait. If this is allowed, then Singapore will become a warfield very easily when conflict happen. When war happen in singapore, we all no need to work tomorrow already.<br><br>If US manage to convince singapore as a way to control the oil transportation in malacca strait, then very soon we will see a lot of investors suddendly show interest in building the Kra canal in thailand.

              <p>What do you think that by providing US armed forces with facilities here we have become a "US military outpost"? Singapore is not like Thailand during Vietnam war. Right now we have a camp in Sayok, so is Thailand now " a military outpost" of Singapore?</p>

              <p>Go to america today and you will still find people there who think Singapore is part of China, or part of India if you show them pictures of little India.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>

              <p>There was a 'Thaification' policy around 40-50 years ago, initiated by a military dictatorship to assimilate all ethnic groups including Chinese, Muslim of Malay descent, Vietnamese, Khmer, Laotian, tribal minorities, into the mainstream Central Thailand culture. There are good and bad. It unites all ethnic groups to live together peacefully in general. The bad thing is each ethnic culture was lost along the assimilation process.</p>
              <p>In the same period, teaching Mandarin and other Chinese dialects in school was banned as the government feared communist infiltration from China. Until recently that the Thai Government woke up to the fact that Thailand lacks behind Singapore and Malaysia when it comes to taking advantage over trade and investment with China. Many Thai companies, mostly belonging to ethnic Chinese, found it inevitable to hire Singaporeans, Hong Kongers, Malaysians, and Taiwanese to work for them in the Mainland. Almost all ethnic Chinese in Thailand have lost contact with the Mainlanders. I am one of the not so many 3rd generation Chinese in Thailand who can share something, though not much, in common with our brothers and sisters in other parts of the world.</p>

              is not like Thailand during Vietnam war. Right now we have a

              <p>You make a wrong accusation against Singapore and you want to
              ask what is our main objective? as a Thai, you ought to be ashamed

              <p>sgdiehard, don't rush to the conclusion that I disrespect Singapore. I have never denied the fact that Thailand is also a US and also Singaporean military outposts in this region.</p>
              <p><em>You said: Why do you think we need the US to "protect the island state
              from neighbouring Malaysia and Indonesia"? </em></p>
              <p>Well, geographically Singapore is a resourceless island, surrounded by bigger countries like Malaysia and Indonesia who do not share common ethnicity and culture with Singapore. Singapore even depends on fresh water supply from Malaysia although your government has attempted to implement some sort of water reclamation technology. Let alone food supplies. Put it differently Singapore needs to seek security.</p>

              <p>Well, wasn't Singapore the first SE Asian nation to support 'War on Terror' campaign? I still remember broadly Donald Rumsfeld visiting Singapore and giving speech in a security conference. He cited indirectly about the need for the US to station in the region as part of 'War on Terror' and to counterweight some sort of 'growing threat'. That growing threat couldn't be anybody else but China. And if you look at the map of East Asia, you would find a big picture that the US has built either military bases or allies that it sells arms to around China. Bases in Japan and South Korea. Constant arm sales to Taiwan. Attempt to court Vietnam to open a port. Attempt to bring independent-minded India away from Russia. Then there are non-NATO allies like the Philippines, Thailand, Singapore and Australia.</p>

              <p>What is your definition of "military outpost" ? Singapore's military camp in Thailand is primary a training camp, SAF does not operate from there for any other operations. So that is not a "military outpost". Neither is the US naval facilities in Singapore.</p>

              <p>Yes, Singapore wants peace and security, but that does not mean we need the US to give us that security. You Thai may need to count on the US to protect you from the Burmese or the vietnamese, but Singapore is quite capable of protecting ourselves against invading forces for a period of time. We have still have defence pact with other 4 nations, our friendly foreign relationships with neighbours and friends far and wide serve us well. We don't need the US as our "protector", not until there is a WW3. So keep your assumption to yourselves.</p>

              <p>Is War on Terror a war against China? Why do you say that <strong>That growing threat couldn't be anybody else but China. </strong>Now that is your assumption if you feel that China is threatening Thailand. American can feel the threat of China, they ought to. But to Singapore, China is not a threat, but a balancing power among the rising power in the whole region, besides the traditional regional power such as the US, Australia, Japan, and north korea, there are India, Vietnam and China. We do not consider any of these a threat to Singapore.</p>
              <p>Philippines and Thailand are the US allies, HOW? you are out of date.</p>
