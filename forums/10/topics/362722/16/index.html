              <p>Yes. I was on scholarship to study in Nanyang university by some chinese organization. That is why I always remember my roots and also, I am grateful to Singapore for breeding me into what I am.</p>
              <p>I do understand the hardship etc,  but we must view things with an open heart. I am not trying to say we should let FTs to flood in and make us all jobless. I am trying to say, lets be more objective.</p>
              <p>That is all I have to say. I cant keep up with this forum because my old eyes cant stare at computers for extended period of time. Not that I lack any fighting spirit or whatever. If Terminator was to define spending time arguing in this forum as "fighting spirit" , then I really lack his kind of fighting spirit.</p>

              <p><br>To say the truth, you belong to the minority of FTs who come to Singapore. Most FTs come to Singapore to earn money due to the better pay and nothing else. Greed is indeed one of the strongest incentives in the human mind.</p>

              <p>Well, I think it would be great if they were to merge. But, first of all you have some 60% of Bumi to be convinced and a more efficient and transparent government than PAP.</p>
              <p>Malaysia has lagged behind for too long a time due to inefficient government that runs on racial ground. If a merger is to be possible, BN has to be removed.</p>

              <p>Chances can be re-created. We must ensure our future chinese decendents to be well educated in order to compete.
