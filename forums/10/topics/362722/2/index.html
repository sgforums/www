              <p>I agreed with you. The local employers have a social responsbility to hire the local and not just looking at the bottom line.</p>
              <p>Moreover, these so called " foreign talents" are not here to contribute but to learn the trade and used Singapore as a stepping stone to a better paid job elsewhere.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is time for us the true Singaporean to show our displeasure to the highly paid clowns in the government to stop issuing work permits and penalise the greedy employers.</p>

              <p>Given a 2.0 millions local workforce and 1.0 million foreign workforce, we got a total of 3.0 millions people working here, the rest are our mothers, old peoples, students or early retirees or people who just dun work like me.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There is an obligation set by MOM on each individual industrial on employment policy, that is 3 to 1, or, 4 to 1, or, 5 is to 1, depending on your industrial, eg, for my case, i can only employ 3 foreigner if I employed 1 singaporeans, others like construction or shipyards, they can go as high as 5 foreigner is to 1 singaporean.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Therefore, companies still need to employ local before they can employ foreigners unless you are doing labour supply business.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So dun anyhow think that employer can suka suka employ all foreigners hor. Govt not stupid hor, if they allow employers to employ all foreigner, sure the whole singapore people would protest and chase them out.</p>

              <p><br>What choice do we have, with no doubt, Govt also understand the implication of foreigners here, do you think they really like it?? They know it will degenerate their popularity and hurt their election percentage, if possible and best, they still prefer Singaporeans, the more the merrier. However, govt cannot alway be a nanny or an old grandma nagging her childrens to give marry and give birth to many childrens. It is all up to individual, as LHL had said in his ND rally, we can change many policies to suit the environment and economy of these country, but one thing that we cannot really push on is birthrate. If peoples dun want to get marry and give birth to childrens, what can we do?? How are we going to uphold this fast and furious economy we adopted with just a million workforce alone??? Given the other millions getting old and retired.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So, be like me, just think that foreigners are here to help us get job, and you will be more happier and life goes on.</p>

              <p><br> What choice do we have, with no doubt, Govt also understand the

              They know it will degenerate their popularity and hurt their
              election percentage, if possible and best, they still prefer
              Singaporeans, the more the merrier. However, govt cannot alway be a
              nanny or an old grandma nagging her childrens to give marry and
              give birth to many childrens. It is all up to individual, as LHL
              had said in his ND rally, we can change many policies to suit the
              environment and economy of these country, but one thing that we
              cannot really push on is birthrate. If peoples dun want to get
              marry and give birth to childrens, what can we do?? How are we
              going to uphold this fast and furious economy we adopted with just
              a million workforce alone??? Given the other millions getting old
              and retired.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So, be like me, just think that foreigners are here to help us
