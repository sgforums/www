              <p><br>social integration will only lead to better understanding between cultures. Nothing enforced, but block parties would help break the ice, and issues can be amicably resolved, such as mundane issues of spitting, urinating on lifts, talking loudly, etc, etc.</p>
              <p>It would also  open up our eyes and ears to an aspect on how they live in their own country, which even we when we tour their country, do not get to see or understand. It would help our next generation, the building of knowledge upon the previous.</p>
              <p>To not integrate would only lead to further misunderstandings and unnecessary fears. Making money is one thing. But if the conducive environment of cooperation is not there, there is no money to make, except for fighting each other, something that would make Uncle Chia sexually wet his pants and drool in his mouth.</p>

              <p><br>This Viet girl abit different from the rest of the Viets. Not like the ones you see in Joo Chiat. She plays office politics with me as if this is in NYC. She has some Singaporean friends but so what? Still she is a refugee from her hometown city. She does not like it there and yet want to come here and boss people around. She almost wanted to join our local youth groups as well. It sounds as if a Chinese in USA joins the KKK.</p>

              <p>The FT does not include the expats from North America, Europe and Northeast Asia.</p>
              <p>The FT only includes mainly those from other ASEAN countries.</p>
              <p>Rich so what? Come from the big cities, like Hanoi and Yangon, so what? Come here still a refugee what.</p>
              <p>You know, I really admire some Burmese I saw before who came here and become happy-go-lucky souls or humble ones working away from their slain homeland. They may integrate with us but they don't ever dare to look down on us locals.</p>
              <p>It really pains me to see anyone from these ASEAN nations coming here acting like their daddies are rich here and can't care less attitudes. I don't quite mind if they are from our forefathers' lands but not from the other third world countries in ASEAN.</p>

              <p>Ok, I guess we are now moving onto another aspect of the FT/FW issue. I hope the economic situation is resolved with agreement for the need of them and the balancing between commerce and society with fine tuning, for the problem you see now is the social impact.</p>
              <p>At least it is not as difficult as the economic issue. Isnt then all the more MP Charles Chong's concept of integration a solution to the enclaves or clique problem? All the more our society should support and encourage such efforts and adopt it throughout the island?</p>
              <p>While our land is small, the sky is infinite and we could always build upwards to accomodate much more. These foreigners and every local have a job and would pay for their keep, and not a drain to our society's efforts.</p>
              <p>We are all humans after all, black or white. Who is the local, who is the foreigner? The only identity we really need is for us all to work towards our personal as well as national aspirations.</p>
              <p>Singaporean citizens are treasured above foreigners, but within limits as no one should be elevated higher than society in our equal republic. Therein lies the greatness of our nation, if we succeed.</p>

              <p>I believe you only speak for yourself and your clique. There are more whom are inquisitive about us, as they attempt to live on our island for longer than the social visit pass would allow, on work permits or PR/citizenship. Such is the nature of human beings.</p>
              <p>In place of an environment where such openess are not offered, it will only allow misunderstanding and wild presumptions to fester.</p>
              <p>Thus, integration is necessary, being the host. It takes 2 to clap, and yours and our  participation and patience is necessary. It may be dream, but that 1st step must be made, and had already been made by MP Chong.</p>
              <p>Everyone know what are the problems, but if we do not take steps to resolve it, unnecessary pain will only follow. I appeal to everyone's good sense, to make that critical 1st step, with patience. We all have more to gain than to loose.</p>

              <p>i talk alot about integration, but i want to what you propose exactly, the major population of foriegner come from china, how you wanna integrate them into singapore, if they come at a early age, it's easy to integrate, but what i saw is most of the chinese student, even they come here at age 17 , they still inclined to stick with chinese.</p>
              <p>there is a long way to pave to integrate them in singapore, but since it's a long way, it's unpredictable, anything could happen, if the economy continuous drop. Leave them with no choice, then they have to go back to china,</p>
              <p>i don't what exactly the chinese population consist of , some of them are scholar, however how many percent, some of them are under working permit,</p>
              <p>i think if the chinese come here , mainly from canton or fujian, then the integration task is easier, but you know china is a big place, even within china, the people from different region, act different, so i really want to what exactly you propose to change them to be same with locals.</p>

              <p>The current China immigrant don't speak a word of English in the US.

              <p>US is different, it's the most democratic country in the world, and people go to US seeking american dream, it's freedom, and the loyalty of the american system bond them, US first is colony of British, then after years pass by, the immigration in US feel they are different with british, because they have a great extent of autonomy,</p>
              <p>And the interest between immirgration in US and british seperated,</p>
              <p>So US is the most advanced society in the world. US accept and assimiliate any people go to the country, and they become american,</p>
              <p>but the chinese society in US, is special case, the caucasian still treat them like forienger, because they act differently.</p>
