              <p>"the Indonesia's pogrom in 1998" is a bad example. No country in
                  Asia was spared the asian financial crisis. Rupiah, Baht, RM,
                  S$...all devalued, prices got up, business collapsed. Mahathir
                  blamed it on George Soros; with the help of IMF, the Indonesian
                  brought down Suharto, but before that indonesian chinese were taken
                  as scapegoat, as usual. But really, what was the problem?</p>
              <p>You can blame the government of the influx of foreign workers
                  from specific sources, but it is the local businessmen who apply
                  and employ the foreigners.</p>
              <p>"but if push comes to shove.. " do you think singaporean
                  can take on 1 million foreign construction workers,
                  maids, factory workers...like the "Indonesia's pogrom in 1998"? we
                  will still have to depend on the government to send in the police
                  and the army...I really hope this won't happen.</p>
              <p>it is our family and property that will become collacteral
                  damage...but unless if you have already migrated....</p>

              <p>I don't blame the local businessmen.. they are just opportunists.</p>
              <p>But the govmen are the one who legislate the country.</p>
              <p>If the people do not stand up against the tide, it is their own children and their future that will be collateral damage to such govmen neglect.</p>
              <p>You as the foreigner who has invested much in Singapore.. should also stand up and prevent another tragedy from happening.</p>
              <p>Do not underestimate the power of the people.. many ruling power made this same mistakes when it becomes too arrogant.</p>
              <p> Send in the army ? Who do you think are the people who form the army and police ? They are Singaporeans. Do you really believe they are merely robots ? Do you really believe they do not feel the pain and desperation of their fellow Singaporeans ?</p>
              <p>I see, you expect the govmen to protect you and your vested assets. Think again. Can they really protect you ?</p>

              <p>At times, it can be therupatic to blame the govt. Just push all blame to our elected representatives, so easy, and when the solution is yet to come, blame them further to alleviate our misery.</p>
              <p>But the truth is, if we want solutions, we must find out where the problems lay first, without any fear or favour.</p>
              <p>The history of foreigner workforce came as early as the 60s when malaysians came to our shores seeking work in our industries as we expanded beyond cottage industries. As it gathered pace, demand for workers in those industries shot up, and attracted much of our more educated youths in managerial capacities, with further success in our education policies.</p>
              <p>SMEs found themselves unattractive as employers as their salaries were low and often not enough to pay even for mortgages by the workers. Employers cried that citizens were choosy and did not want their employment, even though the truth was that the salaries were low to gain more profit selfishly.</p>
              <p>Look at the queues for condos, bungalows, and IPOs. Look at the niteclubs where $20k blown a night and not a problem. There were made up of local bosses.Yet they appeal to the govt for more workers, and the birth of cheap foriegn workers aroused.</p>
              <p>Our govt practices a hands off approach to private enterprises, as all democratic govts do. It will legislate, and fine tune policies, but at the end of the day, it is still the bosses who determines the direction or misdirection where their companies go.</p>
              <p>Some bosses are gentlemen, but some others not. Bosses from hell are common, look at the low salaries and compare the products we pay today. The disparity is obvious, even with cheap foreign labour. Who is actually gaining?</p>
              <p>How many of the bosses are acutually using phantom ICs to hire more cheap foriegn labour? One boss who hires 10 cheap labour, translated into 60,000 bosses would mean 600,000 foreign workers here compete with locals. Who is to be blamed when bosses is twisting information?</p>
              <p>There is nothing wrong with profits. But when such profits are extracted at a social cost that our society finds it hard to accept, struggling to survive, then bosses best wake up, grow up, manage their company to international standards and not with peasant coolie mentality that they grew up with, and do a rethink on their management policy.</p>

              <p>Are you recommending govt interference in private enterprise? The entire govt arm of 80,000 bureacracy to check on the hundred thousands of companies operating in Singapore?</p>
              <p>Govt action or enforcement alone is not enough. <strong>What is society if its commercial leaders are selfish and only self profit driven at all cost, even to society at large? This is a bigger issue that must be addressed!</strong></p>

When the shoes companies like Nike went to Indonesia, lured over 7000 people out of the countryside and villages, gave them good income (better than farming) making shoes. 2 years later, labor costs at vietnam were cheaper so they moved everything to Vietnam, leaving the thousands of people jobless and their farmland deserted...blame the indonesian government?  </p>
              <p>It is easy for those electronic companies to recruit cheap labour from malaysia, because when they don't want them, they just picking them up from JB. they just stop sponsoring the FT and send them back home. They don't want to shoulder any social responsibility!!</p>
              <p>Many MNC also bring in their own useless countrymen so that their headoffice don't have to take care of these dead wood anymore.</p>

              <p>The businessmen has great social responsibility to the people
                  who work for them, to the society they are working in, to the
                  environment as a whole.</p>
              <p>Glad you say they are opportunists. Opportunists are whose
                  expense? When the shoes companies like Nike went to Indonesia,
                  lured over 7000 people out of the countryside and
                  villages, gave them good income (better than
                  farming) making shoes. 2 years later, labor costs at
                  vietnam were cheaper so they moved everything to Vietnam,
                  leaving the thousands of people jobless and their farmland
                  deserted...blame the indonesian government?  </p>
              <p>It is easy for those electronic companies to recruit cheap
                  labour from malaysia, because when they don't want them, they just
                  picking them up from JB. they just stop sponsoring the FT and send
                  them back home. They don't want to shoulder any social
                  responsibility!!</p>
              <p>Many MNC also bring in their own useless countrymen so that
                  their headoffice don't have to take care of these dead
                  wood anymore.</p>
              <p>the problem is, how do you blame the MNC? somebody has to take
                  the blame, better blame the government.</p>

              <p>When the MNCs set up shop in Indonesia.. do they not pay taxes to the local govmen ? </p>
              <p>Is it not the part of the local govmen to initiate support and placement so their own people do not suffer after the MNC leave,  using the resources they accumlated during boom time?  Is it not the part of the gov to plan for times when the MNC will leave ?</p>
              <p>If all these while.. the govmen had been sitting pretty on their laurels.. thinking heaven will never leave them.. then they are nothing but a bunch of useless blood suckers. And yes they need to take the blame and make good their promise to her people.</p>

              <p>i think XTREYIER, we need to find out the reason, why local is hostile to FT, is it because they take over their job, or simply because FT behave differently, singapore is not a tolerant socient, hope you will not take it as an offend,</p>
              <p>and  i think the primary reason that local don't welcome FT, is because culture shock,</p>
              <p>because the mass of FT is huge, local society don't have enough power to assimiliate in, so still most of  china chinese stick with china chinese, india indian stick with india indian, that cause alot of fraction.</p>
              <p>When the immigrant migrate to US, they going for American dream, and the dream unite them, but in singapore, there is no such thing to assimiliate FT to local lifes.</p>
              <p>When they wake up, they go to work, with indian, malay, but when work off, they stick to different ethnicities.</p>
              <p>The government's fault is they should not import so many FT in the first place, in such situation, hardly an national indentity could be formed, and they walking on the street , saw so many FT, they don't know they are in singapore or in other country.</p>
