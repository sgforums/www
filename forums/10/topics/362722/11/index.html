              <p>...and you think you can? With your bombast and silly extreme views? You are what you write, a joke, a wastrel of our forefathers expenditure on education and someone that cannot be taken seriously.</p>
              <p>Is this gonna be another schoolyard challenge of whose penis is bigger or longer, replaced instead by citizenship? I certainly will not stoop to your level of schoolyard brawl. Grow up, sonny.</p>
              <p>-----------</p>
              <p>To MissZ.</p>
              <p>I had already mentioned in previous post on this thread, on how cheating bosses could hire a bangla truck driver at $1.8k a month yesterday with existing work contracts and profit long calculated,and yet today pay $1.3k for a local driver.</p>
              <p>This are clear-cut abuses by local bosses to profit from our misery, who had denied their social obligations in the name of earning bigger profits, and for what? - to drive a bigger continental car? A bigger apartment for their mistresses? Longer holidays abroad? And then push the blame to locals, foriegners and elected representatives?</p>
              <p>Thus, if anyone here whose parents are bosses, I would plead with them to remind their parents of a social responsibility to our society, in these difficult times. Only by sharing what we have will we all pull through this crisis, if not, it will be ours and our future generations' doom. </p>

              <p>FYI. NYC will not have the same problem as Singapore.</p>
              <p>The visa and wage policy is already different.</p>
              <p>Companies are not allowed to hire foreign worker if a local can do it. The requirements are job specific.. NOT wage specific.</p>
              <p>Second.. they do have a minimum wage law that protects the lower income jobs from going to cheaper foreign labours  which depress wages (excludes agricultural industry)</p>
              <p>The only way to exploit foreign cheap labor is to shift the entire operation offshore.</p>
              <p>True.. Singaporeans are not all saints.. but do we really need more arrogant devils in this tiny island ? There wouldn't be so much gripe .. if the foreigners actually do try to behave themselves.</p>

              <p>I am glad you are more open now.</p>
              <p>Arrogance is only a perception. There is no way to stop anyone's display of boorish behaviour. It only shows their upbringing. Are we to fight every slight we see, the way gangsters do when you happen to stare at them a few seconds longer?</p>
              <p>No, let them be. Their behaviour will only be detrimental to themselves in their social and working life. Let them be. For every arrogant foriegner bastard including expats, talents and our own, there are more who are more civilised.</p>
              <p>Lets not generalised all FW/FTs or those from a specific country as being arrogant and then bash them all. That's like giving a dog a bad name and then hang him.</p>
              <p>If you want to delve deeper, arrogance is borne out of fear and insecurity. If you have the time, do reach out to them and find out the reason, allay their insecurity and any misunderstanding, and you would have solve a problem the gentleman's way.</p>
              <p>As mentioned, there is more to the FW/FT issue, and we all have to be patient and find solutions in every level of the employment field, hiding nothing and leaving no stone unturn, so that we can all live amicably together, with a common goal of personal and national aspirations to be achieved, instead of spreading hate and misunderstandings.</p>

              <p>"the Indonesia's pogrom in 1998" is a bad example. No country in Asia was spared the asian financial crisis. Rupiah, Baht, RM, S$...all devalued, prices got up, business collapsed. Mahathir blamed it on George Soros; with the help of IMF, the Indonesian brought down Suharto, but before that indonesian chinese were taken as scapegoat, as usual. But really, what was the problem?</p>
              <p>You can blame the government of the influx of foreign workers from specific sources, but it is the local businessmen who apply and employ the foreigners.</p>
              <p>"but if push comes to shove.. " do you think singaporean can take on 1 million foreign construction workers, maids, factory workers...like the "Indonesia's pogrom in 1998"? we will still have to depend on the government to send in the police and the army...I really hope this won't happen.</p>
              <p>it is our family and property that will become collacteral damage...but unless if you have already migrated....</p>
