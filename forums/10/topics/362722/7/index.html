              <p>You guys all get the wrong concept of we Sg gals, you think we are all money minded ar?? please lah, all successful men in Singapore stand a successful wife behind him, and all these men are from empty hands in poor stage to rich and famous stage, and all these while, it was the wife who take care of him, sacrificed the time, work to earn for the family, care for his childrens, give him sound advices etc etc...our local gals except me may not be so pretty and nice looking as PRC or any other countries ladies, but we got brain and care for our husband or bf and family. On the other hand, Sg Guys are also not as good looking as other countries men.</p>

              <p>What the garmen needs to do is to ensure that the so-called 'foreign talent' are really talents.</p>
              <p>There's no need to stop the influx of FT if they can do us good, but if we can do the job better than them, then Singaporeans can just take on the role of being a 'FT' (since they may be just as capable), so there's no need for them anymore! </p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>THis is just my <span style="text-decoration: underline;">personal</span> thoughts and observations.</p>
              <p>There are issues govts around the world will proclaim and say, as well as issues that out of diplomacy so as not to antagonise or hurt other nations, will not be said publically. Only the more rational will see the rationale behind some policies, reading between the lines.</p>
              <p>Singapore had struggled much and had come a long way since its founding in 1819, finally gaining independence in 1965. Post independence had since seen education  being the main priority of govt policy.</p>
              <p>Today we can boast of 98% literacy, with passes at 0 levels as a yardstick, and similar percentages at tertiary and universities level. With such achievements, it is only natural that citizens aspire towards better positions in employment, with better remuneration.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, we have no resources and is only a small island state, surrounded by richer resources neigbours, with cheap labour and properties in abundance. Thus it would be difficult for ANY govt to fulfill the citizen's aspirations in this small red dot.</p>
              <p>But our founding fathers were of talents, who had continually attempted and had accomplish making the impossible possible for everyone or at least the significant majority of the people.</p>
              <p>The <strong>gameplan</strong> is to achieve a high standard of living for the citizens. Supervisory or at the least technician positions for locals, earning above $2,000/mth for the educated. For the more educated, management positions in MNCs and local corporations earning higer salaries, with meritocracy for all levels to move up.</p>
              <p>Supporting these intelligent workforce will be the huge amount of foreign workers needed to support the corporate structures, (but not given our precious citizenship) to fill in the lower paying jobs, of which they would be gratified, for they are economic refugees.</p>
              <p>As this issue is still experimental, the FW/FT issue will need some further fine-tuning yet at ALL levels in the field of employment, so long as citizens will allow the time to do so, be rational, for the sake of our society and its next generations, instead of thinking or be misled into start using pitchforks.</p>
              <p>We need not go down on our knees to these FW/FT, nor should we downtrod them, for we and our peasant forefathers know what it is like to be downtrodden by colonials and brutual Japs. We can treat all equally with courtesy and courtesy will be returned. Those not returned, we can afford to ignore, as civilised beings do, that we are.</p>
              <p>Singapore has no resources for any entreprenuerial enterprise to flourish in this richer national neighbourhood anyway, so better to earn a secure salary, and learn from MNCs, whom had centuries of management skills.</p>
              <p>These foriegn Talent's forefathers were Kings, Barons, big bizmen with centuries old biz culture while our own forefathers who migrated here were only peasants. We do, in all honesty, still have alot to learn.</p>
              <p>We may not achieve entreprenuerial independance today, but within a couple more decades coupled with education and experience by our local talents - educated and the higher educated, we will conquer the world. We are no less productive, and are more ethical, than anyone else.</p>
              <p>Due to the current financial crisis, expected salaries had dropped, but nevertheless, it is only a matter of time before the world will recuperate using John Maynard Keynes recommendations, and go on the upswing again, along with our salaries.</p>
              <p>Thus if you are earning less than $1.500/mth for the educated today, regardless of any age group, it is high time to attend courses for upgrading, which the govt/our society's funds, had provided. It is part of the national gameplan to be elevated and not be left behind. It will be your loss.</p>
              <p>For the better educated, perhaps it would be wiser to get closer to the FTs and Foreign Entreprenuers and learn their skill, their connections, upgrade if necessary, and in time, take over them and lead our nation as an economic power in the world. Better than fighting or casting aspersions against them and more constructive for the sake of our society's survival.</p>
              <p>It is crucial everyone gets a job, no matter how small pay it is right now and survive. Don't be left out. The rest are working tirelessly daily to get out of the crisis and surge far far ahead. There is a quiet national gameplan in play.</p>

              <p>When the term "Foreign Talent" was first created, it was meant to be interpreted as those foreigners that have the "talent" in "high end skills and experience" that are not found amongst Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>Examples of such skills not found amongst Singaporeans then - would include such talents in international finance that require financial traders with the knowledge of trading in special financial instruments, as well as the legal minds with the expertise in crafting of the legal documents that are globally binding - all of which were intended to help achieve the PAP goal for Singapore to be a Financial Hub.</p>
              <p>Under a cloak of official silence, the growth of foreign talent seems to have pervaded and is no longer in the upper rarefied end of the exclusive world of high finance.</p>
              <p>Quietly, a silent revolution seem to have been started by the PAP.</p>
              <p>Silently, an influx of new migrants have been allowed into Singapore to take on jobs that would otherwise have been available to Singaporean school leavers.</p>
              <p>The realisation of this insidious invasion suddenly became obvious to Singaporeans when we begin to notice "foreign talents" coming into direct contact with us - the common folks - with greater frequency.</p>
              <p>This group of "foreign talents" no longer come from Europe or the USA, and are no longer the Caucasian Foreign Talents - with the highly skilled missing talent not found amongst Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>The silent invasion over the last five years have been the result of the easy entry of young citizens from Bangladesh, China, India, Malaysia, Myanmar and even South Korea - all being given PR status to occupy the middle and lower wage positions that surely would have been available to young Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>Some of these young foreigners have been in Singapore on Student Pass - to study in our Polytechnic and University, and upon graduation had applied for PR status to obtain employment.</p>
              <p>Walk into Changi Airport, one will encounter girls from China or Malaysia manning the airport check-in counters, or the service counters at the Airport Food Courts; while girls from Myanmar trained in Singapore Polytechnic or University are employed to supervise the Bangladeshi technicians who are employed to maintain the airport facilities; and with Indian engineers employed in the airport design office to crunch the engineering numbers.</p>
              <p>Walk into any Government Linked Companies, and an army of the same types of "foreign talent" can be found in the various positions classified at "low and middle" wage levels.</p>
              <p>The silent invasion is no longer unnoticeable as the numbers begin to grow, and foreign voices can be heard loudly, working in restaurants and food centers - coming into direct contact with Singaporeans in greater frequency.</p>
              <p>Should Singaporeans be alarmed at this sudden realisation ?</p>
              <p>Does the PAP have a more cynical agenda behind this cleverly disguised policy that was cunningly crafted and explained to Singaporeans at the beginning, and after five years we have now seen the real consequences of the "Foreign Talent" policy ?</p>

              <p><br>Oh! that means they are now attracting the wrong talents coming in, well, the hidden agenda is to increase the population, so as long as a foreigner is sexually productive, young, willing to be a citizen of Singapore, he/she is a talent. And the undermined motive is that all these FTs who become citizens of Singapore only know PAP and recognised PAP in helping them, therefore in the end, with the right to vote, PAP still holds the majority. All these is done because PAP has lost some faith in local singaporeans, all old old and talks alot.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Just imagine by increasing the population to 6 millions, with adult local singaporeans eligible to vote is about 2 millions, rest are like me, the young ones, not eligble,  and  with about 2 millions young adult foreigners turn singaporeans voting for them, already 50% is in their hands, even before talking about local singaporeans.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Politics is dirty hor, making political policy is more dirtier, so be clever hor, die die like it or not, they are coming, be it ah neh, or my taiwan high school cert, we are all FTs.</p>

              <p>UNLEASH YOUR FURY ON ME, AND STRIKE ME DOWN AS VIOLENT AS YOU CAN WITH YOUR BATS AND CUT ME UP FOR YOUR PURE ENJOYMENT, THEN FEAST UPON MY BLOOD TO QUENCH YOUR OWN THIRST AND DEVOURED UPON MY INNOCENT FLESH TO TAKE A STEP CLOSER TO BECOME WHO YOU BELIEVE YOU ARE.</p>
              <p>NOT MANY FORTUNATE PEOPLE OUT THERE CAN ACTUALLY CHOOSE HOW THEY ARE GOING TO DIE YOU KNOW? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
