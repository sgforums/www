              <p>You will succeed with the FT/FW issue as you did here, antagonising Sgnoob instead of reaching out for better understanding as civilised people do, stirring them up and then getting others pissed when a wrong word is said or misunderstood, amongst those who had lost their jobs or are bigots.</p>

              <p>Many people are critical of the agenda of globalisation.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Globalization is a word used today, often without precision.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>If we use the word globalization to refer to the entire process of IMF and WTO-led neo-colonialism under the Dollar System, then it is a descriptive term. It describes the creation of a global dollar imperium, a Pax Americana. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong></strong></span>Establishment critics of the IMF system such as Joseph Stiglitz, himself a former Clinton adviser and World Bank official, make accurate charges against the IMF.</p>
              <p>They assume, however, that it is <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>merely misguided policy that leads to the problems. </strong></span></p>
              <p>The entire IMF institution, along with the World Bank and WTO, however, have been deliberately developed to advance this globalization of the Dollar System, the second pillar of Pax Americana after the military power.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>It is no mistaken policy, no result of bureaucratic blunders. That is the crucial point to be understood. The IMF exists to support the Dollar System.</strong></span></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>The <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>most notable aspect of the crisis is the thorough discrediting of
                  western academic economists</strong></span>, including every single winner of the
                  Economics Nobel Prize.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Their grandiose theories justifying their
                  laissez faire ‘free market’ economic model of globalization has been
                  proven fatally wrong, in effect a transparent promotion gimmick to
                  justify the process of one-sided globalization, little more.</strong></span> They have
                  been exposed, to use the terms of one of my favourite children’s
                  stories by the Danish writer H.C. Andersen, like the Emperor with no
                  clothes...</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>The 1990s have been the decade of globalisation. We see its effects everywhere: in economic, social and political life, around the world.  Yet the more all-pervasive are globalisation's effects, the more elusive is the animal itself.<br><br>An enormous outpouring of academic literature has failed to  provide an agreed view of its physionomy or its location and some reputable academics of Right and Left even question its very existence.<br><br>Others, notably Anglo-American journalists and politicians, insist it is a mighty beast which savages all who fail to respect its needs. They assure us that its gaze, 'blank and pitiless as the sun', has turned upon the Soviet Model, the Third World Import-Substitution Development Model, the European Social Model, the East Asian Development Model, bringing them all to their knees.</p>
              <p>For these pundits,  globalisation is the bearer of a new planetary civilisation, a single market-place, a risk society, a world beyond the security of states, an unstoppable, quasi-natural force of global transformation.</p>
              <p>Yet, as the East Asian crisis turned into a global international financial scare, some who might be thought to be deep inside the belly of this beast, the big operators on the 'global financial markets', wondered whether globalisation might be in its death agony.</p>
              <p>At the start of 1998, Joe Quinlan, senior analyst for the American investment bank Morgan Stanley, raised the possibility  that globalisation may be coming to an end. He noted that "globalisation has been the decisive economic event of this decade" and stressed that <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>"no one has reaped more benefits from globalisation than the United States and Corporate America....The greater the velocity and mobility of global capital, the more capital available to plug the nation's low level of savings and boost the liquidity of financial markets. In short, globalisation has been bullish for the world economy in general and for the United States in particular</strong></span>."</p>
