              <p>I think what is more vital is what we, the citizens can do, on the ground. We must first get employment and then help those whom we love, we care about, our friends, help them tide over this difficult period and find jobs thru our own network then the national network.</p>

              <p>Let our elected representatives spent their best effort to help the more worse off than us, while we, who are able bodied and have a far bigger network of relatives and friends, help ourselves and those around us.</p>

              <p>i dun mean to side with chia here but :</p>
              <p>3.2% now with present population vs 0% in the 80s is quite a large number of people.</p>
              <p>elected representatives even with their best effort will be override by LHL orders,eventually still be back to square 1.</p>
              <p>i do agree with you on this:</p>
              <p>we need to help ourselves and those around us, but IMHO there is a limit to how and where we can help..not at the cost of losing our future, jobs to those that don't really deserve it.</p>

                                                  <p>A question to the foreign "talents" here...</p>
                                                  <p>Globalisation is not suppose to be a one way street.</p>
                                                  <p>Why your country don't have influx of foreigner ? Only OUT FLOW
                                                  or a brain drain ?</p>
                                                  <p>Obviously something is very wrong.</p>
                                                                </div>

                                A PRC working in a MNC in China may earn 500 to 2000 rmb a month.  If the PRC comes over to Singapore just to earn $1000 a month and assuming that the exchange rate is $1 to 5 rmb, then the PRC has already earned 5000 rmb. Thus, the PRC is earning 3000 to 4500 rmb more  a month working in Singapore compared to working in China.
                                
                                <p>China, besides having an abundance of land, also has an abundance of cheap labour. MNCs setting up shop there are exploiting this to their advantage. Thus, salaries of workers there will definitely be low.
                                
                                </p><p>Unless foreigners can earn more money in China when compared to their home country, I think there won't be an influx of foreigners in China like in Singapore's case.</p>

              <p>Whatever layers of the food chain one lives, one is still a precious human with a voice, and there is no harm in voicing out, more so over issues they may not comprehend.

              <p>What's wrong with living in "lower layers" of the food chain ?</p>
              <p>In every society.. there's never one that is top heavy.</p>
              <p>Even in a foreigner's land.. the structure is still the same.</p>
              <p>The thing is.. if that particular foreigner can make it ABOVE the average "food chain".. in his OWN country ...will he still need to travel to another country to find work as cheap labour ?</p>
              <p>SGnoob.. you don't have to feel sorry for us.. on the contrary..we feel sorry for you. It is obvious you ARE in the lower layer of the food chain.. and to get out of the RUT.. YOU need to come to our land to find work as CHEAP LABOUR.</p>
              <p>If you want to insist otherwise.. is there any other reason other than because of the favorable EXCHANGE RATE ?</p>
              <p>Sure.. those who are truly FOREIGN TALENT.. we welcome you because your capabilities and knowledge contributes greatly to our progress.</p>
              <p>But for the foreign WORKERS.. they are ... just.. cheap.. and if they put themselves in the same league as the TALENTS.... I say they have obviously no SHAME.</p>
