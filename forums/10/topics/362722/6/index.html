              <p><br>Had they obtain discounts in education, medical care, transportation, GST offsets, etc, etc?</p>

              <p>Â </p>
              <p>Regardless if you are a local or an ex-citizen trying to stir shit here, If you don't like FT/FW and fear competition for your own selfish ends, it's your right, but don't expect others more civilised to share your bigotry.</p>
              <p><br>The FT/FW issue is more complex than opposition politicians makes it out to be. It is multi-faceted with equal problem lying in every level, from CEOs to workers. To just simply push the blame on our elected representatives is sweeping issues under the carpet.</p>
              <p><br>We need to analyze the root of the problem and its offshoots, and only then can we solve in amicably. Emoting on the issue and stirring shit will only create hatred. My fellow citizens are of better character than what you hope to inspire.</p>
              <p><br>FT/Fws are dime a dozen. Those who are uppity, can go home if they dont like it here. There are many more, from European Armenia to Africa zululand to attract from.</p>
              <p><br>But citizens are precious. Lose one and it will take years to reproduce another. Thus we will always be treasured, but within limits.</p>
              <p><br>We need FT/FWs as much as they need us, therefore, in the best interest of all till better solutions be found, let us all be amicable to each other, resolve misunderstandings and reach out with hands extended instead of clench fists, which the losers may be us and our generations if we do not tap the wealth and resource from other nations.</p>
              <p><br>Whether you reply or not, its your choice, not mine to make, unlike you who deem its your right to dictate to me as to should i reply or not. Grow up, kiddo, and have a nice day.</p>

              <p>Singapore has been way too liberal in welcoming foreigners in recent years without looking at the social ramifications.</p>
              <p>The government seems to be in a hurry to remodel its society by acecpting too many new citizens and PRs, which not surprisingly is leading to resentment among the locals.</p>
              <p>In contrast, Middle Eastern nations, where the native population is often in a &lt;b&gt;minority&lt;/b&gt;, treat all foreigners equally -Â  as second-class resident who can never dream of becoming citizens. Every foreigner knows very well why he is there: to make and save money and liveÂ a good life, not make lifelong plans. And the citizens, who are a pampered lot in the first place, don't harbour much resentment towards foreign workers.</p>

                  Minister <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Lee Hsien Loongâs uncharacteristic comments about flying

                  Minister Lee Hsien Loongâs decision to fly economy class âpraiseworthyâ
                  and âpragmaticâ.</p>
              <p><em></em></p>
              <p>The Chosun Ilbo, a leading South Korean newspaper, reported that
                  when Finance Minister Yoon Jeung Hyun asked Mr Lee âwhy the leader of
                  an affluent country (doesnât) use a private or charter jetâ, Mr Lee

                  class, not first class, for flights under six hours.â</p>
              <p>The entire exchange, as well as the Chosun Ilboâs coverage of it,
                  was reported in the Straits Times. Both leaders spoke after attending
                  the Asean-South Korea Commemorative Summit in South Korea.</p>
              <p>When politicians start making statements that display a false sense
                  of humility, one cannot help but question the premise of those
                  statements as well as the issues that those statements obscure.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Mr Leeâs assertions of âleading by exampleâ seem rather hypocritical, given the pay he receives as a minister.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Had Mr Leeâs statements come from a politician of any other
                  developed country, they would probably not cause any stir. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>But Mr Lee
                  is the highest paid politician in the world by a wide margin, and one
                  cannot help but wonder at the purpose of this false sense of humility.</strong></span></p>
              <p>It may well be true that South Koreaâs per capita GDP is only half
                  that of Singapore, as Mr Yoon had stated when he questioned PM Lee on
                  the latterâs choice of transport.</p>
              <p>However, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Singapore cabinet ministers on the average earn 20 to 50
                  times more per dollar of GDP compared to politicians of other developed
                  countries like US, Britain, etc.</strong></span></p>
              <p>It is equally facetious for Mr Lee to claim that he thought
                  Singapore was not an affluent country, in light of the fact that the
                  ruling party frequently touts the competence of their cabinet ministers
                  and public servants and high rate of economic growth as the
                  justification for the ministersâ million-dollar salaries.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>If Singapore cannot be considered an affluent country, why are we
                  affording our ministers such affluent lifestyles funded out of the
                  taxpayerâs pocket?</strong></span></p>
              <p>If you are one of the almost 300,000 Singaporeans and permanent
                  residents who still earn $1,200 or less a month, or one of 126,000 or
                  so working part-time for a median monthly income of $600 that has
                  remain unchanged for the last nine years, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>how would you feel after
                  reading the news about Mr Leeâs remarks?</strong></span></p>
              <p>If you are one of the 95,600 who are unemployed with no prospects of
                  a job on the horizon, or one of 60,000 who are having problems paying
                  your mortgage for your HDB loan flat, would you not be upset at the
                  outrageous salaries that the ruling party declare for themselves?</p>
              <p>It is sad that Mr Yoon has mistaken Singaporeâs ruling partyâs
                  self-serving attitude and Mr Leeâs misguided sense of humility as
                  âpragmatismâ. The false modesty displayed by him should never be
                  mistaken for humility.</p>
              <p>Indeed, Mr Leeâs assertion that all ministers fly economy for
                  flights under six hours is questionable. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>It is known that permanent
                  secretaries used to fly first class for all flights, and that was
                  subsequently changed to business class for short flights and first
                  class for long flights.</strong></span></p>
              <p>It will also be interesting to ask when this policy to fly economy
                  was implemented, and whether senior official fly business or first
                  class for flights over six hours.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>If our ministers really want to lead by example, perhaps they could
                  consider reducing their salaries some more, as a $1.5 million annual
                  salary is still unjustifiably high.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Only then can they earn a greater measure of respect among the poor and disenchanted.</strong></span></p>
