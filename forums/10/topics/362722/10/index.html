              <p>FYI. NYC will not have the same problem as Singapore.</p>
              <p>The visa and wage policy is already different.</p>
              <p>Companies are not allowed to hire foreign worker if a local can do it. The requirements are job specific.. NOT wage specific.</p>
              <p>Second.. they do have a minimum wage law that protects the lower income jobs from going to cheaper foreign labours  which depress wages (excludes agricultural industry)</p>
              <p>The only way to exploit foreign cheap labor is to shift the entire operation offshore.</p>
              <p>True.. Singaporeans are not all saints.. but do we really need more arrogant devils in this tiny island ? There wouldn't be so much gripe .. if the foreigners actually do try to behave themselves.</p>

              <p>I do agree with most of what you said. These are facts, harsh, but nevertheless facts which we must all reconcile with. And it is fully within your rights to express here, to offer an insight on how a foreigner think.</p>
              <p>It would be apalling to a foreigner, more so if a thin skinned one, to see how we locals think of the foreiger too. Some are more rational, some not. But this is only a discussion board, and nationalism do get strong, and at times over and above rationality.</p>
              <p>Therefore, to make your stand, you must be prepared for the flak that comes with it. Utimately it is your right to respond or not. </p>
              <p>I see you as a rational person instead of some foreign bigots whom are here, and would suggest instead that if you truly want present your views, do it in the real world with my fellow citizens first, get to know them and see them for what they are, and you would get a better insight on us and our homeland where you are or will be serving your contract in.</p>
              <p>You will find us Singaporeans friendly with open hearts once the ice is broken, and much more civil in real life, which will be crucial in reaching out to each other and sharing this island, making it a better place for all.</p>
              <p>The FT/FW issue is a whole lot more bigger and complex than any single one liner statements can solve. But it is an issue that our elected representatives must grapple with to come out with viable solutions. So far they had protected 96.8% of jobs with our society's support.</p>
              <p>But there is another 3.2% that they must be helped. No one gets left behind in our Singapore society. You too will be playing a part in that help, by performing in your job as a talent which I believe you are, along with the other 96.8% of Singaporeans whom are too, being employed for no bosses would hire and pay for passengers.</p>

              <p>this topic have been discussed long time ago, but seems that the problem surface again, maybe because the situation didnot changed.Actually only Malay are native here, so when the first generation of chinese and indian emigrate here, they are foriegner, but at that time seems that the forienger talent thing is not so pressing, maybe because  the people back then are more tolerating then the people nowadays.</p>
              <p>Is singapore learning from US, US attract migrant all over the world. And the foreign student is all over American campus, and US is being called melting pot.But US is unique, not all other country could copy US model.</p>
              <p>There is a delimma  here, attracting FT, or not, attracting Ft ,means attract more talent , so that the business in singapore could be more competitive, but it bring the problem that, the locals feels that their job opportunity is robbed by FT. But if not attract FT the talent produced by local University, is barely sufficient for the industry,</p>
              <p>So how, anyone want to say sth?</p>

              <p>xtreyier, did you realise that you are one of seldom is still rational, i think most local didnot welcome foriegner, why is that, some portion of the problem is because, the local is not so open minded, and some because too many FT, and FT are contained with their own group, someone got to break the ice, but i see no progress yet about the problem</p>

              <p>this topic have been discussed long time ago, but seems that the problem surface again, maybe because the situation didnot changed.Actually only Malay are native here, so when the first generation of chinese and indian emigrate here, they are foriegner, but at that time seems that the forienger talent thing is not so pressing, maybe because  the people back then are more tolerating then the people nowadays.</p>
              <p>Is singapore learning from US, US attract migrant all over the world. And the foreign student is all over American campus, and US is being called melting pot.But US is unique, not all other country could copy US model.</p>
              <p>There is a delimma  here, attracting FT, or not, attracting Ft ,means attract more talent , so that the business in singapore could be more competitive, but it bring the problem that, the locals feels that their job opportunity is robbed by FT. But if not attract FT the talent produced by local University, is barely sufficient for the industry,</p>

              <p>OK. Back in the time when Chineses and Indians were coming to this place, there was no such thing call govt cheese to the Malays. As long as you can find yourself a job or start a business here, you will be fine. Because the local wont feel much they got benefits took away from them. The feeling wont be that strong because people back in that time are more self-dependant...</p>
              <p>Getting FT is for sure if Singapore still wants to be competitive and to have those industries.</p>

              <p>I think most would understand the initial reason for importing of FT - that our population is greying &amp; we need to 'top it up'.</p>
              <p>But I do think they (u-know-who) could be more discriminating &amp; not just welcome any Tom, Dick or Harry.  Looking at some who are imported, I do wonder if they fit the monicker 'Foreign Talent'. They are doing jobs which any local could easily fill (&amp; do a better job of).</p>
              <p>Especially in these difficult times, I see many many 'FTs' doing work that could easily have been given to a local!! &amp; no, they are not 'dirty, menial' jobs like cleaner &amp; such (which locals generally shun).</p>
