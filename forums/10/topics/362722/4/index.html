              <p>Yes. The foreign talents I refer here don't include those from Malaysia, Indonesia, China or India.</p>
              <p>Cos at least they can integrate into our races. They share the same cultures as us.</p>
              <p>I am ok with the Filipinos.</p>
              <p>U see. In my alma mater, the foreigners here just work hard all day and show their humble selves to us locals. Maybe because they mostly come from countrysides.</p>
              <p>But I've seen one from a city. She's from Vietnam. Not even of our races! Yet over time, she can boss with me as a local.</p>
              <p>I live and breathe here. And also serve the 2 years. Not only that, every year, I have to come back for about 2 weeks.</p>
              <p>So if they wanna come here, make sure they be graceful. Otherwise, they should leave and return to their motherlands.</p>

              <p>xteyier, i am trying very hard to understand your point.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You say we are Singaporean and should be proud. We are of a higher class than them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Then you also say when FTs are proud we must walk away quietly and make them feel welcome.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Arent you contradicting yourself? Sounds like you are a FT supporter like the chenghu.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I ask you this question: has the average Singaporean's live improve since this FT policy? I see more PRC prostitutes and massage parlours, I see whole IT departments overtaken my South asians, and local IT grads take on temp jobs. I see study grants given to foreign students using my tax money, whereas local grads take study loan from banks. I see overcrowded buses and trains, hospitals and schools.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you are a REAL SINGAPOREAN, tell me honestly if you are not worried about the future of you or your childrens!</p>

              <p>Serious, Method Man. the future of our children is doomed.</p>
              <p>They will grow up jobless.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Australia Government have advertisement.</p>
              <p>The advertisement is about giving their children hope.</p>
              <p>Their advertisement emphasis the importancy of hiring own citizen first. they educate citizen to buy own products.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Advertisement is on T.V, RADIO, PAPERS, MAGAZINE. POSTERS.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>it said: buy local products, hire local citizen. give your children a future, give them a chance.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>it have one sentence which i remember, it's to LOVE your children.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>our government even stop the speak chinese campaign.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>singapore is DESTROYED by the government.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Singaporean is like being brain wasted.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The government make singaporean look like idiots.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>They make singaporean like clowns, giving the impression that</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1) singaporean are GREEDY. Free things sure Q up like crazy, including the toto and 4d grand prize seasons.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2) singaporean are selfish. they don't give way in MRT/BUS, they don't give seats in MRT/BUS. I think it's the foreigner who spread the culture first. the government pin point these to the singaporean.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I NEVER NEVER SEE a FOREIGN TALENT give SEAT to anyone. U got see bangla / indian give up their seat?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3) Singaporean is like idiots, they Q up for nonsense. EXAMPLE :</p>
              <p>HELLO KITTY, POOH BEAR from MAC. Throw away the food for the dolls. Do DONATION without knowing where the money go to.</p>
              <p>EXAMPLE : DONATE to NKF, REN CI, YOUTH CHALLENGE.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I NEVER NEVER SEE a FOREIGN TALENT give a single cent for donation.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I REMEMBER there was once the GOVERNMENT is having election soon and give up some petty cash to singaporean.</p>
              <p>He FOREIGN TALENT said : why we don't have. Singaporean all very rich. blanja us food.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>in the EYES of those foreigner , they are always thinking we REAL singaporean are very rich. which is not truth. they always think we are so rich that we can treat them lunch, buy them items, pay for them, and also, borrow money from us.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Foreigner is all of a kind.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Philipinos : they like to stick together to creat gangs, politic. they think by staying together, they become a strong force in the company and can control, tell the sinagporean to work. bully us .</p>
              <p>These people tends to borrow money from singaporean saying their father /mother is dead in their home ground. but it was fake. and they left for other countrys with the borrowed money.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>China people:  they think they are more superior. their chinese sucks. they like to criticise we singaporean are bad. always saying the goods about their countries, or which uni of china he come from.</p>

I see more PRC prostitutes and massage parlours, I see whole IT departments overtaken my South asians, and local IT grads take on temp jobs. I see study grants given to foreign students using my tax money, whereas local grads take study loan from banks. I see overcrowded buses and trains, hospitals and schools.</p>

              <p>The problem actually lies in yourself.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you are not aggressive or assertive enough in your workplace, then you surely deserved to be run over by foreigners who were brought up in an entirely non-pampered and non-lovey-dovey environment as compared to you, a normal Singaporean.</p>
              <p>If you do not even know how to protect yourself against foreigners who come to invade your workplace and take away your work rights and your work future, then you deserves to be conquered by those foreign invaders and allow your daughters to bear their children in the future. </p>
              <p>What the use of Singaporean guys going through national service when they have shown themselves as weak and defenseless against a more streetwise and aggressive counterparts?</p>
              <p>Clearly national service isn't training Singaporean men to defend themselves in time of war when they do not even have the spirit to unite together and fend for themselves at their workplace. National service only produces a bunch of loud-bragging whiners who knows how to complain at the very sight of pain/displeasure/stress and yet it sometimes makes them feel superbly proud of having gone through their sissy period in national service.</p>
              <p>As a girl, I think I'm able to defend myself better than any of you weak guys in here. Your mindset and mentality has already shown me that you are all weak and naive folks, extremely inexperienced with people and has very low tolerance levels emotionally.</p>
              <p>To tell you all the truth, even if none of the foreigners decide to take an interest to bully all of you weak Singaporean men, you would've been run over by your own kind at your workplace anyway.</p>
              <p>I hope you will can realised how pathetic you all really are, because talking about FT isn't going to change anything if you all are not able to realise that the change that you all are looking for is in yourself.</p>
              <p>Yes, you all should change yourself and let go of your NAIVE childhood and start to live your lives INDEPENDENTLY in the UNFRIENDLY, COLD, HARD-WORLD.</p>
              <p>Trust yourself, and believe that the rest are all your enemies....eventually. Cos if you aren't going to treat yourself as the star in your own world, then you are just showing others how you are very dispensible in other people's world.</p>
