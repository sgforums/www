              <p>Fire Cracker,</p>
              <p>I am shocked by every piece of your posts. They are filled with racism, hatred of all kinds, even down to your own fellow citizens. I do suspect that you have a deeper grievance than the surface enmity you display to all.</p>
              <p>Why not tell us that deeper reason? If I, an insignificant nobody, cant help you, I am sure there are others who can, as there are thousands of more capable and intelligent people here.</p>
              <p>Could it be that:-</p>
              <p>a. You just lost your job to a foreign worker/talent?</p>
              <p>b. You just lost your gf?</p>
              <p>c. You were scolded by your superiors?</p>
              <p>d. You were scolded by your mom?</p>
              <p>Millions of singaporeans face problems daily, made worse by the current crisis, but they had all courageously confronted and deal with the issues maturedly and not blame anyone else.</p>
              <p>Although not everyone is as matured, there is no harm in seeking help, rather than to spew nauseating remarks and make yourself hated by all resulting in events careening down a steeper slope in life.</p>
              <p>What's your root problem? a, b, c, or d?</p>

              <p>Do you also know that the past salary of a delivery man/driver used to be $1.6k per month, but lately, because many singaporeans were unemployed and caused the vacancies to be filled within hours of news ad,. the salary peg is now only $1.3K?</p>
              <p>Go out and make friends with people of all kinds, then you will be able to see a true and updated picture of what is happening.</p>
              <p>If the bangla is paid 1.8k, then he is one lucky bangla, who applied earlier.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>PS: If you analyzed the current situation, you will then be able to see that cheating bosses are taking advantage of the situation now by lowering their hiring costs and profiting more.</p>
              <p> - if they can pay 1.8k for a bangla then, why pay 1.3k now for a citizen? More so when there are still plenty of unfinished contract work in Singapore, as well as govt contracts, and lowered costs of imported goods/shipping but goods bought by citizens are still where they are today as of yesterday?</p>
              <p>There are still some ethical bosses around, but they are getting fewer by the day. Honour, obligations to society is dying out. If we dont stop it now, we will revert to barbarism and law of the jungle soon.</p>
              <p>So, for some, dont just blame the limited govt bureaucracy. The cheating bosses are more than happy that the govt which many believe should not interfere in private enterprise, is being made scapegoats.</p>

              <p>One critical point many failed to realize is the reason why there are foreign workers and talents here in the first place.</p>
              <p>It's not because we don't have enough population figures to justify a nation status. Even Polynesian island states survived with their meagre pop. and coconut economies.</p>
              <p>The lesser the people, the lesser strain on the financial ministry to provide for all.</p>
              <p>It's not because we simply open our doors to anyone who wish to work here in order to create a vibrant state.</p>
              <p>It's simply because our society needs to uplift the lives of our fellow citizens, to be educated and take on jobs that justifies their ambitions and career paths. Positions at the top are few but low salaried jobs are plenty at the bottom. Singaporeans aspire for more, and rightly justifiably so, for they had proven themselves capable through education and productivity at work.</p>
              <p>Thus, it is not justifiable for our citizens to remain in low paid salaried jobs. But the competition is keen in our neighbourhood. Thus, the door opened for the foreigners to fill such jobs.</p>
              <p>For every 5 FWs, 1 fellow citizen gets a higher paid position in the same company enticed to set up shop here. For every 1 senior FT, 5 fellow citizens get an executive professional pay job. This may not be the exact ratio, but the principle remains.</p>
              <p>Therefore, before one complains about 'flood of FW', 'open the floodgates', 'foriegn invasion' and whatnots, do stop to think about the benefits it brings.</p>
              <p><strong>If it would mean we have to squeeze on weekends with them, on buses, trains, roads or HDBs, etc, it would be worth it, for it would mean one more fellow citizen gets to keep his/her job and feed their families.</strong></p>
              <p>It is easy to talk of solutions to the problems, stirred by opposition politicians and the dissatisfied, but they are all talk. We, the common people will have to face the reality daily and take the most pragmatic approach.</p>
              <p>Ask oneself first before complaining - who amongst us own this country individually and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not as a society which comes with obligations to each other</span>? </p>

              <p>Nobody likes the idea about getting foreingers into their countries at the first place, but for good and highly educated populations, they should know how to overcome the feelings, and face the truth about if there is no foreinger's contributions, there will no success of many things in the country. Singapore is one of the typical cases.</p>
              <p>You like it or not, you cannot deny foreingers contributions to the success of your country. And dont build hatred between each other, at the end of day, nobody would win anything out of hatred.</p>

              <p><br>I see you have failed again to answer my questions. And now, you have even expressed doubts on *gasp!* my maturity! It's ok, you didn't hurt my feelings. Had I hurt yours?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And thanks for calling me noble, though I suspect it might be secondary schoolboy sarcasm. Let you in on a secret: I'm not. I'm selfish as the man next to me because this is my country where my forefathers have built, where I am contributing to, and probably my children will too. Why should I share any of my exclusive citizen rights with VISITORS?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hey, don't bother anymore with answering my questions or replying to my posts. I believe readers here already got their own answers about Singapore's FT policy.</p>

              <p>One critical point many failed to realize is the reason why
              there are foreign workers and talents here in the first place.</p>
              <p>It's not because we don't have enough population figures to
              justify a nation status. Even Polynesian island states survived
              with their meagre pop. and coconut economies.</p>
              <p>The lesser the people, the lesser strain on the financial
              ministry to provide for all.</p>
              <p>It's not because we simply open our doors to anyone who wish to
              work here in order to create a vibrant state.</p>
              <p>It's simply because our society needs to uplift the lives of our
              fellow citizens, to be educated and take on jobs that justifies
              their ambitions and career paths. Positions at the top are few but
              low salaried jobs are plenty at the bottom. Singaporeans aspire for
              more, and rightly justifiably so, for they had proven themselves
              capable through education and productivity at work.</p>
              <p>Thus, it is not justifiable for our citizens to remain in low
              paid salaried jobs. But the competition is keen in our
              neighbourhood. Thus, the door opened for the foreigners to fill
              such jobs.</p>
              <p>For every 5 FWs, 1 fellow citizen gets a higher paid
              position in the same company enticed to set up shop here. For
              every 1 senior FT, 5 fellow citizens get an executive
              professional pay job. This may not be the exact ratio, but the
              principle remains.</p>
              <p>Therefore, before one complains about 'flood of FW', 'open the
              floodgates', 'foriegn invasion' and whatnots, do stop to think
              about the benefits it brings.</p>
              <p><strong>If it would mean we have to squeeze on weekends with
              them, on buses, trains, roads or HDBs, etc, it would be worth it,
              for it would mean one more fellow citizen gets to keep his/her
              job and feed their families.</strong></p>
              <p>It is easy to talk of solutions to the problems, stirred by
              opposition politicians and the dissatisfied, but they are all talk.
              We, the common people will have to face the reality daily and take
              the most pragmatic approach.</p>
              <p>Ask oneself first before complaining - who amongst us own
              this country individually and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not as a society which comes with
              obligations to each other</span>? </p>

              <p>Hehehehe... what kinda rubbish is this ?</p>
              <p>For every 5 FW.. 5 fellow citizens are OUT OF JOB.</p>
              <p>For every 1 senior FT.. 50 FW are invited to take more job from fellow citizens.</p>
              <p>FWs are no longer a supplement .. they have become our REPLACEMENTS.</p>
