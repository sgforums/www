              <p><br>since they are foriegner, so you cannot control them how they behave, they have their tradition, and culture, if they behave exactly like singpaorean, then there won't be the name of FT, even caucasian, some of them are arrogant, but i think the problem is not they are arrogant, it's culture shock, so the problem now is that to reduce import foriegner population, so that, the local will not feel too wierd walking on the street of singapore,</p>

              <p>i think XTREYIER, we need to find out the reason, why local is hostile to FT, is it because they take over their job, or simply because FT behave differently, singapore is not a tolerant socient, hope you will not take it as an offend,</p>
              <p>and  i think the primary reason that local don't welcome FT, is because culture shock,</p>
              <p>because the mass of FT is huge, local society don't have enough power to assimiliate in, so still most of  china chinese stick with china chinese, india indian stick with india indian, that cause alot of fraction.</p>
              <p>When the immigrant migrate to US, they going for American dream, and the dream unite them, but in singapore, there is no such thing to assimiliate FT to local lifes.</p>
              <p>When they wake up, they go to work, with indian, malay, but when work off, they stick to different ethnicities.</p>
              <p>The government's fault is they should not import so many FT in the first place, in such situation, hardly an national indentity could be formed, and they walking on the street , saw so many FT, they don't know they are in singapore or in other country.</p>

              <p>Ok, I guess we are now moving onto another aspect of the FT/FW issue. I hope the economic situation is resolved with agreement for the need of them and the balancing between commerce and society with fine tuning, for the problem you see now is the social impact.</p>
              <p>At least it is not as difficult as the economic issue. Isnt then all the more MP Charles Chong's concept of integration a solution to the enclaves or clique problem? All the more our society should support and encourage such efforts and adopt it throughout the island?</p>
              <p>While our land is small, the sky is infinite and we could always build upwards to accomodate much more. These foreigners and every local have a job and would pay for their keep, and not a drain to our society's efforts.</p>
              <p>We are all humans after all, black or white. Who is the local, who is the foreigner? The only identity we really need is for us all to work towards our personal as well as national aspirations.</p>
              <p>Singaporean citizens are treasured above foreigners, but within limits as no one should be elevated higher than society in our equal republic. Therein lies the greatness of our nation, if we succeed.</p>

              <p><br>Social integration cannot be forced. It must happen naturally, and gradually. And in Singapore's case, it is difficult to break the deadlock since it has become a place for transients.</p>
              <p>Most foreigners are here with a short- or medium-term perspective. Make money, try and save as much as one can, visit the neighboring nations, enjoy the safety and convenience of this city, and go back home to a life of leisure.</p>
              <p>Where is the incentive to know more about the local people and their issues or to try and connect with them at some level? Worse, many only have contempt for Singaporeans and their way of life. And with sufficient numbers of people from one's own nation, there is always the comfort of socializing with fellow countrymen.</p>
              <p>The social integration you are talking about is a distant dream.</p>

              <p>Indeed.. it is the job of the govmen to legislate. Unfortunately.. they have been rather frivolous with their entry permit issuance in recent years.</p>
              <p>What kind of policies the govmen adopt directly affects the lives of fellow residents in Sg,  INCLUDING those of the foreigners.</p>
              <p>Bad practises will only result in anger and resentments from the peasants.</p>
              <p>When the peasants no longer trust the govment to protect the people's interests.. people WILL take matters into their own hands.</p>
              <p>An excellent example will be the Indonesia's pogrom in 1998.</p>
              <p>We do not wish for it to happen in Singapore.. but if push comes to shove.. nobody can guarantee it won't happen.</p>
              <p>Foreigners can and will continue to come into Singapore to take advantage of whatever they can get their hands on from local Singaporeans.. .. but there will eventually be a price to pay for it.</p>

              <p><br>Social integration cannot be forced. It must happen naturally, and gradually. And in Singapore's case, it is difficult to break the deadlock since it has become a place for transients.</p>
              <p>Most foreigners are here with a short- or medium-term perspective. Make money, try and save as much as one can, visit the neighboring nations, enjoy the safety and convenience of this city, and go back home to a life of leisure.</p>
              <p>Where is the incentive to know more about the local people and their issues or to try and connect with them at some level? Worse, many only have contempt for Singaporeans and their way of life. And with sufficient numbers of people from one's own nation, there is always the comfort of socializing with fellow countrymen.</p>

              <p>I believe you only speak for yourself and your clique. There are more whom are inquisitive about us, as they attempt to live on our island for longer than the social visit pass would allow, on work permits or PR/citizenship. Such is the nature of human beings.</p>
              <p>In place of an environment where such openess are not offered, it will only allow misunderstanding and wild presumptions to fester.</p>
              <p>Thus, integration is necessary, being the host. It takes 2 to clap, and yours and our  participation and patience is necessary. It may be dream, but that 1st step must be made, and had already been made by MP Chong.</p>
              <p>Everyone know what are the problems, but if we do not take steps to resolve it, unnecessary pain will only follow. I appeal to everyone's good sense, to make that critical 1st step, with patience. We all have more to gain than to loose.</p>
