              <p>After reading your posts, I realized all your anger and angst is really over one person - a vietnames lady who happens to be your superior. It would not be fair that just because of that you condemn an entire nation of living human beings.</p>
              <p>Why not you take it out in Agony Aunt forum, as you are in agony because of her, and let others try to help you deal with her, rather for you to lash out here and worse, be made use of by others who are radical, to sow the seeds of hatred to attract others to their radicalism and support  their own cowardly insecurities?</p>

              <p>They cannot talk to the MPs every Tuesday, seek help from CDC or  enjoy special benefits from SPUR as an individual. We Singaporeans and PRs can.</p>
