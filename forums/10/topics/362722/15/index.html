              <p>The US is huge place so different region treat immigrant differently. The West Coast are particularly liberal toward immigrant. But the assimilation are the same. The 2nd and 3rd generation Chinese in the state side behave totally different from the 1st. Its the same from korean, and japanese.</p>
              <p>The intergration will take generation if immigrant choose to stay. Don't expect the 1st generation immigrant to change. Of course the worst kind are those that use Singapore as a transit city.</p>

              <p>To Terminator2000 and firecracker</p>
              <p>As a Malaysian Chinese who has migrated to Singapore for more than 30 years, I hope I am qualified to talk here.</p>
              <p>I do understand there are bad "FT" here. But not all are bad. </p>
              <p>I did my degree here in Nanyang Uni many years ago, get a citizenship here and eventually started my own business here. I had and have been donating to Chinese schools and NTU. Am I considered as a bad FT?</p>
              <p>After firecracker labeled Malaysians as the worst of all, I decided to come and give a post. I hope that you are not from any Chinese independent school nor from NTU because if you are, you make me so disappointed in a sense that all the money I had donated have raised such a narrow minded person like yourself.</p>
              <p>I have sons who have served NS. But they are doing well in university and their job. They are very independent. It all boils down to the mentality you are educated with. If one or two FT peeved you off, it does not mean all the FTs are bad and haughty, nor does it means that everyone from a certain countries shares the same irritating traits like the FTs you have met.</p>
              <p>Please be more open minded and more objective if you wish to succeed in your life.</p>
              <p>God bless.</p>

              <p>To Terminator2000 and firecracker</p>
              <p>As a Malaysian Chinese who has migrated to Singapore for more than 30 years, I hope I am qualified to talk here.</p>
              <p>I do understand there are bad "FT" here. But not all are bad. </p>
              <p>I did my degree here in Nanyang Uni many years ago, get a citizenship here and eventually started my own business here. I had and have been donating to Chinese schools and NTU. Am I considered as a bad FT?</p>
              <p>After firecracker labeled Malaysians as the worst of all, I decided to come and give a post. I hope that you are not from any Chinese independent school nor from NTU because if you are, you make me so disappointed in a sense that all the money I had donated have raised such a narrow minded person like yourself.</p>
              <p>I have sons who have served NS. But they are doing well in university and their job. They are very independent. It all boils down to the mentality you are educated with. If one or two FT peeved you off, it does not mean all the FTs are bad and haughty, nor does it means that everyone from a certain countries shares the same irritating traits like the FTs you have met.</p>
              <p>Please be more open minded and more objective if you wish to succeed in your live.</p>
              <p>God bless.</p>

              <p>I only here for 19 years already talk better than a singaporeans, you 30 years old still scare to talk ar??</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You start business, I also start my pub business and create jobs for both Singaporeans and foreigners, however you must understand the perspective of Singaporeans, for them, well known to be kiasu and kiasee, felt that their home is invaded by foreigners and their rice bowl and life is at stake, jealousy also play a part. We cannot blame them, if someone come into your home and take one of your room, you will feel offended and thus retialiate it. Therefore we have to look at the human natural behavior of territorial aspect before we really understand their agony of Foreign Talent here.</p>

              <p>So have you found success by converting to singaporeans, Uncle, in your time, there are lots of Malaysian Chinese converting to Singaporeans, it was a line between it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Your Contribution to the society is what the society had earlier contributed to you, giving you an education, a peaceful environment, a conducive platform to build your family and a business career and so on. Your contribution is just a pay back to what the society offered you. UNDERSTAND. So dun think big big hor.</p>
