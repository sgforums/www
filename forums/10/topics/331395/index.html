              <p>Melamine Contamination Problem - Beyond Milk</p>
              <p>From: Law Sin Ling<br>22 September 2008<br>Melamine Contamination Problem - Beyond Milk<br>Sg_Review</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>There
              are signs to suggest, following the actions taken by the Agri-Food and
              Veterinary Authority (AVA) of Singapore in the face of the melamine
              scandal, that the agency has much to do towards gaining a higher degree
              of faith from the public.</strong></span></p>
              <p>The first concrete sniff of the recent
              scandal broke clean when the Centre For Food Safety of Hong Kong
              detected and released results of their tests between the 15 and 16
              September.</p>
              <p>AVA announced on the 17 September the recall of Yili
              products pending tests by AVA. AVA also stated that it was conducting
              tests on "other imported milk and dairy products from China".</p>
              <p>2
              days later, AVA confirmed the contamination of Yili yogurt and Dutch
              Lady milk, and declared a cessation of import and sale of all milk and
              milk products from China.</p>
              <p>On the same day, AVA issued a letter in
              the TODAY newspaper titled "Milk, dairy products safe: AVA" which
              bewilderingly stated that "milk and dairy products sold in Singapore
              are safe for consumption" even as AVA was conducting more tests for
              particular products from China.</p>
              <p>This is a major gaffe as the AVA
              created confusion over whether products unsafe for sale are safe for
              consumption, no thanks to their inability to communicate their point
              unambiguously.</p>
              <p>On the 21 September, AVA then announced that
              following the confirmed contamination of a third product (the popular
              White Rabbit Creamy Candy), a suspension was imposed on the import and
              sale of all milk and milk products from China including "milk,
              ice-cream, yoghurt, confectionery such as chocolates, biscuits and
              sweets".</p>
              <p>AVA has failed to appreciate that most consumers would
              not automatically draw a relation between tainted milk from China, and
              sweets and biscuits (collectively called confectionery). This is
              especially since confectionery is not typically classified under dairy
              products.</p>
              <p>Hence, the late explicit inclusion of confectionery 4
              days after the first notice demonstrated the detrimental tunnel vision
              of AVA. So is the public to be told of potential problems with other
              products containing milk from China such as cakes, dougnuts, beverage
              powder (Milo, Ovaltine, etc), salad dressings, certain soups, and even
              certain food emulsifier and natural flavouring, only after AVA has
              completed their findings?</p>
              <p>If AVA had reasons to suspect since the
              onset that all products using dairy ingredients from China may be
              implicated, a comprehensive statement with a broad coverage of
              suspected products should have been made public without waiting for the
              results of their tests.</p>
              <p>There is no harm in transparently
              alerting the public to real and possible dangers while the AVA
              cautiously conducts investigations. On the other hand, failure to do so
              would make the actions of the AVA look reactionary and knee-jerk in
              nature.</p>
              <p>Poor communication inevitably leads to suspicion of
              excessive introversion and incompetence. Poor planning though has no
              excuse at that level.</p>

              <p>Samples of the sweets were found to be contaminated with melamine, an industrial chemical that can cause kidney stones and lead to kidney failure.</p>
              <p>How many previous batches of the sweets did AVA passed without having samples tested? Hard to say. Probably samples from every batch that has been imported were tested since time immemorial and had been found to be safe.</p>

              <p>I dunno man... On the one hand, u can see china as a cooperative society with national pride and all that, u see the olympics the earth quake incident, they are telling the world they are a united people. But behind the facade, chinese are doing all sorts of evils in the name of money. For goodness sake, china is a communist country, and its behavior is not better than "greedy capitalist pigs", sheesh. Seems to me chinese sees money more than anything else.<br><br>China to me is like a country that has split personality, sometime united, sometime selfish, but those are mutually exclusive are'nt they. Or is china putting up a mask to fool the whole world?<br><br>So what is china suffering from??? split personality or grave dishonesty.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Sorry guys, i know this topic is on AVA, but i think the culprit are the chinese evil merchants.</p>

              <p>AVA should work from a clean slate. That is, assume that all Chinese food products are un-safe. Next begin to include products that they safely consider safe.</p>
              <p>Now, we have a range of China food products allowed here, except the milk products.</p>
              <p>I am sceptical of all China food products being safe for consumption. They have consistently shown the world that they have no health standards. They are simply waiting for the next food scare to appear, cover up if possible and then act catch the culprits when the news are blown up. That's been their only strategy. They simply execute a few scapegoats, and wait for the next scare.</p>
              <p>I am prepared to pay more for safer food products.</p>

              <p>As much as I feel that AVA should have more alert in stopping the tainted milk from reaching our shores, but if one takes a more rational approach to look at this problem, you can see that AVA is actually more or less an unfortunate scapegoat of this saga.</p>
              <p>The qualitative test that was conducted by the food laboratories, is meant to determine the quantity of nitrogen in the milk powder. The Kjeldahl was not designed to detect harmful materials but merely to QA the nitrogen content. To be honest, even if we managed to put a stop to the Sanlu's practise of adding melamine to the milk, there are many other nitrogen based adulterants they can add in to fake the nitrogen content. Examples will be like those compounds with amine functional groups like pyridine, pyrilidone, triamine, diamine substances and the list is unexhausive. These substance have also high nitrogen lvl due to the NH2 groups. You can't expect AVA to test for all the thousands of different potentially harmfull organic compounds rite?</p>
              <p>What has to tackle now, at international lvl is to send a strong message to PRC. As a growing economic and military power, you must be responsible for your actions. No doubt making profits is important, ethics is also important, bcos you are putting your country's reputation and fame on it. The PRCians should send more time exploring the ethics, morals and spiritual part of life. Yes, you can have an olympic opening that is touted to be the best and the most extravagent, but yet you can't even assure the interest of your commoners are protected e.g. shroudy construction in Szechuan earthquake killing many school children.........</p>
