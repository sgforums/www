              <p><br>FYI, Hong Kong is not a country, it is a city in the PRC. So only 3 countries out of the all the developed countries in the world. So the system is a feedback system? Wait for something to happen then find solution to it. If it's like any other countries in the world, how come they demand stellar salaries. Maybe the other developed countries in the world discovered the contaminants, that's why no western country was affected?</p>
              <p>Why you blame the teachers? Is it because they demanded 10 times the salary of their equivalent in other developed countries, yet the teaching method adopted is equivalent to the teaching standards in these developed countries, subject to high failure rates.</p>

              <p>Eggshells present healthy, balanced calcium due to trace amounts of other minerals contained in it. Eggshell calcium is probably the best natural source of calcium, and it is easier for your body to digest and absorb. Dutch researchers have reported recently a highly positive effect of eggshell calcium (with added magnesium and vitamin D) on bone mineral density in a scientific study (double blind, placebo-controlled). Laboratory test and measures of bone density were carefully made in these studies. The eggshell supplemented group had measurable increases in bone density in their hip bones, after one year..................................................</p>

              <p>Sanlu is involved because the CEOs knew about the case and refuse to act on it. The one tat really get the blame for MSK is the in charge of the detention center and he is sacked. However I do not blame u for linking the case to Wong KS because as the head of the department, he has to go for checks etc to make sure everything is okie.</p>
              <p>About the melamine case, however is really not the fault of the country testing the product. Tis is because there r so many toxin in tis world and so many food to test. To do an exhaustive test is not just costly, it can even be impossible. Tat is why no ministers, even in other countries r sacked because they fail to detect melamine in the food.</p>

              <p>First u talk about your son, then u talk about the teachers. Kinda illogical isn't it ?

Why do u twist and turn in your own example ?</p>

Dutch researchers have reported recently a highly positive effect of eggshell calcium (with added magnesium and vitamin D) on bone mineral density in a scientific study (double blind, placebo-controlled). Laboratory test and measures of bone density were carefully made in these studies. The eggshell supplemented group had measurable increases in bone density in their hip bones, after one year..................................................</p>

              <p>And
              it's all supplied by a special government outfit that provides
              all-organic goods from farms working under the strictest guidelines.</p>
              <p>That secure food supply stands in stark contrast to the frustrations
              of ordinary citizens who have faced recurring food scandals —
              vegetables with harmful <span id="lw_1222286001_4" class="yshortcuts" style="background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%; cursor: pointer;   -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial;">pesticide residue</span>,
              fish tainted with a cancer-causing chemical, eggs colored with
              industrial dye, fake liquor causing blindness or death, holiday
              pastries with bacteria-laden filling.</p>
              <p>Now that the country's most reputable dairies have been found
              selling baby formula and other milk products tainted with an industrial
              chemical that can cause <span id="lw_1222286001_5" class="yshortcuts">kidney stones</span> and <span id="lw_1222286001_6" class="yshortcuts" style="background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%; cursor: pointer;   -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial;">kidney failure</span>, many Chinese don't know what to buy. Tens of thousands of children have been sickened and four babies have died.</p>
              <p>Knowing that their leaders do not face these problems has made some people angry.</p>
              <p>"<span id="lw_1222286001_7" class="yshortcuts" style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc; cursor: pointer;">Food safety</span> is a high priority for children and families of government officials,
              so are normal citizens less entitled to safe food?" asked Zhong Lixun,
              feeding her 7-month-old grandson baby formula after he got checked for
              kidney stones at Beijing Children's Hospital.</p>
              <p>The State Council <span id="lw_1222286001_8" class="yshortcuts" style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc; cursor: pointer;">Central Government Offices</span> Special Food Supply Center is specifically designed to avoid the problems troubling the general population.</p>
              <p>"We all know that average production facilities use large quantities
              of chemical fertilizers and pesticides. Antibiotics and hormones are
              commonly used in raising livestock and poultry. Farmed aquatic products
              are contaminated by various kinds of water pollution," the center's
              director, Zhu Yonglan, said in a speech earlier this year.</p>
              <p>"It goes without saying that these are harmful when consumed by
              humans," Zhu told executives at supplier Shandong Ke'er Biological
              Medical Technology Development Co., which posted it on its Web site.</p>
              <p>Zhu's speech has been widely circulated by Chinese Internet users on
              blogs and forums in recent days, with many expressing outrage that top
              government officials have a separate — and safer — food supply than the
              public.</p>
              <p>The special food center enforces strict standards on suppliers like
              Shandong Ke'er, which makes health supplements designed to boost
              immunity and energy. Foods must be organic, not genetically modified
              and meet international food standards, said a manager in the center's
              product department, who only gave her surname, Zhang.</p>
              <p>The reason: its A-list clientele of government officials and retirees of vice minister rank or higher.</p>
              <p>It's not unusual for China's leadership to have a special food
              supply; the practice stretches back thousands of years to farms
              providing ingredients for lavish imperial meals or the greasy, spicy
              dishes favored by <span id="lw_1222286001_9" class="yshortcuts" style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc; cursor: pointer;">Communist Party Chairman Mao Zedong</span>.</p>
              <p>The former Soviet Union's ruling classes also ate food that was unavailable to the masses. In <span id="lw_1222286001_10" class="yshortcuts" style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc; cursor: pointer;">North Korea</span>, where withering famines have seen tens of thousands starve over the past 13 years, leader <span id="lw_1222286001_11" class="yshortcuts">Kim Jong Il</span> is a gourmet known for his love of lobster, shark's fin soup and sushi.
              His former private chef has said Kim keeps an extensive collection of
              vintage <span id="lw_1222286001_12" class="yshortcuts">French wines</span>.</p>
              <p>Set up in 2004, <span id="lw_1222286001_13" class="yshortcuts">China</span>'s
              Special Food Supply Center is almost as secretive as its high-end
              clientele, whose precise number is unclear, but includes hundreds of
              top political leaders, their families and retired cadres. Much of the
              information on its Web site was removed after media inquiries and
              interview requests this week.</p>
              <p>Goods deemed to meet the highest standards are stamped with the
              label "Nation A," which stands for "top end, irreplaceable, the best,"
              according to the Web site. Those products are for senior politicians or
              government offices and not released to the general consumer market,
              said a customer service agent surnamed Dong.</p>
              <p>Rice fed by melted snow from Mt. Changbai, which straddles the
              China-North Korean border, gets a "Nation A" rating, according to the
              Web site.</p>
              <p>The center scours the country for purveyors in places famous for a particular product, said Zhang, the manager.</p>
              <p>These include fish from <span id="lw_1222286001_14" class="yshortcuts">Hubei</span> province — known traditionally as the "land of fish and rice" — tea from <span id="lw_1222286001_15" class="yshortcuts">mountainous Yunnan province</span> abutting <span id="lw_1222286001_16" class="yshortcuts" style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc; cursor: pointer;">Tibet</span>, and beef and mutton from the Inner Mongolian steppes, according to Zhu's speech.</p>
              <p>As for rice, some comes from the northeast, grown from seeds specially
              cultivated by experts from the Jilin Academy of Agricultural Sciences,
              said sales manager Wu Honghua of Chifeng Heiyupaozi Organic
              Agropastoral Development Co.</p>
              <p>It "has a very small output. It tastes very good. And it doesn't involve genetic engineering," said Wu.</p>
              <p>Wu said 90 percent of the rice goes to the Beidaihe Sanitorium —
              a seaside resort for retired party cadres. The remainder is sold on the
              market, he said, at $4 a pound — a price five times higher than regular
              organic rice and 15 times more than the price of ordinary rice.</p>
              <p>A brand of organic tea supplied to the center sells for $187 a
              pound. "It's fresh and tender, smells good and has a bright color,"
              said Xia Dan, an employee of the Huiming Tea Co. in eastern Zhejiang
              province.</p>
              <p>The latest food safety scandal began with tainted baby formula
              from one company, but widened to include products from 22 of China's
              dairies. Countries as far away as <span id="lw_1222286001_17" class="yshortcuts">Kenya</span> and <span id="lw_1222286001_18" class="yshortcuts" style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc; cursor: pointer;">Colombia</span> have banned or recalled Chinese dairy imports, while cakes, candies and
              other products made with milk products have come under suspicion.</p>
              <p>Since the scandal broke earlier this month, sales of Chinese
              milk have plummeted after top dairies Mengniu Dairy Group Co. and Yili
              Industrial Group Co. were found to have sold contaminated milk.</p>
              <p>Chinese looking for reassurance have turned to one company not named in any recalls — Sanyuan Foods Ltd.</p>
              <p>It proudly advertises that its milk is used for state banquets at the <span id="lw_1222286001_19" class="yshortcuts" style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc; cursor: pointer;">Great Hall of the People</span> and has seen its sales triple in <span id="lw_1222286001_20" class="yshortcuts">Beijing</span>,
              while demand has outstripped supply in at least one province. And
              that's despite the fact that its price — about $1.60 a quart — is 25
              percent higher than other brands.</p>

              <p><br> Recall the slim 10 case, we had import it for yrs until when they
              try to export to Auss, the Auss test it and stop it from importing,

              <p>This tainted milk issue has been around for three years. I just wonder if AVA is as vigilance as it claimed on its website, why this problem is not detected earlier?</p>

              <p>Why is it always only when incident happens then we see our government body in action?</p>
