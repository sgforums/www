              <p>I think singaporean need to understand this.</p>
              <p>If Melamine is already injected into the supply Chain of Process food supply. This is more than just Milk product. Singapore have to look at ALL PROCESS Food supply and need testing.</p>
              <p>Singapore Govt need to go to Melamine suppliers and look at who are their customers in order to understand the magnitude of the spread.<em> </em>I fear that all other can processed food already contaminated.</p>
              <p>The chinese govt are seriously good at hiding the truth when things get worst.</p>

Your explanation to your dad being, I have failed, but so did everybody else in the class.

              <p><strong>China says dairy firm knew of toxic milk for months</strong></p>
              <p>AFP - <span>59 minutes ago</span></p>
              <p class="first">BEIJING (AFP) - - The Chinese company whose tainted baby milk triggered a food safety crisis that has seen 53,000 children fall ill failed to report complaints about the product for months, state media said Tuesday.</p>
              <p>Sanlu Group, the dairy firm first found to be selling melamine-contaminated goods, began receiving complaints of sick children as early as last December, state television said, citing a cabinet probe.</p>
              <p>It also said Communist officials in the northern city of Shijiazhuang, where Sanlu is based, delayed referring the matter to higher authorities for more than a month after Sanlu finally told them of the problem on August 2.</p>
              <p>"In the eight months from December 2007 to August 2, 2008, Sanlu made no report to relevant authorities in Shijiazhuang and took no corrective measures, allowing the situation to worsen further," the report on state-run CCTV's news channel said, quoting the cabinet probe.</p>
              <p>The report appeared to be the first official admission that news of the health risks was deliberately suppressed.</p>
              <p>Reports of tainted milk only emerged in state-run media earlier this month.</p>
              <p>The chemical melamine, normally used in making plastics, was apparently added to milk supplies to give the appearance of higher protein levels.</p>
              <p>Sanlu Group did not begin testing its milk for dangerous substances until June, the cabinet probe reportedly found.</p>
              <p>The government has blamed tainted products for four deaths, and said Sunday that nearly 13,000 children remained hospitalised with kidney stones or other problems, 104 of them in serious condition.</p>
              <p>With several countries slapping bans on Chinese dairy-based products, the government announced new steps to limit the fallout from the latest safety scare to tarnish the nation's exports.</p>
              <p>The commerce ministry ordered tighter quality checks on export goods such as food, drugs, toys and furniture products, the official Xinhua news agency said.</p>
              <p>The agriculture ministry ordered its departments to use "severe discipline" in stepping up supervision of milk brokers blamed for adding the chemical.</p>
              <p>"Departments at all levels must ... put these milk collectors in order and strengthen supervision. The mission must be completed to the letter," Minister Sun Zhengcai said in comments posted on the ministry's website.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, Hong Kong authorities reported Tuesday two more children have fallen ill in the city with kidney stones after drinking Chinese dairy products, taking the sick total there to four.</p>
              <p>A dozen Asian and African countries have either barred Chinese milk products or taken some other form of action to curb consumption.</p>
              <p>"What we are telling parents now, especially the mothers, is to avoid buying milk with 'made in China' markings," said Leticia Gutierrez, the head of the Bureau of Food and Drugs in the Philippines.</p>
              <p>She spoke after announcing a ban on the import and sale of Chinese milk products.</p>
              <p>Malaysia on Tuesday widened an earlier ban to include candies, chocolates and all Chinese-made food containing milk, a top official said.</p>
              <p>Vietnam and Bangladesh also took new measures to ban imports of Chinese dairy products and warn consumers against using such products still on store shelves.</p>
              <p>In Japan, a petition by the country's regional governors urged the central government to suspend imports of all Chinese dairy products, saying "people's distrust is growing over food made in China."</p>
              <p>The scandal forced the resignation Monday of China's product-safety watchdog chief, Li Changjiang, whose tenure coincided with a wave of recent safety scandals involving food, drugs, toys and other goods, many of them exported.</p>
              <p>Also sacked was Wu Xianguo, the top Communist official in Shijiazhuang. The city's mayor and several other government officials had been fired earlier.</p>
              <p>Eighteen people have been arrested so far, including the sacked head of Sanlu Group, and dozens detained for questioning, according to state media.</p>
              <p>Although Sanlu was the first company embroiled in the scandal, subsequent government tests found melamine in the products of 22 other Chinese dairy manufacturers.</p>
              <p>Investors on Tuesday punished the shares of top Chinese dairy makers that were implicated, with Mengniu Dairy falling more than 60 percent in trading on the Hong Kong stock exchange.</p>
              <p>In Shanghai, shares of Yili Industrial and Guangming Dairy and Food plunged the maximum 10 percent trading limit</p>

              <p><em>Melamine, which can be used to cheat quality checks by mimicking food protein, has been found in candy, buns and carton milk sold to other countries and regions, unleashing fear in markets already shaken by a string of "made-in-China" scandals last year.</em></p>

              <p><strong>AVA, MOH say low melamine levels found in affected milk products here</strong></p>
              <p>Channel NewsAsia - <span>Wednesday, September 24</span></p>
              <p><span>
              </span></p><p class="first">SINGAPORE: Singapore authorities have given the assurance that the risk of melamine poisoning to Singaporeans is low. There have been growing concerns after three China—made products in Singapore were found to be laced with the industrial product.</p>
              <p>Authorities said the tainted products will have to be consumed over a prolonged period of time before one gets really sick. That’s because the body can safely take in and purge some amount of melamine.</p>
              <p>The Tolerable Daily Intake (TDI) of melamine as established by the US Food and Drug Administration is 0.63 mg/kg body weight.</p>
              <p>This means that an adult weighing 60 kg or a child weighing 30 kg can ingest 37.8 mg of melamine and 18.9 mg of melamine respectively, everyday, over a lifetime without any appreciable health risk.</p>
              <p>37.8 mg is about the size of a grain of rice.</p>
              <p>The Agri—Food &amp; Veterinary Authority (AVA) cited an example of drinking about 80ml of liquid everyday for an entire lifetime, before the ill effects of melamine take root.</p>
              <p>The Ministry of Health also cited an example of an adult weighing about 60kg who ate 47 pieces of the white rabbit candy everyday over a lifetime and the health risk for this adult will still be very low.</p>
              <p>For a child who weighs 30 kg, that’s about 400 ml of the Dutch Lady Strawberry Flavoured milk daily over a lifetime.</p>
              <p>And so there’s very little chance that a child will be affected unless his sole source of food is tainted milk.</p>
              <p>However, worried parents can still look out for certain symptoms.</p>
              <p>Professor Yap Hui Kim, Head of Paediatric Nephrology, National University of Singapore, said: "In infants there will be a pain. And if there is a pain when one urinates, an older child will be able to tell you. Or they would scream when they’re passing urine. Many of them will also come down with fever, will be unwell, and will vomit."</p>
              <p>To date, government hospitals have not treated any child affected by melamine toxicity as a result of consuming contaminated milk or milk products.</p>
              <p>Melamine is also not known to cause deformities in unborn infants.</p>
              <p>According to a doctor from KK Hospital, there’ve also been no calls from parents with queries on this. The doctor added there is no cause of alarm as the amount of melamine found in the products sold in Singapore is too low to cause kidney stones.</p>
              <p>The AVA added that it is widening checks to include products made in other countries but may contain China milk—based ingredients.</p>
              <p>Dr Chua Sin Bin, CEO, AVA, said: "We have contacted our importers to track down from the suppliers whether their products are manufactured with China milk, as an ingredient. If it is stop it and don’t import from them."</p>
              <p>He added the AVA will also include melamine under its export certification process to ensure food found in Singapore is certified melamine—free.</p>
              <p>Although only three China—made products have been found tainted in Singapore, the AVA said it cannot rule out more of tainted products, as it continues its battery of tests.</p>
              <p>As to why melamine was not detected earlier, Dr Chua said 300 chemical compounds come into the market every year. So it needs to take a pragmatic approach to its tests.</p>
              <p>He added that no agency in the world conducts food tests for melamine.</p>
              <p>He said: "It is a very abnormal occurrence. It is because someone cheated and intentionally added this into the product to beat the system and nobody could dream of that."</p>
              <p>Consumers can call the AVA at 6325 7625 or the Ministry of Health at 1800—2254 122 if they have queries.</p>
              <p>National Environment Agency (NEA) officers have also been deployed to check on bakeries, cake shops, hawker centres, coffeeshops and school canteens to ensure vendors do not use tainted products. — CNA/vm</p>

              <p>Because in labs, they dun check for melamine, but they do check for protein content as part of their QC tests.And protein level in food is determined indirectly by organic nitrogent content, and melamine is a soure of that nitrogen.</p>
              <p><br>Say when it come to singapore, ava will check its stated nutritional content VS tested content, and since the milk is watered down its protein level will be lower ma, so one way is put in some melamine to fake the testers loh.<br><br>This is cheating. This is dishonesty. THis is lack of intergrity. This is the reason we should be careful of ALL china products, since its nt only ONE company that does it apparantely. It was pet food, now its baby food... Getting sick of chinese products.</p>
