              <p>Meat Pao You are so full of crap...You have no idea but simply follow SG govt of containment....Do you seriously know what is melamine......a form of plastics. You walk into any office in Raffle place and you see all the office desk and table. most of them are Melamine work top because it provide a very nice shine worksurface. Assuming you Feed that to your children..... </p>
              <p>If you want to harm your own body that is your personal choice. Long Term exposure of Melamine to liver is unknown.  So stop encouraging people to eat something that is harmful.</p>
              <p>If you don;t agreed at least do not mislead public to ignore the warning, Than you are no better than manufacture who add melamine to milk powder. (I'll bet those folks think the same as you did)</p>

              <p>What is your feeling and thoughts after reading? Seriously, how can the authorities cover up the news or the fact that milk powder is tainted and ending with it, DEATH of 4 young lives till date! How can China now "repay" the lives of those affected? What is more important? Lives or Olympics? Obviously, to China authorities &amp; government bodies, Olympics is more important.</p>
              <p>How can we trust China government bodies? Anyone forgotten how China cover up about SARS? And at time, didn't they say the same lines about dealing with the matter &amp; restore confidence... etc etc...? Then why this kind of health issues are always been announced when the event become so big &amp; ugly? Let me refresh you all again.

              <p>Mr Mah says it is impractical to test everything. I agree but shouldn't milk be considered a basic necessity? After all those emphasize on baby making, we're not even interested in ensuring that the product we use, the food meant for babies are safe??</p>
              <p>Mr Mah should be fired! I'm so getting tired of PAP's incompetence and LHL extremely high tolerance for failures. He may think that 66.6% is good enough for election but 66.6% is a near half-f*ck job for other things like security and safety.</p>

              <p>Most of the content of the melamine is actually not harmful to
              healh except if consumed in large quantities and repeatedly,
              consistently, for a lifetime. This is excluding the Sanlu milk
              powder, which seem more negative and contain more melamine, and
              especially harmful for young children.</p>
              <p>There is not much to say or comment about this, I hope AVA can
              perform more checks in future so there wont be similar cases or
              wait until a news to break out first.</p>

              <p>was just wondering if China learned anything from this milk issued.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>HOHHOT, China (AFP) — China on Tuesday declined to release updated figures revealing just how many children have been affected by the tainted milk scandal, as it insisted it was working hard to boost confidence.</p>
              <p>The health ministry said it had new statistics showing how many babies were believed to have been left ill by the crisis, but did not release the data and gave no indication of if or when it would made the latest information public.</p>
              <p>"We've not released the latest number of cases because it is not an infectious disease, so it's not absolutely necessary for us to announce it to the public," a health ministry spokesman told AFP.</p>
              <p>Previous official figures said milk powder tainted with the chemical melamine had claimed the lives of four children and made a further 53,000 ill.</p>
              <p>Melamine, used to produce plastic, can make watered-down milk appear richer in protein than it really is.</p>
