The conflict between china and ameica, or in other words, between Chinese and Anglo-Saxon, will become dominant in the near future. unfortunately taiwan wants to take a chance of this.. good luck on them and all the best.<br>the suffering of china from those whites in the past will not justify china's would-be aggression on taiwan, but leaning into the lap of china's enemy will certainly put taiwan into very vulnerable situation.<br><br></div></blockquote>There are a lot of material posted in the afternoon while you were away take your time to read all of them. You don't have to discuss about all of them since some points are repeated. Don't need to rush. Take your time to reply and digest the information.<br><br>Anyway both Qitai and I mentioned that if China's stand is less aggressive towards Taiwan, the people there will also take a more positive stand towards China.

Wrong, the world was split in their recognition of the legitimate Chinese government, the KMT's ROC in Taiwan, or the commie's PRC in Beijing. The world recognised north and south vietnam, north and south korea, but they recognise one China, never 2!!<br><br>"...Now china become powerful, he can either choose to recognise his policy about 1 china or else china is not going to recognise u as anything."   True, if you don't recognise the 1 china policy, why should china want to have any diplomatic relationship with you.

China never ask you to agree and follow every policy of China. But the 1 china policy is a must. You have your choice, you can continue to accept ROC as the legitimate chinese government. This is what it is today, whether we agree or not.<br></div>

If you recognised the Tigers as a legitimate party, do you think Sri Lanka will want to have any diplomatic tie with you? </blockquote>U just prove my point. As I said before, the reason why people still treat china as one is because central china force it down people's throat. Nobody treat Tigers as the legitimate country because they r rebels. They do not win any voting, if they had gone in the first place and they practise militant way to establish control. This is different from china because it is KMT tat is the ruling Gov in the first place. In china case it is the rebel taking control of china and insist the main party to be under him. Frankly they do not practise diplomacy to acheieve reunification too.<br><br>If u know tat there is the existence of north and south korea, then u will know tat without any pressure from any side, the world community will treat them as 2 seprate entities.<br><br><blockquote>China never ask you to agree and follow every policy of China. But the 1 china policy is a must. You have your choice, you can continue to accept ROC as the legitimate chinese government.

If ROC recognise communist party, we won be discussing this issue. Anyway, if ah bian agrees, I believe Beijing will be glad. What a Joke</blockquote>But the question is do they attempt to do it in the first place ? no, because china still think he is the Gov of taiwan and will not play the rules for diplomacy<br><br><blockquote>Ming and Qing are different countries in the same China in different time on the same piece of land!! </blockquote>Ming and Qing r 2 different countries. One is Manchus and the other is Han. Each have their own kings and court officers, and they never treat each other as being the same country. It is Manchus tat invade Ming isn't it ? Tat is why they had a war isn't it ? Please do not treat the current map of china as a reference<br><br><blockquote>Yes, I agree that chinese are giving pressure to taiwan. You are saying that china should not. I am saying that taiwan better take that pressure seriously. </blockquote>Frankly... yes, china shouldn't give pressure to taiwan. But it is your own opinion tat it is to be done tat way<br><br><blockquote>The US will gain a lot by selling more weapon to taiwan and using taiwan as an unsinkable aircraft carrier against China, something they lost since they were kicked out of the Philippines......

According to a reply before, someone accuse singapore of gaining something when war is fought between taiwan and china, which is false and wild accusation<br><br><blockquote>As I said in my previous post, the process had started and had gone on well until ah bian came on stage. If Ah Bian and DPP officially denounce any intention to become independence, then I believe things can go back to normal.

Tat is why everyone agree Afghan has to be hit isn't it ? But for Iraq case, people feel tat US had given the first punch toward them now. tat is why there is such a big mess there.<br><br>At least US got a better reason of "self defense" toward a "evil" nation condemn by international committee.
