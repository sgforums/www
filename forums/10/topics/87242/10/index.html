            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>You should ask ah bian if KMT, DPP would allow the CP of China to come to Taiwan. If you ask China if they want to send a party to stand for election in Taiwan, they will say they would love to and have been waiting for the opportunity. </blockquote>Tat is wat u say, not wat the CP says. They will not do it. Why ? Because going for the elction just means tat they have acknowledge taiwan is a seperate country ! Not only tat, if they lose, which appears to be very likely, they will lose more face ! As said by a previous forumers, wat china want to send is not a party for election, but a ruling governor. Will they send a team to bid for votes ? Unlikely due to the 2 points I have raised above. All I can say is, your views r pretty... near sighted...<br><br><blockquote>Even in the recent election, DPP linked the opposition with communists to discredit the opposition, how on earth do you think any taiwan government would allow the communist to stand for election in Taiwan??? sorry, you sound pretty naive here. </blockquote>If nothing goes wrong (shooting incident) it is predicted tat Chen will lose. In other words even when they alleged the KMT to be linked with china, KMT is not appearing to be losing either. If a party fulfil the criteria to stand for election, there is no laws in taiwan tat could have prevented him from running for office. Who is the one tat sounds naive here ?<br><br><blockquote>We can wait for probably another generation, when the communists become less of the previous Maoist or Marxist Leninist communists. and become more captalists and socialists, and more Taiwanese grow up and study in China. The gap, in every aspect, become narrower, then china and Taiwan reunification will become natural. </blockquote>Or we could lower the hostility, open up more dialogues, pursuading them by showing the benefits of reunification. If things carry on as they r, not matter how many generations is gone, the anger or frustration between taiwan and china will still remains because of fresh incidents. ROC has been established for 40 over years yet it doesn't seems to be enough. Isn't tat again, a near sighted view ?<br><br><blockquote>The info in yr posting tells me how much or little you know, your logic or the lack of it tells me if you have a point or just an argument, and your advocates shows what is important to you, objectives or compassion. </blockquote>Well well well... I wanted to stop initially, but thanks to someone like u, look like I have to carry on tis debate. From your view, it just occurs to me as someone idealistic and think things in a too simplified manner.</div>
