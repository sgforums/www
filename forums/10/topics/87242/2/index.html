But they reunite eventually without bloodshed because they were people with the same language and culture.<br><br>Same thing for Taiwan. I believe they will reunite eventually its a matter of time when China is developed and the differences between two sides not so great. But why should China reunite Taiwan in a hurry through force and cause bloodshed ? </div></blockquote>East and west germany united is a good example of this sort.. it would be very nice if china and taiwan can follow the suit.  but the reality is quite different between these two countries..  i am not interested in ideology at all. in my understanding, that is quite out of date concept. That is only being used as an excuse for sb's own purpose.. exactly like democracy.. american like using that..<br><br>the reunity issue is totally because of sth else.. it is related with the national interests, and the future of a country and people.  so i would say china can not afford to lose taiwan.<br><br>on the other hand,, taiwan knows the real situation of china right now... china wants to take this period of time to get its economy into a good shape.. and would not want to get into war in the first place unless it has got any opton.<br>and taiwan just wants to take advantage of this time,, and do sth like gambling..  maybe they thought if they do the "right" thing at this time,, maybe they can become independent and china is not so strong,, so china can not stop them. and they are very clear,, if the things keep going like this, china would become another world or at least regional power. taiwan would lose the chance forever.. That is where the "hurry" is coming from. it is not because of china, but taiwan starts pushing.. and playing the ball in the hard way.   also at the back of their mind they always think american will come to save if they go too far.<br>in the meanwhile, they created whole set of fancy names to support their intention of getting indepent.. those are just excuse.. and the dangerous part is taiwan serously underestimate the determination of china.. that would put taiwan into real disaster someday..<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To be fair, I think ppl are exchanging "view" here, not "where from".  Individual's "view" might has a lot to do with "where from". However, debating over "view" is between individuals, while digging too much into "where from" can easily go beyong individual, but more between nations, races, etc.<br><br>If j28w32 does not want to answer, why insist? Why not focus more on the "view"?</div>
