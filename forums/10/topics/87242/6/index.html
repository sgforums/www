That is much worse than what "commie"  did in terms of leader sccession.  The funny thing is sg gov set up "speaker's corner" (forget in which year) to let world know sg is a democratic country. What a freak show!!! any democratic country will have to do this kind of show to let every one know if they are real democratic??  also i guess there is only one kind of voice coming from single tv station, and newspaper which is in the hand of sg gov. it is really beyond my understanding that so many people in here defend sg gov.. and try to convince me with one thing that sg. is a democratic society.  anyway,, i  do not know as individual in singapore what kind of punishment will result if you criticize sg gov. in the net forum like this.  or if there is no punishment, why everyone seems very defensive in this issue?? patriotic?? can not understand.. indeed..<br><br>moreover,, if it is illegal to have a number of people gathering, how people up there can have a party?? is it illegal?? how does this restriction work in the real life?? just out of curiosity,, nothing else.. maybe only sg gov can work out a way, which can only be accepted by sg people without any whinge. anybody minds giving me a reply about this??<br><br></div></blockquote>There is only one political party in China, but there are multi parties in Singapore.
