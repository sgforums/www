Don't they understand that this will only make the Taiwanese vote Ah Bian just for the seek of pride? Now that Ah Bian is in power, he is causing more trouble and China keeps getting manuipulated by him, giving him more support from the Taiwanese who let their false pride get the better of them.

There are a few points I would like to clarify :<br><br>1 I am not anti-chinese<br><br>2 I strongly oppose the use of force in reunification, even if Taiwan declare independence. I have used the eg of Germany. Before reunification there were two independent countries separated by different systems but they reunify peacefully eventually, without bloodshed.<br><br>Taiwan and China are bonded by historical and cultural ties. I believe they will reunify eventually but it should be on terms acceptable to both sides and not a unilateral proclaimation by China.<br><br>As mentioned by me earlier and by Qitai later, if China is less aggressive towards Taiwan, bilateral ties would improve, support for Ah Bian will erode and peace talks can resume.<br><br>As for Loong Yin Tai she is Taiwanese but her stand is pro communication and understanding. I don't feel that it is as one-sided as you mention. Hers views are frank and unbaised and she is not a person to mince her words. The full- article is in today's newspaper. Please read it again.

Before PRC was recognised, only ROC was recognised by half the international community. Realistically ROC would want to do something to those who recognise PRC, unfortunately these countries were USSR and other commies which were much more powerful than Taiwan, which had to under the protection umbrella of the US. Now the table has turned. Countries can choose to recognise two China, but do the two china want to recognise you? There is still one china, it is which one do you recognise. The only parties which benefit from a broken China is the USA.<br><br>ROC and PRC have always recognise one china!!  If they agree, outsiders pls stay out. As they always say, this is our internal affair!!! Don't kaypor.<br><br>"Why don't chinese gov go for election in taiwan if they r the same country?" I don know what kind of question is that. The chinese actually want to send their own taiwan provincial governer but obviously taiwan would refuse. so china says, i will let you play your own election game, as long as you know the boundry.<br><br>About setting up company, do you know that if you want to set up a company in GZ you don't go to beijing. Part of the problem with our Shouzhou project is that lee thought he settled everything in beijing and it would be happy ever after. He forgot the estate was to be built in Shouzhou. Even in the US, different states have different rules. China is also very big, u no, like the US, not like singapore.<br><br>ROC and PRC were on the way to peaceful reunification, there were cross straits discussions even in Singapore and they were beginning to disucss the 'San tong" directly link land, sea and air!! Then lee teng hui betrayed the taiwanese ppl and ah bian came on stage, then the war games.....tell me who we should restrain, as a regional player concerns about the impact of a war in the straits??<br></div>

If that is the case, which side is America on?? I know if America is on the side of China, things will be simpler, but it seems America is on Taiwan side.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>I presume nobody was sure if all these pro-independence moves by ah bian was for real or just for election. LHL apparently went to find out what ah bian was really thinking about the issue. </blockquote>Just my opinion... first LHl don't have to go personally to find tat out. Second, A Bian relationship with LHL seems normally... nothing spectacular or something and he probably won't tell him much about the truth anyway... Tat is not much justification of his motives...<br><br><blockquote>The one china policy exists not just because "otherwise china is going to do something funny to them". Before PRC was recognised, only ROC was recognised by half the international community. Realistically ROC would want to do something to those who recognise PRC, unfortunately these countries were USSR and other commies which were much more powerful than Taiwan, which had to under the protection umbrella of the US. Now the table has turned. Countries can choose to recognise two China, but do the two china want to recognise you? There is still one china, it is which one do you recognise. The only parties which benefit from a broken China is the USA. </blockquote>Actually in other words, before china becomes powerful, more than 1/2 of the world do not treat china and taiwan as one but treat them as seperate entities... Now china become powerful, he can either choose to recognise his policy about 1 china or else china is not going to recognise u as anything ? In other words... isn't tat doing "something funny" to force nations to accept one china policy ? I mean do other nations have to follow and agree with every policy by china in order to be accepted ?<br><br><blockquote>ROC and PRC have always recognise one china!! If they agree, outsiders pls stay out. As they always say, this is our internal affair!!! Don't kaypor. </blockquote>ROC don't really recognise one china... I am staying out of the affair to be safe but just for the sake of discussion, I want to know the excuse behind it...<br><br><blockquote>"Why don't chinese gov go for election in taiwan if they r the same country?" I don know what kind of question is that. The chinese actually want to send their own taiwan provincial governer but obviously taiwan would refuse. so china says, i will let you play your own election game, as long as you know the boundry. </blockquote>Of course they cannot send a governer over  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>They should send some representatives and start to pull votes or something, not someone to control taiwan as if it had won an election... Anyway tat point is to emphasis tat Taiwan and China r already ruling as 2 seperate countries, like Ming and Qing.<br><br><blockquote>About setting up company, do you know that if you want to set up a company in GZ you don't go to beijing. Part of the problem with our Shouzhou project is that lee thought he settled everything in beijing and it would be happy ever after. He forgot the estate was to be built in Shouzhou. Even in the US, different states have different rules. China is also very big, u no, like the US, not like singapore. </blockquote>??<br>anyway it is still under the jurisdiction of the chinese gov, not taiwan gov isn' t it ? I never mention anything about beijing...<br><br><blockquote>ROC and PRC were on the way to peaceful reunification, there were cross straits discussions even in Singapore and they were beginning to disucss the 'San tong" directly link land, sea and air!! Then lee teng hui betrayed the taiwanese ppl and ah bian came on stage, then the war games.....tell me who we should restrain, as a regional player concerns about the impact of a war in the straits?? </blockquote>Then keep trying lor... but just the "sang tong" is still far from peaceful reunification. Their politics r a bit more.. special... but to win the heart of the people, force just makes things worse... Tat is the right direction though, compromise with each other.<br><br><blockquote>The Karen in Burma, the tigers in Sri Lanka, the separatists in south Thailand, the chechen in Russia, .....they all say the same thing! </blockquote>And look at the whole mess now. East germany and west germany is an example of peaceful reunification. Which is better ?<br><br><blockquote>Even for HK, china is hoping that in 50 yrs times, when china catches up with them in standard of living...the unification will be more natural.

He purposely provoke u guys and u took the bait and strengthen his case more ! Since A Bian is the president for more years to come, maybe u can try to think wat should be done with the current situation.<br><br><blockquote>"I believe the proportion will goes up a lot.

Hardly to say America is doing better than china.  The conflict between china and ameica, or in other words, between Chinese and Anglo-Saxon, will become dominant in the near future. unfortunately taiwan wants to take a chance of this.. good luck on them and all the best.<br>the suffering of china from those whites in the past will not justify china's would-be aggression on taiwan, but leaning into the lap of china's enemy will certainly put taiwan into very vulnerable situation.<br><br></div>
