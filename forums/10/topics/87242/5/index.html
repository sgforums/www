And we didn't know which area in China the SARS first come from, it may appeared in one of the areas where only villagers living in. And it will take time for them to travel to a town area to see a government doctor. And in mean time, the SARS will travel and spread. Not like Singapore where anyone can seek a goverment doctor immediately..and a SAR case is then recorded and action can be done immediately. But i do agreed with you on the Chinese govt covered up the SARS even they knew it...</div>

That is much worse than what "commie"  did in terms of leader sccession.  The funny thing is sg gov set up "speaker's corner" (forget in which year) to let world know sg is a democratic country. What a freak show!!! any democratic country will have to do this kind of show to let every one know if they are real democratic??  also i guess there is only one kind of voice coming from single tv station, and newspaper which is in the hand of sg gov. it is really beyond my understanding that so many people in here defend sg gov.. and try to convince me with one thing that sg. is a democratic society.  anyway,, i  do not know as individual in singapore what kind of punishment will result if you criticize sg gov. in the net forum like this.  or if there is no punishment, why everyone seems very defensive in this issue?? patriotic?? can not understand.. indeed..<br><br>moreover,, if it is illegal to have a number of people gathering, how people up there can have a party?? is it illegal?? how does this restriction work in the real life?? just out of curiosity,, nothing else.. maybe only sg gov can work out a way, which can only be accepted by sg people without any whinge. anybody minds giving me a reply about this??<br><br></div>
