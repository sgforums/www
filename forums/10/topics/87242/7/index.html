On an international level and comparing other political parties in other countries, they are more than very good.<br><br>(2) I agree that PAP sometimes use strongarm tactic to get rid of opposition. But I see some benefits to that, as well as some hidden worries. I shall not elaborate too much. I would just say that sometimes to get things done right and fast, you cannot have too many voices. The risk is when this same efficiency in execution is use for less-righteous purpose or when dumb decisions are made. Phillipines is an example of democracy gone wrong when there is too many voices.<br><br>For me, I look at the overall performance and not just one or two issues. There have been many times I disagree with this government. But overall they have done a lot more good than bad. The rest, well... many things (like your wife) comes in a package.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>First, I need to clarify a msiconception tat even some singaporean have themselves. To be guilty under illegal assembly, they must fufil 2 criteria<br><br>1) More than 4-5 people<br>2) THE <strong>INTENTION</strong> OF GATHERING IS TO PERFORM AN ILLEGAL PURPOSE<br><br>Wat do u mean by tat ? Gathering of people is legal. U can gather 1000 people for the national day parade and it is totally legal. Gathering for a party is also legal since they r not a gathering tat intend to perform an illegal purpose. However gathering for the purpose of rioting, demostration, strike etc becomes illegal.<br><br>The reason why tis law is in effect is because in the past, there r a lot of racial rioting, demostration, strike, gangfights etc. In the past singapore is in a turmoil too. When sufficient people (&gt;100) have gathered for rioting, then remedy action (tear gas, riot police, water cannon) will be too late and will incur the wrath of the people more. So tis law is to nip problem in the bud before it grew out of control. U seee, to prepare for a riot, certainly some people will arrive at the designated place more early than others. As such they will get arrested or "investigated" making the number of people preparing for rioting lesser, resulting in no starting seedlings necessary for rioting. If the authority acts only when a riot has started and in progress, then it is too late.<br><br>Pardon me for being frank... but tis law seems to be very capable in preventing any form of rioting, gangfights or demostration in singapore till now. Maybe it appears to be draconian to other people, but it certainly beats having to armed police with shields, spraying water cannon and tear gas at people or crushing them with tanks...<br><br><blockquote>that is very true. if there is war between china and taiwan, china must the one starting the attack.<br>the situation is like that.. china is out of option now. and taiwan trys to take a chance.. i guess taiwan thinks china will spend this period of time to get its economy up to certain level. and china will be put to second thoughts if they will attack taiwan at this moment. as china will get a lot of hostility around world because of doing this. and all achievement of getting its economy onto track will down to the drain. and if china keeps going like now and what it had done in the past 20 years.. in the foreseable future,, let's say next 20 years.. china will certainly become a world or at least regional superpower. at this time, taiwan will totall lose the chance of getting independence. and right now, at this moment, this is very good or the only chance to do this gambling. if every thing is going all right,, maybe taiwan can become independent without a war. if they miss this time,, taiwan will lose the chance forever. that is why taiwan starts pushing in the very hard way. or you may not like calling it "aggressive" way. but actually it is.. china is unwilling to get into war when its economy starts taking good shape.. and want to take advantage of this time to develope its shabby economy.. basically china is just forced into the corner. and run out of option other than force. it is common sense that china will make full use of this optimum period to develop. but shlt always happens as sb says in here.. </blockquote>Ya ya ya... I have been asking a question for some time now... wat is the rational tat taiwan must submit to china ? Wat is the reason tat taiwan should be part of china ? Now they r 2 different states altogether, and the most likely reunification means is through war, which will hurt both parties badly. Why don't u guys just let them be, or ignore them, or remains the status quo for them now ? Why purposely add the pressure, which result in making them more prone to independence ?</div>
