            <div class='col-md body'>My views.<br><br>1 SARS - Agree with what you said.<br><br>2 Tainanmem Square 4th June 1989 - Basically a bad situation and only a diplomatic genius can solve it peacefully. If they don't stop it, they run the risk of it spreading. If they do (which they did), they get comdemn. History has shown that this kind of situation can and do spread like wildfire. So, I can understand why the Chinese Government handle it that way (though that does not mean I agree to it).<br><br>3 Taiwan Issue<br>Historical burden. Complex situation. And add to that, a not so diplomatic China and a ask-for-trouble Ah Bian and Taiwan Media. Just the right mixture for trouble. China should learn to be more diplomatic and those rural Taiwanese should stop voting for this idiotic Ah Bian. As for whether Taiwan rightfully belongs to China - this is another complex question with no right answer.  Best scenario is to remain status quo.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Recalling the outbreak of SARS, I feel that China have indeed faulted in covering up the outbreak of SARS in their country, thus causing and costing many other countries to suffer losses in terms of economy and lives. I understand China's cover up was largely for their value of "face", and IGNORED the possibility of SARS becoming a global threat.<br><br>In my opinion, I feel that China created SARS out of their own ignorance and level of hygeine. But by covering up, they come across to me as being very SELFISH and EGOISTIC. Saving their face at the expense of the world.<br><br>I think that China is a fast growing economy, and that they are indeed advancing impressively, but, while they grew and advanced economically and technologically, their habits of living changed little or not at all. Fort instance, I noted on many occasions how China nationals living in Singapore shop for groceries in supermarkets like NTUC Fairprice, GIANT, and the likes; 1) Chossing a watermelon - picks up every one, shake it, knock it with their knuckles, tap it, and toss it back in the pile. 2) Choosing fresh crabs - picks up every single one, pry the shell open to look at how much roe there is inside the crab, and tossing it back if it doesn't have much or any. In your opnion as a reader of my posting, is this also your idea of Consumer Rights? Or don't you think this method of picking fresh produce, rather selfish and inconsiderate?<br><br>If you ask me, I firmly say that I DO NOT have a very good impression of China's people. I think they're IGNORANT, SELFISH, and BACKWARDLY besides being EGOTISTIC.<br></div>

My neighbours nextdoor from China but they are quite friendly and they are not selfish. Sometimes they cooked their hometown food and give us eat and my family aso do the same. Also last time my little brother which is autistic had a misunderstanding with the other neighbour (not from China) due to my brother misbehaving. I don't want to go further details what exactly happened but the china neighbour is the one that helped us solved the conflict, my family and i really appreciate it.<br><br>Well, IGNORANT, SELFISH, BACKWARDLY, EGOTISTIC. This 4 words will invite flamings later on tell ya. And this 4 words can be used on some Singaporeans i can tell ya. Yes SOME of the China's people really deserved this 4 words but i can aso tell you, some Singaporeans also deserve this 4 words.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Talking about being gracious etc... I guess only countries which r rich for some time can cultivate such behaviours. Singapore 10 years ago r not gracious as well... I remember stories of them pigging themselves in buffet or throwing rubbish on the streets and spitting on the ground. In fact all countries even Japan r not gracious when they r poor. Give china some time and they will improve.<br><br>Why was SARs covered up ? I do believe tat it has been in china for many months and gov do cover it up... but all because Jiang Ze Min is going to hand over power to Hu Jin Tao so Jiang try to "taichi" the problem to his predeccessor by covering it up. Just a rumour though...<br><br>Tiananmen is too much... they r the brightest university student in china then... Although u r right tat the revolt r getting out of control as other university r joinging in too.

As such I believe tat the political situation should change... at least modified so tat the people have more power than now.
