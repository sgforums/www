The police then were not properly equipped and organized to deal with such a large angry mob and thus the military had to be sent in.<br><br>Was just one of those unfortunate coincidences in my opinion. "<br><br>The above are two opinions which I heard and agree with.<br><br>I was in Beijing just before Tiananmen June 4. It was very obvious that the situation was going out of control. The students who started the sit in were reduced to minority in the end. Who were the rest? I have no idea. Before the tragic,  the heads of the government met with the leaders of the students, including Chai Ling, Wu Er Kai Si. The premier then, Zhou Zi Yang also came down to meet the students in the square. To me,  the students should have gone back to their campus and give the government time to respond. But they did not. Did they really expect the government, the communist government, to dissolve and start an election?? Wasn't that too much to expect? don't think even the american government would agree to them!!!!!!<br><br>Now the chinese government are smarter, they will not let anybody stage any kind of demonstration for more than an hour!! In June 4, the demonstration went on for weeks!!<br><br>The ending was tragic, no doubt, but it is too simplistic to blame just one party for it.<br><br>I am a Singaporean.<br><br></div>
