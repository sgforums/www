            <div class='col-md body'>Some analysis of LHL's visit from Asia Times:<br><br><a href="http://202.85.169.139/gate/gb/www.asiatimes-chinese.com/2004/07/0726rep.htm" rel="nofollow">http://202.85.169.139/gate/gb/www.asiatimes-chinese.com/2004/07/0726rep.htm</a><br><a href="http://202.85.169.139/gate/gb/www.asiatimes-chinese.com/2004/07/0727rep2.htm" rel="nofollow">http://202.85.169.139/gate/gb/www.asiatimes-chinese.com/2004/07/0727rep2.htm</a><br><br>Maybe the visit is a well-calculated move, or maybe SG government/LHL under-estimated the potential reaction from China.<br><br>It is a political game. There is no need to put too much emotion in it. In such game, big nation bulling small nation is a very common practice, and small country often play one big nation against another big one in order to get its benefit. That's the reality. Nation-to-nation can not be simply compared to individual-to-individual.<br><br>Both SG and CN are playing by the rule. It is nothing about betray or over-react. Every step is either well-calculated or mis-calculated. [/url]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by j28w32:</div><div class="quote_body">East and west germany united is a good example of this sort.. it would be very nice if china and taiwan can follow the suit.  but the reality is quite different between these two countries..  i am not interested in ideology at all. in my understanding, that is quite out of date concept. That is only being used as an excuse for sb's own purpose.. exactly like democracy.. american like using that..<br><br>the reunity issue is totally because of sth else.. it is related with the national interests, and the future of a country and people.  so i would say china can not afford to lose taiwan.<br><br>on the other hand,, taiwan knows the real situation of china right now... china wants to take this period of time to get its economy into a good shape.. and would not want to get into war in the first place unless it has got any opton.<br>and taiwan just wants to take advantage of this time,, and do sth like gambling..  maybe they thought if they do the "right" thing at this time,, maybe they can become independent and china is not so strong,, so china can not stop them. and they are very clear,, if the things keep going like this, china would become another world or at least regional power. taiwan would lose the chance forever.. That is where the "hurry" is coming from. it is not because of china, but taiwan starts pushing.. and playing the ball in the hard way.   also at the back of their mind they always think american will come to save if they go too far.<br>in the meanwhile, they created whole set of fancy names to support their intention of getting indepent.. those are just excuse.. and the dangerous part is taiwan serously underestimate the determination of china.. that would put taiwan into real disaster someday..<br><br></div></blockquote>I think China is at fault. By conducting exercises off the coast of Fujian, they have alienated and annoyed the Taiwanese people. This has been used by Chen SuiBian of Pan- Green Alliance to ramp up his support. Its like China taking a stone to hit her own feet.<br><br>Most Taiwanese want peace and not independence. China's aggressive stand will only alienate the Taiwanese further. I think China should put up a more friendly stand towards Taiwan.</div>
