I doubt the PM understand the in-depth wisdom in such time-honored practices and golden rule as mentioned in the foregoing.</div>

              <p>If PM Lee was right in saying there is no incompetence on the part of
              the minister or ministry of home affair then his father MM Lee was
              clearly wrong in saying to the Arab audience there was complacency in
              some places within the government.<br> <br> Is such complacency rectified. No PM Lee did not rectify such problems
              at all as can be seen in similar negligence in Took Leng How or Richard
              Yong escape in earlier repeated incidents.<br> <br> It looks like he will not admit complacency at all. He tried to make
              speeches to avoid such major mistake and shortcoming but is refusing to
              see such glaring complacency happening at every level of ISD and prison
              department on many past occasions.<br> <br> Just look at all these evidences of such complacency from the
              renovations of the prison toilet, the gaping holes in the toilet
              windows and the pipings next to the hole in the window, the manner of
              construction of fences all pointing to negligence on the part of ISD
              director and Prison Department and up all the way to the minister and
              PM Lee himself.<br> <br> I suggested process management being set up to oversee all civil
              servants' daily duties and responsibilities for many years now and they
              are too proud and are not listening.<br> <br> If they the civil servants are prepared to be hands-on answering for
              operational performance with databases coming in every month to confirm
              results how can there be such complacency and glaring errors of this
              dimension.<br> <br> This is the consequence of having too many Chieftains paid 5 figures
              and millions shuttling from meetings to meetings and concepts and
              assumptions with all the talks about their leadership and achievement
              with grandiose ideas and precepts but being unable to deliver results
              and performance.</p>

              <p>Actually results from third party sources are not reliable. The problem is the SIX figure chiefs are scholars with  helicopter views. Did WKS ever step foot into the detention centre while the renovations are taking place?</p>
              <p>And as to their grandoise ideas and precepts, there are none really. They simply lack the imagination to do so. Eye on Singapore - copy Eye on London. Gondola idea - copy of a copy (Macau copying Venice).</p>
