In the same report which you have 'conveniently' left out:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">"The Land Transport Authority is cool to the proposal. A spokesman said the locals-only rule is a way to help the less educated and lower-income citizens earn a living. It also protects the commuting public.<br><br>'If the vocational licence were issued to non-Singaporeans, it may be difficult to prosecute them for offences should they abscond from Singapore after committing the offence,' she said.<br><br>She said unlike bus drivers, many of whom are foreigners, cabbies 'are in closer proximity with passengers'."</span><br><br>The LTA has been looking after the interests of Singapore cabbies and resisting the move towards foreign can drivers...despite the fact that many commuters and taxi companies would welcome it as it would lower costs.<br><br></div>
