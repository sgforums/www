            <div class='col-md body'>the report is quite spot-on.  try advertising for sales asst and cashiers - many calls.   but few locals and most are PRs (from m'sia or china).   even when scheduled for interviews, many singaporeans do not bother to turn up.<br><br>a few weeks ago, i was helping a family fren who advertised for staff in the food industry.  when the call is from a singaporean, it typically goes like this : how long is lunch break ? any tea break ? do you provide meals ? can have weekend off ? how about public holidays ? can increase weekend rates ?  sigh . . .   i feel like I am being interviewed instead.   and mind you, they have not even enquired about job scope !<br><br>no choice. we ended up employing 2 PRs - and i was told that they were excellent workers.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">note : by spot-on - i'm referring to the low take-up rate by singaporeans for these jobs.  many see it as beneath them.</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>aiyah, working in retail and security guard no need high education lah. The govt keep raising the percentage of workforce who have poly, JC and university education. So now not enough O level and PSLE students in the work force already.<br><br>Those people who have tertiary education dont want to work in retail is correct, they follow govt's planning mah. I think govt plan to put everyone through uni is not for them to work in retail or security guard.<br><br>So unless these firms willing to accept 40-50 yrs old lor otherwise now youngsters almost everyone has a degree or diploma, how to work there? Their parents want or not?<br><br>Ask govt to change the plan, make more people get phD or Masters, then degree holders can work in retail lor.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I remember reading in another thread, there is another reason why many locals are unwilling to take up these low paying jobs. No offence but retail jobs that pay less than $700 a month is really low paying, regardless of the hours.<br><br>Many foreigners from PRC, India, Malaysia (lesser extent) are willing to work for absurdly low pay because they are here for a fixed period of time. They scrimp and save, and try very hard to earn extra side incomes (legal or otherwise) so that they can take the money they've earn back home.<br><br>Imagine converting our SGD into rupees or renminbi, you can imagine how rich they are back home. They can buy a small plot of land or open a small provision stall and live easy the rest of their lives.<br><br>How many locals are able to escape to another country to be able to retire there spending in either rupees or renmingbi? Only a few. Furthermore, we have to consider the CPF contribution which we are unable to touch until we retire, and if there isn't enough in the CPF, you still can't touch it even after retirement.<br><br>How many of us can say we can survive for at least 1 year after losing our jobs? How many of us are ASSURED of having half a million SGD upon retirement? Not many, hence many of us want higher, and higher and higer pay. Its materialism, granted, but also necessity.<br><br>Next thing you'll ask, why sit around jobless when you can earn few hundred a month? Well, being fresh to the workforce, I face a similiar situation. should I accept a low pay while looking for another job? Or should I concentrate on looking for a job that meets my (reasonable) pay demand?<br><br>I chose to get a low paying job while looking for another higher paying job.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by SilverPal:</div><div class="quote_body">I remember reading in another thread, there is another reason why many locals are unwilling to take up these low paying jobs. No offence but retail jobs that pay less than $700 a month is really low paying, regardless of the hours.<br><br>Many foreigners from PRC, India, Malaysia (lesser extent) are willing to work for absurdly low pay because they are here for a fixed period of time. They scrimp and save, and try very hard to earn extra side incomes (legal or otherwise) so that they can take the money they've earn back home.<br><br>Imagine converting our SGD into rupees or renminbi, you can imagine how rich they are back home. They can buy a small plot of land or open a small provision stall and live easy the rest of their lives.<br><br>How many locals are able to escape to another country to be able to retire there spending in either rupees or renmingbi? Only a few. Furthermore, we have to consider the CPF contribution which we are unable to touch until we retire, and if there isn't enough in the CPF, you still can't touch it even after retirement.<br><br>How many of us can say we can survive for at least 1 year after losing our jobs? How many of us are ASSURED of having half a million SGD upon retirement? Not many, hence many of us want higher, and higher and higer pay. Its materialism, granted, but also necessity.<br><br>Next thing you'll ask, why sit around jobless when you can earn few hundred a month?

It's just that they don't view it as a problem, and that their prevailing policies and general scheme of things are in line with their "National Buildling" plans.<br><br>Since when, have they ever seen things at our level? From what we can all see, they're only keen in making more money through all of our needs, wants, ills, and troubles.<br><br>We're just laying eggs, and they're just collecting them.
