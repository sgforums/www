That is why we simply cannot afford to compete at the same level as foreign workers...on their terms. Some of you mentioned that FT are getting management jobs rather than menial jobs as road sweepers. Shouldn't we ask why is it that our graduates are not more highly valued as managers compared to foreigners? Pay is only one factor. If our graduates are far more effective managers than the FT, why should firms choose foreigners? If one of ours can bring in more income for the company than two foreigners, which boss would be daft enough to hire a foreigner instead at 20% less pay?<br><br>London paid its fund managers 1-million pound bonuses last Christmas, because these fund managers bring in billions for their financial firms. The UK hires thousands of foreign workers to build their liquified natural gas (LNG) facilities, but the engineers were British nationals who have been brought back from the Middle East at high salaries.

Yes, they do...not for everyone but enough Singaporeans have seen their wages increase to create the demand for the latest mp3 and duo core laptops. Perhaps they are just the elite? Yes, perhaps they are but if so, the elite group is big enough to create the demand for the ever increasing car population (despite the high costs of car ownership), the rising house prices and the increasing number of Singaporeans who go overseas for holidays and studies. In fact, our wages have increased too much relative to those of our competitors, which is why locals are losing their jobs to foreigners who are able to acquire similar skills.<br><br>For example, a local bricklayer is paid S$65 per day, whilst a foreign worker in Singapore doing the same job is paid S$23 per day. A bricklayer in neighbouring Malaysia is paid only 10 ringgit a day. Singaporean bricklayers will have to be three times as productive as the FT in Singapore and 10 times as productive as his counterpart in Malaysia.

It is true that the rich are getting wealthier and the poor are getting poorer. There are enough people who are getting higher wages to support the higher costs of living in Singapore. On the other hand, the poorer Singaporeans are also the ones whose skills cannot match those of our competitors who are far cheaper.

There are enough of these surgeons who can bid top prices for COEs and pay millions of dollars for condos to ensure car and house prices remain high.<br><br>The way forward is to constantly evaluate our own competitiveness and either upgrade or switch vocations entirely as the economy re-structures.<br><br>BTW, if you are trying to blame the LCD screens for the rising MRT fares, that is not true. The LCD screens are more than sufficiently paid for by the companies who put up adverts...the cost of installation is not the reason for the rising train fares.<br><br></div>

If commuters cannot afford it and no longer take taxis, the fares will have to come down or else more taxi drivers will lose their jobs. But if the taxi fare drops, taxi drivers will have lower salaries. If the fares remain high despite fewer commuters, then some taxi drivers will become jobless. The cost of living is driven up by consumers who can afford it and salaries are ultimately tied in with the cost of living.<br><br>Although I am Singaporean, unlike you I see that in a globalised economy, your nationality matters little nowadays. Bear is right that purely capitalist policies are cruel but they are here to stay. Communism has utterly failed. Companies do not care where you were born...it's how much money you can bring to the company that matters.<br><br>The flies won't be coming to Singapore if our employers don't want them. When one bricklayer in Singapore costs as much as 3 foreign talents and 10 Malaysian bricklayers, it's time for our bricklayers to consider a different job. Unless you become like some Indian god with 10 pairs of hands and legs, how can you compete with your Malaysian counterparts?<br><br>Please look around and see how the world has changed. If the government were to pass a law tomorrow banning all foreign talent, many of our companies and factories will close and move to China. Singaporeans stand to lose even more. Indeed the rising costs of living affects me as much as it does you. But the solution is not to whine about foreign talent and hope they go away...the solution is to be able to offer a skill that foreign talents do not have. No doubt they will learn even that skill eventually, but we must constantly stay one step ahead.<br><br></div>

If commuters cannot afford it and no longer take taxis, the fares will have to come down or else more taxi drivers will lose their jobs. But if the taxi fare drops, taxi drivers will have lower salaries. If the fares remain high despite fewer commuters, then some taxi drivers will become jobless. The cost of living is driven up by consumers who can afford it and salaries are ultimately tied in with the cost of living.<br><br>Although I am Singaporean, unlike you I see that in a globalised economy, your nationality matters little nowadays. Bear is right that purely capitalist policies are cruel but they are here to stay. Communism has utterly failed. Companies do not care where you were born...it's how much money you can bring to the company that matters.<br><br>The flies won't be coming to Singapore if our employers don't want them. When one bricklayer in Singapore costs as much as 3 foreign talents and 10 Malaysian bricklayers, it's time for our bricklayers to consider a different job. Unless you become like some Indian god with 10 pairs of hands and legs, how can you compete with your Malaysian counterparts?<br><br>Please look around and see how the world has changed. If the government were to pass a law tomorrow banning all foreign talent, many of our companies and factories will close and move to China. Singaporeans stand to lose even more. Indeed the rising costs of living affects me as much as it does you. But the solution is not to whine about foreign talent and hope they go away...the solution is to be able to offer a skill that foreign talents do not have. No doubt they will learn even that skill eventually, but we must constantly stay one step ahead.<br><br></div></blockquote>Do u think taxi drivers want the taxi fare to go up???

You have to be better than they are, accept a lower pay or you won't stand a chance. Managed care organizations are looking for cheap doctors and the top universities have a plethora of talent to choose from the foreign doctors that have arrived all over the world. The rule is still true that unless you possess superior skills, you will have trouble finding a high-paying job.<br><br><blockquote><strong>Talking about average S'poreans who earn about S$20k -30k p.a if their son /daughter is now studing M in NUS,do u know the tuition fee per year ???more than 35% of the average salaries earned p.a by Sporean.<br><br>Is the 177% tuition fee hike caused by us or the gov???</strong></blockquote>The fees in NUS are far too high, I agree with that. But still there are hundreds of students who apply to come in each year....just as people complain about the high costs of car ownership but still buy BMWs. There are also scholarships (albeit only for a few top students) available that will pay most if not all the fees...<br><br>In addition, you do not have to study medicine and you are free to read it in overseas universities, an increasing number of which are recognized.<br><br>Presumably you are trying to say that doctors have to charge much more to recoup the costs of their medical education? I have no issue with that...but if the doctor from India can perform just as well as one from NUS and accepts a lower pay, why should hospitals employ local doctors?<br><br><blockquote><strong>May I know who cause these rental,transportation and  misc expenses to go up and up??? Worst still, Dr Wong told be that they have to increase consultation fee from S$20 to S$25 due to revised HDB?JTC rental and misc price hike.</strong></blockquote>Your GP friend Dr Wong makes a business decision to increase his consultation charges whilst other GPs may decide to close shop and work in polyclinics for the government. Some GPs are successful, others are not. As I said, why should GPs earn 10k when some Consultants in government hospitals do not earn as much? As you yourself said, competition is keen among GPs, which means there are GPs who are prepared to charge a lower consultation fee and yet survive the competition. That is good to keep healthcare costs low...It's the survival of the fittest out there..<br><br><blockquote><strong>I am telling u we will not hesitate  to leave this beloved country if we cant take it anymore!!! .More than 3% of our professionals had left and migrated from Spore  for/to other countries. SG gov are attracting flies to our country who will not create economic and they will bring along a lot of social problems</strong></blockquote>If they want you and you think you will have a better life there, go! Who's stopping you? Our ancestors from China and India came to Singapore because they felt they could have a better life here. If you feel you are better off in the US, go! Let younger Chinese and Indians take your place and improve their lives and those of their children.[/quote]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>So much talk about making 20K-30K per month. Globalisation can only mean one thing. The wages of developed countries will have to go downwards in order to remain competitive. Can't expect wages of Indians and Chinese to rise to our level. That will cause their countries to lose the competitive edge. The signs are already showing. Gov't try to make it gradual so that we won't feel the pain.<br>India and China are already fighting to keep costs down in order to compete for business. Africa will soon join the ranks as cheap foreign talents. What ever talents Singapore has, there are more in China and India, and cheaper too.<br>Say good bye to high wages. Those who are still earning thousands of dollars per month better live within your means. It's not going to be forever.</div>
