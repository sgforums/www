Steal jobs from others who are more expensive? Of course, that's the way to go in our globalised economy. If you can offer your skills at a lower price and yet perform as well as your foreign counterparts, you get the job. If they can do better than you at a lower price, you lose yours. If the government tries to protect your job by not allowing foreign workers in, your boss will just move his business overseas. Then Singapore will lose twice: once because you lose your job and twice because the government loses their taxes from the company.</div>

The fact is, if you work as a maid, you are competing at the same level as your maid. You earn the same sort of salary and you can only expect to have to the same quality of life, ie. $10k pesos in the Phillippines. You can withdraw your CPF if you renounce your citizenship and emigrate there....and you will enjoy the same benefits as your maid.<br><br>The fact is, if we choose to live in a first world country like Singapore and enjoy the quality of life in a first world nation, we must be able to compete at a higher level than your maid. And btw, a car is a luxury and damages the environment. You can get by more easily in Singapore without a car...use public transport.</div>

Assuming that I take the CPF factor out of the equation so that I am competing at the same level as my maid. That fact remains that, we do not choose which country to live in, we are citizens of our respective countries, like it or not.<br><br>With full knowledge of her return to phillippines, and her ability to return there to her friends and family, she can take up such low paying jobs in sg. But with the knowledge that its going to cost me a bomb (since I'm earning so low wages) to migrate to a country whose language and culture is foreign to me, and I might have to remain in sg to live the rest of my life, then suddenly we come to realise that my spending power is significantly less that hers.<br><br>Its like how the Indians and PRCs here are able to undercut local workers as they know they can convert their savings to their local currency in their own countries and their spending power back home might be more that their employers spending power in sg.<br><br>Hence many singaporeans, with knowledge that they MIGHT not be able to migrate, due to whatever reasons, would have to take the highest possible paying job they can get. Any job that does not give them the means to support themselves and maybe 1 or 2 dependents cannot possibly in good sense be considered.<br><br>Hence, (most) poorer singaporeans cannot be said to be choosy or picky about their jobs but rather pragmatic.

As reported in Zaobao, graduates from Sichuan University are taking on jobs as nannies in Beijing for S$300 a month. Your dollars will go further there.<br><br>I note that the Minister of Health is also considering this option when he suggested building retirement homes in Batam etc. That is a possible and logical option.</div>

If we want to live in a first world country like Singapore, we can only expect first world prices.<br><br>The cost of living is tied in with our salaries. If bus drivers want higher salaries of 1.5-2.5k a month, you cannot expect bus fares to remain at 25 cents. If we lower costs at hospitals and polyclinics, we will have to cut the salaries of our nurses and doctors. If we want school fees to drop, we have to pay our teachers less.<br><br>Of course the purchasing power of S$1 in Sichuan is very different from that in Singapore. But you cannot expect to have a western-trained qualified surgeon to take out your appendix, your children will not have teachers of the same calibre as those in Singapore and you have to walk an hour to the nearest town just to send a telegram.<br><br>That's why Khaw Boon Wan said that Singaporeans have to moderate our expectations if we want cheaper healthcare. That follows in other fields as well. Our bus service and MRT are very good and comfortable compared to those in the UK...(try taking the London Underground in summer...jam packed and no aircon but costs 5 times more)...if we want even lower fares, we will have to accept a drop in quality.<br><br>The taxi driver Poolman says he can earn 2-2.5k a month with no problems. If we want to cut taxi fares, he may have to take a salary cut as well.<br><br>Lower salaries in Singapore will lower the cost of living and will make Singapore less attractive as a destination for foreign workers. But talented Singaporeans who can find jobs in the West where the pay is higher will move out, causing a massive brain drain. That is what's happening in China and India. I have met top Chinese doctors working in the best hospitals and Universities in the US, whilst the hospitals in their hometown in China are stuck in the 1950s. Sure, the returning Sichuan worker from Singapore will be able to afford much more than his neighbour in Sichuan, but he will not have access to these western-trained doctors either.<br><br>Lower salaries will lower the cost of living in Singapore but it will also make foreign imported goods and services more expensive and less affordable. Your barber may charge you less but you cannot afford that MP3 player or your laptop now. And by the way, your filippino maid could well decide to work for Hong Kongers instead..</div>

It's because foreigners are willing to accept a lower pay. I agree that foreigners are willing to do that because their families in China or India can live very well on the meagre sum he sends home. But remember that his children in China do not have the kind of education your children have, neither do they have access to the kind of education, healthcare or transport system we are accustomed to.<br><br>The cost of living in a first world nation like Singapore is obviously much higher than that in third world nations. Unless we are prepared to accept a lower standard of living, we must be ready to pay a higher price as well.<br><br>The solution is not to drastically cut the cost of living but to greatly increase our income. That is why we simply cannot afford to compete at the same level as foreign workers...on their terms. Some of you mentioned that FT are getting management jobs rather than menial jobs as road sweepers. Shouldn't we ask why is it that our graduates are not more highly valued as managers compared to foreigners? Pay is only one factor. If our graduates are far more effective managers than the FT, why should firms choose foreigners? If one of ours can bring in more income for the company than two foreigners, which boss would be daft enough to hire a foreigner instead at 20% less pay?<br><br>London paid its fund managers 1-million pound bonuses last Christmas, because these fund managers bring in billions for their financial firms. The UK hires thousands of foreign workers to build their liquified natural gas (LNG) facilities, but the engineers were British nationals who have been brought back from the Middle East at high salaries. Why? Because they have specialized knowledge that foreign engineers do not.<br><br>The reason local workers lose out to foreign workers is that their skills are not sufficiently covetable to justify the salaries they seek.</div>
