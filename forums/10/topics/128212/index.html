            <div class='col-md body'>Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi has expressed "deep remorse" over Japan's wartime aggression in Asia at the Asia-Africa summit in Jakarta.<br><br>I suspect that this apology is merely strategic as Japanese MPs recently<br>visited the War Memorial and the issue regarding the textbook was not<br>dealt with. The whole textbook thing was also probably a deception as<br>the textbooks were not widely adopted before and the Japanese government<br>knew that it will be the same this time round. However, it allowed the Japanese government to arouse Chinese nationalistic feelings. And the Chinese naively played along. It gave them the opportunity to label China a 'scary' country. China's refusal to apologize after the attack on the Japanese embassy allowed the Japanese to portray themselves as the victims and China as unreasonable and irrational. With the Prime Minister's apology, Japan gained the moral high ground. Japan is seen as the more reasonable, rational, co-operative and peaceful among the 2 countries. Furthermore, China's strong opposition to Japan's acceptance to the Security Council is seen as aggressive and allowing regional politics to interfere with an International system. This whole issue also caused a greater scrutiny of China's own human rights record.<br><br>This tactic is not new. The US has used it against a previous super-power, the Soviet Union, in the Cold War. They advertised themselves as the 'country of freedon' while the communist Soviet Union is condemned as repressive. And recently, they began to label countries as the "Axis of Evil" and some countries as allies to terrorists. It is apparent that Japan seeks to sway world opinion that China is a threat and steps must be taken to contain its growth, just like how the US did with the Soviet Union. China has not helped itself in this matter. It displayed what people think as a conduct unbecoming of a future superpower.<br><br>So, round 1 to Japan. Next move.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The number of Chinese protesting against Japan is just a very very small drop of China's population. It certainly doesn't prove anything. Most Chinese have nothing against the Japanese. In fact there are more and more Japanese who see China as a great place to live in and are migrating to China in numbers. Here is the related article about Japanese migration to China:<br><br>http://www.muninn.net/blog/archives/000229.html<br><br>It has been 60 years since the war ended but even until today the Japanese government are still denying and glorifying their past mistakes. What's the reason behind this?<br><br>I think that the Japanese government is trying to stir up nationalistic sentiments among its citizens in order to divert their attention from its ailing economy. By continuing to whitewash their altrocities, the Japanese government is trying to incite foreign countries to stage protests against them, this will anger the Japanese and help rally the people of Japan behind the ruling government.<br><br>What's most disturbing is that in recent years in Japan itself, ethnic Chinese and Korean and their properties are frequently subjected to unprovoked death threats and attacks from Japanese nationalists. Look at these articles:<br><br>http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2004-04/23/content_325864.htm<br><br>http://210.145.168.243/pk/066th_issue/98102107.htm<br><br>http://www.imadr.org/imadr_jc/song_hesuk.html<br><br>What have the japanese government been teaching their younger generations anyway? Why do they have so much hatred towards Chinese and Koreans when China and Korea have never done anything ill towards Japan?</div>

Another thing is that since the Japanese economic bubble burst in the early 1990s, their economy has shrunk for more than 10 consecutive years. The unemployment rate is still high and foreigners are seen as competitors who took away their jobs and hence more and more discrimination against foreigners.</div>

That's why during these periods, countries are scrutinizing and judging China's foreign policies, deciding whether having China as a superpower would be best for the future. This is especially true for the Europeans countries as they are not part of Asia and may not benefit much or could be threatened by Asia's growth.  The shift of power from the West to the East may also be uncomfortable to them as they are not as familiar with the culture.  They probably prefer India as a superpower as India was a former colony and has retained a Western structure while China's structure is different. Europeans are also critical of China's past and its human rights record.<br><br>The global media is also still mostly controlled by US and Britain. They can still influence public opinion and portray China's moves in a harsher light that what it actually is. The Europeans are still pretty neutral so far.

A lot of Chinese people around the world are closely following the news to see how China is going to engage US and Japan in power play games. And they aren't just getting their news from the Western media. The 22 million  signatures obtained around the world for the online petitions against Japan's U.N. Security Council permanent seat bid have proven the far reach of the Asian media as well.</div>

The world has to keep an eye on its ulterior motives in dealing with Japan. Other countries must form alliances in case Japan decides to ally with USA to control Asia.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just wanna bring a few related things up:<br><br>-US asked japan to play stronger role asia regional securrty.<br><br>-Japan made a bid to ask for release its military sanction<br>or strengthening its defence force citing growing threat from china<br>(somehting like tat...)<br><br>-US wants to support India to become asia superpower<br>and offer to sell next generation military crafts to india.<br>.. this was followed by china approaching india to cooperate<br>and exchange industry expectise. something like tat...<br><br>All these moves were made by US and Japan all bcos<br>of their fear of China rising power.<br>One analysis even view the US strategy as analogous<br>to former president Nixon's strategy of forming allied forces<br>w France against rising power of germany (if i rembr correctly)<br><br>My personal sad view to these is that, they have labeled China<br>as dangerous even b4 it had done anything.<br>It seemed more dangerous as they are provoking China<br>rather than coorperating w them.<br><br>If theres any more new conflicts, it seemed to be started by US and Japan.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I second kheldorin's view.<br><br>Its all part of Japan (and US) strategy to make the world think<br>that china is a dangerous nation. Its all a plot.<br><br>Then, perhaps it can get UN permission to regrow its military industry.<br>Another lucrative industry where it can display its engineering might,<br>which had been in denial for 60yrs.<br><br>And this will indirectly provide for economic growth and regional power,<br>esp w US cooperation,<br>in face of the growing pressure in power and economy from China.<br></div>
