              <p>you want to take the MIW down, fight them on topics and issues

                                                  your own inabilities just give them more firepower to shoot you

              <p>go figure out what the real issues are.. and why they require
                                                  debate.. instead of ranting and raging.. because, pardon me, your

              <p>Do you notice how its all the stupid or stupider people of the society, as can be seen from their poor education and upbringing, that are the most easy and convenient preys of the propaganda and emotional rousing of the SDP and other crazed psychotic nutcases? Because these losers lack the necessary logical faculties and reason, they are unable to process information, digest and rationalise, or think through critically the various facets of an argument, the various ramifications of issues, the various consequences of something, the long and short term perspectives.</p>
              <p>Because of their low IQ, they are very easy to target for brainwashing and rabble-rousing.</p>
              <p>One recent example is their remarks about the Romanian diplomat who has diplomatic immunity. Their ability to connect anything, even an entirely civil matter like a husband and wife quarrelling to the PAP, and bring in the government in for a bashing, has cheaped their position to offer any constructive feedback in any manner, as their credibility is non existent.</p>
              <p>Another recent example of the acts of these low-class and low IQ peasant lunatics can be witnessed in a thread I started about my office-related complaints. One of these low class and low IQ lunatics posted to claim I was a supporter of a political party when I'm completely uninterested in party politics, and when the thread at hand has NOTHING to do with even current affairs, let alone socio-political affairs and party politics. Later another fuckwit came in and started talking about PAP and connecting the issue about someone feeling unhappy at work and attributing it one political party!!! I know, its very very amusing to people like us.. the antics of these clowns and losers. So dumb right.. I can't imagine them even being able to get past primary 2.</p>
              <p>These people are so stupid, I wish they would practise what they claim and get out of Singapore as their very citizenship is perilous to the future of the nation and will cause genetic dilusion.</p>

              <p>My point is simple,if the PAP government want Singaporeans to accept lower pay,then LKY,LHL n boot-licker GCT should have their pays cut first.No use going around asking Singaporeans to accept lower salary while they themselves enjoy highest pay in the world,thats totally hypocrite.</p>
              <p>And Temasek has lost millions of dollars in foreign investment,this show that Ho Chin is not that talented.So can someone in the government tell me why she is still the chairman n getting high salary.</p>

              <p>Businessmen need, sorry, its want,Â to earn money. The more the better.</p>
              <p>Its expected they will hire who is cheaper , younger or accept contract, non-permanentÂ work.</p>
              <p>With the FT policy being so open, prolly the most open in the world, its hard to be pro-citizen.</p>
              <p>As more citizens who are retrenched,Â like due to restructuring etc,Â and middle-aged turn to running a business as form of income, more citizens have become employers. What would these do to survive? Hire cheaper labor.Â </p>
              <p>As more foreigners easily come here to setup a business or as more PRs do the same, what would they do to earn more money? Hire cheaper labor.</p>
              <p>Having a degree or skill does not gurantee long term or permanent employment anymore these days. skills can be found in many people in this worldÂ like from 3rd worlds. The 'cheaper labor' salaryÂ is good moneyÂ to them. As we age, and it is now 2010, we need to compete with younger cheaper labor who can easily come here and apply for your kind of job. There is no reason why a company should not hire a cheaper, similarly skilled labor who can work on contract and does not have to afford kids or a flat or a car or wife.</p>
              <p>But of course many still survive retrenchments. Some even escape all retrenchments. Some born with silver spoon. Some don't know what is poverty. Some given big fat lobang.</p>
              <p>Good luck yall. This is the system chosen.</p>

              <p>you are looking only at the surface value, you do not go deep into the industrial and see what the govt or the unions is trying create, it quite painsickening. The paid is not low, $1800 + O/t and when graduated after 2 years, you can get 2.5k to 3k, but our people simply cannot stand the hardship as what our forefather did, see the ship only, run liao, see bangalas workers only, siam liao, see the hot sun only, sick liao, wear helmet and those safety stuff, tired liao...so how??</p>
              <p>Same goes my the pilot project by the Food and beverageÂ  employer's association together with govt and their unions, in a tripartite way, we worked together to form an alliance to get Singaporeans in, we share our vacancy available from hotels to pubs like mine into a career link committee who will look out for Singaporeans to match the jobs, if they are not suitable, govt can train them to match it.</p>
              <p>I got 3 drivers who work as driver to take customers home if they drink too much, one of them is an indian national, PR status, the other two are Singaporean Uncles, there are paid $1200 per month just for driving, and yet they can also get tips from rich customer whom they sent home. When i said, look, you guys are just waiting for people get drunk, why dun you help out in some cleaning and washing in the pubs, or even wash car for customers, so that you can earn more money and i also can paid you more...the Indian PR guy was very happy, the 2 singaporeans uncles stared at me and asked, Hello, boss, you siao or not?

              <p><br>My stand is still the same.</p>
              <p>Import foreign labour for the lowest of jobs (that locals do not want to do). Given that the govt wants 1 in 4 Singaporeans to have a degree, I do not think that necessarily equates to us being weak and not wanting to do difficult jobs. If you ask a local to study until he gets a graduate degree, and then go and pour coffee and tea at the coffeeshops, then, why then are we wasting resources into training our locals?</p>
              <p>Import foreign talent (EXPATS) for the highest of jobs (Senior Management, Specialists that we lack)</p>
              <p>Leave the middle job market for locals. If businesses are given too easy a time to hire cheap labour, there is no way our businesses will mature and learn how to value personnel over longer terms.</p>
              <p>In a way, Adam Khoo laments at the weakness of our youths. I lament at the weakness of businesses such as his (and angel7030's if she has one), in only going for cost as the <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">sole criteria of selection</span></strong>, for it demonstrates that our businesses also need to grow up (as our youths need to)</p>

              <p>You are spot-on. It's not just rabble-rousing.</p>
              <p>Do you notice how its all the stupid or stupider people of the society, as can be seen from their poor education and upbringing, that are the most easy and convenient preys of the propaganda and emotional rousing of the SDP and other crazed psychotic nutcases? Because these losers lack the necessary logical faculties and reason, they are unable to process information, digest and rationalise, or think through critically the various facets of an argument, the various ramifications of issues, the various consequences of something, the long and short term perspectives.</p>
              <p>Because of their low IQ, they are very easy to target for brainwashing and rabble-rousing.</p>
              <p>One recent example is their remarks about the Romanian diplomat who has diplomatic immunity. Their ability to connect anything, even an entirely civil matter like a husband and wife quarrelling to the PAP, and bring in the government in for a bashing, has cheaped their position to offer any constructive feedback in any manner, as their credibility is non existent.</p>
              <p>Another recent example of the acts of these low-class and low IQ peasant lunatics can be witnessed in a thread I started about my office-related complaints. One of these low class and low IQ lunatics posted to claim I was a supporter of a political party when I'm completely uninterested in party politics, and when the thread at hand has NOTHING to do with even current affairs, let alone socio-political affairs and party politics. Later another fuckwit came in and started talking about PAP and connecting the issue about someone feeling unhappy at work and attributing it one political party!!! I know, its very very amusing to people like us.. the antics of these clowns and losers. So dumb right.. I can't imagine them even being able to get past primary 2.</p>
              <p>These people are so stupid, I wish they would practise what they claim and get out of Singapore as their very citizenship is perilous to the future of the nation and will cause genetic dilusion.</p>

              <p>In this debate the one key elements regards to FT is the lack of understanding global movement for Singaporean.</p>
              <p>If you look at the Koreans they move globally and they established their business network globally. And they establish business within their community globally given opportunity for their own people.</p>
              <p>Personnally i would give every opportunity to Singaporean even if they left Singapore because i know that they still Call Singapore home and they are the contact For singapore home grown business.</p>
              <p>But I would not Give FT and opportunityÂ as a steping stone cause they would treatÂ e.g. for the sake of discussion China as their home grown opportunity.</p>
              <p>So while the topics of dicussion is about hringÂ foreign cheaper worker. Your notion that Singaporean fall prey to SDP propaganda assume Singaporean areÂ unable to think for themselves. You means those that can think already left....Singapore?</p>

              <p>Every rich person's home is probably riddled with home politics. That DOES NOT mean he is not borned with a silver spoon.</p>
              <p>Looking at his views, can see that he has not suffered before. It is very clear from the way he said how Singaporeans demand $2500 and foreigners only demand $2000, that he has not the need to eat only to survive, and save to survive.</p>
              <p>Even now, the MOM has increased its protection of workers in its employment act to workers who earn $2000 and below. Therefore, $2500 is just slightly above their definition of those who are not earning enough, and require help to defend their rice bowls.</p>

              <p>i wonder why foreigners would come to sg and work for less than 2k per month.</p>
              <p>if they have masters from good uni.shouldnt they be able to find a job in their own country? even if they can't find something to fit their skills, they shouldnt be earning as low as 2k? even a random restaurant manager can earn that much.</p>
              <p>i question the validity of this claim.</p>
