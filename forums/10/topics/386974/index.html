              <p>http://www.adam-khoo.com/304/the-expats-will-rule-singapore/</p>
              <p>I hate to say this but in a way,<strong> I prefer to hire expats for my own business than locals.</strong> Expats are willing to work long hours, go the extra mile, are fiercely loyal to you and don’t complain so much. They also come alot more qualified and do not ask the moon for the remuneration. Recently, I placed an ad for a marketing executive. Out of 100+ resumes, more than 60% came from expats. While locals fresh grads are asking for $2,500+ per month,<strong> I have expats with masters degrees from good universities willing to get less than $2,000</strong>! They know that if they can come in and learn and work hard, they will eventually climb up and earn alot more. They are willing to invest in themselves, pay the price for future rewards.<strong> Sometimes I wonder how some of the locals are going to compete with this.</strong></p>

              <p>it is better to let Singaporean a feel of the global market competition now rather than later, now they understand they are not worth that much to walk around, point and point there while earning a 5 figure paid, these will motivate them work harder and smarter, so that in a long run, our Singaporeans PMET or workers will be able to adapt to any condition set about in the global market.</p>
              <p>Vice Versa, even if you decided to leave this country and work in another country, you are also a global labourer competing with the country you are going to work for, the real situation now to all Singaporean is, there is no more a silver plater job in front of you anymore. Dun assume that once graduated, you can have a manager job, a good career, a nice house, a beautiful wife and if can, a mistress too and well paid. Those are heyday of the 70s and 80s, today, in knowledge and global economy, you have to prove yourself sell your skills and talents to the world, market yourself and alway be valuable to the market condition. No more long life employment just point finger here and there while earning 5 figures paid, with many perks including share options.</p>
              <p>Today, technically speaking, in jobs or business, it is the same in a way that you need to be special, you need to have that added value to convince people that your are worth what they are paying for,..it is no more a making up of nos in the hierrachy trees, the essence is to be different, special, creative and innovative.</p>
              <p>If young graduates are naive about the current situation and still hoping for a nice cosy office job with 2 to 3 Angels secretaries like me serving them, I think most employer will said, Thank you Mr so and so, we will call you if you are selected, thanks for coming.</p>

              <p>whatever it is, when supply exceed demand, employers will be in a better position, it is an employer market now. Given a same responsibility and tasks, from an employer perspective, if you FT less than a local, in a long run, you expect the FT to get slacked. If you paid both the same, the local will most likely give up, and if you give the FT more than the local, then something must be wrong in the wage policies.</p>
              <p>Unlike our predecessors, we youngs tend to look at short term rather than long term benefits, if bosses said  wait, you will get your chance, I think most young peoples will give up, the impulse is to get it now or never, kind of like getting instant sucess. But you cannot we, the young ones, as such the working condition in Singapore had changed, we need to compete with the international labour market, loyalty to an organisation is diminishing due to no more long life employment and ever fast changing world enviroment, a 10 years ago graduate certificate may not be relevant today, u need to upgrade. With in mind, many youngs like to job hopping in hope of getting the right job with the best paid.</p>

              <p>i think this is totally unfair those FT can go back to their
              home land to build big houses while sporean that earn the same pay
              as FT have to stay here to suffer sky high expenses ..<br> <br> FT can just wipe their butt clean and go back while we got to stay

              <p>Foreigners have to eat here and pay their rent as well, you know. Of course, their savings have more purchasing power back home, depending on where they came from.</p>

              <p>The MIW already gives you many hints in their speeches that they are going to tighten the string on FTs and foreign worker immigration. There will be less quotas, higher levies (tax) and of course, more stringent filtering before one is allow to stay or work in Singapore.</p>
              <p>eg, our SME service industrial quotas had reduce to 5 locals is to 2 Foreigners instead of 5 is to 3 previously. That mean to say, if i want employ 2 foreigners, i need to get 5 locals first. Usually, i put my grandmother name in also...</p>

              <p>If the foreigners can get a house and rent their house here, we can do the same.</p>
              <p>The key difference for me is that they can come here to study and stay on our expenses and compete with us on the limited space and job.</p>

              <p>When you open the door for people to come in, you can't blame those people coming in, because they are innocent, they are lure/invited here, and they also take the risk and agony of leaving their own country. Just like you and me, we will venture overseas if there is no future here.</p>
              <p>Now who opened the door? the govt right? so you should blame the govt, but then the govt tell you, with a diminishing and aging population, are we going to sit still and do nothing resulting in a future population labour shortage to support our economy, our dollars value and our land. No right?</p>
              <p>Therefore, the understanding of the true intention of what the govt is doing now, is critical for one to appreciate and understand before blaming other peoples. It is for our future. If we dun plan now, we plan to fail.</p>
