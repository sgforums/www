              <p>Another stupid propagation of the popular myth about foreigners being more hardworking and willing to work longer hours.</p>
              <p>Having worked with these so called foreign talents like the Burmese and Filipinos and others from third world countries, I have seen for myself that they are willing to work long hours only if there is overtime pay, but do they really work during the overtime? </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Of course not! When the employer is not around they will be goofing around like reading newspapers, surfing the internet or chatting on MSN or Skype or sleeping at the company stair well if not the conference room.  One of the main reason for "working" long hours is because there is free internet at the workplace which they cannot afford because the pay is low and expenses are high which they would soon discover within a month of working here.  And they always have these homeboy gatherings, and that's where the problem starts to get worse.  They are always comparing pay.  For $50 more they will quit their job.  The employer will soon realise that they are always on MC, which in reality they are going for more job interviews.</p>

              <p>Adam Khoo is borned with a silver spoon in his mouth.</p>
              <p>He has no idea the issues affecting the average Singaporean.</p>
              <p>Similar to our govt. They have no idea about the pains of the average Singaporean because to them, increasing a bowl of noodles from $3 to $4 is nothing much to them.</p>
              <p>The crux of the problem lies in making it too easy for employers to employ foreign labour (they are NOT foreign talents). And employers like angel7030 will try all means to circumvent any restrictions, such as putting her grandma as an employee of her company.</p>

              <p>That's the issue.</p>
              <p>If you allow short-sighted bosses to hire only based on the most simple rule (cost), then all hell breaks loose</p>
              <p>The most successful companies don't hire based on that simple rule, but look more towards how a candidate fits into their organization.</p>

              <p>but seriously, no one has addressed this question yet:</p>
              <p>what if the FT is more value for your company than the Singaporean?</p>
              <p>if you owned that company, who would you hire?</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>My question is how do you determine whether an FT is more value?</p>
              <p>I'm not unreasonable, it's hypocritical for me to work towards being a FT in another country but cannot tolerate FTs in my own country.</p>
              <p>But my question is how do you measure that? How do you determine by resume whether this FT would definitely perform better than a local?</p>
              <p>Wouldn't the HR guy responsible receive more recognisation if he/she could hire someone on paper with the same qualifications but lower salary? The hiring system is going to manned by humans no matter how automonus anyone makes it, if it is manned by humans then it would definitely be selfish by nature.</p>
              <p>People paid to get their degrees and they want to get a equivalent salary in return for the effort and money they put in to get it. These people with masters who ask for 500 less didn't have to pay as much as locals to get it (I'm sure they're Chinese/Indians/Indonesians/Vietnamese/Burmese , you expect a Westerner to take 2,000 sing dollars for a starting salary?)</p>

              <p>There's a reason why our SMEs are mini-sized compared to SMEs of other countries (defined to have turnovers of $50m to $100m per year).</p>
              <p>Our SMEs are forever short-sighted, and only look at cost. Put it bluntly, I don't think you even know how to measure what is better. More likely, you are only interested in cheaper.</p>
              <p>Our local companies are unlike foreign companies, where they also look at whether you fit into the organization, rather than just only looking at costs.</p>
              <p>That's why most of our SMEs are destined to remain as either a one-man or a single-digit employee company.</p>
