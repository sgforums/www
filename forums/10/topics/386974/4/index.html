              <p>in india, if you have a good degree or masters, and managed to get into a good local or mncs, the pay can be very, very good. my colleagues in india arguably are better paid than some of my counterparts in singapore for the same level job. they saw the huge spike in salary about 4-5 years ago when their economy boomed. while the income acceleration has tapered recently, the salaries are no peanuts. case in point, i have colleagues in india who declined job offers in singapore before, partly because the salary offered are not attractive enough.  </p>
              <p>the downside in india is they have a huge pool of educated indians there and a conversely a limited job openings in india; which explains why many would still want to leave. the wide income gap in india is another push factor.</p>

              <p>Govt taxation works in a way that if they cannot tax you, they will tax the others, understanding, tax you for what, in fact, after much reliefs, what is there to tax you, they will tax the company corporate tax. If Adam employ low wage foreign worker, make profit out of it, the govt would get higher corporate tax from him, and moreover, foreign workers need to pay tax and also Adam needs to pay levies tax ya. So, in the end the govt gain more.</p>

              <p>Well, there is a different btw gambling and shares ya, gambling is more on luck, whereas shares, which also need abit of luck but also good foresight and knowledge...lazy bums will just gamble, no need to think so much, various for some, shares and stocks is like a think tank centre to make money, think until hair all white,...like my daddy lor, so immerse in shares and golf</p>

              <p>chance is probability lah</p>
              <p>shares really is on strategy, when to move when to back out, when to hold. the market goes up and down. if you look at the whole picture its about moving a pail of tea among tea cups. when a good strategist watch carefully and keeps winning filling his own cups full, that's when there is imbalance andsome other cups sure will be emptied. that's where people go bankrupt lose money. while some others cups keeps emptying after they were filled is no gain if you see it in the end. they just wasted their time in mometns of joy when things gets rosy and tears when they lose sometimes.</p>

              <p><br>gambling really depend on the players and how much they have for the games. once some of them losses and had enough change players or the games end, with or without the players.</p>
              <p>for shares really its a bigger picture. the stakes are higher and that's why sometimes a little trip to the shares really affects lots of people, winning and losing ends. the stakes are higher.</p>
