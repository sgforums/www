              risk-taker contrarian, part brand/franchise strategist, part

              <p>Do your homework first before you reply on this. Adam Khoo's real mother is still very much alive and healthy. His parents got divorce but she's alive and they are still in close contact. She's Betty Khoo, she is some super power woman in the magazine line last time. Remarried another rich angmo.</p>
              <p>This Adam guy comes from a whole family of rich millionares, father, mother, uncles and all, born with silver spoon. His father is some big shot in advertising industry. All are well known. Takes over daddy's company and business contacts to claim to become millionair. Definitely not self-made at all.</p>
              <p>His wealth is the straight forward same old conventional way of rich daddy pass to son. No big deal. Same old story.</p>

              <p>Agreed. I have no respect for any kid with a silver spoon in his mouth asking Singaporeans to take lower pay. He sounds right smack with the PAP elitist leadership, asking Singaporeans to accept lower pay when they are the highest paid in the world.</p>
              <p>And as I mentioned before, EVEN IF he has a stepmother, SO WHAT? ALL rich families have politics in one way or another. The point is, he has more than enough to eat since young, regardless. Therefore, he has no way to comprehend why Singaporeans barely survive on $2.5k of salary.</p>
              <p><br>Frankly, to me Adam Khoo is never a truthful motivator. He is just another businessman who brings contents wholesale from sources in other countries to Singapore, and then claims he is a motivator.</p>

              <p>Well, if you can't beat them why not join them?</p>
              <p>Go work in other countries where you can cut the wage line... like the US or something... I am sure our Government won't be too happy about that but it's not like we really have a choice. -___- We just can't compete here, it's like against FT we already have one hand tied behind the back hor? Costs of living here is higher, we have more obligations and what have you not. The profit margin we get from our wage is certainly less then them, so of course they can charge cheaper.</p>

              <p>Irresponsible businessman create problems for the rest to solve is totally not acceptable.  Unless the Sentosa RW hire their own police, security surveilance if they bring in more uncivilised people and exploit them with low wages.  I do not think the current managment are "lion" enough to handle these "sheep" when they complaint to their government by blocking the entrance of Universal Studio or RW hotels at Sentosa.  Unless they have brought in the middle management to control these exploted worker with their styles as well .... This means that majority of jobs were created for them and left only boards of directors are locals.</p>

              <p>This happens when the floodgates are wide open to let in the foreigners (foreign workers/talent and no talent) indiscriminately. Aren't there options e.g. yellow ribbon projects, training the destitutes to bring them out of poverty...?)  </p>
              <p>do our local education suck so badly that we cannot have a premium over the foreigners? Come on, these people should not be easily be able work here if there are equivalent unemployed grads and professionals. Take a look at Australia and other countries. Yes, as employer, if given the opportunity will hire cheaper resources..but why is the opportunity so easily given? Such policy drives up prices while bring down salaries and giving the country lots of social economic problems which the govt fail to see or act. Not easy being a singaporean worker.</p>

              <p>This happens when the floodgates are wide open to let in the foreigners (foreign workers/talent and no talent) indiscriminately. Aren't there options e.g. yellow ribbon projects, training the destitutes to bring them out of poverty...?)  </p>
              <p>do our local education suck so badly that we cannot have a premium over the foreigners? Come on, these people should not be easily be able work here if there are equivalent unemployed grads and professionals. Take a look at Australia and other countries. Yes, as employer, if given the opportunity will hire cheaper resources..but why is the opportunity so easily given? Such policy drives up prices while bring down salaries and giving the country lots of social economic problems which the govt fail to see or act. Not easy being a singaporean worker.</p>

              <p>Please hor, if you can swim, dun blame the swimming trunk or suit too big ya.</p>
              <p>Singapore is a free economy country, everyone have their right to become rich or poor or average, it is up to each individual to decide on his life on what he aim for, if a person earns $1100, so be it, he can earn more if he go upgrade or improve his skills, that is his life. We are a country base on meritorcracy, you got merits, you are good, you perform, you get things done,..you are in for a stay in Singapore, because we provide so much opportunities for those who are willing to upgrade, perform and be productive. A man must learn to walk on his own, he control his own destiny, not others ya.</p>
              <p>In business context, labor cost is one of the key factor to look at, you can't change the govt taxes, you can't change the supplier invoices, you can't change the property rental or interest, even if you can change, there is not much differences, moreover you can't charge customers more to justify your labour cost. You will loose customers. So labour cost is the only one left for cutting just to justify your profit.</p>
              <p>Put yourself in a business suit and shoes, you will understand more, we want Singaporeans who are capable, leadership and productive to look over these Foreign peoples, not Singaporeans working together with foreign workers ya. That should be the road we are going, good for singaporeans, good for the companies and good for the country.</p>
