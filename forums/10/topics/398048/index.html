              <p>Saddam Hussein ordered the killings of more than 1,000,000 Iraqi during his reign...in addition to this he ensured the total obliteration of several ethnic groups with the use of sarin gas. Saying that the Iraqi ppl could "lead a normal life" under him, or that the Iraqi population was a particularly happy population during this time, is extremely naive.</p>
              <p>So <em>of cuz the Iraqi ppl care who is the PM</em>. I do agree that they most of all want to return to normalcy, but who would expect otherwise?</p>

              <p>I loled at this. Do you realise that Saddam Hussein is a dictator in iraq ? Which means that if you disagree with him, you are dead. People in iraq do not have human rights/ freedom of speech etc. People do not voice out because they fear for their lives. Serious Corruption exist in iraq to make people's lives even worse. Do not care versus unable to voice out has a huge difference</p>

              <p><br>I see, so safety is the key issue we are talking about. I think the major problem is religion intolerance, war and oil issue, which lead to many many sub problems like poverty. And poverty is enough to let anything happen in a country. Because it is not a country problem. It is the whole of Middle East that is facing the same issue. Everday their neighbour will shoot friendly homemade "missle" to each other as morning greeting, not reported in the news only. I agree, strong governance and military power is a must.</p>
              <p>Singapore is a relatively small and new country, so using singapore as role model for Iraq is not very good, because it does not have that much problems as Iraq.Especially the restriction of freedom of speech. However, if I die die must say one country as role model, it would be Turkey, but what I know about the country is only surface deep.</p>

              <p>Give some time to iraq just like how democracy does not occur in one night. People are poor/ business and trading are poor etc. All these takes time to build up. In order to control people, you need certain rules and propaganda. All these exist in Sg, but not as bad as in other country like china where youtube/facebook gets banned. Of course not as open as US, where freedom of speech is allowed.</p>

              I got my news from BBC interviews with Iraqi which were broadcast some time ago.  The recent topic was about the Christain community in Iraq.   Most have fled due to internal strife.
               Saddam was a dictator but he did not killed 1,000,000 Iraqi but few hundreds people who opposed him.   Women were freed to go to school etc and he did not enforce Islamic laws.  Liquor was also available freedly during his time.
              US and coalition troops killed and maimed a few hundred of thousands.  The killing is not only in Iraq but also in Afghanistan.  Now US is also active militarily in South Yemen and Northern Pakistan.

              <p><strong style="color: #886666;">For people who don't understand Iraq, how important are family and tribal connections in that society?</strong></p>
              <p>Family and tribal connections are supreme. They come ahead of ideology. They come ahead of commitment to the nation-state, they come ahead of all commitments. Saddam Hussein realizes that. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">This is why, at a certain point, he transferred power from the Ba'ath Party, which put him in power, to his family, because he decided that the family can be trusted, but the party cannot be trusted.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">He weakened the party and strengthened the family, and that is the situation in the country now.</span></strong> His second son is the head of the dreaded security system. His first son, who was a psychopath, runs all types of committees in the country. His brother is on the security system, his cousins are in key positions in the army. The people who come from Al Awja are in other positions in the army. The people who come from Tikrit, the town near Al Awja, are in other positions. It's a pyramid of relationships, tribal and familial. And this is what he depends on. And, those people are loyal to him, because they believe that if Saddam goes, they will go as well. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong style="color: #886666;">Why were you working for the regime of Saddam?</strong></p>
              <p>There is a whole generation of people like me. We are about the same age as Saddam -- I'm two years older actually -- who believe that is where the Arab dream was -- in Iraq. Iraq had wealth, it had population, it had prospects, it had a strong army. They were not backward -- and I will use the word "backward" -- like some of the oil-producing countries. They offered us a future. And we took that chance. We were enamored with what Saddam was doing. Make no mistake about it. Anybody who tells you otherwise didn't know what Saddam was about. He's not telling the truth.</p>
              <p>We knew Saddam was tough.<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> But the balance was completely different then. He was also delivering. The Iraqi people were getting a great deal of things that they needed and wanted and he was popular.</span></strong> He eliminated people here and there. With time, as with all dictators, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">the balance switched</span></span></strong>. And all we saw of Saddam was elimination and very little benefit to the people.</p>

              <p><br>I do not think your claim that he only killed a "few hundreds people who opposed him" is true. Pls read the following links and see for yourself.</p>

              <p>I think it is very safe to assume the man was a mass murderer. Even that could be considered an understatement.</p>
              <p>My main point here is that as opposed to what many western politicians repeatedly claim, perhaps Iraq simply is not ready for total personal freedom and even democracy. Maybe, in a period of transience, strong governance and strict rules which are enforced, would be suitable? (not meaning killing and torturing like in Saddams days, of cuz...). And for this purpose S`pore, or Turkey as someone suggested, might be worth studying (role model is maybe taking it a bit too far though).</p>
              <p>Would be interesting if we had an Iraqi here to ask!</p>

              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-family: Arial; line-height: 22px; font-size: 15px; color: #333333;">Those<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> communities are generally of two types, either local, such as parishes, neighborhoods, villages, or manors; or kinship communities, families, clans, and so forth.</span></strong></span></p>

I will not go into the details of this, but in such communities, there are no written laws; all law is customary.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-family: Arial; line-height: 22px; font-size: 15px; color: #333333;"> Most controls on behavior are what I call internalized, that is, they are built into your hormones and your neurological responses. You do what is necessary to remain a member of the community, because if you were not a member of the community, you would be nothing. You would not be a man.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-family: Arial; line-height: 22px; font-size: 15px; color: #333333;"> As you may know if you have ever studied linguistics, the names which many primitive and not-so-primitive peoples have for themselves is their word for man. The communities from which Classical Civilization came were clans, kinship groups; the communities from which Western Civilization came were local villages and manors.<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"> Lucky civilizations, such as Chinese Civilization over the past 1500 years, generally have communities which are both kinship and local. </span></span></strong><br><br><br>What happens in the course of a Class A Civilization, over a thousand or more years, is that <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">the fundamental <span style="color: #ff0000;">communities are broken up and gradually disintegrate into smaller and smaller groups</span>, and may end up simply as what we call nuclear families, a father and a mother, who eventually lose all discipline and control of their children. The result of this process is a state which is not only sovereign but totalitarian, and it is filled with isolated individuals. </span></strong><br><br><br>Of the four civilizations which came out of Classical Antiquity's wreckage, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">two, Islamic and Byzantine, clearly are Class B Civilizations</span>, that is, they continued to work for communities.</span></strong> Their governments were governments of limited powers, of which the most important were raising money and recruiting soldiers.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-family: Arial; line-height: 22px; font-size: 15px; color: #333333;"> The finest example of such an Asiatic Despotism was the Mongolian Empire of Jenghiz Khan about A. D. 1250, but its origins go back to the Persian Empires of the Achaemenids and the Sassanids. Good examples of such a structure are the Chinese Civilization of 220-1949, the Byzantine Empire after 640, and the Islamic sultanates which eventually culminated in the Ottoman Empire. The efforts of the Carolingian Franks to establish a similar empire in Western Civilization collapsed and led to the Dark Age of 860-970.<br><br><br>These eastern political traditions might be called Providential Empire or Providential Monarchy, and they are associated with the idea of a Providential Deity. To us today, who shove religion off into a corner and insist that it must have nothing to do with politics or business or many other things, it may be hard to grasp that one of the most potent things in establishing the structure of the state in any civilization has always been men's ideas of the nature of deity. I will not take time to give you my paradigm for that; I'll simply point out to you something which should be obvious. The deity -- God -- has many different attributes. He is creator; he is masculine; he is transcendental, that is, he is outside of the world of space and time -- that was established by 500 B.C. Eventually, he is one; that is what Muhammad insisted on. And then he is omnipotent, all-powerful. I stop at this point; Providential Empires never got further than this...</span></p>

              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">So we can clearly see that under Islamic areas such as in Iraq, the basic social unit is still the tribal organisation, while those areas in the west, those tribal organisations had been destroyed and disintegrated.</p>

              <p><br>Saddam dun rule iraqi for 5 or 10 years, he ruled them since the iraqi and iran war, the US of A just want a control of oil in the middle east, the day Saddam refused to co operate to give US of A a stake of the oil field, all accusation set in.</p>
              <p>During the iraqi and iran war, saddam was a good USA ally, he gives US a stake to operate in their oil field which the US had already been operating in jordan and saudi, in return, US supported Iraqi against Iran, on the other hand, US diplomats secretly sell arms to Iran to fight the war, war in the Arab world is a blessing for USA, firstly, US can enter the oil market, secondly can sell arms and thirdly, break the brotherhood of muslim Arabs.</p>
              <p>When Saddam come to know the motives of US, he declared for peace with Iran, whacked Kuwait because of it close ally with US, just to chase the US away. And because the US cannot control the oil fields in Iraq, they start to wrongly accuse Saddam of whatever they can throw in, from dictators to WMD etc etc,,...and because Saddam knows the dirty side of USA, the US need to quite him and shut him off. Therefore, in attacking iraq it is both personal and business in term of oil field for the USA.</p>
              <p>And all these wars was sponsored by many countries, Japan, britain etc etc and even singapore and all other close ally of US. Singapore govt can never be like Saddam, because Saddam is better than them, he cares for his peoples and get rid of those who is hurting the nation by foreign influence. I have much respect for him, and certainly Singapore govt cannot match up to his benevolences and empathy toward his subjects and citizens way of ruling.</p>
