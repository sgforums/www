            <div class='col-md body'>Hmmm....interesting horr....OK loh....I also talk abit...<br><br>Lee Kuan Yew is indeed an interesting man, you can go to his wikipedia page, and read some of his interviews.<br><br>For sure, he is a strong man, with bold thinking, very strategic, and very knowledgable. He can see the big picture and think ahead, and can analyze societies. He is wide read, in history, in politics, and sociology. He is no-nonsense, quick, and decisive.<br><br>Other than this, he has a way in conveying his views forcefully. He is talented, he can speak out in an articulate way, a good orator and debator.<br><br>So, those are the good points about him.<br><br>Bad points is....as he grow older, it seem he is indulging in more and more self-aggrandizement. This might give the impression that he is arogant.<br><br>OK.....those are my impression of him.<br><br>Now....come the part...about his contribution to Singapore.<br><br>I think he is a remarkable man, however, Singapore progress is not entirely because of him, or even of his counterparts such as Devan Nair, Poh Chin Chye, Goh Keng Swee, etc. It is more to do with the people, the anthropological aspect. The people of Singapore has the right characteristics.<br><br>For my prove, just look at Korea, advanced country. Japan, advanced country. Hong Kong. And also now China is growing rapidly.<br><br>Singapore development is because the people of Singapore consists of immigrants who are hard working and infused in Confusian and other Asian values which prize thriftiness, sacrifice for future, respect for elderly and authority, respect of scholarly persuit, and other characters.<br><br>In Korea, Japan, Hong Kong, similar traits can be found. Low crime rate, respect for elderly, and high educational attainment, other than high economic prosperity, become the traits of these countries, very much similar with Singapore.<br><br>So....<br><br>We dont see any leader of Japan, Korea, or Hong Kong taking the limelight, and saying 'this country become like this because of my brilliance'. Wrong! A country is a very complex collective society, and not 1 organization or much less 1 person can steer it from what its underlying natural social characteristics are.<br><br>Another prove....what is the most advanced country in Africa?<br><br>South Africa.<br><br>Again, same, we dont see any leader of South Africa, saying 'This country become like this because of my brilliance' while comparing it to another African country such as Uganda or something. Why? Because it is very clear, it is not 1 person contribution, the underlying society of South Africa is different from that of Uganda. Anthropology. The composition, value, characteristics, of the people making up the society is the real driving force behind any country. Not 1 person or a group of persons.<br><br>So I believe....in this regard.....Lee Kuan Yew might be abit too exalted and the common people of Singapore might be abit overlooked.<br><br>Meat Pao.</div>

But that is missing the point.....The point is USA is rich, big country, many millionaires and billionaires. Many hedge funds. Of course their financial center is big. They are a country with 300 million people. The richest country in the world. Their center, New York, pull all this money, together with money from the rest of the world.<br><br>Now Singapore, a country with 4 million, half a world away, in South East Asia. A developing world region. Not many millionaires and billionaires. Not many hedge funds. Dont have the same environment.<br><br>So if we compare straightforward New York with Singapore.....or other types of hubs such as Sillicon Valley with Singapore etc....in many aspects Singapore will lose and will continue to lose, forever and ever, because the hinterland is different. It is almost non-existent in Singapore. But not bad, because Singapore can still manage to pull abit abit from all those different hinterlands in the world, to make them to come some into Singapore.

It is almost non-existent in Singapore. But not bad, because Singapore can still manage to pull abit abit from all those different hinterlands in the world, to make them to come some into Singapore. So in this regard Singapore must be measured. And in this regard Singapore can be said as successful, because it can turn nothing into at least something.<br><br>Meat Pao.</div></blockquote>What are you talking about? If it's the numbers game you're making a case for, shouldn't China and India be the richest countries on the planet instead of the US?<br><br>If it's economic achievement you want to talk about, why not compare what this regime has achieved to the Nordic nations, Luxembourg and Iceland? These countries' populations do not differ too much from this regime's (Iceland and Luxembourg combined would yield a population of just 1 million, yet their GDP per capita combined would be 4 times Singapore's).</div>

As <span style="font-style: italic;">Atobe</span> has already covered in some other threads, the entrepreneurial culture is infused in those societies - incidentally, it's no surprise why there are so many startups in those countries which also happen to be much more prosperous. If anything, they're sufficient proof of what countries with small populations can achieve.<br><br>Needless to say, there's an awful lot more things this regime wouldn't like you to hear of those countries (like how they could prosper with a coalition government with no leader drawing million-dollar salaries and a social safety net that would put this regime to shame)...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Meat Pao:</div><div class="quote_body">Hmmm....interesting horr....OK loh....I also talk abit...<br><br>Lee Kuan Yew is indeed an interesting man, you can go to his wikipedia page, and read some of his interviews.<br><br>For sure, he is a strong man, with bold thinking, very strategic, and very knowledgable. He can see the big picture and think ahead, and can analyze societies. He is wide read, in history, in politics, and sociology. He is no-nonsense, quick, and decisive.<br><br>Other than this, he has a way in conveying his views forcefully. He is talented, he can speak out in an articulate way, a good orator and debator.<br><br>So, those are the good points about him.<br><br>Bad points is....as he grow older, it seem he is indulging in more and more self-aggrandizement. This might give the impression that he is arogant.<br><br>OK.....those are my impression of him.<br><br>Now....come the part...about his contribution to Singapore.<br><br>I think he is a remarkable man, however, Singapore progress is not entirely because of him, or even of his counterparts such as Devan Nair, Poh Chin Chye, Goh Keng Swee, etc. It is more to do with the people, the anthropological aspect. The people of Singapore has the right characteristics.<br><br>For my prove, just look at Korea, advanced country. Japan, advanced country. Hong Kong. And also now China is growing rapidly.<br><br>Singapore development is because the people of Singapore consists of immigrants who are hard working and infused in Confusian and other Asian values which prize thriftiness, sacrifice for future, respect for elderly and authority, respect of scholarly persuit, and other characters.<br><br>In Korea, Japan, Hong Kong, similar traits can be found. Low crime rate, respect for elderly, and high educational attainment, other than high economic prosperity, become the traits of these countries, very much similar with Singapore.<br><br>So....<br><br>We dont see any leader of Japan, Korea, or Hong Kong taking the limelight, and saying 'this country become like this because of my brilliance'. Wrong! A country is a very complex collective society, and not 1 organization or much less 1 person can steer it from what its underlying natural social characteristics are.<br><br>Another prove....what is the most advanced country in Africa?<br><br>South Africa.<br><br>Again, same, we dont see any leader of South Africa, saying 'This country become like this because of my brilliance' while comparing it to another African country such as Uganda or something. Why? Because it is very clear, it is not 1 person contribution, the underlying society of South Africa is different from that of Uganda. Anthropology. The composition, value, characteristics, of the people making up the society is the real driving force behind any country. Not 1 person or a group of persons.<br><br>So I believe....in this regard.....Lee Kuan Yew might be abit too exalted and the common people of Singapore might be abit overlooked.<br><br>Meat Pao.</div></blockquote>I fully agree with what you said...<br><br>He IS a great man in my eyes too... but to date, his tongue has become increasingly sharp...<br></div>
