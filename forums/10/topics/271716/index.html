            <div class='col-md body'>In Sun Tse Art of War, there is a common belief that Â“to know oneself as well as oneÂ’s enemy will allow one to win a hundred victoriesÂ”<br><br>Does MM Lee know himself as well as others to have the extra shrewdness to understand his own weakness - easily carried away by his own over-confident pet theories - to the extent of missing out on governing for the greatest good of the greatest number.<br><br>If he has that extra ability or empathy to understand others then he would have been a great leader. So far it appears like he is only self-conscious of his own need to succeed and look good whether in dealing with people or understanding their needs and desire or handling of statecraft or foreign affairs. He is only a self-believer at the best.<br><br>Because of his legal training he has been able to push through all the fallacious policies by sheer political muscle to wrangle through laws like GRC election process or ministersÂ’ benchmarking of salary to a few lucky CEOs in the private sector and get away with fall-outs and objections from the people until NKF problems starting to hit back at him on rare occasions due to combination of circumstances like change of premiership etc.<br><br>Apart from his legalistic wrangling he has not quite convinced thinking persons on any of his own pet theories imposed on the electorate from GRC or using of civil libel suits to undermine his own political opponents. Try to impose his ministersÂ’ salary benchmarking on Badawi, he instantly got the rebuff. Try to teach Mahathir to be more multi-racial he got all the short ends of the bargains.<br><br>In in reality, he could not influence much outside the little red dot despite all the seeming reputation or rhetorics.<br><br>Does he convince any foremost western journalists or thinkers of his justification or excuse to clamp-down on political or press freedoms as something desirable even for a small red dot.<br><br>The answer is quite clear - his rhetoric or legalistic wrangling does not work outside the little red dot.<br><br>Whenever he tries to same rhetorics with any external parties from Taiwan Li Ao to suzhou local authority to Indonesian journalists he would be soundly rebuffed one time after another with his own local press doing damage control mostly making it look less bad.<br><br>Therefore he has not demonstrated any special convincing logics or abilities apart from legalistic wrangling to override all fallouts or objections caused to the people.<br><br>If he does not understand others as well as himself and understand only himself then he will eventually be exposed by more objective thinkers and powers of his own weaknesses in his own backyard.<br></div>

Had he needed to deal with the nuts and bolts of running a specific ministry, he might have come a <strong>cropper</strong>. If Lim shares this view, he keeps it to himself.

            <div class='col-md body'>The statement on "governing for the greatest good" has an assumption that the person wants/chooses to govern for the public and not himself. This cannot be proven or disproved. Hence, I would avoid making such statements about personal characteristics.<br><br>Singapore Marketing Success<br>=====================<br>Singapore has great PR therefore the good image of our police, govt, and of course well paid ministers. Therefore many foreigners who do not know the reality, fed with this controlled media will think Singapore is well run, with good leaders and etc.<br><br>The Greener Grass Symdrom<br>====================<br>Singapore will always be envied by others because of the new buildings and advances. People always think the grass is greener on the other side. But why do so many Singaporean leave. Because all these things we have, are substance without form.
