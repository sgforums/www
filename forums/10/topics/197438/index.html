For appeal to investors or citizens' votes during election time, he would never say choosing leaders from one-man-one-vote democracy is anything bad.<br><br>But once the election is over, and in order to deal with critics of self-centred leadeship gibberish, democracy will be regarded as bad on the ground that it will lead to disorders and chaos.<br><br>So it depends on one's ego and who you are answering to and who are leaders appealing to ?<br><br>At one time before the Asian Financial Crisis our great leader had wanted to promote Asian or Confucianism as characterizing his presumed good or wise leadership. However following the crisis it was found that among the economy worse hit actually leadership malpractices were the fundamental causes of implosions and rotting of structures, so there seems to be a reprieve of such refuge to leadership values and cultures.<br><br>Today leadership is being revamped to look like social and culture but who define these if leadership refuses to listen to its own people needs and desire for level playing field, freedoms of choice, objectivity, social values and morality.<br><br>In order to produce good leaders there must be respect for people's wishes for leaders to govern with openness, accountability, pro-people political renewal processes and level playing field not by constant changes from one value system to another.</div>

It was found that self-centredness which often accompanied the leadership beliefs was one of the fundamental or root cause of the crisis.<br><br>To avoid another Asian Financial crisis, obviously the solution is good corporate governance where leaders would subject themselves to tests of accountability and transparency in whatever they may be leading and doing and implementing.<br><br>In this way, leadership would then be redefined to include accountability and good corporate governance. So the constant changing tacks from vision to values in describing or characterising leadership and how leaders can be better thrown up or identified by society is baffling.<br><br>How could good leaders be identified, chosen is therefore a multifarious issue and problem and not just based on circumstances or cultures or needs of some kind.<br><br>How leaders could be better identified and chosen as mentioned by MM Lee in his latest speeches has been discussed so many times.<br><br>Is autocracy a better way to identify future leaders or is democracy better at identifying leaders from within society based on circumstnace, cultures etc.?<br><br>In addition, greatness of leadership or government is not dependent on singular factors like vision of leaders but their ability to implement their visions.<br><br>Leadership or governance is not just about values or cultures of people.<br><br>Accident of birth, and vision were not sufficient guarantee for our continuous success.<br><br>There is a need to democratise and open up and be accountable in identifying or throwing up leaders of visions, implementation ability or accidents of births, through accountable local or municipal or national election process or democratic election processes.<br><br>It is baffling us to have our leaders changing so often their thinking about leadership and good government from vision to values of people and not be able to see that finally it is collective leadership, implementation leadership, accountability and good corporate governance and commitments to inculcation of social and cultural values and democratic equitable election processes that hold the final answer.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>What is leadership? Is it talents, insight, forsight and some general assumptions ?<br><br>This subject has been debated frequently but is it clearly established that good leaders are who are being asked to accept or believe - people who are scholars, men of vision, foresight, insight?<br><br>What kind of leaders do we choose in practice anyway? It can be seen that we are choosing leaders based on prospect of their receiving million-dollar salary, academic intellect and elitism, some past achievements and glory, moral uprightness or nobility of spirit?<br><br>It would appear that we have been overtaken by pragmatism where leaders have long decided that leaders are not those with the passion to serve the people or ability to implement major upgrading or improvements but scholars who should be enticed to by million-dollar salaries, and others possessing some look-good presentations.<br><br>Despite many instances of past business failures as unvealed by the Asian Financial crisis as being caused by self-centredness associated with autocratic leadership system we seem to be going back again and again to the conceptual leadership factor for solutions to our problems.<br><br>But look again, have our leaders so based on such conceptual academic leadership helped us to attain greater success apart from the initial success of the 1970s? Have they subsequently delivered a more value-added technology-driven economy as promised over many years.<br><br>Have they solved the "20 major policy errots of the government" as posted to the Feedback Unit? Have they tackled the high cost of living and upgraded our fundamental economic competitiveness given all the past three or four major economic restructuring exercises?<br><br>Wages of ordinary workers have dropped to the third world since 1997s. Property prics have dropped 30% from the peak for 10 years now.<br><br>I remember the Ministers kept saying that the government could not do anything except to wait indefinitely for the world economy to recover. Now when the world economy recovers finally in 2004, they started claiming about their leadership and talent for their past 40 years of achievements without mention of their own failures in economic restructuring. Is this true leadership success or basking in past initial glory or complacency?<br><br>Shouldn't we try to give our new ministers some yardstick like that of Dr. Goh Keng Swee who could quietly behind the scene create restructuring to the whole economy during the 1960s-1970s.<br><br>Shouldn't true leaders keep up with new expectations and time and improve social, cultural and economic conditions to facilitate attainment of result through people participations in every field.<br><br>For a start, I would like to see solid and concrete programs consistently implemented such as the following:-<br><br>(1) Identify new goals and objectives, and implement new technology start-ups.<br><br>(2) Set work processes which will empower workers in knowledge application, mass participation to bring about competitiveness.<br><br>They should stop the old one-size-fit-all pro-foreign investment and employment policies which have constrained the growth of our own domestic economy and our own talented citizens.<br><br>There ought to be readiness to change past legalistic controls to help unleashing opportunities in every field and infusing of practical knowledge application by the ordinary citizens.<br><br>LEADERSHIP QUALITIES IN THE NEW AGE<br><br>Leaders of the new age must not be people who possess the highest academic qualifications but people who have been tested or shown ability to implement policies and programs to transform the economy to value-added technology-driven model and motivate people in all their actual work performance:-<br><br>(1) Passion,<br>(2) Inspire and Motivate followers,<br>(3) Set up work processes for coordination and knowledge application.<br>(4) Implement policies and decisions to upgrade the economy.<br>(5) Accountability and Transparency<br>(6) Collective leadership.<br>(7) Integrity of system and processes.<br><br>HUMILITY AND RELIABILITY<br><br>The constitution should be reviewed to make the government embrace social and cultural sphere of governance and more accountable so as to encourage greater participation and knowledge application.<br><br>IMPLEMENTATION ABILITY THE KEY<br><br>Education is only the basic. Beyond the grades there is a larger sphere of knowledge application by all students and workers. Applying existing knowledge within works and education is as important as obtaining more degrees and more education for the sake of look-good presentation.<br><br>The leaders must also have ability to maximise use of its available resources e.g. the empty lands, vacant factories, the unemployed, and under-employed, idle capitals to use them to fuel the next phase of expansion to attain value-adding competitiveness.<br><br>Leaders should be paid reasonable salaries consistent with their performance not highest salaries to prevent corruption as corruption happens not because of one factor or financial situation alone. It is not apple-to-apple comparison to benchmark private sector's highest salaries to the public sector.<br><br>Finally the past government policies have been over-emphasising on individual talents or leadership. Individualism is not pro-people or pro-efficiency.
