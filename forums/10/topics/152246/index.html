            <div class='col-md body'>Seeing as how the security climate in Iraq is not going to resolve soon I don't see how oil prices will be going back to pre war levels in the near future.<br><br>What do you people think if we use vegetable oil like palm as another alternative fuel source to power our economy and lower our crude import bill instead? We could build a refinery and generator for palm and buy the oil directly from our neighbours in this region like like Malaysia, Indonesia, Vietnam or Thailand and either pipe it down or tanker it by sea to us.<br><br>Sure, we have Indonesian gas supply contracts and our crude oil refining facility is the world third largest so there is no worry right? but no one knows what the future may hold for us. Indonesia already reeling from high oil prices is already thinking of cutting 23% of their crude import and trying to use their own natural resources like maybe gas in Natuna island which by the way is we are also getting our gas, who knows next time if this will be a sore point in our relations with the Indonesians when their domestic needs becomes really intense as oil price goes above $100 Â… Just like our earlier water problems with the Malaysia.<br><br>With an electricity generator that runs on palm we could on a small scale supply electricity for SMRT trains or light industries with it, and with a palm refinery we could use to replace diesel for all our taxis and eventually replace all the diesel guzzling vehicles. This will take some of our energy burden off and reduce crude import bills.<br><br>By the way this region with the countries that mentioned are already a major producer for palm oil for the world with Malaysia and Indonesia already having a combined market share of more than 80%. With the exception of Nigeria in Middle East/Africa this SEA region supply 99% of the palm oil world market.<br><br></div>

We have large open seas and can surely tap on the seas for large supply of tidal power.<br><br>Solar power for now might seem expensive but can still strategically develop and nurture such use on smaller scale for certain environmental or incineration projects and from there develop further to use such power or reduce our reliance on fuel.<br><br>Do not just go about such projects from initial costing as such costing would only end up with over-pragmatic rejections. Take a larger view of investment goals and long-term benefit of all energy or environmental projects like the above-mentioned as we have large supply of sunlight and tidal wave. Similarly take a more strategic view of project like fuel-cell vehicle as we can develop certain types for our miliatary use.<br><br>For example at one time inverter motor was rejected for less cost effectiveness but now the country which has taken the lead in inverter technology is the one which has taken larger investment view of such project.</div>

In India, it is grown on 13% of cropped land.<br><br>According to the United States Department of Agriculture, rapeseed was the third leading source of vegetable oil in the world in 2000, after soybean and oil palm, and also the world's second leading source of protein meal, although only one-fifth of the production of the leading soybean meal.<br><br>The FAO reports that 36 million tonnes of rapeseed was produced in 2003. In Europe, rapeseed is primarily cultivated for animal feed (due to its very high lipid and medium protein content), and is a leading option for Europeans to avoid importation of GMO products.<br><br>Natural rapeseed oil contains erucic acid, which is mildly toxic to humans in large doses but is used as a food additive in smaller doses.<br><br>Canola is one of many selected cultivars of rapeseed bred to have a low erucic acid content. Canola was developed in Canada and its name is a contraction of "Canadian oil, low acid".<br><br>The name was also chosen partly for marketing reasons, so successfully that the name is sometimes mis-applied to other cultivars of rapeseed.<br><br>The rapeseed is the valuable, harvested component of the crop. The crop is also grown as a winter-cover crop. It provides good coverage of the soil in winter, and limits nitrogen run-off. The plant is ploughed back in the soil or used as bedding.<br><br>Processing of rapeseed for oil production provides rapeseed animal meal as a by-product. The by-product is a high-protein animal feed, competitive with soya. The feed is mostly employed for cattle feeding, but also for pigs and chickens (though less valuable for these). The meal has a very low content of the glucosinolates responsible for metabolism disruption in cattle and pigs.<br><br>Rapeseed leaves are also edible, similar to those of the related kale. Some varieties of rapeseed are sold as greens, primarily in Asian groceries.<br><br>Rapeseed is a heavy nectar producer, and honeybees produce a light colored, but peppery honey from it. It must be extracted immediately after processing is finished, as it will quickly granulate in the honeycomb and will be impossible to extract. The honey is usually blended with milder honeys, if used for table use, or sold as bakery grade. Rapeseed growers contract with beekeepers for the pollination of the crop.<br><br>Picture 2 : Rapeseed in yellow flower<br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/05/Raps.jpg"><br><br><strong>Biodiesel from rapeseed oil of Turkish origin as an alternative fuel</strong><br><a href="http://www.osti.gov/energycitations/product.biblio.jsp?osti_id=588683" rel="nofollow">http://www.osti.gov/energycitations/product.biblio.jsp?osti_id=588683</a><br><br><strong>Review: Utilization of Rapeseed Oil, Rapeseed Oil Methyl Ester or Diesel Fuel<br>- Exhaust Gas Emissions and Estimation of Environmental Effects</strong><br><a href="http://journeytoforever.org/biofuel_library/ro_rev.html" rel="nofollow">http://journeytoforever.org/biofuel_library/ro_rev.html</a><br><br></div>
