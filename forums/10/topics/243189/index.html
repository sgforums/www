The highest increase will be for the B2+ward, which will see a $6 increase. (See table below.)<br><br>The previous review of these fees was in 1993.<br><br>The hospital will continue to absorb GST for subsidisedpatients.<br><br>Last month, SGH revised specialist outpatient clinic fees for private patients. They now pay up to $60 for each repeat consultation with a senior consultant and up to $85 for a first-time consultation.<br><br>Private ward fees were revised last year.<br><br>SGH had held off any fee increase despite the annual rise in operating expenses such as utilities, housekeeping and maintenance arising from higher energy costs, said a spokesman.<br><br>Housekeeping costs have gone up because of intensified post-Sars infection control and increased bird flu vigilance measures. For instance, there is more frequent cleaning, changing of linen and gloves.<br><br>Said Prof Tan Ser Kiat, chief executive officer of SGH: 'With an increasing volume of subsidised patients, and facilities at SGH which need updating, any under-collection of revenue would mean less resources available for meeting the growing need for improvements necessary for sustaining quality of patientcare.<br><br>'Even with the impending adjustment to fees, we can only recover a small fraction of rising costs.'<br><br>SGH will continue to assist patients with financial difficulties through MediFund and other assistance schemes, like its Samaritans Fund for needy patients and the SingHealth Foundation.<br><br>The SGH fee revision is the latest in a series of fee increases by restrutured hospitals here.<br><br>KK Women's and Children's Hospital KKH adjusted its fees with effect from 15 Feb. The estimated impact on bill size ranges from 0.2per cent to 4.3percent, said a spokesman.<br><br>The fee adjustments were mainly to cover increases in operating costs and inflation.<br><br>The revision affects outpatient consultation fees for private patients and daily ward and treatment fees for both private and subsidised patients.<br><br>National University Hospital<br><br>NUH revised its accident and emergency fee in January from $70 to $80, the first revision since 1997.<br><br>'The revision was necessary to help to some extent meet the higher cost of providing the service and in our continuing efforts to improve clinical care and services for our patients,' said a spokesman.<br><br>NUH has introduced various initiatives and new technology at the A&amp;E to enhance patient safety and care, and even cut down hospitalisation costs for patients, she said.<br><br>For example:<br><br>A new life-saving technology for patients with breathing difficulties which has significantly cut down the need for these patients to be kept in intensive care.<br><br>Tests that can rapidly detect heart attacks enabling doctors to get patients to undergo treatment faster.<br><br>Alexandra Hospital<br><br>In November last year, its emergency charges went up from $55 to $60, while specialist outpatient clinic charges for subsidised patients went up from $18 to $20.<br><br>In December, its ward charges for C class patients went up from $21 to $25 a day.<br><br>Changi General Hospital and Tan Tock Seng Hospital<br><br>CGH and TTSH have yet to follow suit.<br><br>Said a CGH spokesman: 'Currently, our hospital is still reviewing our fees, particularly our A&amp;E fees which was revised 10 years ago in 1997.'<br><br>CGH's A&amp;E charge is currently $65.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>'We'll feel the pinch'<br><br>ALTHOUGH the hospitals say that all patients with financial difficulties will be helped, there are many who feel the fees increase could not have come at a worst time.<br><br>Of the 30 people we polled, more than eight in 10 were unhappy.<br><br>Said Mrs Tan Siew Leng, a housewife in her 40s: 'Already we are facing a GST increase.

            <div class='col-md body'>It is easy to complain, but I think this is one change that should be least controversial.
