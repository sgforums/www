            <div class='col-md body'>The surname Luo (character representing net) could have originated from the Yun (with the female radical) clan, which claimed descent from Zhurong, another legendary emperor in Chinese mythology. Zhurong was also known as the Fire god in some tales.

Another comes from the descendants of honest official Bi Gan who was also a prince by lineage in the Shang Dynasty.

To conceal their identities from enemies while reminding themselves of their common royal lineage, they all agreed to change their surnames to Sun (character meaning grandchild).</div>

However, the Jiang clan supporting the rebellion was huge and Jiang Ziya was known to be an aloof genius, so it is not confirmed if the two were in any way related.

According to Chinese genealogical records, there are two other main origins, one from King Ping's (Zhou Pingwang) second son Lin Kai born of a concubine in the Eastern Zhou Dynasty, another from a minority Xianbei tribe whose surnames were summarily changed during one nation-wide surname-changing campaign initiated by King Xiaowen (Xiaowen Di) in the Northern Wei Dynasty.<br><br>During the Warring States period, Lin Gao from Bi Gan's lineage served as the Premier for the state of Zhao. He had nine sons who served the Zhao king faithfully, and the king bestowed upon Lin's sons the title of "The Nine Dragons". That's about the closest I could find about the Lin's in the Qin Dynasty. It could be a princely title at that time, but I am not able to verify that information from my sources.</div>

Non-Chinese? I don't understand. I know a Miao girl from Guizhou who, when dressed in modern clothes, looked very much like any other girl from China and she holds a Chinese passport.<br><br>Genetics could help trace our ancestry, but to a limited extent. Our surnames are not tied to our genes and surnames can be easily changed. We shouldn't be too surprised if our DNA's do not match with those of our first ancestors with the same surnames, that is, provided their more-than-three-thousand-year-old DNA's could be obtained.<br><br>In order to cement the ties between the Han's and the Hsiong-Nu (Xiongnu) tribe, the first Han Dynasty emperor Liu Bang married off an imperial princess to the tribe ruler. According to the Hsiong-Nu custom, children of noble birth follow the surname of their mothers, so the leading tribe clan changed their surname to Liu after that. That was one of the origins for Liu.</div>

Of course after three thousand years, it is pretty hard not only for other tribes <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span> to be absorbed to a certain extent into the mainstream, but also for the Han tribe to claim ancestral purity. We couldn't tell what our forefathers did throughout those three thousand years, could we? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>There might have been a tribal classification, though I didn't ask to look at the Miao girl's passport.

Glad to help a fellow enthusiast in Chinese history. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>For the uninitiated, the reason why the Chinese race usually refer to themselves as descendants of "Han" or "Tang" was because the Han and Tang Dynasties were two of the most glorious periods in Chinese history when the country of the Central Plains or China was strong, powerful, abundant, and vibrant with culture.<br><br>"Nan Tang Bei Han"... If my memory served me right, this distinction originated during the dying years of the Tang Dynasty when the northern region of China was actually divided among several autonomous tribe nations like Liao, Xixia and Jin. (Readers of Jin Yong's pugilistic novels should be familiar with these tribe nations.)<br><br>One remarkable characteristic of the Chinese culture was that the roots were so deep and the values were so strong that the culture was able to exercise considerable amount of influence on the foreign tribal nations that occupied the land. These nations took to the Han language, rites and government structure naturally during their occupation of the northern regions, and the citizens there referred to themselves as "Han ren (citizens)".<br><br>On the other hand, most citizens claiming Han roots (though actually the Han bloodline had already been pretty much corrupted by that time) moved with the capital to the south, and called themselves "Tang ren (citizens)" to differentiate themselves from the Han citizens of the tribe nations up north. Hence the distinction was born, but it has slowly been blurred as the centuries rolled by through the subsequent dynasties.<br><br>An interesting point of noteworthy mention is that many southern citizens, especially those in the Guangdong and Fujian provinces, still retain the tradition of calling themselves "Tang ren". At the end of the Qing Dynasty when many of these citizens emigrated to foreign countries and established communal enclaves there, they named these Chinatown enclaves as "Tang ren jie (street)" or "Tang cheng (city)".<br><br>Anyway, not sure if this information was what you had in mind, and I can't remember the source to verify the accuracy (and cover my own ass). But you may wish to refer to this article on Han origins published on Zaobao online forum last October (it does not talk much on the distinction between Tang and Han, but there was some cursory mention in there):<br><br><a href="http://www.zaobao.com/special/china/general/letter161004a.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.zaobao.com/special/china/general/letter161004a.html</a><br><br>Feel free to PM me if you wish to discuss anything else on Chinese history. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Huang (representing yellow), another popular surname in Chinese history, shared similar origins with the surname Qin in the Ying clan. As mentioned for surname Qin, the Ying clan's origin could be traced to a noble who served the legendary emperor Shun. A faction of the Ying clan founded the state of Huang when King Wu (Zhou Wuwang) ascended the throne in the early years of the Zhou Dynasty. When the king of Huang offended the powerful state of Chu by refusing to offer tributes, Chu attacked and annexed Huang, and the surviving clan members subsequently adopted the surname of Huang.</div>
