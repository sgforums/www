            <div class='col-md body'>Such information could be found in genealogy books on the list of the most common 100 Chinese surnames, or , compiled during the Song Dynasty. According to the books, there are multiple origins for most of the surnames. For the sake of simplicity, I have only quoted one of the earliest for the surnames of Li and Tang ("Tang" as in Hanyu Pinyin, not "Tang" as in dialect name), and would do likewise here.<br><br>For the surname Chen, one of the earliest origins could be traced to the Gui family -- descendants of China's legendary emperor Shun -- who defected to the state of Zhou during the tumultuous Shang Dynasty. When King Wu (Zhou Wuwang) overthrew the tyrant King Zhou (Shang Zhouwang), he bestowed the state of Chen to potter Gui who had served his father King Wen (Zhou Wenwang). During war in the Spring and Autumn Period, one of the nobles' sons fled to the state of Qi and adopted the surname of Chen.</div>

Countless times he advised his cruel king to change his ways and rule with benevolence. For his efforts, Zhou had Bi Gan's heart dug out to entertain his concubines. Upon learning her husband's fate, Bi Gan's pregnant widow fled and sought refuge in the deep forests. After Zhou was deposed, new King Wu (Zhou Wuwang) sought out the widow and bestowed the surname of Lin to the newborn child in honour of Bi Gan.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The surname Xu with the water radical hails from the Jiang (character representing ginger) clan, a major clan of powerful families in the Shang Dynasty. The clan claimed to have descended from Shennong ("Divine Farmer" ), also known as the Yan Emperor, a legendary emperor in Chinese mythology. Shennong was much revered because he taught people the practices of agriculture, which was at that time a highly-regarded aspect of the society. When the Jiang clan helped King Wu (Zhou Wuwang) overthrow the Shang Dynasty, Wu rewarded them with the fertile state of Xu. After Xu was conquered by the state of Chu during the Warring States period, descendants of the Jiang clan changed their surname to Xu.</div>
