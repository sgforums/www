              <p>In singapore, if u throw litter or do some minor stuff, u get jail sentence and fine of up to $5000 dollars. But if u r a foreigner tricked or lured into singapore to be a prostitue, the singapore government doesn't seems to find that as a problem. This suggest that singapore government finds that littering is a much bigger problem and a bigger criminal offence compared to pimps robbing away a lady's life, having them to work as sex workers in singapore.</p>

              <div class="segment_normal">
              <div class="detail">
              <div class="gchild chrome1 left"></div>
              <p>Three weeks after having her appendix removed last year, Filipina bar girl Camille was forced by her pimp back to work as a prostitute in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Penniless and deeply in debt in a foreign land, 24-year-old Camille, not her real name, had no choice.</p>
              <p>She says she had sex with men in hotel trysts arranged by her pimp, who took most of the money, until she sought shelter at the Philippine embassy.</p>
              <p>"My wounds barely healed and I was being forced to have sex," she told AFP, breaking into sobs during an interview before flying home earlier this year.</p>
              <p>"The pimp had no pity. The men had no mercy. I should have listened to my parents not to come here."</p>
              <p>Philippine embassy officials said Camille, a single mother, is among a growing number of Filipina women lured by human trafficking syndicates to Singapore, Southeast Asia's wealthiest economy.</p>
              <p>Promised jobs as "entertainers" in pubs and restaurants, many instead find themselves virtually indentured as prostitutes, working to pay back the cost of getting here.</p>
              <p>Women interviewed by AFP said they were locked in cramped apartments, given one meal a day and told they owed between 1,000 and 4,000 Singapore dollars (736-2,945 US) to their pimps for bringing them to the city-state.</p>
              <p>The sex industry in Singapore -- where prostitution is legal but pimping and public solicitation are not -- is dominated by women from the Philippines, Thailand, China and Vietnam, industry sources said.</p>
              <p>The Philippine embassy in Singapore said there were 212 cases of human trafficking involving Filipinas in 2007, up from 125 in 2006 and from 59 cases in 2005.</p>
              <p>Of those 212, nearly 30 percent admitted to having engaged in prostitution or said they were coerced into sexual acts, it said.</p>
              <p>Filipino consul Neal Imperial described the numbers as the "tip of the iceberg" as they reflected only women who turned to the embassy for help.</p>
              <p>The US State Department, in its 2008 Trafficking in Persons report, put Singapore on its list of countries not doing enough to combat the problem. Cambodia and Sierra Leone were among others named.</p>
              <p>The report urged Singapore, which has yet to ratify the 2000 UN Trafficking in Persons Protocol, to "vigorously investigate and prosecute both labour and sex trafficking cases".</p>
              <p>Responding to the US report, Singapore's Ministry of Home Affairs said reported cases of forced prostitution fell to 28 in 2007 from 33 in 2006 and 35 in 2005.</p>
              <p>Police investigated all 28 cases and found evidence in only one, the ministry said.</p>
              <p>Human trafficking experts said Singapore's figures differ from the US report because the police do not consider women as trafficking victims if they arrive voluntarily.</p>
              <p>In contrast, the United Nations counts women as victims if they are lured by false promises about working conditions, and if they are exploited.</p>
              <p>Singapore should accept there is a problem, said Sallie Yea, an Australian consultant who has researched sex trafficking in Asia. "Singapore is still in the denial mode."</p>
              <p>The island-state is an attractive destination, experts said, because women can enter without a visa on cheap flights.</p>
              <p>John Gee, of the non-government group Transient Workers Count Too, said acknowledging that human trafficking exists could be embarrassing for the government, which likes to perpetuate Singapore's squeaky clean image.</p>
              <p>But he said the government's bid to maintain that image could push it to tackle the issue.</p>
              <p>"I'm optimistic that Singapore will actually rise to the challenge and deal with it," he said.</p>

              <p>In all honesty, aside from enforcement, there is little the government can do. These days, it is so easy for anyone just to apply for a social visit pass and over stay, I mean we've seen articles in the papers where people just enter the country and stay here for ten over years without even being caught and you can't expect the the ICA to track every single tourist entering Singapore, it'll be a logistical nightmare and not to mention intruding upon one's liberties. </p>
              <p>Furthermore, these innocent victims are controlled by syndicates who profit from their existence. You would say, well crack down on these guys! The thing is that these people have been around since god knows when, it's just that with a changing world, they have adapted their businesses with the current trends. Maybe in the past they relied on locals to serve their ends, now they make more going abroad and enticing gullable young women with the promise of better jobs and better lives, but enslaving them to prostitution when they reach our sunny shores. </p>
              <p>And lastly, not everyone can just zip it up and keep their pants on. There is one reason why prostitution is one of the oldest professions in the known world. Moreover, the last thing you want is a 'nanny' telling you what is right or wrong, I'm sure we are much better off leaving the government out of defining our personal moral views. </p>

              <p>I think a lot of you are missing the point.  The issue isn't prostitution and the need for it.  The issue is the exploitation of those exploited in the industry.  The fact remains that many are lured here as 'entertainers', that many are placed under huge debt, and that many leave this sunny island without a penny to show for it.</p>
              <p>Case in point, I knew of somebody who came here as an entertainer, and found herself in a brothel to pay back the exhorbitant debt. She wasn't paid, and was forced to work  until she had overstayed, was picked up by the police and deported without a penny.</p>
              <p>You think that's right?  You think that worth it for the banglas and uncles to get their jollies? </p>
              <p>And don't tell me it's too difficult to crack.  What a load of bollocks.  The police have their pathetic raids on pubs etc, deport the girls (if illegal), and for whatever reason, fail to investigate the management, to track down their other businesses or follow to their lodgings where the girls are locked up during daylight hours.  There's simply no will to solve the problem.</p>
              <p>While I'm at it.  Notice a trend?  Exploitation of labourers, exploitation of maids, exploitation of prostitutes.  All foreigners.  That's what Singapore is built on.</p>

              <p>Perhaps you could propose to the goverment to ask its citizens to pay more tax to conduct more raids on those pubs. Hell you could go to speakers corner and suggest to the public as well since in all these posts so many people are against such people from coming in. I am sure you will rally alot of support. Please tell me if you are going and I would like to see you in action. Then more people will not dare employ illegal foreginers.</p>

The Government has no choice all Man are born with an equal insatiable LUST however unequal standing in life. Some are born rich attractive or have other attributes that enable them to get attached. Others find religion or believe in ethics that help control their "urges". BUT there are others who fall outside of all the above categories and require such a service. However if we rely on prositutes who are legal and willing will there not be a lack of supply and as the rules of economics dictate will there not be an increase in price of such "deplorable" services? So if the males are unable to afford the prositutes now, where do u think they would go to vent their "urges" ? DIY? Nothing beats the real thing. Thus the Government is merely protecting the interest of SINGAPOREANS which it was sworn in to do. This may appear Harsh but we do not live in DIsney Channel. There must be compromises made and not coming down hard is choosing the lesser of two evils.</p></div>
