              <p><br>not true la .... they have 0 Pesos when they come here .</p>
              <p>One Professional agent will buy them ticket @ $380 2 way ticket , settle those philipines " undertable " ( bribery )  immigration cost , and when they reached S'pore , must show Singapore immigration some $500 in cash , so that they can get 30 days visas .</p>
              <p>The Filipinas paid for this 3 clause . Nothing else .</p>
              <p>Agent will also find them accomodations ..... but the girl will pay themself to house owner . Like $10 cash a day .</p>
              <p>Then they return those $1400 maximum in Sgp to the agent's represenatative in Sgp , in weekly basis , by instalments , until they clear their credit .</p>
              <p>How those girls earn ? depending on the pubs ..... 50/50 profit sharing on every drink they get from customers , customers will get them a drink $20 , they get $10 .</p>
              <p>I knew this trade a long time ago ..... very high risk involving the girls , get caught working with tourist visa , they will be banned for 5 years in Sgp straight away .</p>
              <p>Well , the profit no thick la ..... to be honest . One girl nett profit is about $800 .</p>
              <p>But for a syndicate or in group , good money i think .</p>
              <p>It's not a secret in Philipines , the agency fee to come to Sgp is $1400 maximum , most girls , their neighbours , friends all know .....Market price , how they pay $4000 ?</p>

              <p>No disrespect Pistonf, but fuck you for your lack of intellect.  Seriously!</p>
              <p>Nobody is saying that ugly folks don't need sex, usually via prostitution, and nobody is suggesting an end to it.  The issue at hand is that prostitution is available at the exploitation of foreigners.  You pay $40 or whatever, which is enough for the girl to have sex with your ugly face, but *SHE DOESN'T RECEIVE THE MONEY*.  THAT my friend is exploitation.  The pimps grab it, the debtors grab it, they overstay because they haven't received payment, and at the end of it she's been raped by one hundred ugly-as-you bastards and takes home NOTHING.</p>
              <p>The ugly fucks are paying reasonable money for sex with relatively hot women, yet after all the duress those said women aren't receiving their dues.  THAT is exploitation.</p>
              <p>I'm sure that your dick was half/twice/up-to-you the size of your brain and compassion that you can understand what I'm saying.  But sadly I doubt it.</p>

              <p>MY point is that exploitation keeps the cost down. Exploitation provides the Foreign workers. I unlike you do not wear my heart on my sleeves, what i do not say does not mean i agree or disagree. If asking about personal opinion i would definitely say that exploitation is wrong and so is prositution. However this is not the point being debated.</p>

              <p><br>As i said i have been merely voicing a reason why the government is not cracking down on them. IT does not mean i condone it. It might help all of us if you are able to divorce rationality with your emotions. Anyway  how much money there is in the industry does not equate to how much money there is in the pocket of those who are patronizing them. Yees it is sad that they are being exploited and as i said it just so happens that if we were to turn it around WE would have to suffer the consequence. Would you allow your mother or sister to be raped? or would rather let some foreigner to bite the bullet? Brutal and harsh but this is the way things go..</p>

              <p><em><span style="color: #3366ff;">....... " Being there , as it turned out , raised more questions than it answered .</span></em></p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #3366ff;">Together with 4 other Uni level students , aged between 20-27 , we met a female brothel owner in Pattaya .</span></em></p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #3366ff;">Onn turned out to be a jovial middle-aged woman who welcome us into her bar-brothel . </span></em></p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #3366ff;">She enthusiatically revealed how she took care of her staff by cooking for them , advocating condom use and teaching them survival English .</span></em></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;"><em>Her sincerity was so infectious , i found myself thinking : i guess if i were a working girl , i would want to work for someone like her .</em></span></p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #3366ff;">I caught myself . Is tis , then , the realistic of thousands of women in the world , and one which i was just beginning to understand ? Maybe prostitution was not just an uncompplicated evil in itself ?</span></em></p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #3366ff;">Sure , i still think a woman should not by selling her flesh for money . But i speak from a place of priviledge . I do not have to worry about where my next meal will come from , or where i will sleep tonight . </span></em></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;"><em>Some  children choose to go into the trade to provide for their families , although they are by legal definition " Trakficked" , they are not victims of trafficking , but of their circumstances .</em></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;"><em>What am i fighting ? Or maybe i was starting at the wrong place . </em></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;"><em>You can afterall , quite easily rescue a child's froma brothel . ending poverty ? That's another question altogether . "</em></span></p>
