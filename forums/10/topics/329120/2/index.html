              <p>I notice a very common mistake about people replies here...</p>
              <p>If you read the article carefully, it's not about stopping prostitution. It's about stopping human trafficking. If people need money and come to work as sex workers, that's their way of making money.</p>
              <p>This topic centers on those who are conned, cheated, FORCED to work as sex workers. As an example, your sister or female friend have a new handsome boyfriend, the new boyfriend is from russia and wanted to move back to his country one day, so he lure your sister or female friend to go over to his country to live with him, and when your sister or your female friend is there, the guy seize the passport and FORCE your sister or your female friend to work as sex worker for many years. If I understand from the replies, you guys are saying that your sister or female friend should work over there as a sex worker, even though she is forced against her will, because there are male there who have sexual urges?</p>
              <p>This is not about prostitution. It's about criminal activities.</p>

              <p>No disrespect Pistonf, but fuck you for your lack of intellect.  Seriously!</p>
              <p>Nobody is saying that ugly folks don't need sex, usually via prostitution, and nobody is suggesting an end to it.  The issue at hand is that prostitution is available at the exploitation of foreigners.  You pay $40 or whatever, which is enough for the girl to have sex with your ugly face, but *SHE DOESN'T RECEIVE THE MONEY*.  THAT my friend is exploitation.  The pimps grab it, the debtors grab it, they overstay because they haven't received payment, and at the end of it she's been raped by one hundred ugly-as-you bastards and takes home NOTHING.</p>
              <p>The ugly fucks are paying reasonable money for sex with relatively hot women, yet after all the duress those said women aren't receiving their dues.  THAT is exploitation.</p>
              <p>I'm sure that your dick was half/twice/up-to-you the size of your brain and compassion that you can understand what I'm saying.  But sadly I doubt it.</p>

              <p>The Home Affairs Ministry has said before that when it cracks down on illegal immigrants it treats both trafficked persons and illegal immigrants the same way.</p>
              <p>Illegal immigrants face caninig, jail, deportation etc.  If you don't make any distinction between them and victims of trafficking then what is basically happening is that those victims are being caned, jailed and deported <em>because they were tricked or coerced.</em> That was their crime.</p>
              <p>If that's the case, as a victim of trafficking, would you dare to come forward? Would you tell the police what has happened to you? I would have thought, surely not. And if you don't tell the police and you don't testify in court because you are afraid of law enforcement action, who is going to catch the traffickers?</p>
              <p>If we don't catch traffickers and put them in jail, what deters them from trafficking?</p>

              <p>You missed the argument.  My apologies if my assesment holds true.</p>
              <p>Edit based on your edit: yes, there's a lot of exploitation.  Singapore is full of exploitation of foreigners, from labourers ripped off by their agents to maids working seven days a week, sixteen hours a day for a pittance.  The government and economy turns a blind eye,  it's all exploitation and it's all wrong. The exploitation of one group doesn't justify the exploitation of another.  <span class="results-bar">Disingenuous<em></em><strong><em></em></strong></span> of you.</p>

              <p>I noticed some people finally got the idea of what the topic is about. And some people claims it's impossible or difficult to stop it. Now, if the government never even try, how can they reduce such criminal activities? And if like some people claims, that there is nothing much the government can do, then why is the government there for? I in a split second can easily think what they can do, like enacting tougher laws to deal with human trafficking. In the most extreme case, like if you are a human trafficker, and you are caught, you will be sentenced to life imprisonment or death sentence, now will you still do it? Some will, some won't, but for certain, there will be lesser human traffickers because of the change in law. Just like from past experience, there are more drug cases in Singapore until the death penalty, now people are smart, they do trade off, if it isn't worth the risk, they won't do it. Same for human traffickers.</p>
              <p>But the law now stands as the government not doing very much. The law is optimistic towards the human traffickers. So, simply by updating the law in this section, the government can do something, at least to deter and reduce the amount of human trafficking cases. So for those who think nothing can be done, what I mentioned is JUST 1 WAY of what can be done, and it doesn't take more than 10 mins to think about it. Unless the millionaires at the government sector, being paid more than a million dollars have a lesser brain than mine?</p>
              <p>Now, if they can't think of more way, here is another. The government can have an improved process at the immigration section to handle this issue. There are systems that can deduce, to a certain amount of accurancy, the suspicious activity of an individual when it comes to human trafficking, based on certain patterns. Now obviously if I list the patterns here, it defeat the purpose, human traffickers can come here and see, oh i should avoid these patterns in order to avoid detection.</p>
              <p>Between my 2 anyhow think of probable ideas to reduce human trafficking, i think having a tougher law is more likely to have a significiant impact. So if a normal guy like me can think of 2 probable ideas to stop human trafficking, what is stopping the smart brains in the government from doing something?</p>
