              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; color: #0000ff;">Objections
                  have been raised to this claim on grounds of a lack of both
                  proportionality and necessity. To kill over 1000 Palestinians in 3
                  weeks, hundreds of them children, and wound thousands more, in order to
                  deter a threat from rockets that did not kill or injure <em>anybody</em> in Israel for the six months the truce was declared by both sides, or
                  even before Israel launched its attack on December 27, is so
                  disproportionate as to be intolerable in any ethical system that holds
                  Palestinian lives equal in value to Israeli lives. It is also so
                  disproportionate as to defy belief that defence against these rockets
                  was the real motive of the war. To ignore the many diplomatic avenues
                  available to avoid even this threat, such as lifting the suffocating
                  18-month siege, suggests the same thing.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">A
                  more fundamental objection, however, is the self-evident legal and
                  moral principle that an aggressor cannot rely upon self-defence to
                  justify violence against resistance to its own aggression. You can find
                  this principle in domestic law and in the judgments of the Nuremberg
                  tribunals. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">To quote one Nuremberg judge:</span></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">On
                  of the most amazing phenomena of this case which does not lack in
                  startling features is the manner in which the aggressive war conducted
                  by Germany against Russia has been treated by the defense as if it were
                  the other way around. …If it is assumed that some of the resistance
                  units in Russia or members of the population did commit acts which were
                  in themselves unlawful under the rules of war, it would still have to
                  be shown that these acts were not in legitimate defense against wrongs
                  perpetrated upon them by the invader. <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Under International Law, as in
                  Domestic Law, there can be no reprisal against reprisal. The assassin
                  who is being repulsed by his intended victim may not slay him and then,
                  in turn, plead self defense.</span></strong> (<em>Trial of Otto Ohlendorf and others</em>, Military Tribunal II-A, April 8, 1948)</span></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">So who was the aggressor here? </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">There
                  would have been no question as to who was the aggressor had this attack
                  taken place before Israel’s withdrawal from the Gaza strip in 2005. <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">At
                  that point Israel had been committing a continuous aggression against
                  Gaza for 38 years, in its illegal and violent occupation of it, along
                  with the rest of the Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem,
                  after its conquest in 1967.</span></strong></span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; color: #0000ff;">By
                  2005, the occupation had been condemned as illegal by the highest
                  organs with jurisdiction over international law, most notably the International
                  Court of Justice in its 2004 opinion on the separation barrier. A
                  central illegality of the occupation for the International Court lay in
                  Israel’s settlements, which violate the law against colonization, and
                  which are central to the occupation. The fifteen judges of the
                  International Court were unanimously of the opinion that the
                  settlements were illegal and the wall itself was held by a majority of
                  13-2 to be illegal, partly because it was there to defend the
                  settlements, and not Israel itself, and thus could not qualify as
                  self-defence. </span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">The
                  rocket attacks from Gaza started in 2001 and took their first Israeli
                  victim in 2004. Since then, there had been 14 Israeli victims prior to
                  the current war. Tragic, indeed, but obviously paling in comparison to
                  the 1700 Palestinians killed in Gaza during the same period. One death
                  is indeed a tragedy, but many deaths are not just “a statistic”, as
                  Stalin had it; they are the tragedy multiplied many times over. Given
                  Israel’s illegal, aggressive and violent occupation, prior to the
                  withdrawal, Gaza rockets could only be regarded as necessary and
                  proportionate self-defence, or as reprisals against Israel’s
                  aggression. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Did Israel’s withdrawal from Gaza in 2005 change the situation?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">It
                  has been forcefully argued that the 18-month siege of Gaza, a major
                  reason for Hamas’ refusal to extend the truce, was itself an act of
                  aggression, giving rise to a right of self-defence. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">But
                  even more important, though usually ignored, is Israel’s continued
                  illegal and aggressive occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem
                  after the withdrawal from Gaza in 2005. Indeed, the withdrawal from
                  Gaza was intended to strengthen the hold on the other territories and
                  was accompanied by a greater increase in the number of settlers there
                  than those removed from Gaza.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">The
                  occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem figured equally with
                  Gaza in the condemnations of the World Court and the Security Council.
                  Furthermore, in the Oslo Accords, Israel and the Palestinians agreed
                  that “The two sides view the West Bank and the Gaza Strip as a single
                  territorial unit, the integrity and status of which will be preserved
                  during the interim period.” <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Indeed, when Hamas won the elections in
                  2006, elections declared impeccably fair and civil by all international
                  observers, it won them for the whole of the Palestinian Authority,
                  including the West Bank (it was not allowed by Israel to campaign in
                  East Jerusalem). Many Hamas West Bank legislators remain in Israeli
                  jails. </span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">And the basic fact is that the Palestinians of the West Bank and Gaza are <em>one people</em>,
                  however separated they are by walls and fences and check-points.
                  Israel’s unilateral withdrawal from one part of that people’s land
                  cannot turn that people into aggressors when they resist the illegal
                  occupation of the rest.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">So
                  self-defense cannot justify this attack, or the siege that preceded it.
                  What can? <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">That Hamas is a “terrorist organization”? But terrorism is
                  about deliberately killing civilians for illegal political ends, and in
                  that enterprise, Israel has topped Hamas by many multiples.</span></strong> That Hamas
                  does not recognize Israel’s “right to exist”? But Hamas has offered
                  many times to make a long-term truce with Israel on the basis of the
                  legal international borders, something it is clearly entitled to insist
                  upon. Israel says that’s not good enough, that Hamas first has to
                  recognize Israel’s <em>legitimacy</em>, in other words, it has to
                  concede the legitimacy of the Jewish state and all it has meant to the
                  Palestinians. In other words, as one Israeli journalist ironized,
                  Israel is insisting that Hamas embrace Zionism as a condition of even
                  talking peace with it.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">These
                  are not justifications for violence on this or any scale. Indeed, they
                  point to the most plausible reason Israel is fighting Hamas (and the
                  PLO before it): <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">self-defence, if you will, not against rockets and
                  mortars, but against having to make peace with the Palestinians on the
                  basis of the pre-1967 borders as required by international law. </span></strong></span></p>
