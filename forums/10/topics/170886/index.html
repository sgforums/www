It is the principle. Do our NTUC leaders have principle or integrity? Do they follow some basic principles that so when they are taking charge of NTUC, they understand and practise good corporate governance and look after people's welfare and wellbeing. So far, they do not seem to open up or care about such good corporate governance or even look after the livelihood of workers as shown in such persistent overseas losses. Do they have to have so much power to become so arrogant and so frivolous with all such decisions.</div>

DBS Nominees, understood to be representing DBS Private Equity, holds a similar stake.<br><br>The rest of Nextmall is held by China billionaire Liu Yonghao's New Hope Group, real estate developer Dahua, and Taiwanese entrepreneur Chang I-Chang, who owns the Apex group in Taiwan.<br><br>Nextmall provides merchandising, management and logistics services to China-incorporated hypermarket operator, Nextmart, for a fee.<br><br>'We went in as financial investors to get a feel of China, and secondly to establish our purchasing office in China, which we have done,' said FairPrice assistant general manager (investments) Victor Lim.<br><br>'We were not involved in the day-to-day operations of Nextmall which were done by a local management team. It overextended itself, developing too many hypermarkets in a short span of time. In addition, Nextmall also ventured into two mall developments.'<br><br>That was partly how Nextmall racked up its debts. Nextmall's management team is headed by Taiwanese Andrew Shen.<br><br>Nextmall owes suppliers $30 million; banks, including DBS's Shanghai branch, $40 million; and the developer of a Nanjing property, $6.6 million.<br><br>'FairPrice even offered a rescue package to assume the majority stake in Nextmall and take over the day-to-day running in order to reverse the losses, but we could not agree on the terms stipulated by the other shareholders,' said Mr Lim.<br><br>Nextmall owned the Nanjing store and took long term leases of about 15 to 20 years each for the other seven hypermarket stores and malls.<br><br>It has so far disposed of two stores to Carrefour - in Shanghai's Qipao district and in Nanjing. Nextmall has also assigned its long-term master lease in the mall where its Qipao hypermarket was located to Singapore's CapitaLand group.<br><br>Nextmall has also divested its hypermarket store in Yuyao in Zhejiang province. It is finalising a deal to find buyers to take over its master leases for a mall and store in Shanghai's Paoshan district and is in talks to sell three other hypermarket stores in Taizhuo, Shaoxing and Keqiao - all in Zhejiang.<br><br></div>

In this case, i think its more of failure to understand how overseas partners work.   In short , NTUC Is  small fry in this many shareholder arrangment, so cannot make decsision or even control or get to see the original accounts instead of modified one.<br><br>This is how many companies, GLC or private companies, loss money and get cheated in china and india.<br><br>And the main cause is one dishonest partners sucking money from the venture, thru some links.  I have many friends in many situations and also many public listed companies also fall into this trap.<br><br>This should be a lesson to them when venturing overseas, there are no short cuts and doing business in china has a lot of human complexities for personal gain rather than business contract fulfilment.

Salman, why you so like dat one?<br>Everytime mambo jambo para para sakura anyhow whack!<br>Tell u upfront liao, you keep on doing that.<br>You sure you understand what you type?<br>Debtor / creditor don't anyhow mix up.<br><br>When a company incurs a debt, money is owed to a creditor. Normally, a company will have many business partners / suppliers who is owed money. If the debtor is cash-strapped, creditors can choose to write off some loans so as to recover a portion from the debtor simply because partial payment is better than no payment (should the debtor be bankrupt).<br><br>To be honest, NTUC is nowhere near bankruptcy. If they cannot pay, some outlets in Singapore can be possesed by the creditors to be run by them or sold to recover their loans. So the 50% write-off by creditors is very optimistic but unrealistic (as you pointed out). Most likely, NTUC have to pay in full. The full potential loss is $80m in debt + $40m loss + interest payments on debts.<br><br>True, sale of assets can reduce the loss somewhat. But merchandise sold under liquidation conditions fetch poor prices.  Then you have to pay legal fees, rent, labour,suppliers, etc. By then, how much is left?<br><br>Not going to argue with you on the figures.<br>You want to insist loss is $40m, also can.<br>You tell me $40m SGD convert to Chinese yuan can buy what in China?<br>Don't answer also never mind lah.<br><br>Can anyone tell me what is the mission statement of NTUC?<br>WTF were they doing in China?<br><br></div>
