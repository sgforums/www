Those shares will be at a significantly higher price.<br><br>Caijing magazine reported yesterday that the Bank of China's main shareholder, Central Huijin Investment, had agreed to a revised formula whereby Temasek will be allowed to buy a five pct stake instead of 10 pct as originally planned. The original deal called for Temasek to pay 3.1 bln usd at 1.2 times the lender's book value with half of the shares bought from Central Huijin and half new shares issued by the bank.<br><br>The revised deal was approved by the State Council, or cabinet, last week, according to the newspaper.<br><br>Central Huijin had opposed the original deal out of concern that Temasek might gain too much influence over the domestic banking sector. It also may have been reacting to the domestic criticism over the price paid by Temasek.<br><br>Temasek also owns more than five pct of China Construction Bank.<br><br>john.bishop@xinhuafinance.com</div>
