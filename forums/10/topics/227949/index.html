            <div class='col-md body'>Brides and prostitutes- I've seen them all<br><br>Yesterday The New Paper reported how Viet brides are moved around S-E Asia like commodities. Today, two Vietnamese living in S'pore speak up about their compatriots<br>By Dawn Chia<br><br>December 28, 2006<br><br>HOOKER or husband-hunter.<br>That's the impression many Singaporeans have of Vietnamese women here.<br><br>Vietnamese national Linh (not her real name) has seen both types.<br><br>The mother of one, in her 30s, is a familiar face in the Vietnamese community here.<br><br>She has been married to a Singaporean for six years.<br><br>Linh didn't meet her husband through a matchmaking agency. She met him in Vietnam when he was on a business trip.<br><br>But she knows about the plight of Vietnamese women who have come here through matchmaking agencies, as well as 'working girls'.<br><br>She often helps those who need a listening ear or advice.<br><br>Those who come here to be matchmade have a simple wish - settle down and start a family. Ms Pham Thi Hong Truc is one of them. (See report on facing page.)<br><br>Not all are lucky.<br><br>Linh claimed some are forced by matchmaking agencies to marry against their will.<br><br>She told The New Paper: 'Before the girls arrive, they are told that they don't have to marry the men if they don't want to.<br><br>'This is not always the case - some agencies literally force the girl to leave with the man so they can close the deal.'<br><br>But two matchmakers here say this is not common.<br><br>Mr Janson Ong of Life Partner Matchmaker said he would not force Vietnamese women to marry just any one.<br><br>-- Picture: KUA CHEE SIONG<br>Mr Martin Wong of Mr Cupid International Matchmakers agreed.<br><br>He said: 'Both parties have to agree because it is a lifetime commitment.'<br><br>The matchmaking industry is lucrative - packages are priced between $5,000 and $10,000, and the profit is more than half the price of a package.<br><br>Linh said Singapore is now the prefered destination for many of these girls.<br><br>A few years ago, the trend was for village girls to look for Taiwanese husbands, she said.<br><br>That changed after some girls married less than desirable spouses who treated them as child-bearing machines and live-in maids.<br><br>Singapore became the next most sought-after place.<br><br>Some Vietnamese women also enter into sham marriages, she said.<br><br>These are your Geylang and Joo Chiat 'working girls'.<br><br>These women sometimes pay local men to marry them, so they can continue to work as prostitutes here.<br><br>At least 12 Singaporeans have been jailed for between four months and a year for such offences since 2004.<br><br>The Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau has opened files on 140 suspects so far this year, more than four times the number it handled in the whole of last year.<br><br>In 2004, the authorities were aware of only eight cases.<br><br>Linh said: 'They (the women) know that once they get married, they can apply for permanent residency (PR) status or a long-term pass.<br><br>'These women will pay the man between $2,000 and $3,000 to sign the marriage certificate and a further $500 or so each month to extend her visa.'<br><br>SHAM MARRIAGES<br><br>Couples in sham marriages do not live together - the woman may not even know where her 'spouse' lives. All she has is a contact number to call him once a month to extend her visa.<br><br>Linh said: 'Sham marriages have been taking place for more than three years.<br><br>'I know of a few divorces which took place recently between Vietnamese women and their Singaporean 'spouses' - these are the result of fake marriages.'<br><br>A typical woman involved in a sham marriage will be in her early 20s. She spends the nights earning her keep. In the mornings, she goes looking for a better catch.<br><br>If she finds someone, she will ask her 'husband', often unemployed or much older than herself, for a divorce.<br><br>Often, the women will divorce the men after they obtain PR status.<br><br>To get PR status, various documents (such as the marriage and educational certificates) will have to be produced.<br><br>Applicants then will have to wait a few months before they know if their application is successful.<br><br>But not all are like this, said Linh. Some Vietnamese women in the vice trade were duped into coming here, she said.<br><br>They are brought in by 'recruitment agents' promising jobs as waitresses and cleaners in restaurants.<br><br>In reality, they are forced to work in pubs and sell their bodies when they get here.<br><br>The women often take huge loans, running into a 'few thousand dollars', to pay these 'recruitment agents' before coming here.<br><br>Linh said: 'Girls who have managed to escape and gone to the embassy for help confided in me that they were forced into prostitution.<br><br>'But there are some who are not so lucky, and I believe they are still working to pay off their debts.<br><br>'Those who are repatriated have to face their debtors when they go back - it is a lose-lose situation for them.'<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>This wife says: Joo Chiat 'working girls' give my people a bad name<br><br>IT makes her angry when some of her countrymen give Vietnamese brides a bad name.<br><br>Ms Pham Thi Hong Truc (above), 20, has been in Singapore for three months, after finding her husband through a matchmaking agency, Mr Cupid International Matchmakers.<br><br>Ms Pham said she heard from friends and relatives about the 'working girls' in Joo Chiat.<br><br>She told The New Paper in Mandarin: 'When I was preparing to come to Singapore, I was worried about how people might look at me - would they think I'm a 'working girl'?<br><br>'I didn't want to be mistaken for a prostitute and be treated differently just because I'm Vietnamese.'<br><br>Thankfully, her worries were unfounded.<br><br>She lives in a quiet three-room HDB flat with her husband, 37, a renovation contractor who earns $2,000 a month, his elderly mother and his sister.<br><br>No one has passed any nasty remarks, she said.<br><br>If anything, neighbours thought she was Thai because of her darker complexion.<br><br>Ms Pham said, with a laugh: 'When I first arrived, I was so tanned people thought I was Thai.<br><br>'Now, I'm fairer, probably because I don't go out in the sun as often as I did when I was back home.'<br><br>Ms Pham, who also speaks Vietnamese and is learning English, is the youngest of six siblings. She comes from Hau Giang province, a six-hour drive from Ho Chi Minh City.<br><br>Her two elder sisters are married to Taiwanese men, but she was encouraged to marry a Singaporean by a cousin, who also married one.<br><br>They chose to marry a foreigner because she didn't want to marry a Vietnamese man who might 'beat me up when he's drunk'.<br><br>As Ms Pham and her relatives joined matchmaking agencies which took prospective grooms to Vietnam to select brides, they didn't have to save to get married or pay the agencies.<br><br>Her husband paid $11,000 to the agency.<br><br>Ms Pham, who has applied for PR, has not met many matchmade brides like herself, much less ventured into Joo Chiat, as she is still new to the country.<br><br>She recalled how stringent the immigration authorities were when she first landed here.<br><br>Ms Pham said: 'The airport officers asked me a lot of questions about my purpose here, whether I was here as a tourist or here to work.<br><br>'I told them I was here as a bride.<br><br>'Perhaps they thought I was related to the girl who died earlier this year because our names are very similar.'<br><br>She was referring to Ms Pham Thi Truc Linh, who fell to her death from a block of flats in Toa Payoh in March.<br><br>While Ms Pham wants to distance herself from the 'working girls', she is quick to jump to their defence.<br><br>She said: 'Not every one wants to be in that line - some are forced by circumstances.<br><br>'I'm sure they have reasons for doing what they do.<br><br>'As long as my husband and family know I'm not like them, I'm happy.'<br><br></div>
