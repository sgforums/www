              <p>http://www.temasekreview.com/2010/02/26/kenneth-jeyaretnam-demolishes-finance-tharmans-assertion-that-foreigners-help-raise-the-wages-of-singaporeans/</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Kenneth Jeyaretnam, the Secretary-General of the Reform Party has
                  written a comprehensive response to Finance Minister Tharman’s recent
                  Budget speech, demolishing his assertion that the government’s
                  foreigner policy has raised the wages of Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>Mr Tharman substantiated his claim by quoting the rise in median
                  income per household member, after adjusting for inflation, of 20 per
                  cent in the period 2005 – 2008, using it to demonstrate the “success of
                  the government’s policies.”</p>
              <p>Kenneth, who graduated with double first class honors in Economics
                  from Cambridge University, argued that “this could have occurred
                  without any rise in the living standards of median Singaporean citizen.”</p>
              <p>He explained that the discrepancy can be attributed to two reasons:</p>
              <p>1. The use of “residents” to compute figures in all official data
                  used by the government which includes both citizens and PRs. Over the
                  past decade, the resident population grew by 15 per cent due to the
                  influx of new citizens and PRs and as the majority of them do not have
                  dependents, the proportion of working adults in the resident household
                  would have risen thereby contributing to the increase in real median
                  income per household member.</p>
              <p>2. The figure excludes households consisting solely of non-working
                  persons over 60 years of age which would have decreased due to the
                  depressing of wages of senior citizens caused by the government’s
                  pro-foreigner policy.</p>
              <p>Kenneth added that Mr Tharman has painted an “exaggeratedly rosy
                  picture of the government’s failed economic policies of the past decade
                  while at the same time not even beginning to grasp the enormity of the
                  transformation necessary in the economy.”</p>
              <p>He also offered his own recommendations in the following areas of
                  continuing education and training, growing globally competitive
                  companies, boosting productivity and managing the inflow of foreign
                  workers.</p>
              <p>As expected, though the press release was made on 23 February 2010,
                  it did not receive any coverage by the mainstream media which has been
                  heaping generous praises on the Budget to give the false impression
                  that Singaporeans are supportive of it.</p>
              <p>Channel News Asia quoted a few PAP MPs singing in unison to lend
                  their support to the Budget while the Straits Times put up a misleading
                  article on Singaporeans posting comments supporting it on REACH forum
                  when the majority of them are critical of it.</p>
              <p>Though Kenneth’s initiatives are sound and good, they will never be
                  highlighted by the pro-PAP media out of fear of putting its political
                  master in a bad light.</p>
              <p>Despite the lack of publicity, some of Kenneth’s suggestions may
                  turn out “repackaged” in a different form a few months later as what
                  happened to his call to boost productivity last year which is finally
                  given due attention by the PAP now.</p>

              <p>The difference between the Emeritus NTU Professor and a 'Double First in Economics' held by Kenneth Jeyaretnam - is that the Emeritus NTU Professor has to be extra careful not to be seen to be "biting the hand that feeds him".</p>
              <p>The Emeritus NTU Professor has to be more discerning and circumspect with his commentaries that can embarrass the PAP.</p>
              <p>He has to be concious of what happened to CSJ - who decided to join the SDP and had declined the invitation to join the PAP, which was extended by the Head of his faculty who is an old PAP stalwart.</p>
              <p>Unlike the Emeritus NTU Professor, Kenneth Jeyaretnam has no obligation to the PAP and has the space to speak his mind clearly in the interest of Singaporeans.</p>

              <p class="date-and-time  last"><strong>THE average weekly wage in Australia is now $1226.70, after rising by 5.9 per cent in the year to November. </strong></p>
              <p>The quarterly seasonally-adjusted pace of average weekly ordinary time earnings (AWOTE) rose two per cent in the three months to November, Australian Bureau of Statistics data released today showed.</p>
              <p>This was a sharp acceleration on the 0.9 per cent quarterly growth recorded in the three months to August, lifting the annual rate well above the Reserve Bank of Australia's perceived "line in the sand" at 4.5 per cent.</p>
              <p>Still, the composition of the AWOTE series tends to make it volatile, which is why the RBA prefers to use the wage price index - released yesterday - as one of its main guides to wages growth.</p>
              <p>That index showed growth of just 0.6 per cent in the three months to December with the annual rate slipping to 2.9 per cent, a nine-year low.</p>

              <p>Despite the desperate attempts of the PAP to entice mainland Chinese to take up Singapore PR and citizenship to boost the population of ethnic Chinese in Singapore, it appears that even the non-professional PRC workers are shunning Singapore.</p>
              </div>
              </div>
              <p>In a Gallup poll done in July last year among China college students, their top three immigrations are the United States, France and South Korea. Singapore was not even featured among the top five.</p>
              <p>Since the floodgates are opened, a large number of mainland Chinese have flocked to study and work in Singapore with some of them settling here eventually, but with China becoming more developed and prosperous, the number may decrease with time.</p>
              <p>Sichuan Daily News interviewed a PRC lady from the province who worked as a technician in Singapore. She had obtained “NITEC” certification here which enables her to take up Singapore PR. (read article <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.temasekreview.com/2010/02/19/%e5%9b%9b%e5%b7%9d%e7%81%be%e5%8c%ba%e5%a7%91%e5%a8%98%e6%96%b0%e5%8a%a0%e5%9d%a1%e8%bf%87%e6%98%a5%e8%8a%82%ef%bc%9a%e4%b8%83%e5%a4%a9%e5%a4%a7%e5%81%87%e5%8f%aa%e4%bc%91%e4%b8%a4%e5%a4%a9/"><span style="color: #a91b33;">here</span></a>)</p>
              <p>However, she said she is not interested to stay on in Singapore and planned to return back to her hometown in China after picking up some technical knowledge and skills here.</p>
              <p>Singapore’s strongman Lee Kuan Yew boasted that the government is very “selective” about who it gives PRs and citizenships to though it is strange that Singapore needs to import technicians as “foreign talents” from China.</p>
              <p>In other countries, only highly qualified professionals or rich businessmen are given PRs, but in Singapore, it is not unusual to see technicians, cleaners, construction workers and even prostitutes obtaining PR relatively easily.</p>
              <p>According to figures from the Home Affairs Ministry, every two out of three PR applicants are successful. There were more than 70,000 PRs in 2008 alone.</p>
              <p>There are some schemes which allow foreigners from certain places like Hong Kong and Taiwan to obtain Singapore PR without even setting foot here.</p>
              <p>Being a first world country, Singapore should be able to attract talented immigrants with relative ease, but they seem to prefer Australia, Canada, New Zealand and other democratic states though they have much tighter restriction on immigration.</p>
              <p>The PAP should seriously reflect on why even the mainland Chinese are not keen to settle down in Singapore permanently instead of throwing precious taxpayers’ monies into the sea to make them feel “welcomed” here.</p>

              <p>Dear Calvin,</p>
              <p>The ruling party will like to take this opportunity to thanks the reform party chief Mr K. Jeya for his contributions and comments on the budget,  so far feedback from the citizens is not much different from Mr K comments, this clearly shown his common sense is just the same as any layman or woman on the street. But anyway, we will digest all these contirbutions, filter it and present to the budget committee for their deliberation.</p>
              <p>Just a note of caution, the feedback committee is being set up to take comments only, we do not accept recommendations, as comments is easier than recommendations,  we sincerely hope that people out there leave the rcommendation to the budget committee. Thank you</p>

              <p>First of all, Singaporeans know there are benefits in having foreigners in Singapore. Singapore's population has been increasing via foreign intake for decades. Its Lee Hsien Loong's uncontrolled immigration policy that upsets Singaporeans. <span style="color: #ff0000;">So stop labelling those who are against Lee Hsien Loong immigration policy as <em><strong>anti foreigners</strong></em>. <strong>We are simply anti- flooding.</strong></span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #888888;">What is the benefit of flooding in the last 3 years as opposed to the usual gradual intake?</span> </strong>Show me how flooding benefits Singaporeans in 20 years.</p>

              <p>Coming back to the discussion.</p>
              <p>I think that the Finance Minister's attributing of the increase of household income by 20% to the credit of foreigners is a TOTAL insult to the locals.</p>
              <p>Does he mean that locals cannot increase their income due to their own hard work, and productivity, and has to rely on foreign labour for that increase?</p>
              <p>There are many factors that contribute to the increase in household income. Such statements coming from a high level minister is very irresponsible and demonstrates his lack of knowledge.</p>

In a top bank in London where I applied for a job, I was constantly in touch with a human resource officer who had personally given each candidate her direct line to 'call any time, just in case'.<br><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://flowerpod.com.sg/forums/redirect.php?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.straitstimes.com%2FST%252BForum%2FOnline%252BStory%2FSTIStory_373658.html"><span style="color: #da2e67;">http://flowerpod.com.sg/forums/redirect.php?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.straitstimes.com%2FST%252BForum%2FOnline%252BStory%2FSTIStory_373658.html</span></a><br><br><strong>Job seekers with foreign-sounding names have it tough</strong><br><br>I have a friend working as an assistant HR manager in a mid-sized engineering firm. What she told me shocked me to the core. She said whenever her company places a recruitment advertisement for any position, its inbox is flooded with resumes - mostly from citizens of the Philippines, Thailand, Myanmar and China. Only about 10 per cent are from Singapore citizens or PRs. <br><br>Since my friend's team do not have time to sift through each and every curriculum vitae, they just delete any e-mail from a foreign-sounding name. I was shocked as my name sounds foreign too. I started to write as the first line of any cover letter I sent: 'I am a PR, living and working in Singapore for X years now.' But then, some do not even get to read the cover letter at all. <br><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://flowerpod.com.sg/forums/redirect.php?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.expatsingapore.com%2Fforum%2Findex.php%2Ftopic%2C47866.0.html"><span style="color: #da2e67;">http://flowerpod.com.sg/forums/redirect.php?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.expatsingapore.com%2Fforum%2Findex.php%2Ftopic%2C47866.0.html</span></a><br><br><strong>Employer who will base a new employee's salary on his previous salary irrespective of the market value</strong><br><br>Frankly this practice of Singapore companies demanding previous salary slips when they hire new employees is as immoral and dishonest as the candidates themselves inflating their previous salaries. In normal countries, the new salary would be pre-determined for lower-levels, or by negotiation and mutual agreement at the higher-end. Not what I hear is the local practice of X% more than what was on your last payslip...<br><br>It's not the employers business how much I earned in the previous job, instead if the employee wants X and the company is OK with that then end of story. If the company only wants to pay Y then they could negotiate. Using the pay slip as some kind of reference is not right.</p>
