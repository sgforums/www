              <p>To further elaborate,</p>
              <p>An overseas scholar has to serve 6 years in Singapore (their supposed bond), in whichever company they can get a job in, before they are considered to have paid off their scholarship.</p>
              <p>However, there is very little consequence in breaking this 'bond'. The only consequence is that they are not allowed to come back to Singapore should they not complete 6 years, which, to me, isn't much of a problem. Who cares about a small little island?</p>
              <p>That said, I do agree that the PRC students are not to be blamed. It's us cheapening our image, that has resulted in lowering ourselves as a good destination to be at.</p>

              <p>Perhap peoples here do not understand the important of our diminishing and old age population issue.  Because peoples here don't think far with a narrow mind.  With only a fraction of babies in comparing to the baby booming time, what can you visualise by year 2025  or 2030 , if we do not attract people here,  companies would not be able to get people, our population would be just 2 millions and reducing, we would all went back to selling Otah, manufacture bata shoes and paint brushes and most probably i would  became an old aunty selling papayas again.</p>
              <p>Thus , it is of no choice that we have to attract foreigners here, and if  u want to attract, you better get the younger ones with good potential. In order to compete with other countries to attract them, you have to let go a bit of slack in your rules and regulations, otherwise no one is coming. Once they are in, even if they move out later, we do expect them to do business with us in near future, but what we are hoping is not a 100% retention, but a mere 60% retention rate will be good enough, when they build their family here, bring their loves one in, our population increased, our economy  willl have enuf people to mend it. The ultimate reaping part will be their decendents, who will be true singaporeans by 2030 serving NS.</p>
              <p>Nobody like stranger to come to their house, but if the house is going to be empty soon, we need to get or adopt someone in to take care, the govt understand that this policy is not going to be a popular one, in fact, it has been one of the most unpopular one,  but is there another choice?, as govt, they can alway abolish this policy to make citizens happy and vote for them, but that is not the way out for Singapore, the govt bite the bullet with this policy to the extend that they can even forgo seats in the parliament just to get the population in check and hopefully a future for Singapore in a long term view. </p>
              <p>We hope that laymen and laywomen on the street understand this implication of old age and diminshing population isssue.  If you are in your 50s, dun be so selfish to look at your own situaiton,  think for the future of your generation, and to create a better generation for your youngs, is something a mature and gracious society citizens willl do, they build the furture for their youngs, not destroying it. And to do that, we have to solve the problem at the nick of the buds, not until the flowers had blosom, then it might be too late. Let welcome those foreign students.</p>

              people, our population would be just 2 millions and reducing,
              we would all went back to selling Otah, manufacture bata shoes
              and paint brushes and most probably i would  became an
              old aunty selling papayas again.</p>
              <p>Thus , it is of no choice that we have to attract foreigners
              here, and if  u want to attract, you better get the younger
              ones with good potential. In order to compete with other
              countries to attract them, you have to let go a bit of slack in
              your rules and regulations, otherwise no one is coming. Once they
              are in, even if they move out later, we do expect them to do
              business with us in near future, but what we are hoping is not a
              100% retention, but a mere 60% retention rate will be good enough,
              when they build their family here, bring their loves one in,
              our population increased, our economy  willl have enuf
              people to mend it. The ultimate reaping part will be their
              decendents, who will be true singaporeans by 2030 serving NS.</p>
              <p>Nobody like stranger to come to their house, but if the house is
              going to be empty soon, we need to get or adopt someone in to take
              care, the govt understand that this policy is not going to be a
              popular one, in fact, it has been one of the most unpopular
              one,  but is there another choice?, as govt, they can alway
              abolish this policy to make citizens happy and vote for them, but
              that is not the way out for Singapore, the govt bite the bullet
              with this policy to the extend that they can even forgo seats
              in the parliament just to get the population in check and hopefully
              a future for Singapore in a long term view.</p>
              <p>We hope that laymen and laywomen on the street understand this
              implication of old age and diminshing population isssue.  If
              you are in your 50s, dun be so selfish to look at your own
              situaiton,  think for the future of your generation, and to
              create a better generation for your youngs, is something a mature
              and gracious society citizens willl do, they build the furture for
              their youngs, not destroying it. And to do that, we have to solve
              the problem at the nick of the buds, not until the flowers had
              blosom, then it might be too late. Let welcome those foreign
              students.</p>

              <p>many years ago when the productivity bee appeared , singapore was then quite a productive country,i was also a little proud back then as a citizen, but as time goes by, when the system start to go awary, i also am starting to lose faith in the country i used to believe in.obviously you have not gone thru a vicous cycle when you constantly have to make ends meet, but in a different manner, every time when you upgrade to a better educated level, the standard of living goes up again and you have to claw up your way for a few yearsto reach that level , but just again when you reach it, it goes out of your reach by a few years again.</p>
              <p>i beleive i am not the only one having this problem at hand at the moment. so why don't you try this kind of like when to you it can be optional and can be shoved down to your face? i for one do not have this option to choose, it is being shoved to my face time and again.</p>

              <h1>What is missing in the productivity debate</h1>
              <div class="date">February 26, 2010</div>
              <div class="date"><strong>sgpolitics.net<img src="http://www.sgpolitics.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/productivity-chart-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" align="right"></strong></div>
              <p><strong>Written by Ng E-Jay<br>26 Feb 2010</strong></p>
              <p>Budget 2010 which was unveiled in Parliament by Finance Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam on Monday went to great lengths to emphasize the need to raise productivity in Singapore.</p>
              <p>It was proposed that the government spend $5.5 billion over the next 5 years at measures to retrain workers and help companies improve their business operations. The government intends to spend further $1.5 billion on research and development, and will nurture industries and companies it thinks has the greatest chance of innovating and succeeding globally.</p>
              <p><strong>The solution, it appears, is based on greater government intervention in the private sector and increased micromanagement of the economy.</strong></p>
              <p>But the same has been tried before, way back in the 1990s when productivity had begun to stagnate after two decades of high growth, and again in the early part of this decade, with initiatives spearheaded by bodies such as the Economic Review Committee. The proposals laid out in Budget 2010 seem like a tired re-run of the schemes devised in yesteryears.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Why then is the government confident that it will succeed this time round? As the old saying goes, insanity surely is doing the same thing over and over again and hoping for different results.</p>
              <p>Perhaps it is time to question whether excessive government intervention in the economy is the true killer of productivity growth, and whether the latest slew of measures will have the unintended consequence of further retarding the ability of Singaporeans to innovate and think out of the box.</p>
              <p>Entrepreneurship, innovation, creativity and risk-taking are attributes developed not under the umbrella of a watchful and powerful regime that controls where the money flows and decides who should get what benefits and under what conditions.</p>
              <p>Those are qualities developed in the free market where competition amongst peers is the main driver of higher output and productivity.</p>
              <p>What is conspicuously absent in the productivity debate is the fact that after more than four decades of nation building under the PAP, Singapore as a country has become less entrepreneurial and less productive.</p>
              <p>The bedrock of any dynamic economy lies in its small and medium enterprises, the mom and pop businesses, the heartland shops, stalls and emporiums that cater to folks from all walks of life.</p>
              <p>In Singapore however, Government-Linked Corporations (GLCs) which account for 60% of the economy have crowded out many small players and stifled innovation.</p>
              <p>Worse, because they are run not by seasoned businessmen but by bureaucrats from the establishment circles, wastage and poor allocation of resources build up over time, and the lack of drive and creativity puts an ever increasing dampener on the whole economy.</p>
              <p>The suffocating entrenchment of GLCs in our economy must be drastically reduced before Singaporeans can break free from the economic chains that inhibit the full expression of their creative drive.</p>
              <p>We are getting nowhere with the current productivity debate because the government has refused to acknowledge the root cause of poor productivity growth and the proposed measures will only serve to entrench the status quo and deepen our problems.</p>
              <p>Ultimately the problem lies with what the PAP has done to, and will continue to do to, our minds.</p>

              <p>In the world, an SME is defined as a business that has a turnover of $50m to $100m.</p>
              <p>Everyone knows what an SME is like in Singapore. Small and insignificant.</p>
              <p>I would also suggest that much of the reason for the failure of our businesses to grow, is due to the over-emphasis on cost. Because our govt forever cares about cheap (good is optional), our businesses also follow the same principle.</p>
              <p>The result? You have people like Adam Khoo that laments about having to pay more for local labour, and no consideration of anything else.</p>
              <p>In addition, there is also the consistent loss of talent to other non-SG corporations. I worked in a Singapore organization before, and moved on to US and European organizations, which pay well, and treat people better. The only reason why our large GLCs can survive is due to very strong systematic processes that are setup (I give due credit on this), where they can keep hiring fresh grads and use those processes to bring them up to speed.</p>
              <p>Even so, hiring fresh grads usually requires a bare minimum of 2 years before they become truly effective.</p>

              <p>http://www.temasekreview.com/2010/02/26/kenneth-jeyaretnam-demolishes-finance-tharmans-assertion-that-foreigners-help-raise-the-wages-of-singaporeans/</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Kenneth Jeyaretnam, the Secretary-General of the Reform Party
              has written a comprehensive response to Finance Minister Tharman’s
              recent Budget speech, demolishing his assertion that the
              government’s foreigner policy has raised the wages of
              Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>Mr Tharman substantiated his claim by quoting the rise in median
              income per household member, after adjusting for inflation, of 20
              per cent in the period 2005 – 2008, using it to demonstrate the
              “success of the government’s policies.”</p>
              <p>Kenneth, who graduated with double first class honors in
              Economics from Cambridge University, argued that “this could have
              occurred without any rise in the living standards of median
              Singaporean citizen.”</p>
              <p>He explained that the discrepancy can be attributed to two
              reasons:</p>
              <p>1. The use of “residents” to compute figures in all official
              data used by the government which includes both citizens and PRs.
              Over the past decade, the resident population grew by 15 per cent
              due to the influx of new citizens and PRs and as the majority of
              them do not have dependents, the proportion of working adults in
              the resident household would have risen thereby contributing to the
              increase in real median income per household member.</p>
              <p>2. The figure excludes households consisting solely of
              non-working persons over 60 years of age which would have decreased
              due to the depressing of wages of senior citizens caused by the
              government’s pro-foreigner policy.</p>
              <p>Kenneth added that Mr Tharman has painted an “exaggeratedly rosy
              picture of the government’s failed economic policies of the past
              decade while at the same time not even beginning to grasp the
              enormity of the transformation necessary in the economy.”</p>
              <p>He also offered his own recommendations in the following areas
              of continuing education and training, growing globally competitive
              companies, boosting productivity and managing the inflow of foreign
              workers.</p>
              <p>As expected, though the press release was made on 23 February
              2010, it did not receive any coverage by the mainstream media which
              has been heaping generous praises on the Budget to give the false
              impression that Singaporeans are supportive of it.</p>
              <p>Channel News Asia quoted a few PAP MPs singing in unison to lend
              their support to the Budget while the Straits Times put up a
              misleading article on Singaporeans posting comments supporting it
              on REACH forum when the majority of them are critical of it.</p>
              <p>Though Kenneth’s initiatives are sound and good, they will never
              be highlighted by the pro-PAP media out of fear of putting its
              political master in a bad light.</p>
              <p>Despite the lack of publicity, some of Kenneth’s suggestions may
              turn out “repackaged” in a different form a few months later as
              what happened to his call to boost productivity last year which is
              finally given due attention by the PAP now.</p>

              <p>There is this growing numbers of Minister who are listening less but talking down more to the public. This phenomenon but puzzling affair are growing occurrences.</p>
              <p>But if you see Malaysian-born Khaw, he is a different story altogether and I like him. His has sincere trait that is so hard to find in the local-born Ministers.</p>

              <p>Despite all this productivity talk, they still can't answer why there is a need for a MM, 2 SMs and a bunch of ministers without portfolio directly doing what the PM is supposed to be doing.</p>

              <p><strong>What is conspicuously absent in the productivity debate is the fact that after more than four decades of nation building under the PAP, Singapore as a country has become less entrepreneurial and less productive.</strong></p>
              <p>I would just want to add another layer of observation to this statement.....</p>
              <p>1st observation - Crowding out effect</p>
              <p>This is a result of long term crowding out effect by govt high wage policies that cannibalized domestics social and human resources from the private sector. It is hard to directly proportion 1 to 1 relation to the effect.</p>
              <p>(PS: govt ministeries goes overseas to recruit SG students to work in civil servant. I would rather that they invite Human resources of local SME to jointly do the recruitment drive to recruit SG rather than cream off the top candidates)</p>
              <p>2nd observation - Rent Seeking public policies.</p>
              <p>Rent seeking Economies....our government has created renk seeking policies to justify excessive consumption of imoral goods in the name of public. Instead of creating needed services in the economies, SG govt Create services to maintain Rent seeking policies. </p>
              <p>Rent Seeking policies kill the fundatmental of Economics principle of allocating Resources by providing Needed Services and Goods thru market forces. Rather Monies is now to be "FIND" thru creative rent seeking policies vs "Produced".</p>
              <p>Recently when LHL said that they would organized and fixed "Productivities"  I am not sure if LHL comprehend the role of institution for the economies. In his current domain he can only organized Rent Seeking Policies by reducing rate to increase in productivities.</p>
              <p>"Productivies" can't be fixed without a long term plan for a substained Economics Growth and the quinntessential ingredients on Growth is entreprenuership and innovation within the given resources. That is the bases of increasing productivities....it is not about organizing, cheaper, faster, better.....</p>
              <p>Public sector economies is tricky excessive intervention particularly when SG govt operates like an corporation it is too big, too blind and become a moral hazzard for the goods of its people.  </p>

              <p>In the world, an SME is defined as a business that has a turnover of $50m to $100m.</p>
              <p>Everyone knows what an SME is like in Singapore. Small and insignificant.</p>
              <p>I would also suggest that much of the reason for the failure of our businesses to grow, is due to the over-emphasis on cost. Because our govt forever cares about cheap (good is optional), our businesses also follow the same principle.</p>
              <p>The result? You have people like Adam Khoo that laments about having to pay more for local labour, and no consideration of anything else.</p>
              <p>In addition, there is also the consistent loss of talent to other non-SG corporations. I worked in a Singapore organization before, and moved on to US and European organizations, which pay well, and treat people better.
