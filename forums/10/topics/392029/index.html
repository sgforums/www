              <p><strong>Kenneth Jeyaretnam sets up Facebook to call for abolition of GRC<br></strong>February 26, 2010</p>
              <p>Reform Party’s Secretary-General Kenneth Jeyaretnam has set up a Facebook group calling for the abolition of GRC or Group Representative Constituency which has garnered 140 members so far.</p>
              <p>According to him, the facebook is:</p>
              <p>“For all those who believe that GRC’s are simply an obstacle to true representation, have no place in a Democracy and that Singapore should go back to SMC’s.”</p>
              <p>The GRC system was introduced in 1988 to ensure “minority representation” in Parliament though ethnic minorities had won in single seats against Chinese opponents in past elections most notably Kenneth’s father, the late Joshua Benjamin Jeyaretnam who won in the predominantly Chinese ward of Anson twice in 1981 and 1984.</p>
              <p>Critics of the system claimed that it enabled “weak” PAP candidates to “ride on the coat-tails” of heavy-weight ministers and disadvantaged the opposition who is unable to find many credible candidates to compete in the GRCs.</p>
              <p>The opposition has never won a single GRC since its inception. The closest they came to was in 1988 when the Workers’ Party trio of Francis Seow, Dr Lee Siew Choh and Mohamad Yakcop won 49.1 per cent of the votes in Eunos GRC.</p>
              <p>As the redrawing of electoral boundaries fall under the ambit of the Electoral Boundary Review committee, the GRC system is open to rampant gerrymandering by the PAP to dilute bases of opposition support.</p>
              <p>GRCs who witnessed closely fought contests often “vanished” into thin air without any reasons in subsequent elections.</p>
              <p>For example, Eunos GRC which was twice won narrowly by the PAP was dissolved and absorbed in neighboring GRCs in the 1997 election.</p>
              <p>Cheng San GRC was won by the PAP with only 54 per cent of the votes in the 1997 election. It “disappeared” from the electoral map altogether in subsequent elections.</p>
              <p>The GRC system is instrumental in perpetuating the PAP’s political hegemony without which it will probably lose a dozen more seats to the opposition.</p>
              <p>Despite rising opposition to the GRC system from Singaporeans, the PAP is unlikely to abolish it completely as this will mean dismantling their own power support base.</p>

              <p>The GRC system is another way to ensure that the PAP will stuff Parliament with all the dead wood warming the chairs.</p>
              <p>An unnecessary large Parliament is another LKY's kiasu idea of handicapping the Opposition Parties to find 84 candidates to challenge all 84 seats.</p>
              <p>Added to this, each candidate will have to pay a hefty nomination fee that will be lost if the candidate cannot win more then the minimum 5% of the ballot in a constituency.</p>
              <p>Singapore has a population of about 5 Million People, and need more MPs to help an over-inflated cabinet to run the country - which makes the Mayor of New York City or London to be more efficient then the PM of Singapore.</p>
              <p>Compared to the productivity of the PM of UK - whether from the Conservative or Labor Parties - the political parties certainly know how to represent their respective constituents with more productivity per MP then the PAP in Singapore.</p>

              <p>As usual saying, if you can't win, dun blame your swimming trunk is too tight or too loose, as a ruling party, they have the right under the consitution to amend the boundaries of voting consitutuencies, if Mr K Jeya is the ruling party head now, i have no doubt he will the same. Just like a casino, as owner, I make the dens and set the rules and regulations, you place your bet, if you can win, god bless you, if not, dun blame it on the changes and the owner, blame it on yourself.</p>
              <p>The ironic of GRC is placed in a way that if one wins, one wins big, the Govt is also at Odd in doing it, but the main reason is for gathering towns together to gain an economy of scale in decision implemention and progression. Just like if one town wish to plant flower on the road side, the whole GRC will be the same, with just one contractors, cheaper, better and faster, yet with MPs coming together to settle resident issue, the brain will be bigger and the decision will be more decisive and good for all. Even in term of organising and co operation, it will be more wholesome and better teamworking.</p>
              <p>If Mr K Jeya is smart enuf, he should agree to GRC formation, go along with the trend, take on a few GRC as his targets, bet on it, rally on it, and if he wins, he won big, one shot takes 4 to 5 seats, in fact, it is an economy of scale to him. Do not be succumbed to GRC issue, take it on to your advantage rather than looking at it as disadvantage, and if you notice that the govt is going soft on GRC, that mean they are reducing GRC, maybe from 6 GRC to 4 GRC, you can sense that the Govt knows what is at stake and therefore withdrew their strategy on increasing GRC and instead reducing it.</p>
              <p>Can someone please pass my comments to Mr K Jeya, he is not as smart as his father.</p>

              <p>Is there anything to prevent any groupings of single constituencies to pool their needs and resources to enjoy economies of scale in servicing their constituencies ?</p>
              <p>The GRC system will simply allow any candidates rejected by the constituents to enter Parliament - on the success of the other GRC candidates.</p>

Just like if one town wish to plant flower on the road side, the whole GRC will be the same, with just one contractors, cheaper, better and faster, yet with MPs coming together to settle resident issue, the brain will be bigger and the decision will be more decisive and good for all. Even in term of organising and co operation, it will be more wholesome and better teamworking.</p>
              <p>If Mr K Jeya is smart enuf, he should agree to GRC formation, go along with the trend, take on a few GRC as his targets, bet on it, rally on it, and if he wins, he won big, one shot takes 4 to 5 seats, in fact, it is an economy of scale to him. Do not be succumbed to GRC issue, take it on to your advantage rather than looking at it as disadvantage, and if you notice that the govt is going soft on GRC, that mean they are reducing GRC, maybe from 6 GRC to 4 GRC, you can sense that the Govt knows what is at stake and therefore withdrew their strategy on increasing GRC and instead reducing it.</p>
              <p>Can someone please pass my comments to Mr K Jeya, he is not as smart as his father.</p>

              <p>Very simply put it, if GRC is a flaw system, exploit it instead of grumbling over it. Is the opposition scare of the big guns in GRC?, if so, i think that is very lame, take them on and you win big, dun go for those small fly like potong ice-cream and hougang teochew porridge or Nee Soon char kuay teow, go for the big one, the sharkfin and abalone ya.</p>

              <p>In terms of business prospective, wouldnt it be a waste of resources to compete in SMCs instead of GRCs. The capital raised can be properly channelled coupled with a pool of strong candidates to compete in the election rather than having those capital diversified as a form of risky venture.</p>
