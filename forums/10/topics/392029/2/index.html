              <p>In terms of business prospective, wouldnt it be a waste of resources to compete in SMCs instead of GRCs. The capital raised can be properly channelled coupled with a pool of strong candidates to compete in the election rather than having those capital diversified as a form of risky venture.</p>
              <p>Party flags and banners, loan of cars, loudhailers, rental of places and manpower issues are cost induced activities.</p>

              <p><br>Can a fair political system be determined by the simple reasoning in the economies of scale that a GRC system can have ?</p>
              <p>It is clear that a GRC system was introduced by LKY to prevent certain unpopular ministers from being thrown out of an election that only LKY can claim to be a freak election result - as if the citizen's choice are freak.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Each candidate will still have to pay the fee that is refundable only if 5% of the votes are received.</p>
              <p>A pool of single candidates can still form a common resource to enjoy economy of scale as is available to a GRC.</p>
              <p>The only difference between a GRC and a SRC is that in a GRC - an unpopular candidate can still sneak into Parliament even when the constituents do not want the candidate to represent them.</p>
              <p>It will be a traversity of natural justice when an Opposition Candidate can have overwhelming support from the constituents in one of the 5 GRC grouping but can only achieve marginal results in the other 4.</p>
              <p>With the familiar political gerrymeandering of electoral lines by the incumbent ruling party that also make constant changes to electoral rules, it will not be a surprise for the various blocks - that voted for the opposition parties in the previous elections - to be absorbed into a redrawn boundary that see these blocks being absorbed into other wards that are strongholds of the incumbent party.</p>

              <p><br>Equitable ?</p>
              <p>Can it be equitable when one who is rejected by a constituency which one has selected to stand in, but will get pulled up by the marginal results of the other candidates in the other constituencies that form a GRC ?</p>
              <p>It would have been more equitable if in the GRC system - the losing candidate that cannot even garner 25 per cent of the ballot should concede to its opponent - even if this constituency is part of a GRC.</p>
              <p>The manner in which the GRC is designed can only benefit the incumbent political party - when the other circumstances are all controlled by the incumbent.</p>
              <p>Besides the GRC, the Electoral Commission is controlled by the Prime Minister's Office, and the electoral boundaries are headed by a Minister who is from the ruling party.</p>

              <p>The problem with politics in Singapore is that there are many more Singaporeans willing to participate in politics, but have decided not to be pro-active due to the manner in which politics is conducted in Singapore by LKY and his cronies forming the PAP.</p>
              <p>While LKY dare to criticise the Opposition candidates to be liars and gangsters - he failed to admit his own hypocritical stance as the Number ONE Political Gangster in Singapore Politics.</p>
              <p>He can only talk big while in Singapore and when his own lawsuit is pursued in some overseas judicial system - his position do not stand up under the natural justice that somehow seems higher in the overseas judicial system.</p>
              <p>In the last Election 2006, the PAP had to resort to heavy handed pressure on the local newspapers and the broadcast media to provide more positive publicity to its own position and portray the opposition parties as incapable.</p>

              <p>Can two opposition Members of Parliament stand up to 82 MPs from the PAP ?</p>
              <p>The other 82 MPs from the PAP have been seen to display such childish attitude and impoliteness towards the present two MPs from the Opposition that it is shocking to see such hypocritical behaviour amongst adults.</p>
              <p>Of the two MPs from the Opposition Party in Parliament, CST from Potong Pasir is practically hopeless with a heart problem and with no ability to grow his own party with new and fresh members to serve other constituencies.</p>
              <p>The best hope is with the Worker's Party - if only they can attract more professionals to accept the leadership of Low and Sylvia - especially when both are not known to have any clear political philosophy based on their unexpressed intellect.</p>

              <p>Does the GRC system put a premium on parties to field credible teams - or has it not been a fact that it is essential for any political parties to field credible candidates in either single representative constituencies or in GRCs ?</p>
              <p>The GRC system is part of the multiple gerrymeandering strategies of LKY and the PAP to stack the cards in their own favor.</p>
              <p>By itself, the GRC will probably offer a 50-50 chance to all parties concerned, but with the other tools of controls and influence manipulated and unashamedly wielded by the PAP - it allows the PAP to enjoy a handicapped advantage over all other parties. </p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>The fact that there will be more single wards in the upcoming election is not due to any altruistic efforts on the part of the PAP leadership, and is due to their internal grassroot reports that confirms a surge of discontentment in the heartlands towards the PAP.</p>
              <p>The dismantling of the GRCs has more to do with self-preservation of the PAP - as they know that certain ministers are targetted by the population for the insenstivities and arrogance of their attitude towards public opinions.</p>
              <p>Knowing that the ground has changed, and the politics of today is quite different from the last election in 2006, it will be sheer suicide for the PAP to remain arrogant when their own interest is at stake and ignore the signals from the ground.</p>
              <p>The PAP is not stupid and even as much as they do not depend on straw polls, they will still depend on poll studies to gather intelligence of the political reactions to all the policies implemented over the last five years.</p>
              <p>If the number of single wards are increased in the next general election, it is critical that Singaporeans should ignore any hint or insinuations of PAP's ability to trace the ballot papers to break the supposedly secrecy of the vote.</p>
              <p>The fact that the PAP can know which HDB block to be moved into a redrawn electoral boundary is unsettling - as this serve to dilute the votes for the opposition that were abundant during the last election, and can only cast more doubt and fear in the Singapore electorate, especially when most are working for GLCs.</p>
              <p>If the boundaries for the various wards remain fixed for every election, it would have at least allow the general population to vote without any undue influence.</p>

              <p>I strongly disagree with your posting</p>
              <ol>
              <li>There is no such thing as GRCs ANYWHERE else in the world. As such, it's only a gimmick for the PAP to protect their territory. The standard methods to prevent the opposition from becoming a force to be reckoned with are (a) propagate the myth that joining the opposition will result in negative consequences to an individual (See Jeya, CSJ, etc), (b) put up roadblocks such as deposits to reduce opposition participation in the elections, (c) create GRCs to ensure the effects of (a) and (b) are maximized</li>
              <li>And if the GRC system is as you mentioned, to "put a premium on parties to field credible teams", why not just have 1 seat to represent the entire GRC area, instead of putting several seats, which increases costs for the taxpayer?</li>
              </ol>
              <p>As I said, your comments don't make much sense to me, because GRCs don't make sense in the 1st place.</p>
              <p>Some other idiot (an individual who cannot decide if it wants to be a he or she) mentioned that a GRC helps to create economies of scale as decisions can be made for a larger region. In the 1st place, why do you even need to have a GRC then? Just have ONE SEAT to represent that region so that you have THAT economies of scale in the 1st place.</p>
              <p>PS: The reason why you feel the 2 opposition MPS are "not raising much noise at all", is because you solely rely on the media with the lowest freedom in the world for information. Therefore, all they need to do is NOT TO report on what the 2 opposition MPs are raising in parliament, and that's "not raising much noise" to you</p>

              <p>It would have been more equitable if in the GRC system - the losing candidate that cannot even garner 25 per cent of the ballot should concede to its opponent - even if this constituency is part of a GRC.</p>
              <p>The manner in which the GRC is designed can only benefit the incumbent political party - when the other circumstances are all controlled by the incumbent.</p>
              <p>Besides the GRC, the Electoral Commission is controlled by the Prime Minister's Office, and the electoral boundaries are headed by a Minister who is from the ruling party.</p>

              <p>I strongly disagree with your posting</p>
              <ol>
              <li>There is no such thing as GRCs ANYWHERE else in the world. As
              such, it's only a gimmick for the PAP to protect their territory.
              The standard methods to prevent the opposition from becoming a
              force to be reckoned with are (a) propagate the myth that joining
              the opposition will result in negative consequences to an
              individual (See Jeya, CSJ, etc), (b) put up roadblocks such as
              deposits to reduce opposition participation in the elections, (c)
              create GRCs to ensure the effects of (a) and (b) are maximized</li>
              <li>And if the GRC system is as you mentioned, to "put a premium on
              parties to field credible teams", why not just have 1 seat to
              represent the entire GRC area, instead of putting several seats,
              which increases costs for the taxpayer?</li>
              </ol>
              <p>As I said, your comments don't make much sense to me, because
              GRCs don't make sense in the 1st place.</p>
              <p>Some other idiot (an individual who cannot decide if it wants to
              be a he or she) mentioned that a GRC helps to create economies of
              scale as decisions can be made for a larger region. In the 1st
              place, why do you even need to have a GRC then? Just have ONE SEAT
              to represent that region so that you have THAT economies of scale
              in the 1st place.</p>
              <p>PS: The reason why you feel the 2 opposition MPS are "not
              raising much noise at all", is because you solely rely on the media
              with the lowest freedom in the world for information. Therefore,
              all they need to do is NOT TO report on what the 2 opposition MPs
              are raising in parliament, and that's "not raising much noise" to
              you</p>

              <p>Interesting fact. Thanks for the information.</p>
              <p>Interestingly, the 3 countries are 3rd world countries not known for democracy as well. So, I guess our PAP can selectively choose these 3 countries to prove that GRCs exist in other places as well, and to justify their case.</p>

              <p>Being born in the years of racial tumoil, I had originally thought that it is sensible that minorities rights are being represented in the GRC system (3 contituency in 1 GRC). However it seems to me that instead, in the name of racial harmony, I have given away my rights to vote when the system changes from 3 to 4 to 5, 6....where Braddel is Marine Parade GRC</p>
              <p>I therefore support the cause of abolishing GRC before more changes may come and take away our rights to vote.</p>
