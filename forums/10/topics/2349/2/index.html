            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Shotgun:</div><div class="quote_body">Viper, your entire argument is based on the fact that 1.  Rafales will be recieving whatever Typhoons recieve at the same time.  2.  SHould uncle sam refuse to sell us AMRAAMs we will have MICAs right?<br><br>Point 1 basically balances it out between the Rafale and Typhoon.  Point 2 is logical, since US has always been very restrictive on their weapons sales.  Now, the question regarding point 2 is, WHY ARE WE DESPERATE FOR AMRAAMs?   Are our export versions of AMRAAMs that formidable?  Personally, in an earlier arguement, it was already proven that there are already several Medium range missiles in the market that has surpassed the AMRAAMs' benchmark.  No doubt MICA too may have also crossed that boundary, but we need not restrict ourselves to the french or US for missiles.  Remember we still have our Darby options.  Relations between Singapore and Israel has always been close, and I don't think Rafael will have any problems supplying Derby's to us.  Of course, with this, I am assuming that the Derby is more capable than the AMRAAM.<br><br>Question:  Can we rig Derbys and Python 4s on French Rafales?  Just interested to find out since you already said that Rafales require some modification to carry AMRAAMs.<br><br>Anyway, I'm not against the Rafale either.  I just hope that we'll get the Typhoon instead.</div></blockquote>Shotgun,<br><br>my argument for the Rafale hinges on a lot more than the 2 points you've mentioned. I have also referred to the following points in previous posts.<br><br>Training - Singapore already has a training detachment in France. The groundwork, facilities, relationship and other factors are already there. It would be a considerably smaller burden if training for the new fighters is set up in a place where we already have a detachment. Look at the current RSAF permanent overseas training detachments, US(5), France, Australia(3), Brunei and Thailand. I'm sure you'll agree that the logistical burden is already significant, and there're other temp detachments to consider. Why go through the trouble of setting up additiona facilities?<br><br>Capabilities - Like I and Joe Black have highlighted in previous posts, in evaluation by the RoKAF has already pointed to the Rafale as the best choice on technical merit, F-15K 2nd and Typhoon 3rd. These are the guys who actually looked at the planes, are going to fly and maintain the planes and made their choice, rather than reading the brochures given out at airshows or articles written by biased "analysts" in magazines. Who are we to say that they are wrong?<br><br>Combat experience - Combat expericnce is not all about how many planes you shot down, how many SAMS you evade etc. Its about the increased tempo of combat ops, the increased strain on machines and equipment to do what they're supposed to. rafale has done that, while Typhoon hasn't even embarked on any significant long haul flights to overseas airshow. Now thats REAL confidence from the consortium about its abilities.<br><br>Timeframe - Another point which I've made over and over again. The flight test program is almost complete for the Rafale, including basic flight tests, weapons tests. Tests with the CFTs are already at an advance stage. We'll be getting an aircraft which is ready for opoerations from the word go in terms of the Rafale. To compare the CFT for example: I've seen a real Rafale with CFTs flying, the only Typhoon CFT I've seen is a snazzy computer grpahic on a bus advert.<br><br>The most difficult part of weapons integration is the addition of software codes to the aircraft mission computers to allow its systems to opoerate the weapon. In the case of Rafale with derby we need both Rafael's and Dassaults help to integrate this. We can be sure both parties will be willing to do so. AMRAAM integration will therefore be needed to be carried out by Raytheon, and hence the question of US arms export policies will rear its head again.<br><br>asic fact is this: They're both good fighters, I'm sure. But the fact is that the Rafale, when other factors are taken into account, would suit our requirements much better than the Typhoon. It may be older, but then the Apache was older than the Tiger, look where the attack helo contract went.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>F-16 on show is a Block 50. The 35th FW based in Misawa Japan(tailcode: WW) operates F-16C/D Block 50 aircraft, and a check with the production numbers on the aircraft would confirm that all 3 aircraft are Block 50s. The CFTs, pods and seekers on the aircraft in the static display are cobbled on by the LM people AFTER the F-16 arrived. After all, the USAF operates NO Block 60s and the first flight of the F-16 CFT was just a month or so back.<br><br>YourFather: Customers for the Typhoon? Yup, they have lots. Spain UK Germany and Italy. Which are the development partners. Greece? In the article posted earlier it was already stated that it has its arm twisted into buying the Typhoon. So in terms of export customers who've selected Typhoon purely on merit = 0<br><br>As for the AMRAAM integration, you seem to have a lot of confidence that the US will ok the UK to integrate the AMRAAM if the UK asks. I'm sorry, but I'm afraid that I don't share your confidence. More likely it'll be the other way round: The UK will be unlikely to not give the US 'face' by insisting on AMRAAM integration even if the US says no.<br><br>You wrote: "The problem with the Typhoon is that the specifications for the Tranche 3 Typhoon is not concrete, and we would perhaps get Tranche 2 first, with an option for upgrade to Tranche 3 upon agreement on Tranche 3 specifications. (This is the way I see it, if we get Typhoon) "<br><br>Isn't this one of the supposed points against the Rafale in that earlier article you posted? The one where "why get a downgraded version now when you can get the better one later?"   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Weapons. Yup, thats right, the Meteor is supposed to equip both Typhoon and Rafale. What my point is the weapons before Meteor arrives. The Rafale is sure to have MICA, while the Typhoon will have only Skyflash and Sparrow if AMRAAM approval is not given. and if what I've heard is true, it WILL NOT be given.<br><br>I've addressed the problem of the M88 long ago in earlier posts. The newer M88-3 engines, designed specifically for hot and high operations have already been cleared for export in Rafales. The underpowered M88-2, which eveb tge French admit is underpowered for hot and high ops, is not a factor at all.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Typhoon edge in A2A? How confirmed is that? On what basis is that argument derived from? Computer simulations? I've worked quite a bit with FEM programs for aerospace applications in my course of study, and every person who does this programs will alway say before he does anything "The are just programs which will simulate the actual aircraft, and it should not be taken as how the actual plane will actually perform". The Typhoon is nothign ahort of a paper aeroplane, doing well in computer simulations and drawing board. I would prefer to reserve judgement until the consortium actually gets its act together and starts demonstrating in real life what their pet project can do.<br><br></div>

Like I've mentioned, they professional people who would evetually fly, maintain and have examined the planes close up have already stated that the Rafale is the best choice on technical merit, followed by the F-15K and then the Typhoon.

            <div class='col-md body'>To add to Viper's comment, I have read from Air Force Technology web site that Rafale is compatible with all current NATO weapons, including AMRAAMs. I'm not sure if that means that Dassult will be integrating AMRAAMs onto Rafales, if they have already tested (include test fires or what) AMRAAMs on Rafales. I can't see how difficult it would be to integrate AMRAAMs technically. The only problem once again is the export laws in the US. Why do you think RSAF still cannot have AMRAAMs back home but have to keep them in Canon/Luke AFBs?<br><br>Secondly, given ST Aero experience in integrating Python 4 (btw, Asia Pacific Defence Journals confirms that Python 4 is on the Block 50s Vipers - when and how, the author did not specify) and possibly Derby on F5S and Vipers, it is definitely not going to be too difficult integrating them to Rafale with Dassault's assistance. BTW, worse come to worse, we can also seek help from Rafael/Elta/IAI given their expertises in avionics and weapons integration.  If the Israelis can integrate their weapons onto chinese made airplanes and Russian MiGs, I don't think there will be too much problem integrating them onto the French made aircraft. Furthermore, I think the French will probably produce better source codes, easier to maintain and extend. The Israelis could even extend the Vipers 20 year old source code - including their FBW source, not to say the more modern Ada language used today.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

What I meant in previous posts was that is the Typhoon had little chance of AMRAAM integration, Rafale would have even less chance. As for why we cant have the AMRAAM stored here, its just one of America's quirks about not introducing new capabilities to a region.<br>Now, for something else - I was just reading JDW, and in it, they said that there were persistent speculations of our Fokker 50 tail no. 713 is a 'Black Crow' SIGINT aircraft, equipped with the AR-7000.

No proof though... Haven't seen any extra ordinary anntennas or radar dome on the aircraft. However, it was more affirmed that one of the old C-130 is indeed a SIGINT aircraft. The guys at RAAF spotted that. The aircraft also has retractable anntenas. The deployment of that aircraft during the pitch black exercises caused quite a stirred during the SingTel purchase of Optus. Rumours has it that RSAF was spying on Aussies.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Anybody who can confirm about the "Black Crow" would be nice, but such highly sensitive aircraft would usually not be a public domain knowledge.

Sigh.</div></blockquote>As for why not use Derby as the main active guided BVR missile in RSAF, I think the issue is more political than technological. Politically, it would not be good to "introduce" this class of weapons in the region. As you know Mindef's policy of not wanting to be the first to introduce new weapons in SE Asia. If Thailand has it first, then its ok for S'pore to have it.  RSAF probably has already integrated Derby into the Tigers and Vipers. It is more of a case that they are not showing them to the public and we would probably missed it when we see one. Derby looks to much like a Sidewinder. If a Viper or a Tiger is carrying them together with other winders, most of us would probably missed it.<br><br>As for the AMRAAM issue, once again, the US weapon export laws prohibits S'pore to have AMRAAMs in Singapore unless there is an obvious clear and present danger. You can bet that all the returning Vipers from the States would then be armed with Amraams and give the potential aggressor some fright.<br><br>Back to the Typhoon and Rafale integration of Amraams, I believe they are simply minor software changes. The launchers are already compatible as the NATO weapons would have standardised the launcher/Missiles hardware interface. As for the software interface, it is a manner of simply sending relevant target data to the correct interface that Amraam would accept. I am quite certain that NATO has also standardised the software interface portion. So any NATO compliant weapons should be able to adapt to any NATO compliant launcher and software interfaces. Amraam is built to be NATO compliant.<br><br>As for you suggestion of why not building a BVR ourselves, it is easier said than done. US took so long to get Amraams correct. There was a lot of technical issues with Active radar BVR missiles. That include time to target, radar seach area, pattern of search, etc. All these encompass quite a few technologies Singapore or the Defence Science Organsation has acquired.<br><br>Israelis have the know how of building missiles for a while. They are also very good at reverse engineering.  If Singapore is to become a missile builder/designer, then DSO has to buy the technology know-how from countries that are willing to sell, eg. South Africa, Israel or Taiwan.<br><br></div>

However I have seen circumstancial evidence that seems to indicate that RSAF has at least the former. As for the latter yes it is a high possbility that we might have the Derby as well. Building our own BVRAAMs would be possible, but as YouFather and Shotgun has said, we do need quite a bit of technical support and technology transfer to do so. For all you know, we might already have both P4 and Derby, but as we have said, to avoid offending you-know-who, we have kept it quiet.<br><br>JB: The C-130 SIGINT seen by RAAF personnel?

We can never be so sure about the spying bit... but RSAF does have a SIGINT C130 that's for sure. Reported in Janes and other defence journals.<br><br>Missiles: I also read from a couple of defence journals, the latest being the Asia Pacific Defence Journals that Python 4 is already in service with the Vipers.  It was an article about RSAF. Perhaps I should go buy the magazine later and quote it here in the forum  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">.  However, I always reserve some doubt with articles like these as to their accuracies and sources.  I do believe that RSAF indeed have Python 4 already. Only thing is that it is going to be hard to prove unless Mindef decides to declassify such information. With SAF purchase of Spike/Gill ATGMs and other Israeli stuffs, I see no reason for RSAF not to get Python 4. As for Derby, it is, as Viper has said, harder to prove, but reports from Janes have indicated that Rafael did sell Derby to a far east customer (and I believe was a reference to integrating with F5s. Brazilian AF is doing the same F5 upgrade and have Derby as their BVR missiles). As you know ST is involved in the Brazilian F5 upgrade with IAI.  One interesting thing though, from the same Asia Pacific Defence journal, the article also pointed that RSAF is wired for AMRAAMs. Hmmm....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>As to stir up more dicussion, what if RSAF opt for Rafales and purchase Micas for them? Then they would have at least 2 different BVRs missiles, and possibly 3 (Derby). Anyway, it is no uncommon for RSAF to have different types of missiles of the same class, say for WVR ones for examples, they use up to 3 different variants of AIM-9, with the -P4, S, and J version. Now, they have the Python 4. I read that the J version has been decommission. Perhaps DSO should reverse engineer all the ex -J version see if they can learn technical know how, ie. IR seeker and rocket technologies...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> just a thought !!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Reverse engineer the J version? Hmmm, not really worth the while, IMHO. The technology is dated, and our (limited) resources can be channeled for other bigger-payoff projects.<br>Also, how much is a 1 yr subscription of the ADJ? Right now, my info mainly comes from AWS&amp;T. Would be great if Joe would get the ADJ :-)<br>1 thing I'd like to know. What is the SAM inventory of the Malaysians? AFAIK, they have the Starburst, and I think the Crotales. Anybody know if they got any others?<br>The Starburst is an interesting SAM,IMO. I've always wondered why they made its warhead consist of 3 KE darts. Why not make the warhead a conventional blast-fragmentation type instead?</div>

Approximately 120 representatives of the U.S. and French navies, the Egyptian, Singaporean and Taiwanese air forces and the Japan Air Self-Defense Force participated in the four-day conference, which ended March 7. The conference took place in San Diego, Calif., and included briefings on all aspects of Hawkeye operations and support, including new capabilities being planned.<br><br>"The E-2C Hawkeye will be serving our nations for a long, long time," said Capt. Lee Lilly, the U.S. Navy's Hawkeye program manager. "The U.S. Navy has a detailed roadmap for Hawkeye system development through the new Radar Modernization Program. We didn't have a forum to communicate that roadmap to our partners until now. From my viewpoint we accomplished our mission and more this week."<br><br>"The Hawkeye is a powerful network-centric warfare system with a user community that spans the globe. It was only logical that we integrate the community of program managers, manufacturers, operators and maintainers into a living, breathing network," said John E. Michaelsen, Airborne Early Warning Integrated Product Team vice president for Northrop Grumman Integrated Systems. "This first gathering focused years of experience and the range of working environments. We learned much from each other."<br><br>In addition to representatives from user nations, members of the Hawkeye Industry Team also participated. The team includes Lockheed Martin Naval Electronics &amp; Surveillance Systems, Syracuse, N.Y.; Northrop Grumman Electronic Systems, Baltimore, Md.; Raytheon Company, El Segundo, Calif.; BAE Systems, (formerly Hazeltine), Greenlawn, N.Y.; and L-3 Communications Randtron Antenna Systems, Menlo Park, Calif.<br><br></div>
