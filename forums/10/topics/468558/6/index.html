              <p>In my humble opinion, I think you may have possibly omitted the
              import of rice which is Asian and Singapore main staple grain. "
              The ownership of the rice belongs to the individual stockpile
              participant, although the government has the right to acquire the
              rice (with compensation) during an emergency." I hope that at least
              alleviate your concern over the quantity and price of that
              commodity.</p>

              <p><span><span style="font-size: small;">As for the
              Newater, I googled and found out that the "main tactic of the
              water trade is to simply push water through tiny holes—the smaller
              the holes, the fewer the undesirable molecules that can sneak
              through. The art is to do so without sending the electricity bill
              skyrocketing or clogging up the tiny holes with
              grime."</span></span></p>
              <p><span><span style="font-size: small;">I am sorry that I

              has now openly suggested that they may want to employ foreigners as
              Police Officers, which they could do so, by granting them PRs and
              SG citizenships, if Singaporeans are against the idea.<br> <br> So why is this a concern?<br> <br> Because it would greatly undermine Singapore's ability to respond
              to security issues.<br> <br> 1) Total Defence<br> <br> In the event of a crisis, could Total Defence really work? When
              foreigners weren't really aware of what is the event and the
              importance of it, and with majority of the workers in our economy
              being foreign nationals. Could our economy continue to operate as
              intended during a war or crisis?</p>
              <p><br> 2) Cisco.<br> <br> There has been report of Cisco officers corruption like asking a
              maid for payment so as to avoid being fine for drinking water at
              MRT stations and Cisco officers who misappropraite ATM
              monies.<br> <br> As cisco beacme more dependent on the manpower from the North, the
              quality of the men would be greatly undermine due to "desperation"
              of needed manpower.<br> <br> and in the event of a Crisis and Cisco is needed to put up with a
              shortage of manpower. Would the officers "<span style="color: #545454; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: small; line-height: 18.200000762939453px;">è¶�ç�«æ‰“åŠ«. </span><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #545454; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: small; line-height: 18.200000762939453px;">Chen

              Loot a burning house"?<br> <br> 3) SAF is increasingly filling up vocations with foreign born,
              through out the SAF. and at any point of time if these foreign born
              nationals either flee Singapore or refuse to fight. Would it create
              a "gap" in our fighting formations or supply columns, and would
              this compromise our ability to fight?<br> <br> Just my 2c.<br> <br> Bythway, why is the thread being spam by irrelevant post?

              <p>Valid concerns but:</p>
              <p>1. Most of foreigners coming to SG just wants more money than their home country.</p>
              <p>2. There is no oil or anything of value for making Singapore attractive.</p>
              <p>3. Problems you mentioned are in all countries,nothing special about Singapore.</p>
