It is extremely mild in comparison. Minimum Wage is to be used in conjunction with other measures (increase in foreign worker levies, productivity growth, cutting overhead costs, etc.) and not a stand-alone. These slew of measures will raise real GDP and real income growth and hence the living standards of Singaporeans.<br><br>Proposing the complete removal of levies and relying on dependency ratios is like dropping an economic bombshell equivalent to an economic coup. <br><br>No Singaporean worker will support it. Even the factory worker knows he will be severely disadvantaged immediately and a few may even get fired. It will lead to discrimination of the Singaporean worker in the medium to long term, especially if his work is disrupted by NS. <br><br>Very few university professors, trade unionists, human resource practitioners, forum letter-writers will support it. I am very sure even employers may join in to condemn it. <br><br>Pricing mechanisms are flexible. It can be adjusted quickly to market conditions. Using brute force like manipulating dependency ratios is inflexible and may lead to the collapse of companies.</p></div>

              <p>There are certainly no minimum wages for the average Singaporean workers, even if there are some form of structured wages for those in between the very top wage levels and those at the bottom.</p>
              <p>However, surely there must be a mistake in the report - as there is a minimum guaranteed wage levels for the PAP Ministers - who justify their entitlement to such minimum wages so as to keep themselve from falling into corruption.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>It is time that labour movement look into this minimum wages for ordinary worker in Singapore.   We are now in the 21st century, surely our leaders know that rising cost of living does not commensurate with rising wages, how can workers live in Singapore comfortably.   Every time when this subject was advocated, our leaders would give alot of reasons for not introducing legislation on minimum wages.  Some employers are taking advantage of workers due to the absence of minimum wages legislation.</div>

              <p>yalor, labour got move meh??? NTUC is just another subsidary of PAP, have or dun have, dun make much different.</p>
              <p>A former union member who work in my pub told me,  as a member, he thot his job is more secure, damn, he gets retrenched faster than a non member...and for the last 10 years he had been giving hundreds over dollars per year as member fees. He feels cheated. While i told him, you join Angel's Pub, u also can join Union, because in Singapore, got union or no union also same same...Union are both pro business and pro labour, just that labourers have to pay fees to them and business people dun need. So good for us as business people. The biggest joke in the world</p>

              <p>Lets say if Singapore set the minimum wage, how to prevent enterprises from passing the higher operating cost to the customers?</p>
              <p>The hawkers centre cleaners minimum wage is $10 per hour, the contractor will have to charge  a higher fee to the stall holders, the stall holders, would have to increase their prices.</p>
              <p>Minimum pay don't guarantee you will get more pay, only the low end task is better paid, the mid range and above would be out of the minimum pay rule thus not get any benefit, but must pay more as prices increase across the board, because delivery boys, packers, sales assistant, fast food riders all get paid more.

              <p><br>Is there any relevance in the Taiwanese 'hum' interpretation of a 'minimum wage' for Singaporeans as a 'rigid wage system' ?</p>
              <p>The insistence of a Taiwanese 'hum' for flexibility in anything is quite obvious.</p>
              <p>How else can the 'hum' hope to get anywhere if anything is rigid for its existence ?</p>
              <p>Is it any surprise that the flexibility of the Taiwanese 'hum' allow itself to get out of Taiwan, flex its moral values if any exist - to forge some false talent certificates to gain entry into Singapore, and indulge in the sex trade ?</p>
              <p>The ultimate flexibility displayed by the Taiwanese 'hum' is to flex its <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.butler.org/healthGate/images/si55550966.jpg"><strong>‘Labia Majora’</strong></a>  and  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.labiaplastycenters.com/before_and_after_photos.htm"><strong>‘Labia Minora’</strong> </a>in rapturous idiocy simply to attract attention to itself as an 'Attention Seeking Whore'.</p>

              <p><br>if that is classic, art festival can close shop liao...</p>
              <p>Anyway, being a country with no natural resources and also no village to go back to, we must make ourselve flexible, nimble and adaptable, by setting a mini wage will not help in any sense when economy is down, with a flexible wage system that align itself to market demand, and together with a Multiple Variable components, MVC instill into our wage system, EDB managed to attract more investors into singapore, which in turn create more jobs for us. A flexible wage system had served us well since 1970s when NWC was introduced. And to be fair, our citizens incomes can match any SEA countries and still come out as nos 1. And those SEA countries with mini wage are facing jobless and alway on protest and strike that certainly divert investors to invest in their countries.</p>
