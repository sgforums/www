            <div class='col-md body'>In Took's case, <strong>there was a panel of high court judges </strong>in the highest court of the land, (previously known as the Supreme Court). It was this court that confirmed the death sentence given by the High Court Judge. As with all highest court of appeal, there is an odd number of judges in the panel so that there will always be a majority decision. In this case, there was a 2-1 decision in favour of Took's guilt and the death penalty.<br><br>The learned judge who took a different view from his brethen judges questioned the mechanism of death in the victim, but the balance of the evidence so overwhelmingly pointed to Took as the perpetrator that really it matters little to the other judges. to me and to many Singaporeans.<br><br>McCrae wants to appeal against his sentence. The CJ cannot increase his jail sentence further but he can certainly add another 10 strokes of the cane to each charge of cuplable homicide in addition.<br><br>We cannot have scumbags running off to Australia to escape the death penalty after killing someone in Singapore.</div>
