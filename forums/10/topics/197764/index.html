            <div class='col-md body'>Briton McCrae pleads guilty to culpable homicide /video<br>By Rita Zahara, Channel NewsAsia<br><br>SINGAPORE : Briton Michael McCrae has been convicted of killing two people at Pinewood Gardens in Balmoral Park four years ago.<br><br>He pleaded guilty to killing his driver, 46-year-old Kho Nai Guan, and the driver's girlfriend, 29-year-old Chinese national Lan Ya Ming, in his apartment in January 2002.<br><br>The court proceeded on two counts of culpable homicide not amounting to murder, and one of disposing of evidence.<br><br>A fourth charge, also on disposing of evidence, was taken into consideration.<br><br>Court proceedings took off with a bump.<br><br>Although 48-year-old Michael McCrae pleaded guilty to the three charges, he objected to two lines in the statement of facts read out to him: that he stamped on Lan Ya Ming's head while she was lying on the bed, and that he told a third party he had to "silence" Lan, as she had witnessed the incident.<br><br>Justice Choo Han Teck said he could not proceed with the plea of guilt, neither could he ask the prosecution to delete those lines or request McCrae to admit to the statement of facts.<br><br>After consulting his defence lawyer, McCrae changed his mind and admitted to the statement of facts in its totality.<br><br>McCrae seems to have lost a lot of weight; according to his lawyer, he is suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder.<br><br>McCrae was also hospitalised over the weekend for a hip injury because of a fall due to the strong dosage of medication that he had been taking.<br><br>McCrae's lawyer Kelvin Lim said, "He was discharged this morning and I think he is going back again for observation. He's fine; he looks okay but he feels weak and dizzy."<br><br>The bodies of the victims were found in a car on the seventh floor of the Orchard Towers parking lot six days after they were killed.<br><br>Autopsy reports showed that Kho had died of strangulation, while Lan was smothered to death.<br><br>McCrae and Kho got into a fight after Kho passed a harsh remark at McCrae's girlfriend.<br><br>During the fight, McCrae, putting his right arm around Kho's neck and, holding him in an arm-lock from behind, punched his face till he became motionless.<br><br>Audrey Ong, McCrae's former secretary and girlfriend, was convicted in February 2003 of helping to dispose of the bodies and is serving a 12-year jail term.<br><br>The case has been adjourned to Thursday, when Justice Choo is expected to pass sentence.<br><br>McCrae faces a maximum punishment of 10 years in jail for the culpable homicide charges, and a maximum of seven years for getting rid of evidence related to the murders. - CNA /ct</div>

Theres absolutely no problem with the Australian government had we proceeded with the manslaughter charge because he would skip the hangman's noose anyway. But for some reason he got the charges downgraded even further to culpable homicide which meant he gets a slap on the wrist (considering he took 2 lives). Why??<br><br>Its obvious with the slate of recent cases that our "independent" courts are very lenient with politically sensitive cases involving foreigners (the Filipino body parts maid and now McCrea).<br><br>So much for being tough on crime.

The scum was initally charged with manslaughter which carries life imprisonment. Theres absolutely no problem with the Australian government had we proceeded with the manslaughter charge because he would skip the hangman's noose anyway. But for some reason he got the charges downgraded even further to culpable homicide which meant he gets a slap on the wrist (considering he took 2 lives). Why??<br><br>Its obvious with the slate of recent cases that our "independent" courts are very lenient with politically sensitive cases involving foreigners (the Filipino body parts maid and now McCrea).<br><br>So much for being tough on crime. Chickenshit courts.</div></blockquote>You got your facts wrong. When we talk of manslaughter in Singapore, we mean a charge under Section 304 of the Penal Code that puts a maximum sentence of 10 years for culpable homicide not amounting to murder.<br><br>As for your charge of manslaughter that carries life imprisonment...do educate me and pray tell me which section of the Penal Code that comes from?</div>
