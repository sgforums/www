According to the Standard &amp; Poor’s Ratings Services, an international rating agency, India ranks second among the fastest growing economy in the world. Indian economy is growing with an average growth rate of above eight percent over the past three years.<br><br>The S&amp;P report says that despite of booming oil prices all over the world as well as in India too, the Indian economy will remain floating. For the current financial year 2007, Indian economic growth is projected to be remaining at 7.3 per cent. <strong>This shows that the threat of high oil prices are not able to weaken the growth momentum in India.</strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Retail Sector in India<br><br>India is considered to be one of the ten largest retail markets in the world. The retail sector in India is highly fragmented with 97% of the industry being part of the unorganized sector and consisting mainly of traditional family run shops. According to the Investment Commission of India, the retail sector in 2004 was estimated at $206 bn and accounted for over 30% of the country's GDP. The organized sector (3%) has been growing at the rate of about 20% per annum over the last 5 years and in 2004 accounted for about $6.4 bn. Currently food and drugs category accounts for 69% of the retail market and apparel and accessories accounts for 14% of the market. The entire retail sector consists of around 12 mn retail outlets compared to about 16 mn outlets in the US. It employs about 7% of the workforce second only to agriculture. Some of the major Indian players today are Pantaloon Retail, RPG Retail with their chain stores Foodworld, Shopper's Stop, Lifestyle International, Bombay Bazaar, and Crossword. The entry of Reliance into the retail arena has brought an aura of prominence to the sector within the Indian economy.<br>Foreign Investment in Retail Sector<br><br>The Indian government allows up to 100% foreign direct investment (FDI) in the Cash and Carry Wholesale formats but only up to 51% in the retail trade of single brand products. Hence foreign companies have 3 ways to enter the Indian market. Setting up of franchises is the most popular and the easiest way. Fast food retailers like Pizza Hut and Subway are in India in the franchisee format. Wholesale trading is the second format that foreign entrants are adopting. Metro AG of Germany has entered through this route. Establishing strategic licensing agreements with local retailers is the third route through which many apparel companies are setting shop in India.<br><br>Growth of Consumerism<br><br>With increase in urbanization and the higher levels of income due to the new areas of employment in the IT / ITES and BPO sectors, the Indian consumer has higher disposable income. Apart from the growing middle class and the upper middle class segments of population, there is a new growing class in the Indian population. It is the group of high networth individuals or the HNIs as they are popularly known. There is certainly a shift in consumer buying behavior and the entire concept of shopping seems to have changed. Consumers are now more trend conscious and their shift in attitude towards designs and quality rather than price has seen the apparel and accessories category booming. Indians have per se grown richer and this can be clearly seen in their spending habits on luxury items. The 'mall mania' has certainly seen some new formats of retail sales across the country.<br>Opportunity India<br><br>According to the Investment Commission of India, the retail sector is expected to grow almost three times its current levels to $660 bn by 2015. It is expected that India will be among the top 5 retail markets then. The organized sector is expected to grow to $100 bn and account for 12-15% of retail sales by 2015. It is estimated that the home improvements and consumer durables category and the apparel and eating out categories will grow at CAGR of 20% and 13% respectively over the next decade. According to Subha Kalathur, analyst at Valuenotes, there is certainly a lucrative opportunity for foreign players to enter the Indian terrain. Growth rates of the industry both in the past and those expected for the next decade coupled with the changing consumer trends such as increased use of credit cards, brand consciousness, and the growth of population under the age of 35 are factors that encourage a foreign player to establish outlets in India. The government policies towards FDI are the only hindering factors that do not make this a fairy tale for foreign players. But many of them have sought other ways to set shop in India. While many like Wal-Mart, JCPenney, and GAP have been procuring from India for a long time, those in the food business and apparel industry have also tried to work their way around by setting up franchises and license agreements with local players respectively. For retailers like Wal-Mart setting up a wholesale outlet like Sam's Club is certainly the way out.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>mani plans India entry with four stores in 2007<br><br>TIMES NEWS NETWORK[ FRIDAY, APRIL 21, 2006 01:24:52 AM]<br><br>MUMBAI: Finally, there is a timeline for one of the world’s greatest luxury brands to enter India. Giorgio Armani will set up shop in India latest by mid 2007, with four stores in two cities, Mumbai and Delhi.<br><br>The two brands will be Giorgio Armani and Emporio Armani.Commercial director, Emporio Armani, Francesco Tombolini confirmed to ET that the world-famous brand will enter India.<br><br>Whether the 1.5 billion euro privately-held company will enter the country directly, or with a partner, or decide on the franchisee route is still not decided. “Mr Armani is certain about wanting a presence in India and it is a market, we have been exploring for a long time and we are looking at arriving at the route of entry within a year,” said Tombolini.<br><br>The ideal partner, says Tombolini, will be one who respects Armani, understands that it is lifestyle and will not use the name just to leverage his business.<br><br>The over billion euro fashion house, is convinced that it is not too late and neither is it worried about competition. Tombolini says there is space for all. The market is new. Even though close to 33% of its turnover comes from Europe, Asia and specially China has been growing fast. In fact, the 40 stores of the 300 odd stores worldwide, which are in China contribute 10% to the group’s turnover. Even as the worldwide accessories market grows, as much as 52% of the group’s turnover comes from apparel and the flagship brand Giorgio Armani draws the larger chunk of consumers at 33%.<br><br>Is Tombolini looking to manufacture or outsource to India? In keeping with their new business plans, Tombolini says they would always work with a ‘Made for Armani’ rather than a ‘Made in India’ partnership and the area that Tombolini is looking at is in the leather beaded business working exclusively for Armani. “We would choose someone to work with because of his craftsmanship and not because it is cheaper to make the product here,” said Tombolini.<br><br>As far as pricelines go, he says they would like to keep it on par with Dubai if not Italy (which is 10% cheaper). Are there customers for the price tags which their labels come with? “We don’t see India as a cash cow,” ended Tombolini.<br><br><a href="http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/articleshow/1498456.cms" rel="nofollow">http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/articleshow/1498456.cms</a></div>
