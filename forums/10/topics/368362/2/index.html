              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>I tend to agree and disagree to some of your points. Note that I am more skewed to anti-PAP, but not anti-govt. Need to differentiate.</p>
              <p>1st point to disagree, is that all countries have their own problems. Therefore, by highlighting discrimination in Australia, terrorism in USA, does not cover up the problems we have in Singapore. Singapore has a different type of discrimination.</p>
              <p>It's called discrimination against its own people. If you have headhunter friends, you would have heard that there is a tendency for companies to prefer foreigners on the higher level, than for locals. In fact, if you are a foreigner coming here to look for a manager job, chances are, you have a better success rate than the local manager. Not that the local manager sucks, its just that its a discrimination that is existing in the recruitment world in Singapore.</p>
              <p>2nd point that I agree, is that one should not leave just because here, one cannot survive. It's a bit of a pessimist type of personality, which I also do not encourage in fellow Singaporeans. A person should only leave a place once he or she has considered many factors carefully, and decide that, that is what he or she wants. Each country has its pros and cons. Singapore included.</p>
              <p>I have been in a global position since the start of my career, and I sincerely feel that Singaporeans are more capable of doing better than many other nationalities. We are better able to take stress, work faster, and deliver results better. Therefore, I hope that the locals reading this thread, have more optimism about our own capabilities. Once you start facing off foreigners, you will probably find that they are overrated.</p>
              <p>One interesting point to note is, I have been in a management position in a global operation, and its interesting to find out that I am the youngest manager in the division reporting to the global director. All the rest of the managers are foreigners, and they are at least a decade older than me. Come to think of it, perhaps its because of the rat race in Singapore, that we are attaining career progression faster than our peers in other countries. Perhaps, people in other countries have learnt how to slow down and enjoy life, whereas we are forever pursuing career success as the single criteria of success in life.</p>

              <p>The employment of Foreign talents belong to one organisation preferences, nothing to be discriminating about. That is industrial headhunter, not a social issue. Beside, in Singapore, you need to recruit 3 singaporeans before you can get a foreigner, that is the basic for normal industries.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So much so is our young talents efficiency and effectiveness, one by one, these foreign talents are chopped off. As a sole properitorship myself, i do employ foreign gals to make it more colorful and more choice for others to engage. I got a fren of mine working somewhere in wulu Jurong told me that at first, his German firm jump into the wagon of globalisation and employed many german and europe engineers and executives, they provide them cars, condos and even maids. He said that in their homeland, there are just mere laymen struggling to find a job in Europe society, but here is like heaven to them. They bringing in their gf, wifey, family and enjoy most of the things here using company's account. Well, the tide had changed since this downturn, nearly all are ask to go back and replaced by locals and malaysians with diplomas and degrees. All these without condo, car, maid and even transport money, just allowances. All those FTs were at first reluctant to leave, as the cost of leaving is tremendous. But somehow, they have to go, and the profit for his company started to breakeven during the last quarter.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My point here is that FTs here are for a showtime only, but not all of them, some are really good. Slowly, bosses will start to realize their mistakes and replace them with local talents that will not only save costs but increase productivity.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>On the other hands, i beg all local talents to join hands, be it you are a manager or senior, employ locals, and for locals working below, cooperate with local heads and bosses, it is a way of removing FTs, this is not something like a discrimination, it is something that we are after, the creator of this place, why should we then put it on a silver plater and serve to the Foreigners. Perhaps we are still looking at white skin people as higher grade, handsome, gracious, big big, but to me, they are nothing.</p>

              <p>Can the local talents work against the insistence of the PAP Government to prevent foreign talent from entering Singapore ?</p>
              <p>There are 3.5 million Singaporean Citizens, and 1 million foreigners visiting and being Permanent Residents in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Still the PAP Government cannot even find any individual to replace The Jinx and had to bring in Mr Goodyear - who is not even residing in Singapore, and will hardly know the work culture in Singapore.</p>
              <p>At the end, the whole exercise was a farce at the expense of Mr Goodyear, as there was never any intention to replace The Jinx, and now that the Board has admitted their inability to work with Mr Goodyear, they have all the reasons to retain the services of The Jinx to continue at the helm of a sinking Titanic.</p>

              <p><br>Well, look at it this way: if you go overseas, spend a few years and are happy to return, there's no problem. You cherish the time spent there and now you are back home in familiar territory, among friends and family. All's fine.</p>
              <p>But if you don't want to come back simply because life's better over there, and you miss friends and folks, then you are forever caught between two worlds. Should I return, should I revoke my citizenship, should I uproot myself completely? That's the downside I was referring to.</p>
              <p>If you are doing well elsewhere, it reflects well on Singapore, doesn't it? A Singaporean success story is something of pride for Singapore. That's what I meant.</p>
              <p>Actually, if the govt actually encouraged a diaspora it can reap a lot of benefits but they are afraid to do so because of the fear of not being able to control those who leave.</p>
