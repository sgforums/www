              <p>it somehow struck my mind...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>our government apply policy that makes the country a good "environment" for foreign investor to invest and located at</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>- accessibility</p>
              <p>- stable government</p>
              <p>- FTZ</p>
              <p>- competitive cost of operation</p>
              <p>- no minimum wages law</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and many more...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>all these measures ensure our countries to grow and GDP to be one of the best among asia</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But at the expenses of the people well being.. living in singapore is certainly not easy, year by year the GDP raises so is the citizen stress level.. so at some point of the time maybe from 10 years back people started to leave the country(those with means)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and I realise those whom are really angry with the government are more likely to be the slightly below average and the poor families because they got hit the hardest from all these policy that makes them feel isolated...(ask a hawker or taxi driver and you realise most of them day in and out working hard just to survive) feeding the family alone had take up most of all of their energy in life.. the they will have no extra time nor money to do anything for themselve or for their life..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>so now facing with shortage of talent problem they started to woo foreigner to become PR and part of our country because if singapore stop being productive the whole system will fall... so now everyone gotta lower their expectation(competion with foreign talent) once again to push the GDP upwards</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I can tell those PR/work permit holder is supportive of the government (I always heard praises from them to the government anyway) If they have voting right I think PAP will get a landslide victory every election..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So generally we think its will be cool if we change the policy by handing over the leadership to another party?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>- if they change the existing policies to raise to citizen well being will they comprehen the GDP and the regional standing of our country with increasing competition from rising power like india and china?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>- if investor started to leave will our people continue to have what we having now? (at least most of us can survive and have a roof over our head right?)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So whats the solution? leave the country? how about the less educated and lower income families? its their fate to perish either way? its fated for us to choose between being able to survive but live like a slave under stress or crumble down all together to face an uncertain future?</p>

              <p>it somehow struck my mind...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>our government apply policy that makes the country a good "environment" for foreign investor to invest and located at</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>- accessibility</p>
              <p>- stable government</p>
              <p>- FTZ</p>
              <p>- competitive cost of operation</p>
              <p>- no minimum wages law</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and many more...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>all these measures ensure our countries to grow and GDP to be one of the best among asia</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But at the expenses of the people well being.. living in singapore is certainly not easy, year by year the GDP raises so is the citizen stress level.. so at some point of the time maybe from 10 years back people started to leave the country(those with means)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and I realise those whom are really angry with the government are more likely to be the slightly below average and the poor families because they got hit the hardest from all these policy that makes them feel isolated...(ask a hawker or taxi driver and you realise most of them day in and out working hard just to survive) feeding the family alone had take up most of all of their energy in life.. the they will have no extra time nor money to do anything for themselve or for their life..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>so now facing with shortage of talent problem they started to woo foreigner to become PR and part of our country because if singapore stop being productive the whole system will fall... so now everyone gotta lower their expectation(competion with foreign talent) once again to push the GDP upwards</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I can tell those PR/work permit holder is supportive of the government (I always heard praises from them to the government anyway) If they have voting right I think PAP will get a landslide victory every election..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So generally we think its will be cool if we change the policy by handing over the leadership to another party?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>- if they change the existing policies to raise to citizen well being will they comprehen the GDP and the regional standing of our country with increasing competition from rising power like india and china?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>- if investor started to leave will our people continue to have what we having now? (at least most of us can survive and have a roof over our head right?)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So whats the solution? leave the country? how about the less educated and lower income families? its their fate to perish either way? its fated for us to choose between being able to survive but live like a slave under stress or crumble down all together to face an uncertain future?</p>

              <p><br>no lah, I am with Gary lah. Actually hor, we look at thing in a more different perspectives than you opposition supporters do, we look from the marco level, whereas you people only look at the micro level. We see a stable, harmony and peace society here, of course there is some hicup here and there, as nothing is perfect in this world. With such view, we tends to want such condition to progress  on where we can get a good bf, marry, borne childrens and built a happy family here.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Tho i am a still young, but i travelled most of part of the world with my Dad, and while he is entertaining his business peoples and mistresses, I go around to see the culture and the poor condition of other countries, from there, i really admire and envy my own country i called Singapore. But I am not very welcome there, the gals love singapore man more then woman. Therefore as a Singapore man like you are, you should be honored, u ask any 3rd world countries gals around our region, which country men is the best partners,,,they will tell you Singapore Man. This is something not out of a magic, it is something learned and earned.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Finally, as i said earlier, we view and look at the situation of this society to be good, and inorder to stay good with more goodness, we have to put our hands to the ruling party as a whole, not just a person.</p>

              <p><br> The only person who is really 'stuck' is unfortunately YOU.</p>
              <p>NOT in the country, but in the deep recesses of your mind.</p>
              <p>Do you seriously think leaving the country will solve your
              problem? Will you be able to survive there, socially &amp;
              economically? Do you seriously think australia with its racists
              problems, US with its terrorism and ISA type laws on top of crimes,
              Europe with its extreme racist culture, etc...etc..come to think of
              it....discrimination is common overseas, is it not?</p>
              <p>Why does a person have to work hard? The fundamental truth is
              that it is the only way to survive. Smartness can only help so
              much. Have you seen any geniuses not needing to work hard? Bosses
              entertain lavishly, play golf, live in landed property - such
              rewards comes from working both hard and smart.</p>
              <p>Some may claim to be born rich, but if he/she dont work hard to
              maintain the money, it too can be gone and reduced to penury.</p>
              <p>For goodness sake, PLEASE WAKE UP!! Nothing comes easy, more so
              in these times. Everyone needs to work even harder BUT remember
              always, we are not machines, and everyone MUST have and take their
              breaks - weekends, offs, leaves, etc. Making money is NOT
              EVERYTHING!</p>
              <p>It is those times that life can be cherished and treasured,
              during those breaks where we all unwind, make friends and enjoy
              ourselves. Some human beings do not even get that chance overseas
              in their struggle to make ends meet, not because they do not have
              the ability to do so, but only lack the opportunity that you and me
              - singaporeans have.</p>
              <p>It's just so depressing to read your post, seeing your
              irrational fears and feelings of unnecessary doom when we all still
              have the brains, hands and legs to carve something out of this
              crisis and overcome it by working harder and smarter, instead of
              lying down and begging for sympathy......sigh..what can I do to
              make you see the light?</p>

              <p>I tend to agree and disagree to some of your points. Note that I am more skewed to anti-PAP, but not anti-govt. Need to differentiate.</p>
              <p>1st point to disagree, is that all countries have their own problems. Therefore, by highlighting discrimination in Australia, terrorism in USA, does not cover up the problems we have in Singapore. Singapore has a different type of discrimination.</p>
              <p>It's called discrimination against its own people. If you have headhunter friends, you would have heard that there is a tendency for companies to prefer foreigners on the higher level, than for locals. In fact, if you are a foreigner coming here to look for a manager job, chances are, you have a better success rate than the local manager. Not that the local manager sucks, its just that its a discrimination that is existing in the recruitment world in Singapore.</p>
              <p>2nd point that I agree, is that one should not leave just because here, one cannot survive. It's a bit of a pessimist type of personality, which I also do not encourage in fellow Singaporeans. A person should only leave a place once he or she has considered many factors carefully, and decide that, that is what he or she wants. Each country has its pros and cons. Singapore included.</p>
              <p>I have been in a global position since the start of my career, and I sincerely feel that Singaporeans are more capable of doing better than many other nationalities. We are better able to take stress, work faster, and deliver results better. Therefore, I hope that the locals reading this thread, have more optimism about our own capabilities. Once you start facing off foreigners, you will probably find that they are overrated.</p>
              <p>One interesting point to note is, I have been in a management position in a global operation, and its interesting to find out that I am the youngest manager in the division reporting to the global director. All the rest of the managers are foreigners, and they are at least a decade older than me. Come to think of it, perhaps its because of the rat race in Singapore, that we are attaining career progression faster than our peers in other countries. Perhaps, people in other countries have learnt how to slow down and enjoy life, whereas we are forever pursuing career success as the single criteria of success in life.</p>

              <p>If you can, go ahead and leave the country. Don't think of it as desertion or being unpatriotic; if you go overseas and shine, it means Singapore is shining. The best part is life outside the red dot can be a fabulous experience, but the downside is you might feel like never coming back.</p>
              <p>After all, Singapore has come a long way since the 60s, educating the people and encouraging them to go overseas (you get visa-free or visa-on-arrival access to 178 countries). It's time the govt, which is so busy wooing foreigners, actually encourages a Singapore diaspora that is talented and capable of reaching its potential anywhere in the world, insteading of calling them quitters.</p>
              <p>Why stay back and suffocate in an increasingly crowded city when you can get better quality of life and decent wages somewhere else?</p>
