              <p><span class="postbody"> What we know is whenever any business entity tries to acquire companies
              for expansions or activities it will adopt a certain kind of strategy
              such as a visionary plan to expand its business horizontally or
              vertically. </span></p>
              <p>At least like Oei Hong Leong do a thorough asset-strip valuation of ailing state companies in buying such companies in China or National Iron in Singapore. He has benefitted from such asset buys many times because he knows how to go for net tangible assets and introduce strategic plan to expand or reposition the business to nurse back such take-over for gains.<span class="postbody"><br> <br>We have heard of GIC buying Barclay shares worth billions at the
              early days of US sub-prime crisis. Without having conceived earlier of any plan to invest in such companies can we believe GIC ever has says any good plan like Oei or Warren Buffet in making such buy especially when it is done all
              because of the unexpected Sub-prime crisis.
              <br> <br>Before the crisis has GIC already conceptualized certain plans for
              taking over some such businesses like Barclay and what was its strategy
              for such acquisition or taking of stake in such banks?
              <br> <br>Now that GIC has seen Barclay's share prices diving further by the
              billions dropping to half (57% of original purchase price as reported
              last week) so its CEO, Dr. Tony Tan and MM Lee decided to buy another
              few billions to average the purchase price hoping the original purchase
              price will bounce back in 10 years' time.
              <br> <br>Does it make sense to throw monies just because GIC has the monies
              to do so? Let us see the GIC evaluation sheet to see what is its CEO
              talking about.
              <br> <br>If the CEO is not well informed let him consult Dr. Tony Tan and if
              Dr. Tan is not up to it, let him get further instruction from his
              Mentor MM Lee.
              <br> <br>Let us see much is the total values of Barclay at the first
              purchase which has now dropped more than 57% and do another evaluation
              based on further devaluation how much is the total net asset left plus
              goodwill.
              <br> <br>In the case of any acquisition, the balance sheet surely would show
              the total of net fixed and current assets comprising equity, stocks,
              equipment, properties, minus fixed and current liabilities.
              <br> <br> From the net assets left GIC could do a goodwill valuation of all its customer base and its personnel and expertise. 
              <br> <br>What if the large proportion of the customer base and expert
              personnel are likely to be lost or migrated and staff largely
              retrenched to cut losses, what will be the final net worth of Barclay.
              <br> <br>If assuming Barclay's net assets are hardly at 20% of original
              values is it worth to pay the Barclay share prices at close to between
              30-60% of original purchase price?
              <br> <br> On top of this share price evaluation let us see the GIC strategy in using Barclay to expand our banking business to the world?
              <br> <br>Has it the ability based on its overall resource to nurse Barclay
              back to former health or even expand horizontally or vertically.
              <br> <br>So if GIC does not have such a comprehensive strategic plan what is
              the point of buying more Barclay at another few billions of
              down-trodden shares.
              <br> <br>GIC might as well consult Warren Buffet how to park its monies in
              safer haven while earning higher returns from positive activities like
              strengthening the domestic export-substitution investments to put
              idling manpower and empty land and properties to good use.</span></p>

              <p>It is another expensive lesson learned. Strategy requires
              entrepreneurial abilities like turning our assets of educated
              workforce, good locations and transportations and storage into good use
              to support many regional activities.<br> <br> If GIC has the strategy it would definitely by now plow back some
              billions and the gains made in earlier investments to where the mouth
              is.<br> <br> At least many of our own citizens could be employed in such activities
              like import substitutions agricultural productions which will lessen
              our reliance on imports of essential goods and foods to save on foreign
              exchanges.<br> <br> Through our education hub we could also build up our educational
              resources into assets providing diverse skill trainings to create
              employment for our many younger idling manpower.<br> <br> We could turn our empty lands and factories into business activities to
              lessen our reliance on imported foods, agricultural products and simple
              terminals and storage facilities to benefit our logistics and
              transportations all of which we are still commanding a big advantage
              like the petrol-chemicals.<br> <br> Has GIC strategised such use of our surplus for our own domestic needs
              to create jobs for own citizens instead of throwing monies at the
              Russians or Bangladeshi, Indonesians or Thais causing so much
              unpleasant political fallouts with our neighbors.</p>

              <p>While Oei can strip assets of the manufacturing businesses that he take a majority stakes in, the Singapore owned Sovereign Wealth Funds have taken only minority share allocation with or without any seat on the Board of Directors, and abstain from involving themselves in the operation of their investments.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>According to the information available from the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.investorrelations.barclays.co.uk/INV/A/Content/Files/Share_Issue_Final_250608.pdf">latest Barclays Shares Prospectus to raise approx Stg 4.5 Billion  </a>- it seems that it is Temasek Inc that is a shareholder in Barclays and not GIC.</p>
              <p>There is also a new company known as China Development Bank said to be from Singapore that has participated with Temasek to buy into Barclays.</p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.temasekholdings.com.sg/media_centre_news_releases_230707.htm">In July 2007, Temasek Holdings had invested in Barclays PLC – paying Stg 975 million [or S$3 billion} in newly issued shares at a price of Stg7.20 per share – representing 2.1 percent of Barclays issued share capital.  </a></p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://business.scotsman.com/business/The-Qatari-that-got-the.4233767.jp">Since July 2007, Barclays shares have lost 59% of its value  </a></p>
              <p>Despite seeing its share values shrunk, Temasek does not seem to have lost its appetite for more Barclays shares.</p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://business.asiaone.com/Business/News/Story/A1Story20080617-71241.html">AsiaOne reported on 25 June 2008 that Barclays is close to raising Stg 4Billion [S$10.7 Billion] in a capital raising exercise, with existing investor Temasek Holdings likely to be offered more shares. With existing investors such as Singapore’s Temasek and China Development Bank, which are sitting on big paper losses, will be offered the chance to buy into Barclays at a lower price.  </a>{See reference Share Issue Prospectus in opening paragraph}</p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.businessweek.com/globalbiz/blog/europeinsight/archives/2008/06/just_two_days_a.html">On 27 June 2008, Barclays Share Issue faces analyst scrutiny, as the shine starts to wear off. It seems that despite the new capital raised by share issues, Barclays will continue to face pressures to further write down of 33% on its book – or roughly US$26.5 Billion – even as the bank declare itself in good financial shape.  </a></p>
              <p> It seems that the Sovereign Wealth Funds are being offered a carrot and got themselves a banana.</p>
              <p>The more money that is pumped into these troubled banks, the more they will write down their book values to take care of the bad credit from the sub-prime crisis.</p>
              <p>The more capital share issued will require the Sovereign Wealth Funds to either subscribe to more shares, or see their existing percentage holdings shrink despite the huge amounts invested originally.</p>
              <p>While MM LKY believe that Sovereign Wealth Funds are in it for the long haul, other more astute Fund Owners are having second thought and wondering if they have made the right decisions - unless MM LKY believe that his financial instincts are more keenly acute than the Qataris and the Chinese in Beijing.</p>
