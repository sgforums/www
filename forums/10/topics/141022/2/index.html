            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by DeadPoet:</div><div class="quote_body">To get this one-off payment of $50, your total household income must be less than $1,500 a month or $450 per household member. That mean if your total household income is $1,700 but you have 6 persons in your household, you are still eligible for the vouchers.<br><br>What I am unhappy about is firstly, instead of $50 per household, it should be based on the number of people in the household.  $50 for a family of six is way too little.  Secondly, some not that needy people are abusing this fund.  A friend of mine who is working in the CC told me that they have been receiving applications from residents living in condominiums, and even those living in landed property.<br><br>I asked him how could they accept these applications? I thought these vouchers are for the needy? Obviously these people do not need the $50 vouchers.  He told me these applicants are usually senior citizens who are no longer living with their children. They rely on their pensions, rents collected, allowances from their children, etc. And since these "income" are not taken into consideration, they are entitled to the vouchers.<br><br>Frankly, I am not convinced.  Yes, they may meet the requirements but do they really need it?<br></div></blockquote>it really depends on the individual.  there is nothing the system can do to fully stop such exploitations.  there are lots of well-to-do people taking advantage of the loopholes.<br></div>
