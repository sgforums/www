              <p>With the next general election looming ahead, the PAP regime has gone on a massive propaganda overdrive to “address” the concerns of Singaporeans and soothe frayed nerves to the extent of pulling a wool over their eyes in cahoots with the sycophantic media.</p>
              <p>Sovereign Wealth Fund GIC which came under fire for its massive losses incurred during the global financial crisis now proclaims that it has “recouped” most of its losses, according to a Straits Times article today with the most misleading title: “GIC recoups most financial crisis losses.” (read more <a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/PrimeNews/Story/STIStory_583758.html"><span style="color: #ab6f07;">here</span></a>)</p>
              <p>GIC had released a report yesterday showing that its 20-year nominal annual rate of return in US dollar terms jumped from 5.7 percent to 7.1 percent for the last 12 months which is hardly impressive considering the fact that the Dow Jones Industrial Average is now up 8.44 percent and the S&amp;P 500 index has increased by 9.5 percent in the month of September alone. (read more <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/39351208"><span style="color: #ab6f07;">here</span></a>)</p>
              <p>Furthermore, NO figures were released on the percentage it has recouped nor the actual amount of money made or lost.</p>
              <p>It doesn’t take an economist to realize that the so-called “rate of returns” make little sense as it is simply a rebound from earlier losses incurred during the global financial crisis as admitted by GIC chief investment officer Ng Kok Song himself:</p>
              <p><strong>“The recovery in our 20-year nominal average rate of return is not surprising, given the rebound in global equity markets in the last financial year.”</strong></p>
              <p>GIC was reported to have lost a shocking SGD 59 billion dollars in the last financial year, the bulk of its losses coming from the untimely purchase of shares in banking giants UBS and Citigroup.</p>
              <p>A Bloomberg report in March quoted an experienced fund manager at Siwsscanto Asset Management in Zurich as saying that GIC may like more than a decade to recoup its initial investment in UBS.</p>
              <p><strong>“The game turned out not as easy as it may have seemed. It will take probably more like a decade than three years for UBS shares to return to 2007 levels.”</strong></p>
              <p>GIC should reveal the exact figure of the amount it has “recouped” from its disastrous SGD 59 billion dollar loss instead of using fudgy figures to mislead Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>For example, even if it recouped 98 percent of its initial losses, it will still suffer a SGD 1 billion or $1,000,000,000 loss which can be used to help the poor and needy in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Despite being a fund owned by the Singapore government and charged with managing our national reserves, much of GIC”s accounts remain enshrouded under a veil of mystery which runs contrary to the PAP regime’s claims that it is a “transparent” government.</p>
              <p>The Chairman of GIC is PAP strongman Lee Kuan Yew, who is a lawyer by training. Singapore’s other sovereign wealth fund Temasek Holdings is headed by his daughter-in-law Ho Ching whose husband is the Prime Minister of Singapore.</p>
              <p>With no opposition in parliament to hold the ruling party accountable, Singaporeans will have little choice but to accept Finance Minister Tharman’s warped logic that the entire system is “based on trust”.</p>

              <p><span class="postbody">US govt exit could leave GIC as top Citi shareholder
              <br> <br> THE Government of Singapore Investment Corporation (GIC) could well turn
               out to be the largest shareholder in Citigroup after the United States 
              government said it will sell its remaining stake in the bank.
              <br> <br> The US Treasury owns about 2.4 billion Citi shares and will start to sell all of them, said a Bloomberg report yesterday.
              <br> <br> Its stake, based on Monday's closing share price of US$4.45, is worth up to US$10.7 billion (S$13.9 billion).
              <br> <br> Once the sale is completed, GIC may be left as the biggest stakeholder 
              in the third largest bank in the US, with an estimated 3.8 per cent, 
              based on data from Bloomberg. It is not clear how other key shareholders
               like Saudi Arabia's Prince Alwaleed bin Talal and Blackrock stack up.
              <br> <br> In September last year, GIC exchanged its US$6.88 billion worth of Citi 
              preferred shares that it bought in January 2008 for about 2.12 billion 
              common shares at about US$2.95 each.
              <br> <br> Subsequently, GIC sold about half of its holdings for a profit of US$1.6
               billion, leaving it with 1.12 billion shares, or a 4.9 per cent stake.
              <br> <br> Subsequent new share issues by Citi to boost its capital diluted GIC's stake to around 3.8 per cent.
              <br> <br> At US$4.45 apiece, GIC's stake would be worth about US$5 billion, giving
               an estimated unrealised profit of US$1.7 billion over the US$3.3 
              billion cost.
              <br> <br> The sale by the US Treasury will help Citi exit its US$45 billion 
              bailout, which the government provided in 2008 to keep the bank from 
              collapsing.
              <br> <br> 'We're seeing a form of governmental handcuffs being released,' Mr Bill 
              Bradway, founder of banking consultant Bradway Research, told Bloomberg.
              <br> <br> Citigroup shares have rallied 34 per cent this year, although they are 
              still 92 per cent below their December 2006 high of US$56.41.
              <br> <br> The bank may post a US$11.7 billion profit this year, according to the 
              average estimate of 16 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg, after two years 
              of losses totalling US$29 billion.
              <br> <br> GIC group chief investment officer Ng Kok Song said in September that 
              the firm is not in a hurry to sell its shares in Citi or Swiss banking 
              giant UBS, as GIC believes the worst is over for both banks.
