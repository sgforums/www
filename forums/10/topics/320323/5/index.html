              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">For one who claim to be smarter than Gazelle, you certainly know how to react in the same manner as Gazelle when you cannot get things in the manner that you wished.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The question speaks for itself in being more polite at ridiculing your efforts that the Singapore-China trade ''is worth $27 Billion" both ways - it seems that you cannot discern the polite effort at questioning your position.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">How did you brilliantly arrive at the magic figure of $27 Billion - was it in USD or SGD currencies, and from which year statistics was that number plucked from ? 1975 ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Have you tried 'googling' if you cannot even pluck the right numbers from the fragrance that constantly hover around you ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If you are capable - try digesting the following numbers from a report titled :</span></p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.uschina.org/statistics/tradetable.html">‘US-China Trade Statistics and China’s World Trade Statistics’  </a></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"> - and when you are done, shall we delve deeper into your ability at comprehending facts from your fantasy.</span> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"> I am giving the immense ability of a Gazelle-Hunter the room to display his hunting prowessness, and see if he will shoot the Deer or the Gazelle.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"> Of course you did not mentioned any niche areas - that was my view of how your silly performance, and that statement was not putting words in your mouth, it is your Gazelle ways of reading nonsense into your sheep brain while pretending to be a Gazelle, and now think you are a remarkable DeerHunter.</span></p>
              <p> <span style="color: #0000ff;">Of course life will go on, as the Humanoid is far resillient that any four-legged animals - as has been proven by the evolution of Mankind.</span></p>
              <p> <span style="color: #0000ff;">Will you gamble that there will not be a global meltdown - if no one takes any action - when the US economy spiral downwards out-of-control ?</span></p>
              <p> <span style="color: #0000ff;">Are you so certain of this when you cannot even discern the difference sarcasm and cynicism ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Gazelle, Gazelle , still playing to the attention of the larger audience, and hoping that they will rescue you from your untenable position.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Do I sound like I fear Gazelle ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Come on Gazelle, surely your head has not swelled to the size that you believe you can float naturally under your own steam ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The tone and quality of your responses has the hoof prints of the Gazelle, as much as you wish to distract others with the nick as a DeerHunter - is there any difference in the style and reasoning abilities between yourself and the Gazelle ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Only a fool will register and defend a Gazelle's position with so much enthusiasm - for one who knows next to nothing about the issues being discussed, and will plunge headlong into an ongoing debate in the style of the Gazelle.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">In any case, whether you are a Gazelle-Hunter or the Deer, we can always say good bye to old rubbish.</span> </p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Yes, that news was dated 21 April 2008 @ 5.40 GMT - 2 months old news. </span>
              </p><p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Why do you sound so 'Gazelle' logical when you make no attempts with any clues to do so ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Have you hit the nail on the head with your reasons for hoarding - that arises out of insecurity ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Can we accept your explanation to give a deeper insight into the causes of MM LKY's insecurity for hoarding the Annual Surplus into the GIC funds, and managing it in a tight fisted manner that even the Elected President is not privy to its total size ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If your observation is of any accuracy, then it confirms also the statements by another participant named ''robbertteh'' - that all the government expenditures on essential services are being recovered from Singaporeans' consumption and usage of such services, leading to a larger accumulated Government funds. This growth can only result from taking more money from the Citizens - and putting these out of circulation and into the Sovereign Wealth Funds managed by GIC and Temasek Holdings.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Can Singapore or Singaporeans be in a better position during a recession, when there is an influx of cheap labor to compete with the few jobs left for Singaporeans facing retrenchment during an economic storm ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If the influx of cheap foreign labor is to meet the demands of the labor intensive industries, and create more jobs for Singaporeans - why will this government insist on placing a huge foreign worker's levy for every one employed, and making it even more difficult for the labor intensive manufacturers to stay in Singapore ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Has it not been the plan of this Singapore Government to move out all the labor intensive industries to other lower labor cost centers, while we go up the value added chain in Bio-Science and Higher Technology ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Are you outdated with your information besides believing Minister Tharman to have used outdated news information ?</span></p>
              <span style="color: #0000ff;">
              <p> <span style="color: #0000ff;">The only Singaporeans that this Government has helped with the accrued interests and dividends are the Talented Elites in their close knit circle - by giving themselves and their own, the wage increases when every other Singaporean has been persuaded to tighten our belts and take a cut in wages and CPF savings.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The measly amounts that are given to each working person in each Singaporean household had dissipated the sum effect of such a large sum paid out.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The amounts given to each individual could not even last through one month of house hold expenses - and with more payment having to be topped up from our cash savings for the high charges of Government services.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Only a fool will give out all that he has saved, with none left for a rainiy day.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Only a politician will know how to dole out in small bits and pieces that make them relevant in holding the loyalties of those whom they see and treat as carpet beggars.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If the Elite and Talented Politicians have the clear altruistic interest of Singaporeans in their thoughts, they would have used the total sum - which they claimed to cost the Government a Billion SGD - paid out annually into a National Insurance Plan, with the Billion Dollar Gift as premium paid for all Singaporeans.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">This would have been the best policy that takes care of all the health care and hospitalisation needs of every Singaporean - from cradle to grave.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Surely by 'Public' - you are not hoping to refer to the Government sector ?</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">It has always been the Private Sector that has taken the lead to organise the funds contributed by Singaporeans to be distributed to the needy Singaporeans.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The hard pressed Singaporeans have constantly and consistently been hit from every directions demanding for the meagre monies they earned as daily wages, or monthly salary to be given to charities.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Yet the large largesse managed by the Great Mentor remains inaccessible to help those who have been identified as ''really down and out through MCD, CDCs, NGO, etc....'' - as this Government fear that it will be depended upon infinitely as a crutch by the poor.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Ironically, the Talented Elite - who are already successful individuals - will need a crutch in the form of Million Dollar wages to keep them from being corrupted.</span></p>
              <span style="color: #0000ff;">
              <p> <span style="color: #0000ff;">Quite a smart plagiarising efforts with a twist from the Police Force advertisement of 'Low Crime does not mean No Crime'.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Which School of Voodoo Economic did you graduate from ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">What economic philosophy are you driving with ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Can there be progress with a lower or regressive <a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP">‘ Gross Domestic Product ’  </a>?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Have you read the report that <a rel="nofollow" href="http://bigpicture.typepad.com/comments/2008/05/positive-gdp-re.html">“Recession Often Begin With Positive GDP Data” </a><span style="color: #0000ff;">- with high inflation in tandem ?</span> </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Is Singapore not in this unique situation during this month of June 2008 - with food and fuel prices spiraling the percentages upwards even as the GDP data is positive although comparatively weaker ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Should this not be the factor that caused Minister Tharman to sooth the nerves - as the writings are already on the Wall ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">For you to believe that ''inflation is up, but not to our eyeballs'' - you must either be deluded with your eyeballs at the height of a Gazelle, or that your DeerHunting results have been far better to cushion the high costs of living that is currently the bane of every Singaporean service provider and consumer.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Again, another useless comparison made by putting down our Asian neighbor, while our problems are far different from theirs.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Why will you not compare our living conditions with those of our Ministers' - who have liberally taken our monies to live their life of iron-bowl security, while calling for us to make sacrifices that they snatch away without a blink of an eyelid ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">No it is not all doom and gloom, as at least without the help of the Government - which has yet to reach many down and out Singaporeans, and which the help given to-date are meaningless - the Citizens of Singapore are more resourceful in handling ourselves, and bidding our time for judgment day.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">So far the non-credible opportunists are those who are sly at making the plagiarised syncophantic sound from a single orthodox political philosophy - that is fearful of competing ideas which are developed from open minds.</span> </p>
              </span></span><p></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">How sure are you that Minister Tharman was referring to this piece of old news ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Do you think that Singapore Ministers are so ill informed of global events in this age of instantaneous information, and will rely on out-dated information that will make their public speeches vulnerable to inaccuracies ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Perhap, it is you - who is the ill informed one.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Have you read this piece that is freely available on the www - if only you will click on it, and this is one of quite a few similar assessments of the very dire state of the US economy if you have taken the trouble to make intelligent use of Google ?</span></p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.321gold.com/editorials/buckler/buckler060408.html">‘The US Economic Recession – An Update : 4 June 2008’ </a></p>
              <p>  <span style="color: #0000ff;">Yes, money that goes around becomes the catalyst for economic activities - every economists know this principle.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Does this piece of information hit home with the Singapore Talented Elite that will lock-up a major portion of our money in unreachable CPF accounts that remain locked up till one either buy a house, reached the statutory age of withdrawal, or die ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">After the 1987 and 1997 economic downturn, the Economic Review Committee had on both occassions been given the feedback and recommendations that this Government should relax the CPF withdrawal rules, and more so during times when the workforce is facing economic hardship.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Unfortunately, this piece of Lee Ka Shing's anecdote never fall into the ears of the Singapore Talented Elite, who are perched too high on their pedestal towers.</span> </p>

              <p>The figures bandied around in US dollars, without adding in HK trade and just to give you a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">rough idea the scope</span> of our bilateral trade amounts to you, of which you attempted to downplay by your inferences.</p>
              <p> <a href="http://www.singstat.gov.sg/pubn/reference/mdsmay08.pdf">http://www.singstat.gov.sg/pubn/reference/mdsmay08.pdf</a></p>
              <p>Rather than to depend on US or PRC sources, I would suggest our own national statistics board for more precise figures which will put you to further shame on your absolute ignorance, which now you changed your original inferences to make it seem like you were the one of a view that China trade is important to us, ( which i will have to take credit for knocking sense into your rotten head), further heaping scorn on me to brazen your way out.</p>
              <p><br>I know your despicable modus operandi. I had been silently reading views here before i stepped in. Your way is to challenge viewpoints is by dissecting it into little parts in the hope of catching errors.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But should you be caught instead, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">you change your tune</span> and brazen it out by scorning that person. If he responds to your piecemeals, you will change tactic and continue to piecemeal his comments to wear him out or frustrate him with further scorn and not rational arguements.</p>
              <p> <br>When he leaves, you take credit for his comments and then declare victory, though i don't know what you had won except the spittle of those who knows better.</p>
              <p><br>Thus, i will not embarass myself to be seen arguing with a fool, and an insidious one at that, a intellectual wannabe for you put shame to those who had studied and work hard to be where they are today.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I had already attained my objectives - to prove you intellectually empty despite the use of technically correct words probably learnt from 'An idiot's guide to..' and filled with insidious misleading venom, as well as expressing my personal and original views on subjects matter of which silent readers can be kept informed or make their own judgement, for i stand by what i had posted.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You have yet to counter any of my arguments, which you even agree with the points, but your inflated ego will not allow it to be seen that way, thus the scorn. Pathetic creature you are.</p>
              <p><br>The only ones who will support you are probably just as mentally deficient as you are, and for their sake, i hope they are not from the police force, because their silly methods of profiling a person will not help them make detective's grade, let alone make inspector.</p>
              <p> <br><strong>So, crawl back into the rubbish bin where you really belong. Don't waste my time</strong>.</p>

              <p>Secondly, I thank you for criticising my post for its spelling errors, of which i can only claim that i am writing on a forum and not for a peer review dissection, and do not have the time to check for (edit:) spelling errors. Nevertheless, it is a spelling error on my part which i will endeavor to correct with time.</p>
              <p>However, do not claim i am somebody else please, unless you have evidences that are irrefutable, otherwise you would only look like an a small child given a bunch of bananas instead of sweet juicy grapes.</p>

              <p>my apologies that i saw this late. i think you are alluding this to me, though it was a different nick <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/plain/confused.png" alt="confused.png"> that pointed out that `mistake' to me on my `slip'.</p>
              <p>i have already clarified that it is a typo error which i admitted and corrected. now, can you pls pull out the different nicks that made the same `error' i made by calling sheep (in generally accepted definition here in singapore: MIW blind followers), `sheeps'? i would be curious to see how many different a/cs that i have set-up without me knowing, or impostors are there.  </p>
              <p>there is a clear distinction between a typo (sheeps) and bad english (irregardless), nicks aside. however, whichever nicks you used, it is an easy catch because of this `tell tale' error you consistently commit.</p>

              <p class="">SINGAPORE : Finance Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam on
              Sunday gave the assurance that Singapore is not heading for a
              recession.</p>
              <p>Speaking at a community event, Mr Tharman said, "From all
              indications we have at this point, I donâ€™t think weâ€™re heading for
              a recession. But there will be discomfort on the ground.
              Unfortunately, the fuel price increase in Malaysia does mean that
              vegetable, poultry and some other prices will go up. We canâ€™t avoid
              that. Fortunately, rice prices globally are coming down.</p>
              <p>"But overall, weâ€™re in a situation which isnâ€™t temporary â€” this
              will be with us for a while. Commodity prices are much higher than
              what they used to be. But weâ€™re tackling it, and weâ€™re confident of
              tackling it â€” both through the governmentâ€™s measures, the Growth
              Dividends, the GST Credits, as well as the way in which you see a
              lot of community initiatives on the ground."</p>
              <p>Mr Tharman was speaking to reporters at the Entrepreneurâ€”inâ€”You
              Carnival at Republic Polytechnic, where some 7,000 people turned up
              to pick up tips on starting their own business.</p>
              <p>The carnival included forums, workshops and an exhibition to
              nurture business acumen.</p>
              <p>There were also winning business presentations by tertiary
              institutions, and a presentation of the 2008 Youth Enterprise
              Awards.</p>
              <p>The Peopleâ€™s Association organised the event to encourage
              Singaporeans to be entrepreneurial. â€” CNA/ms</p>

The one-year-old Roe Deer - nicknamed "Unicorn'' - was born in captivity in the research center's park in the Tuscan town of Prato, near Florence, Gilberto Tozzi, director of the Center of Natural Sciences, said. He is believed to have been born with a genetic flaw; his twin has two horns.</div>

              <p>Have you also decided to identify the $27 Billion trade between China-Singapore in US Dollars ?</p>
              <p>If we were to believe your numbers from your given 'singstat.gov' - Singapore Export to China was <strong>S$43,549.5 Million</strong>; while Singapore's Import from China was <strong>S$48.013.4 Million</strong> - and taking an exchange rate of <strong>USD1.00 to SGD 1.48</strong> as at end-2007 : both numbers hardly come any where near your <strong>US$27 Billion</strong>.</p>
              <p>What exchange rate were you using in making your estimate to conclude that the China-Singapore Trade - BOTH WAYS had amounted to US$27 Billion ?</p>
              <p>Do you need the Hubble Telescope to improve your DeerHunting skills ?</p>
              <p>It is Sunday, and Hubble is probably available for your efforts to redeem your credibility by looking for some new stars to add dazzle to your sudden brilliance.</p>
