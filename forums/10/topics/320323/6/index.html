              <p><br>No use trying to shoo the attention that you have been seeking to your DeerHunting abilities - you have already made your 'point blank' fame with all your 'blank point' shots.</p>
              <p>To save you the trouble in jumping to both threads in which you have suddenly decide to display a flash of ingenuine genuis with you US$ reason - you sound alot more credible with your continued effort in giving me a blind eye in not reading what I have written.</p>
              <p>Have you also decided to identify the $27 Billion trade between China-Singapore in US Dollars ?</p>
              <p>If we were to believe your numbers from your given 'singstat.gov' - Singapore Export to China was <strong>S$43,549.5 Million</strong>; while Singapore's Import from China was <strong>S$48.013.4 Million</strong> - and taking an exchange rate of <strong>USD1.00 to SGD 1.48</strong> as at end-2007 : both numbers hardly come any where near your <strong>US$27 Billion</strong>.</p>
              <p>What exchange rate were you using in making your estimate to conclude that the China-Singapore Trade - BOTH WAYS had amounted to US$27 Billion ?</p>
              <p>Do you need the Hubble Telescope to improve your DeerHunting skills ?</p>
              <p>It is Sunday, and Hubble is probably available for your efforts to redeem your credibility by looking for some new stars to add dazzle to your sudden brilliance.</p>

              <p>Again you talk rubbish. Instead of backing up your claims with facts to support your lack of knowledge in economics, you use insults to futher your ownstupidity.</p>
              <p>Thus is there a need to discuss with you further, more so with one like you whose only facts are slander, scorn, mocks, slur and taunts instead of intelligence? Your only claim to  rabid notoriety are ridiculous attempts to humilate and revile others whom are rational and thinks differently from you.</p>
              <p>Continue with your thrash. It suits me well that you do so, so that readers of this forum may know your kind well and what grid-locking and time wasting opposition politics will be like, with rabid imbecile hypocrites of the likes such as you.</p>
              <p>Either that, or crawl quietly back to your rubbish bin where you belong, and no  one will say you are dumb.</p>

              <p>China Singapore Bilateral Trade made simple:-</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This post is for the benefit of readers to discern facts from half truths and lies. Simple analogies would be used for simpler understanding, for village idiots like Atobe still exists in Singapore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1.Imports and Exports</p>
              <p>----------------------------</p>
              <p>A. ) Exports to China:</p>
              <p>I purchase materials, made a table and exported it to China. China pays me S$43 dollars.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>B.) Import from China:-</p>
              <p>I saw online China had 3 chairs to sell. I don't need 3 chairs, as i am only 1 person, but there is a bulk discount if i buy all 3. So I paid S$48 dollars for all 3 chairs. I kept 1 and sold the other 2 to Indonesia and Australia, countries further away at a slightly higher price from me for a profit.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>On paper, it looks like I paid $5 more than i buy from China. But in actual fact, i didn't, for i don't need so many chairs as i am only a population of 1. I sold the other 2 China chair and made a small profit.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Multiply those chair a billion times and you will see how important bilateral trade with the factory of the world is to our entreport country.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>B. Service and support for trade</p>
              <p>--------------------------------------</p>
              <p>To make those table, i would need wood, glue, nails, tools, varnish, banks to give me capital, factory space, exports agents, etc. These are the organisations that facilitate my trade. They gain as well, for i have to pay for such services, which i will include into my costings for the S$43 table i sold to China.</p>
              <p>Now multiply the level of support for my trade in billions and you will see how much it had benefitted the supporting industries. IF there is no China trade, factory of the world, can you imagine how many people would be out of job?</p>
              <p>And this businessmodel is what the govt is attempting to replicate in modern Russia. What had CSJ and the political opposition done except to waste time, cast slander and maligned the honour of our super salesmen who are scouting the world for opportunites for us citizens so that we can put food on the table for our kids? </p>
              <p>No matter how high or low the volume of trade becomes even in recession times, there will always be trade, for there will always be something people will need and people will produce. No country is self-sufficient, except the poor. But then they are never a target market to earn money from.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>27 billion both ways</p>
              <p>------------------------</p>
              <p>When one chat with another person on prize of cars, one would usually give general views, eg: around $30k for Chinese makes, $50k for korean makes, $70k for japanese makes and above $100k for european models even when there are variations in between.</p>
              <p>It is only when one goes into specifics, such as type, engine capacity, fuel consumption, etcs, does one give a better accounting.</p>
              <p>My mention of $27 billion (international trade currency is in US dollars) both ways meant  around S$40 billion ( dec 07 rate) each for China and for Singapore. It was only a general figure to give the size of trade, for example if it was Korea, it would be (US)$10 billion.</p>
              <p>But Atobe stupidly use this general figure to prove her further ignorance. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Idiocy from Atobe</p>
              <p>-----------------------</p>
              <p>Can Singapore's bilateral trade with China be considered healthy when China exports more to Singapore than it does importing Singapore manufactured goods ?</p>
              <p>With China's main market also tied to the US market - as also with every major countries on earth, let alone Singapore - do you think that China can be immune to any recession in the USA ?</p>
              <p>Can Singapore depend on China's economy when it imports less than what it sells to Singapore ?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #000000;">Was it not your own grand idea in attempting to project China as an engine for Singapore's continued economic growth ?</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #000000;">And much more astounding stupidity only an ignorant idiot Atobe can contribute for your reading pleasure with the past pages.</span></span></p>

              <p><strong>Singapore's key exports down 10.5% in May on-year<br>Posted: 17 June 2008 1528 hrs</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>SINGAPORE - Singapore's key exports fell 10.5 percent in May compared with a year earlier, with pharmaceutical shipments down nearly half amid lower exports to the United States and Europe, the government said on Tuesday.</p>
              <p>The fall in non-oil domestic exports (NODX) was the largest since December 2006 when they dropped 14 percent, Fortis Bank economist Joseph Tan told Dow Jones Newswires.</p>
              <p>NODX fell in May after a 5.3 percent gain in April, said the trade promotion body, International Enterprise (IE) Singapore.</p>

              <p>I purchase materials, made a table and exported it to China. China pays me S$43 dollars.</p>
              <p>B.) Import from China:-</p>
              <p>I saw online China had 3 chairs to sell. I don't need 3 chairs, as i am only 1 person, but there is a bulk discount if i buy all 3. So I paid S$48 dollars for all 3 chairs. I kept 1 and sold the other 2 to Indonesia and Australia, countries further away at a slightly higher price from me for a profit.</p>
              <p>On paper, it looks like I paid $5 more than i buy from China. But in actual fact, i didn't, for i don't need so many chairs as i am only a population of 1. I sold the other 2 China chair and made a small profit.</p>
              <p>Multiply those chair a billion times and you will see how important bilateral trade with the factory of the world is to our entreport country.</p>

              <p>To make those table, i would need wood, glue, nails, tools, varnish, banks to give me capital, factory space, exports agents, etc. These are the organisations that facilitate my trade. They gain as well, for i have to pay for such services, which i will include into my costings for the S$43 table i sold to China.</p>
              <p>Now multiply the level of support for my trade in billions and you will see how much it had benefitted the supporting industries. IF there is no China trade, factory of the world, can you imagine how many people would be out of job?</p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Are you not ashamed at being trounced by one whom you will disrespectfully call a Village idiot ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">How ironical that you cannot even protect your political idiot-logy with your over glorifed claim as a DeerHunter with a wimp gun ?</span></p>
