              <p>Atobe, it does look to me that your <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>habit of spreading lies and distorted information</strong></span> in this forum is still alive and well. I am not sure if your are intentionally doing this again or is it due to you lack of knowledge in dealing with FACTS and numbers.</p>
              <p><em>1<span style="color: #993300;">) Can Singapore's bilateral trade with China be considered healthy when China exports more to Singapore than it does importing Singapore manufactured goods ?</span></em></p>
              <p>The answer to the above question is YES, because about 50% of what we import from China are re-exported to other countries. Hence if you factor that in, our bilateral trade with China is extremely healthy</p>

              <p>No doubt that China economy is closely linked to the US, however over the past 8 to 9 years, China economy has grown so much that their domestic market is now strong enough to help cushion some of the impact from a possible US recession.  </p>

              <p>Do you seriously believe yourself that Singapore entrepot status has not already been short circuited when our neighboring countries are already doing a large portion of business directly with China ?</p>
              <p>As matters stand, Singapore entrepot business is not dependent on products from China, with the bulk of it being importing raw materials, processing it and exporting the final processed products - <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.ntc.org.sg/nbas/sgoview.htm">“such as wafer fabrication and oil refining”. </a> </p>

              <p>If China's domestic market is large enough to cushion any impact from a recession in the US, and deflating the US consumer market from buying up the luxury goods that are made in China - do you seriously believe that China's consumers are wealthy enough to make up for the loss of the wealthy US consumers ? </p>
              <p>You should be an economic adviser to China, and Singapore will be much safer.</p>

              <p>China can be the World No 1 - does it need to buy anything from Singapore that it cannot manufacture for itself ?</p>
              <p>Do you believe in all the propaganda about China's size and economic drive to become the engine of growth for Singapore's manufactured products ?</p>
              <p>That propaganda is to soothe snuffed eyes and waxed ears to the challenges that China will pose when it becomes an imperialistic economic dynamo, and closed its doors from external investors to participate directly in their consumer economy.</p>
              <p>As matters stand, foreigners are welcome to start businesses beyond a fixed capital size, which suits the MNCs.</p>
              <p>How does that translate opportunities for the SME from Singapore, whose capital base do not meet the artificial limits that block entrepreneurial mobility ?</p>
              <p>Singapore has an open economy that welcome any capital size enterprise to open business in Singapore, and we have seen a flurry of 'Ban Mee' Noodles stalls at some Food Centres that are wholly owned and manned by Mainland Chinese.</p>
              <p>Can the same opportunities be extended to our smaller hawkers to set up business in China, with the same protection given by the State to its own citizens' enterprises ?</p>
