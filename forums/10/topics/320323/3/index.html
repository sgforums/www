              <p> Which part of what is said is a lie ?</p>
              <p>The Gazelle that is addicted to panty-sniffing, or the Gazelle that deride everyone as sheep even as he will answer to the calls of the Great Shepherd without fail ?</p>
              <p>Can you handle facts as given by others to you, or do you dutifully depend only on the Facts according to what your master - the Great Shepherd - decides for you ?</p>
              <p>Do you seriously believe yourself that Singapore entrepot status has not already been short circuited when our neighboring countries are already doing a large portion of business directly with China ?</p>
              <p>As matters stand, Singapore entrepot business is not dependent on products from China, with the bulk of it being importing raw materials, processing it and exporting the final processed products - <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.ntc.org.sg/nbas/sgoview.htm">“such as wafer fabrication and oil refining”. </a> </p>
              <p>If China's domestic market is large enough to cushion any impact from a recession in the US, and deflating the US consumer market from buying up the luxury goods that are made in China - do you seriously believe that China's consumers are wealthy enough to make up for the loss of the wealthy US consumers ? </p>
              <p>You should be an economic adviser to China, and Singapore will be much safer.</p>
              <p>China can be the World No 1 - does it need to buy anything from Singapore that it cannot manufacture for itself ?</p>
              <p>Do you believe in all the propaganda about China's size and economic drive to become the engine of growth for Singapore's manufactured products ?</p>
              <p>That propaganda is to soothe snuffed eyes and waxed ears to the challenges that China will pose when it becomes an imperialistic economic dynamo, and closed its doors from external investors to participate directly in their consumer economy.</p>
              <p>As matters stand, foreigners are welcome to start businesses beyond a fixed capital size, which suits the MNCs.</p>
              <p>How does that translate opportunities for the SME from Singapore, whose capital base do not meet the artificial limits that block entrepreneurial mobility ?</p>
              <p>Singapore has an open economy that welcome any capital size enterprise to open business in Singapore, and we have seen a flurry of 'Ban Mee' Noodles stalls at some Food Centres that are wholly owned and manned by Mainland Chinese.</p>
              <p>Can the same opportunities be extended to our smaller hawkers to set up business in China, with the same protection given by the State to its own citizens' enterprises ?</p>
              <p>How did you come to this conclusion, after uselessly misinterpreting my earlier response in the previous page of this Thread, and uselessly pursuing an aimless query to my intention and purpose for the question posed ?</p>
              <p>Now are you back to your mindless game at seeking a grand profusion of what is merely juvenile facts and deluded interpretation of facts ?</p>

              <p><strong>You therefore claim our trade is no longer reliant on China?</strong></p>
              <p>  "Do you believe in all the propaganda about China's size and economic drive to become the engine of growth for Singapore's manufactured products ?"</p>

              <p><strong>227 million american consumers against 1 billion chinese? With China's trade diversification with the world of another 5 billion people? You are claiming the factory of the world cannot cushion the impact?</strong></p>
              <p> Where did you study economics? No, no need to reply that question, I just hope it was not from some coffeeshop. As for the rest of your post, I don't think it's even worth asking.</p>
