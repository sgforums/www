              <p>Dear Eagle,</p>
              <p>This is the first time i am replying to you and hopefully the last time. Please do not attempt to tell me what I can or cannot do on my posts, so long as i write responsibily as responses to what i see fit, irregardless of first or last post, for you would be infringing on my freedom of expression,</p>
              <p>Secondly, I thank you for criticising my post for its spelling errors, of which i can only claim that i am writing on a forum and not for a peer review dissection, and do not have the time to check for (edit:) spelling errors. Nevertheless, it is a spelling error on my part which i will endeavor to correct with time.</p>
              <p>However, do not claim i am somebody else please, unless you have evidences that are irrefutable, otherwise you would only look like an a small child given a bunch of bananas instead of sweet juicy grapes.</p>

              <p><strong>Tuesday, 10 July, 2001, 09:43 GMT 10:43 UK <br>Singapore falls into recession</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Singapore's economy shrank by 10.1% during the three months to June, its second successive quarterly contraction. <br>Two quarters of falling gross domestic product (GDP) means that the Singaporean economy is now technically in a recession.</p>
              <p>The second-quarter contraction has turned annual GDP growth negative - a drop of 0.9% year on year - for the first time since the pan-Asian economic crisis of 1997.</p>
              <p>The slowdown is blamed on exceptionally weak global demand for high-tech equipment, an industry on which Singapore is heavily reliant.</p>
              <p>Manufacturing, half of which is high-tech, accounts for one-quarter of Singaporean GDP.</p>
              <p>And Singapore is particularly vulnerable to the ebb and flow of the global economy, since more than two-thirds of its industrial production is exported.</p>
              <p>The Singapore dollar has plumbed a series of 11-year lows, to about 1.835 against the US dollar, in trade over the last few days.</p>
              <p>Nasty surprise</p>
              <p>The Singaporean authorities had been expecting a slowdown ever since the outlook for the international technology sector turned sour in the middle of last year.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Singapore is heavily reliant on trade<br> <br>But the figures were worse than expected.</p>
              <p>They prompted the trade and industry ministry to slash its economic growth forecast for this year down to 0.5-1.5%, from the 3.5-5.5% estimated in April.</p>
              <p>At the start of 2001, the ministry had forecast 5-7% GDP growth.</p>
              <p>Liberals</p>
              <p>During Asia's 1997 economic crisis, many governments in the region raised trade barriers and increased regulation, in an attempt to slow the outflow of foreign capital.</p>
              <p>This time, however, Singapore seems determined to accelerate liberalisation.</p>
              <p>At the end of last month, the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the territory's central bank, unveiled the second phase of a financial deregulation plan announced two years ago.</p>
              <p>More foreign banks will be allowed to open branches in Singapore.</p>
              <p>And all five of Singapore's biggest banks - long protected from outside competition - are now engaged in takeover bids.</p>
              <p>A revival of the financial sector, the government hopes, could go some way to compensate for the feeble performance of export-oriented manufacturing.</p>

              <p><strong> US recession may cause Singapore's GDP growth to drop to 3%<br>By Ng Baoying, Channel NewsAsia | Posted: 27 March 2008 2025 hrs</strong></p>
              <p>  </p>
              <p>SINGAPORE: The market generally expects Singapore's economy to grow by 5.5 percent this year.</p>
              <p>But economists at Nanyang Technological University (NTU) said if the United States goes into a recession, there is a 50 percent chance that Singapore's GDP growth may drop to as low as 3 percent.</p>
              <p>Generally, consumer demand is expected to slow down this year, whether or not the US goes into a recession.</p>
              <p>Choy Keen Meng, Assistant Professor, Economics Division, Humanities &amp; Social Sciences School, NTU, said: "Consumer spending would definitely be cut back because consumers in Singapore and all around the world are realising that the US economy is slowing, the world economy is slowing, and psychological reaction to that is to be more cautious in spending."</p>
              <p>If US goes into a recession, the electronics sector which tends to be driven by US demand is likely to suffer the hardest hit. NTU economists expect a 1.3 percent dip in chip sales then, versus a 6.9 percent recovery if the US holds up.</p>
              <p>Experts said the construction sector will likely be Singapore's main pillar of support in those difficult times. And while the services sector is more insulated from external pressures, they will not escape the ripple effects of the US recession on regional economies.</p>
              <p>A bright spot, however, will be tourism-related services, which will benefit from upcoming projects like the Formula One night race and the integrated resorts.</p>
              <p>Financial services are forecast to see a heavy slowdown from a 12.5 percent growth in 2007 to just 6.5 percent this year.</p>
              <p>Overall, inflation is expected to stay high.</p>
              <p>"Unfortunately, inflation will remain very high this year. We are forecasting about 7 percent inflation in the first quarter and about 6 percent inflation in the second quarter," said Prof Choy.</p>
              <p>Inflation is then expected to ease in the second half of this year to 3 to 4 percent. For the whole year, NTU expects inflation to come in at 4.5 to 5 percent.</p>

              <h1 class="articleheading"><strong>SIngapore investors expect global financial crisis and recession</strong></h1>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Singapore - The spread of the financial contagion beyond the United States </strong></p>
              <p>has increased the likelihood of a global financial crisis and recession, the executive director of Singapore's sovereign wealth fund warned on Monday.</p>
              <p>'We could be facing a recession which is longer, deeper and wider than any recession that we have encountered in the last 30 years,' said Tony Tan at a staff conference of the Government Investment Corporation (GIC), which bought substantial stakes in troubled UBS in December and Citicorp in January.</p>
              <p>Tan, who is also the GIC's deputy chairman said the investments in the Swiss and US giants are regarded as 'long-term investments which will give us good returns when markets stabilize and economic conditions return to more normal levels.'</p>
              <p>'We are now entering a period of extreme uncertainty in the world economy and the global financial markets,' Tan said. 'As banks continue to de-leverage, cutting down on their lending activities and causing contraction in credit supply, the prospects for the US economy and possibly even the world economy are fraught with considerable downside risk.'</p>
              <p>The economic downturn can be mitigated if decisive and timely actions are taken by policy makers in the United States and elsewhere, he said.</p>
              <p>'If such actions by the authorities are not taken within the next three to four months, it will be left to the market forces of supply and demand to stabilize the US housing market before we can see the light at the end of the tunnel,' Tan said. 'This will be a considerably more painful and long drawn process.'</p>
              <p>Financial and investment markets will be extremely nervous and volatile over the next one to two years, Tan said. Policymakers, business managers and investors will require 'fortitude and nimbleness.'</p>

              <p>SIngapore investors expect global financial crisis and recession <strong>Apr 21, 2008</strong>, 5:40 GMT</p>
              <p><strong>US recession may cause Singapore's GDP growth to drop to 3%<br>By Ng Baoying, Channel NewsAsia | Posted: 27 March 2008 2025 hrs</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As you can see, those are dated news, of which prompted Finance Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam on Monday 9th June to reassure the public.</p>
              <p>I will spare all here the economic babblegook and instead use simple words here so that more may understand. I will now relate a story often heard. Mr Lee Kah Shing, one of the richest man in Asia was walking on a pavement with his friends when he noticed a 10cts coin on the ground. He picked it up and pocketed it.</p>
              <p>His friends chided him on he being a miser. But his reply was "This 10cts is no use to anyone laying in the gutter. It would be better to use it so that in its circulation, others will benefit"</p>
              <p>The point of this story is :- Money needs to be circulated. It is of no use if it is hoarded up. When no one spends money, shops and markets will close. Worse if it is kept in banks, for they will have to lower interest rates, take higher risks to lend money to speculative investments so that the banks may earn loan interests to pay for savings interest. When default, the banks go belly up, customers lose their savings.</p>
              <p>What makes people hoard up or spend less is fear. Such fears will only to lead to further self prophecies of doom such as recessions, etc. simply because people are worried.</p>
              <p>The whole foundation of the market place is built and can succeed on only one thing - confidence. Confidence that someone will buy and someone will sell, which is true, for who amongst us have not something we need?</p>
              <p>Our country is in a better position to weather whatever storms may arrive, simply because we have</p>
              <p>1. Foreign workers. The influx of cheap labour had enabled companies, which would have gone to their country instead, to set up here in our safe and law abiding country. Such companies provide employment for many of our workers, from white to blue supervisory collars for our ITE grads, which would not had a chance for employment had they not been around. And in a recession, it had been always the unskilled to be the first to go.</p>
              <p>2. Reserves. There are US$300billion dollars in our coffers. It is alot of money and its accrued interests and dividends can and had been used to help fellow Singaporeans tide over rough times.</p>
              <p>It would not be prudent to give it all out, for it would not be enough for all, nor enough for subsidies, but it can be used to pay more for national projects that our businessmen can earn to pay their workers, now that resource prices had risen.</p>
              <p>3. Public and private initiatives to help those whom are really down and out through MCD, CDCs,NGOs,etc.</p>
              <p>4. Lower GDP does not mean NO GDP. There will still be economic activities, no matter how the market performs.</p>
              <p>I will not bore others to list more, but due to good government and a resiliant people, I believe together we can weather the rough seas ahead. Inflation is up, but not to our eyeballs. For us singaporeans, it means just giving up one meal in restaurants or a second pub outing for the week, unlike our asian neighbours, who may not earn enough to buy bread alone for himself.  Just keep an eye out on non credible opportunitsts who may seek to divide us up. Good luck and have some confidence. It's not all doom and gloom in reality as some here want us all to believe.  </p>

              <p>the idea that china are insulated from the american possible recession is unfounded.</p>
              <p>The majority of chinese exports are already to american. even a drop by 20% of export to american can hurt most company in china.</p>
              <p>some of the badly affected industries could be</p>
              <p>1. textile, electronics, semiconductors. F&amp;B, shipping.</p>
              <p>province like zhejiang, guangdong in my opinion will be hard hit.</p>
              <p>thereafter, the effect will trickle down to domestically such as housing, banks, local F&amp;B.</p>
              <p>to think some industries like tourism, construction can help singapore avoid recession in 2009 is not likely. F1 will only create boom for services for 1 mth.</p>
              <p>even if these 2 industries can help singapore avoid a recession, most singapore will be benefiting from it becoz  tourism and construction dont employ that much singaporeans.</p>

              <p>SIngapore investors expect global financial crisis and recession <strong>Apr 21, 2008</strong>, 5:40 GMT</p>
              <p><strong>US recession may cause Singapore's GDP growth to drop to 3%<br>By Ng Baoying, Channel NewsAsia | Posted: 27 March 2008 2025 hrs</strong></p>
              <p>As you can see, those are dated news, of which prompted Finance Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam on Monday 9th June to reassure the public.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"> Yes, that news was dated 21 April 2008 @ 5.40 GMT - 2 months old news.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">How sure are you that Minister Tharman was referring to this piece of old news ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Do you think that Singapore Ministers are so ill informed of global events in this age of instantaneous information, and will rely on out-dated information that will make their public speeches vulnerable to inaccuracies ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Perhap, it is you - who is the ill informed one.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Have you read this piece that is freely available on the www - if only you will click on it, and this is one of quite a few similar assessments of the very dire state of the US economy if you have taken the trouble to make intelligent use of Google ?</span></p>

              <blockquote>
              <p>I will spare all here the economic babblegook and instead use simple words here so that more may understand. I will now relate a story often heard. Mr Lee Kah Shing, one of the richest man in Asia was walking on a pavement with his friends when he noticed a 10cts coin on the ground. He picked it up and pocketed it.</p>
              <p>His friends chided him on he being a miser. But his reply was "This 10cts is no use to anyone laying in the gutter. It would be better to use it so that in its circulation, others will benefit"</p>
              <p>The point of this story is :- Money needs to be circulated. It is of no use if it is hoarded up. When no one spends money, shops and markets will close. Worse if it is kept in banks, for they will have to lower interest rates, take higher risks to lend money to speculative investments so that the banks may earn loan interests to pay for savings interest. When default, the banks go belly up, customers lose their savings.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p> <span style="color: #0000ff;">Yes, money that goes around becomes the catalyst for economic activities - every economists know this principle.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Does this piece of information hit home with the Singapore Talented Elite that will lock-up a major portion of our money in unreachable CPF accounts that remain locked up till one either buy a house, reached the statutory age of withdrawal, or die ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">After the 1987 and 1997 economic downturn, the Economic Review Committee had on both occassions been given the feedback and recommendations that this Government should relax the CPF withdrawal rules, and more so during times when the workforce is facing economic hardship.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Unfortunately, this piece of Lee Ka Shing's anecdote never fall into the ears of the Singapore Talented Elite, who are perched too high on their pedestal towers.</span> </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>What makes people hoard up or spend less is fear. Such fears will only to lead to further self prophecies of doom such as recessions, etc. simply because people are worried.</p>
              <p>The whole foundation of the market place is built and can succeed on only one thing - confidence. Confidence that someone will buy and someone will sell, which is true, for who amongst us have not something we need?</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Why do you sound so 'Gazelle' logical when you make no attempts with any clues to do so ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Have you hit the nail on the head with your reasons for hoarding - that arises out of insecurity ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Can we accept your explanation to give a deeper insight into the causes of MM LKY's insecurity for hoarding the Annual Surplus into the GIC funds, and managing it in a tight fisted manner that even the Elected President is not privy to its total size ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If your observation is of any accuracy, then it confirms also the statements by another participant named ''robbertteh'' - that all the government expenditures on essential services are being recovered from Singaporeans' consumption and usage of such services, leading to a larger accumulated Government funds. This growth can only result from taking more money from the Citizens - and putting these out of circulation and into the Sovereign Wealth Funds managed by GIC and Temasek Holdings.</span></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Our country is in a better position to weather whatever storms may arrive, simply because we have</p>
              <p>1. Foreign workers. The influx of cheap labour had enabled companies, which would have gone to their country instead, to set up here in our safe and law abiding country. Such companies provide employment for many of our workers, from white to blue supervisory collars for our ITE grads, which would not had a chance for employment had they not been around. And in a recession, it had been always the unskilled to be the first to go.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Can Singapore or Singaporeans be in a better position during a recession, when there is an influx of cheap labor to compete with the few jobs left for Singaporeans facing retrenchment during an economic storm ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If the influx of cheap foreign labor is to meet the demands of the labor intensive industries, and create more jobs for Singaporeans - why will this government insist on placing a huge foreign worker's levy for every one employed, and making it even more difficult for the labor intensive manufacturers to stay in Singapore ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Has it not been the plan of this Singapore Government to move out all the labor intensive industries to other lower labor cost centers, while we go up the value added chain in Bio-Science and Higher Technology ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Are you outdated with your information besides believing Minister Tharman to have used outdated news information ?</span></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>2. Reserves. There are US$300billion dollars in our coffers. It is alot of money and its accrued interests and dividends can and had been used to help fellow Singaporeans tide over rough times.</p>
              <p>It would not be prudent to give it all out, for it would not be enough for all, nor enough for subsidies, but it can be used to pay more for national projects that our businessmen can earn to pay their workers, now that resource prices had risen.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p> <span style="color: #0000ff;">The only Singaporeans that this Government has helped with the accrued interests and dividends are the Talented Elites in their close knit circle - by giving themselves and their own, the wage increases when every other Singaporean has been persuaded to tighten our belts and take a cut in wages and CPF savings.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The measly amounts that are given to each working person in each Singaporean household had dissipated the sum effect of such a large sum paid out.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The amounts given to each individual could not even last through one month of house hold expenses - and with more payment having to be topped up from our cash savings for the high charges of Government services.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Only a fool will give out all that he has saved, with none left for a rainiy day.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Only a politician will know how to dole out in small bits and pieces that make them relevant in holding the loyalties of those whom they see and treat as carpet beggars. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If the Elite and Talented Politicians have the clear altruistic interest of Singaporeans in their thoughts, they would have used the total sum - which they claimed to cost the Government a Billion SGD - paid out annually into a National Insurance Plan, with the Billion Dollar Gift as premium paid for all Singaporeans.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">This would have been the best policy that takes care of all the health care and hospitalisation needs of every Singaporean - from cradle to grave.</span></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>3. Public and private initiatives to help those whom are really down and out through MCD, CDCs,NGOs,etc.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p> <span style="color: #0000ff;">Surely by 'Public' - you are not hoping to refer to the Government sector ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">It has always been the Private Sector that has taken the lead to organise the funds contributed by Singaporeans to be distributed to the needy Singaporeans.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The hard pressed Singaporeans have constantly and consistently been hit from every directions demanding for the meagre monies they earned as daily wages, or monthly salary to be given to charities.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Yet the large largesse managed by the Great Mentor remains inaccessible to help those who have been identified as ''really down and out through MCD, CDCs, NGO, etc....'' - as this Government fear that it will be depended upon infinitely as a crutch by the poor.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Ironically, the Talented Elite - who are already successful individuals - will need a crutch in the form of Million Dollar wages to keep them from being corrupted.</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Is Singapore not in this unique situation during this month of June 2008 - with food and fuel prices spiraling the percentages upwards even as the GDP data is positive although comparatively weaker ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Should this not be the factor that caused Minister Tharman to sooth the nerves - as the writings are already on the Wall ?</span></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>I will not bore others to list more, but due to good government and a resiliant people, I believe together we can weather the rough seas ahead. Inflation is up, but not to our eyeballs. For us singaporeans, it means just giving up one meal in restaurants or a second pub outing for the week, unlike our asian neighbours, who may not earn enough to buy bread alone for himself.  Just keep an eye out on non credible opportunitsts who may seek to divide us up. Good luck and have some confidence. It's not all doom and gloom in reality as some here want us all to believe.  </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p> <span style="color: #0000ff;">For you to believe that ''inflation is up, but not to our eyeballs'' - you must either be deluded with your eyeballs at the height of a Gazelle, or that your DeerHunting results have been far better to cushion the high costs of living that is currently the bane of every Singaporean service provider and consumer.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Again, another useless comparison made by putting down our Asian neighbor, while our problems are far different from theirs.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Why will you not compare our living conditions with those of our Ministers' - who have liberally taken our monies to live their life of iron-bowl security, while calling for us to make sacrifices that they snatch away without a blink of an eyelid ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">No it is not all doom and gloom, as at least without the help of the Government - which has yet to reach many down and out Singaporeans, and which the help given to-date are meaningless - the Citizens of Singapore are more resourceful in handling ourselves, and bidding our time for judgment day.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">So far the non-credible opportunists are those who are sly at making the plagiarised syncophantic sound from a single orthodox political philosophy - that is fearful of competing ideas which are developed from open minds.</span> </p>
