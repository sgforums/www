But one may argue on the fact that the government polices are cater to attracts foreign investments and businesses rather than being beneficial for its own entrepreneurs or people. But are there no merits in the pro-foreign polices at all? IBM, GlaxoSmithKline &amp; others big name MNCs station here not only create jobs for Singaporeans but also open up opportunities and exposure working in large organisations.<br>This pro-foreign policies are in line with the free trade agreement which the government I believe intend to pursue thus creating a competitive environment. In my opinion, in a globalisation world today, protectionist polices are no longer effective as in the case of Proton cars in Malaysis, which used to be placed under protectionism but this has been lifted off because the government have realised the implication of protecting one domestic industy.<br>Overall, I will say that it is equally important to lend a helping hand to local enterprises for entreprenuer-to-be yet maintain competitiveness through foreign investors for jobs and boosting economic.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Cindyfeh:</div><div class="quote_body">On the contrary...<br><br>Gov has been very loyal to singaporeans and PR, esp males.

            <div class='col-md body'>So you want the Singapore government to create another "BUMIPUTRA" policy like Malaysia???? Meaning to say that Singaporeans are "sons of the soil" and any foreigners or PRs are second class citizens here?I am not quite  amused by this as the Malaysian Chineses and other minority races have been suffering for years under that divisive and discriminatory policy and many foreigners were scared away as meritocracy was totally dead, and what they are looking for is "Kulitfication" rather than qualification when they are looking for a job!<br><br>I would rather infer that the Singapore government is too loyal to $$$$$$$$, few hundred % more than its own citizens, thereby producing a nation of loyal citizen$ with dollars $ign sticking all over their head$ and of course attracting a lot of foreigners who need S$! Sometimes you just wonder what is the use of gaining the whole world and losing your own soul!Singapore may have billions in its reserves, the citizen$ may have millions in their bank accounts, but the country is becoming more soulless! Top earners want more, millionaires try hard to be billionaires, they suck either legitimately or illegitimately whenever they can, leaving the poors and the sicks to suffer in silence, that has slowly becoming  a reality in Singapore! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

She may not be a true beauty like the SPG or as vain as the SPG but she has steel in her character which the SPG can learn a thing or two.<br><br>Mr AngMo's girl - no need to say. She doesn't has to wear the shortest sarong. Anyway, she already has assets well placed- her chest is fuller and her bump is rounder than the SPG. She is a true beauty no other can compare. The only thing that set her back is her independent streak. Tame that and her man will run back to her arms, even if it is as far as Singapore.<br><br></div>
