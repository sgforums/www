I do not wish to join in any debate but just point out something.<br><br>In internet forum like this, it is very hard for many to write like an author or a journalist, with the ability to take stock or write balance non-partisan viewpoints.<br><br>Many of us write with certain point(s) in mind (sometimes well articulated, sometimes not with misspelling, wrong word, meaning wrongly phrase etc).<br><br>The better medium for political comment, of course, will be the printed media. But that is another thing altogether. I am just saying this medium of commnunication do have limitations and flaws too.<br></div>
