              <p>Since PAP already said the 2 casinos are for foreigners and not for Singaporeans, all Singaporeans should come together and boycott the 2 casinos.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans boycotting the casinos will lead to the downfall of the casinos, since majority of the casinos business come from Singaporeans themselves. It would be very nice for PAP to see the downfall, when PAP see the business of the casino suffering, PAP will lower the levy.</p>
              <p>Why be daft and pay $100 to PAP before you can gamble? We should boycott them.</p>

              <p>How come the <strong>Casino</strong> Regulatory Authority weild so much power?</p>
              <p>The shuttle bus comes under the Integrated Resort management. The free shuttle bus service is a value added by the IR management to <strong>all the tenants</strong> of the IR.</p>
              <p>The casino management did not arrange for the buses, or did they? If they did, then the CRA have every right to order them to stop. If not then they have no right to stop the free shuttle bus service. If they can, then they must also stop SBST and SMRT from ply that area, as these bus services are also bringing locals to the casino to gamble. Senior citizens got concession some more. CRA should order that senior citizens concessions to the IR should not apply, they should pay full adult fare, since they are going to gamble.</p>
              <p>I think the PAP later are going to be the good guy, and reinstate the free shuttle bus service, saying that the IR management misunderstood the CRA.</p>
              <p>This is another test, (LHL in China, Hari Raya Holidays), just to gauge the reaction of Singaporeans, like the CPF case.</p>

              <p><a href="http://singaporenewsalternative.blogspot.com/2010/09/confusion-as-singapore-regulator-axes.html"><strong>Confusion as Singapore regulator axes casino shuttles</strong></a></p>
              <p>Shuttle services offered by Resorts World Sentosa (RWS) and Marina Bay Sands – which take thousands of customers every day to the resorts – were halted after a directive from regulators.</p>
              <p>The resorts, which introduced the buses three months ago to ferry residents and visitors to the resorts to boost business, called the move a “knee-jerk reaction.”</p>
              <p>RWS vice-president of resort operations Noel Hawkes said: “We thought we’d have a bit more time to inform our guests. What we’re really concerned about is our guests…to cut it off just like that is a bit blunt.</p>
              <p>“The deterrent of a $100 casino levy is onerous. I think a free bus ticket is not going to make any difference.”</p>
              <p>A Marina Bay spokeswoman said the resort had “voluntarily suspended its licensed paid bus routes.”</p>
              <p>She added that its free shuttles to various hotels had also been stopped but that an airport shuttle service, for its own hotel guests, remained in operation.</p>
              <p>The spokeswoman added: “The goal of Marina Bay Sands’ bus services has been to service international tourists.”</p>
              <p>The suspension caused confusion over the weekend, with many residents and visitors waiting at stops unaware that the service had finished.</p>
              <p>Last week the Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports said it was investigating the resorts’ free shuttle services – saying that the integrated resorts operators “will not be allowed to target the local market or provide incentives in any form for Singaporeans to patronise the casinos.”</p>
              <p>The move prompted RWS and Marina Sands to announce they were suspending some of their services, including downtown and to the heartlands district.</p>
              <p>Then on Friday a spokesman for the Casino Regulatory Authority (CRA) said it had “directed RWS and Marina Bay Sands to cease all their shuttle bus services with immediate effect.”</p>
              <p>The directive instructed both resorts to cease all services with the only exceptions being for buses to the airport and hotels.</p>
              <p>One of the reasons for the ban on the buses is understood to be that the Casino Control (Advertising) Regulations 2010 only allows advertising in specified destinations such as the airport or hotels.</p>
              <p>It is believed that the shuttle services will not be allowed in the future even if the resorts agree to charge passengers.</p>
              <p>MP Liang Eng Hwa, who had filed a Parliamentary question on the issue of free shuttle buses, said: “When I initially raised this, I had asked the resorts to voluntarily withdraw the services, which they did. I think it’s good because they have listened to the concerns on the ground.”</p>
              <p>The suspension of the services also raised concerns from bus operators, some of who have invested in new vehicles and staff.</p>
              <p>Neo Tiam Beng, managing director of Transit Network Consortium which runs 18 buses for RWS, said he may have to lay off workers if the services were not resumed.<br>“We bring the guests to the resort, not to the casino,” he said. “There is other entertainment here like the theme park and restaurants.”</p>
              <p>The Resorts World shuttle service had been in operation since June, serving 19 locations across the island 15 to 33 times a day. Some services operated past 2am on Fridays, Saturdays and the eve of public holidays.</p>
              <p>It had been ferrying an average of 2,500 passengers daily – although the company estimate 60 per cent of them were not going to the casino, but to Universal Studios or other attractions.</p>
              <p>RWS spokesman Robin Goh said the services were put on because of “the age-old perception that Sentosa was too far and inaccessible.”</p>
              <p>A spokesman for the National Council on Problem Gambling said it viewed the free shuttles with “great concern.”</p>
              <p>The suspension is the latest example of the stringent control the Singaporean authorities are trying to impose on the resorts. Tough rules have already been imposed on junket operators.</p>

              <p>The CRA has ordered the various company serving the RWS shuttle buses which brings visitor from the heartlands to RWS to stop their services WITH IMMEDIATE EFFECT in the afternoon of 10 September 2010 , this has caused alot of frustration , confusion &amp; unhappiness to the people as well as the drivers who were deployed to serve the routes.</p>
              <p>Basically , i think this is a ploy played by PAP as yesterday in ST , the MCYS says that there are concerns that a lot of people are going into the casino easily to gamble , what i think , they are just finding stupid excuses , cos with these shuttle services , SMRT will have no business.</p>
              <p>Obviously , when government made this decision , its like making alot of people jobless , as TNC , which bought about 13 new buses &amp; brought in 25 drivers says that they might retrench these drivers. See how sad these drivers are? Did our government even think about them? Still want to bullshit saying they have found alot of jobs for Singaporeans.... what rubbish... in wanbao yesterday , they even said that for these drivers who are retrenched can go join SBST &amp; SMRT and 1 driver evenspent $300+ to get license to work for RWS Free Shuttle Bus...</p>
              <p>Even if they say that there are many people getting easier to go in to casino to bet , then for goodness sake , close down the casino , if you set up casino , obviously is for people to bet de mah.... they can raise the casino levy to $150 &amp; limit each people is allow to spent up to $3000 to gamble per entry &amp; each person is ONLY ALLOWED to enter the premises of the casino ONCE A MONTH ONLY or ONCE in 3 MONTHS , isnt this better then to put people who are serving the RWS who are innocent &amp; those visitors to the resort other than the casino in a difficult situation? I do hope that the opposition can take this issue to voice out in parliament during the next election.</p>
              <p>I hope that for people who faced alot of difficulty with regards to this matter , please think carefully before voting in the elections......</p>
              <p>What are your views , share here.</p>

              <p><br>Is it because there was a concern regarding a likely act of terrorism in these shuttle buses?</p>
              <p>Think about bus bombing if you looked at the date which is one day before September 11th.</p>
