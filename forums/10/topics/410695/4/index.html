              <p><br>First of all, I rather go out with an old man than going out with you.</p>
              <p>Secondly, am i right to say that all these cheating in gambling, shuttle buses, jam and more peoples coming is the result of the casinos ? Now, just imagine without the casinos, what will be the situation of singapore now,...still the same old one roti, two eggs and kopi morning lifestyle. So, so far, is the casinos benefited us or otherwise,,,</p>

              <p><br>From what i read on the news, yes, the govt either do not know or have initially turn a blind eyes to these free shuttle run, and i am quite certain that they are not informed. It is a make shift shuttle run that pick up the regulars on their best know spot, just like any other company buses picking up workers to work.</p>
              <p>As time went on, from ears to ears, more and more people started to come to know about it, aunties and uncles start plying the buses to casinos thru peers gathering, and this worried their family, sons and daughters who started to question the government, and even in some other forums, there were feedback on these buses, which the netizens find is weird about the real objectives of the casinos, which is to serves and influence the rich, the tourist and the foreigner, but not to influence the heartlanders. Of course anyone (above 21yo) can gamble at the casinos, but the influence by promotiing free shuttle bus services at laymen towns is out of the objectives set.</p>
