He soon was one of the top reporters. In 1941, he joined the United Press Association and was its Chief Correspondent in the 1950s. He returned to The Straits Times in 1959 and was appointed deputy editor in Singapore. In 1966, he interviewed the former Indonesian President General Suharto, reporting of his intention to end the three-year confrontation with Malaysia. He broke the news with a front-page headline quoting Suharto: "Peace: The sooner the better." [1]  (http://ourstory.asia1.com.sg/merger/headline/mpeace.html)<br><br>Wee was the editorial manager when he retired in 1973 to become the High Commissioner to Malaysia, a position he served for seven years. He was appointed as Ambassador to Japan in September 1980, and to South Korea in February 1981. At the end of his diplomatic stint in 1984, he was Chairman of the Singapore Broadcasting Corporation, predecessor of MediaCorp, before his appointment as president a year later.<br><br>A highly popular President in his tenure, he was noted for his approachability by all walks of lives during his office. Modest, friendly and sincere, he was remembered as a PeopleÂ’s President.<br><br>In 2004, he wrote a book, Glimpses and Reflections, to share his childhood and experiences as a clerk, journalist, and President. From the book royalties and other proceeds from donors, half a million Singapore dollars were donated to eight charities.<br><br>President Wee Kim Wee passed away on 2 May 2005 at 5:10am SST at his home at the age of 89 as a result of a prostate cancer relapse. A humble man even in his death wishes, he will be cremated and buried at the Mandai cemetery together with other ordinary Singaporeans, instead of the Kranji War Cemetery, where people of his stature are usually buried.</blockquote></div>
