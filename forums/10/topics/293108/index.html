            <div class='col-md body'>I think for a President with only ceremonial duties and no powers like what we have in our system, the President can play a role of maintaining political stability in a psychological way.<br><br>Because, our President says nothing and does nothing and do not make decisions or carry out policies, he does not offend people or piss people off.<br><br>A prime ministers says and does things that very often causes people to become highly agitated and frustrated and du lan. For example, this way alone 2007, our PM has carried out a string of unpopular policies that many people despise.<br><br>If the current President is a charming and popular one, as the ceremonial head of state, he can at least offer some sort of psychological relief to the people.<br><br>In short, there is at least a public figure that people respect in difficult times.<br><br>That is my view.</div>
