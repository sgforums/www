              <p>Well, someone has to plan long term right? It is not difficult to convert to a citizen</p>
              <p>Conversion to PR is fast. Then within another 2 or 3 years, they can convert to citizenship.</p>
              <p>Within a 5 year cycle, they can easily bring 'create' tens of thousands of new citizens.</p>

              <p>Singapore's system is very hierachical. In the civil service,
                      your cert determines your path for life (that is if u stay civil

              <p>If u ITE guy, more or less condemned to lower rungs of society.
                      Likewise the poly chaps are always second fiddle to uni grads
                      unless u do professions like sales. Even the uni grads are facing

                      Better make your dough elsewhere like the many of us here. Just go
                      to the Sgporeans overseas forums, we are all over the world. From
                      US to Asia to Europe.</p>

              <p>There's a sizeable population of Singaporeans in my part of USA. Some of those I know are division chiefs, CIOs, top consultants etc, people who hold high positions in USA. I fly the Singapore flag high in my organization. People in my organization have a good impression of the Singaporeans they encounter.</p>
              <p>That's why I hate it when the Govt keep telling me that my fellow countrymen are stupid, and so need more foreign labor. And I especially hate it when Singaporeans, brainwashed by the Govt (like the dinosaur here that keeps singing his agreement of the govt policies), actually believe it, and propagate such untruths to others.</p>
              <p>PS: <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>I have never heard of another country that continuously de-moralizes, and demeans its own people. In other countries, making such comments would have resulted in the politicians getting kicked out in the next elections.</strong></span> Only in Singapore do we have such a strange situation...</p>

              <p>I am going to also add in one comment about the dumb dinosaur here.</p>
              <p>There are people who go overseas, and find themselves unable to adapt, and end up having to go back with their tail between their legs. And then, there are those who go on holidays in other countries, and then believe they have seen it all to make immature comments about those who work and live overseas.</p>
              <p>sgdiehard is one of these people. The way he speaks ill of people who made it good overseas just smells of sour grapes all over.</p>
              <p>If you want to talk about someone who wants to go back to Singapore after making it big overseas, look no further than forumer Lionoasis, who has spent more than 10 years overseas in many countries, and has made it, and now intends to go back to Singapore as he feels Singapore ultimately is the place he wants to be in. I respect his views.</p>
              <p>For me, I too have plans to go back to Singapore, once I have earned enough to retire. However, I wonder if Singapore will have lost its identity with the blatant influx of foreigners by then.</p>

              <p>hi guys</p>
              <p>just a few observations and perspectives or consideration when discuss this topics.</p>
              <p>1) First of all Singapore is not the center of the world so people who move to SG really don't have to conformed to Singapore way of lifestyles and thinking.</p>
              <p>2) It is a natural evolutions that after 5 decades of peaceful co-exist in SG, we basically grew up in that enviornment and it helps to substain us as a population. Therefore, there is a tendency to maintain status quo.</p>
              <p>3) it is also true that SG is a freaking small island. One of the world most crowded island per sq ft. where basic housing, jobs and food become an issued  </p>
              <p>4) Current movement of people is a global event not restricted to SG  or within Asia.</p>
              <p>5) It is true that not all foreigners who worked in SG will stayed in SG but some will stayed and become Singaporean.</p>
              <p>6) it is also true that we elected the same political party for the last 45 years thru our own enclosure of minds.  (subjective but They have become self serving. )</p>
              <p>7) it is also true that Singaporean are also subjected to foreign competitions both individual and businesses from other nations. To block off these competition means to limit us having the abilities to compete.</p>
              <p>8) It is also true that went you call a place home/ home country you expect certain degree of social security shared ideas. such as "home" "familar friends"  believes systems and cultures... etc.</p>
              <p> 9) the World is over crowded.</p>
              <p>Last and i think it is important.....</p>
              <p>10) recognizing Change is the only constant..........so probably managed these changes are importance to Singapore social Contract. </p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Study had shown that peoples living in close proxminty and crowded places tends to get high anxiety, hypertension and tempermental reaction to all things, that is why i see most Singaporeans are very stressed with lots of mental illness that most did not seek  medical attention leading to high chances of old age neuron impairment, resulting in Azhemier and Dementia illness, and most went on undetected or simply refuse to admit that they have this illness in them. For the youngers, most get pre mature hypertension illness such as high blood, kidney problem, erectile dyfunction and workholic illnesses.

              <p>In comparing to people who lives in more open and sparing places, they are more cool and enjoy life better, just like me.

              <p>With this note, perhap, the locals can argue with their govt that health, be it mental or other chronical illness is a big problem if govt keep increasing the population here just for the sake of economy and social aspect. For example, if i will to pose a question to a minister if he/she said that we increase immigrant because of social population diminishing and aging and also for our economy at stake, i would had asked him/her, do you consider healthy living as a social aspect, do you know that living in close proximnity and crowded places is no good for health??</p>

              <p>no, there are 2 types of changes, one is call restructuring, the other re- engineering</p>
              <p>Let me give u example for better understanding,</p>
              <p>U take a piece of paper, fold it into an aeroplane, then you unfold it and fold again to another shape of some kind of aeroplane, this is call restructuring, the paper still remain, but the shape had changed. The chinese said "change the soup but never change the ingredients". And this type of changes is what Singapore is having, you can see so much changes in Singapore, but the govt remain the same. This is called restructuring</p>
              <p>Now, you take the piece of the same paper you folded, tear it into peices and throw it away, then you take a new piece of paper and start doing your folding again, this is called Re engineering, a complete change of everything. To change the govt is called a re engineering change.</p>
