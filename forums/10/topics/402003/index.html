              <p><br>Same. Earning as much $$$ from USA as I can. But coming here is not easy. I had to fight past a few thousand global candidates to get to my position.</p>
              <p>You cannot blame the foreigners. Human beings flock to where they can make a living. The easier it is to flock to that place, the bigger the no. of foreigners.</p>
              <p>The anger and dis-satisfaction should be directed at the govt, and not at the foreigner on the streets.</p>

              <div class="art-PostContent">
              <p><strong>By Lawrence Pek</strong></p>
              <p>Clearly, there has been a lot of unhappiness on the grounds with the huge influx of foreigners into Singapore in the last 18 to 24 months, even though PM Lee has addressed this issue (well, sort of), I would like to dwell further with a deeper analysis of certain repercussions of these misguided policies.</p>
              <p>Value Added – Currently, clearly we have many foreigners in the service sectors, from 7-11 to waitresses to masseurs. The quality of Foreigners is both unclear and not scrutinized. Are they doing work that Singaporeans cannot do (special skills, experience or relationships) – or just competition with locals for local jobs (hawker centre, petrol kiosks and 7-11).</p>
              <p>Cheap vs. Cheaper – Even though it is true that foreigners are willing to accept cheaper salaries, please consider 2 things in the long run:</p>
              <p>1.     Will they continue to accept the same low wages in 3 to 5 years? They will not, for 2 simple reasons – if they 30% cheaper than the local Singaporeans now, they will want to price themselves 5 to 10% cheaper than a local Singaporeans, these foreigners are not stupid, they want to be “cheaper” and not simply just “cheap”</p>
              <p>2.     What will the government do about the high unemployment rate for the local that was displaced? e.g. If you bring in a cheaper 25 years old PRC girl to work in 7-11 to replace a 35 year old Singaporean woman (or man) – then what will he or she do, once she or he is replaced? Can that local find a higher valued job (higher salary with higher function) – Isn’t it clear that MOM just created a problem by doing this?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Structural Unemployment:</strong></p>
              <p>Please allow me to use this to clarify pt 2, this comes about rarely, but it is a bitch to handle for any Minister of Manpower. Simply, there is a job mismatch – there are plenty of job vacancies to go about, but the quality of the people simply cannot perform what these jobs require…the market has changed and companies now require skills and knowledge workers in very specific or niche or high (high is not niche) areas. Then there is a clear and definite for that company to import foreign talent in order to perform the tasks at hand. But locally, MOM and MOE need to look at re-training and re-educating the local manpower to perform these task.</p>
              <p>Why? The reason is one of valued added and sustainability. If MOM and MOE can realize that there are no short cuts to structural unemployment, then they need to bite the bullet to retrain locals, because the locals stays and with a higher skilled workforce, Singapore as an economy will be more cutting edge and more competitive.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>What happens when the Music Stops?</strong></p>
              <p>With 36% foreigners now in Singapore, regardless of whether they are PRs or even New Citizens – will they be there when the going gets tough in Singapore or will they leave for their homeland (China, India, Vietnam…). Singapore is NOT HOME, they WILL LEAVE and then WHAT DO WE DO?</p>
              <p>Who will fill the void and what will happen to our economy? There is a further perspective, if you have a small group of 100 and 10 leave, the 90 people should be able to cover and manage, but if you have a group of 10,000 and 1,000 leaves (same 10%), the balance 9,000 cannot and will not want to cover and manage the gap.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>The Brain Drain issue</strong></p>
              <p>This is not a new phenomenon; there are many Singaporeans (even though they keep their passports) who will never come back here. Artists, Musicians, Scientists and lastly, people like myself, self-made business men. I have so many friends now in US, Europe and China now, they simply will not come back anymore; their reply is very simple, Singapore no longer provides the environment for their (or their kids) development. Their value in these foreign countries is higher than in Singapore. They already feel there is no more reason, no more space for them to come back anymore. Given the new demographics in their homeland now, I doubt if any of them are inclined to ever come back.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
              <p>In summary, the key message that I would like to convey is that of Sustainability – Yes, it is true that the local bred and born has 2 main issues, which is driving the influx of foreigners. We are not willing to breed, and we are no longer as hardworking or have higher expectations in terms of our employment benefits.</p>
              <p>However, we cannot take the short cut route and look at the short terms benefits in terms of GDP growth. Rather than bringing the foreigners and creating a unstable society (trust me, there are many pissed off people), why is it that we cannot bite the bullet and try to brain storm ideas to increase birth rates, to control wages for locals.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, it is true that I am not a full time labor officer at MOM, so I am not privy to lots of internal discussions or data, which I am sure, has led our urban planners to decide on the current course of actions. However, I do not think that I am wrong in my assessment above and I do would like an opportunity to be proven wrong.</p>
              <p>As a last word, to these scholars and ministers, I would like to implore your better judgments on 2 fronts. Please trust us to understand your predicament and we will do our best to understand the issues, which we understand is our issues, anyway. Please do not be so insecure in your policy making, talk to us and make us understand, we are your people and responsibility.</p>

              <p><br>Not to mention the poor gender differentiation,</p>
              <p>as a businesswoman, i look at it in a way that cheap labour belongs to the foreigners, just like when Britain or France were in their heydays, all the lower works were done by cheap foreign negro or from poorer countries. Singaporean should therefore take up the knowledge and global economy toward the upper level jobs, given the extensive Sg budget in training and skilling, we should push locals to excellent rather than allowing them to continue taking up lower level jobs, which in a way, had gone to cheap foreign labourers. You have to move the cheese.</p>
              <p>A good businesswoman will alway try in one way or the other upgrade the locals to become supervisors, managers or senior peoples, and leave the dirty, dangerous and sweating jobs to the cheap foreigners. As such, we are able to tap the economic of scale from cheap labour and yet, gives our locals a higher paid, higher authority and of course higher responsibilities.</p>
              <p>But sad to say that many locals are still dwelling in a well that is getting warmer, they want higher paid, good working condition, high authority, but dun want to take responsibilities.</p>
