              <p>I'm in Indonesia because I can offer the country what locals cannot. On the contrary, there are many foreigners in Sg stealing local jobs because they are cheaper.</p>
              <p>It's funny that just because I have permanent residence in Indo, I'm obligated to fight for them. Hahaha, very laughable cos even the chinese who have made it rich here will have no intention to defend the land when attacked.</p>
              <p>I'm here to suck the country's money, cos why? I contribute to their economy, I'm needed here, so I've got every right to do so.</p>

              <p>You mention about fight for your host countries....i'm not sure these days conventional war between nations mean anything typically it take 3rd generations to fully adopt Full identity of the host country. It make it even more acute  with the current movement of people globally.</p>
              <p>I think eventual human conflict is going to be for Causes or Ideas more national identity. War on Terror brings out contradiction more than ever it cut thru national boundaries.</p>
              <p>I think the notion that we bring in closer ethnicity may not solve the national identity problems but rather shared ideas and values are much better forged.</p>

              <p>Agree, closer ethnicity may not, in fact, it does not, solve the national identity problems, but it is easier than people with diverse ethnicities.  Today we are not talking about the chinese from PRC, or the indian, sri lankan, there are also philippinos, myanmese, indonesian. We must also recognize that the chinese from taiwan, HK, malaysia, indonesia are different, even among the chinese in singapore, there are english and chinese speaking. and from india, there are hindi and tamil.  emphasizing ethnicity definitely does not help in forging national identity.</p>
              <p>also agree with you that we need to forge a national identity based on shared ideas and values. What are our values? imho, we are appreciative of people who contribute to our nation and society, regardless of their ethnicity, or when did they land themselves here; we are tolerant to differences in races and religion; we call singapore our home, even though there are greener pastures outside.</p>
              <p>all these bashing, cursing, bitching, moaning about FT, are not values of singapore.</p>

              <p>I am not talking about intergrating into the local communities. Canada, oz and the us are so big, you don't really need to intergrate like living like an angmoh, except when you live in cities. you can live in china town of san fransco for months, a life that is more of a chinese than in singapore, without knowing how to speak english. Go to the shopping mall called aberdeen in richmond, vancouver, you will hear announcement in cantonese and mandarin, no english, and you can hardly see a caucasian in the area.</p>
              <p>But, will the people there call their new country HOME? do they hold the american green card just for convenience, and give up when they have to declare all their assets in HK to the US government for tax purposes. how many are still holding on to their singapore, or malaysian passports after years living there, just in case?</p>
              <p>I feel very proud being singaporean when I met many singaporean who hold on to their singaporean identity, but when people come here and bash the new immigrants who are contributing to the local economy, doing jobs that nobody want to do, I find these singaporean double standard, and hypocrite.</p>
              <p>worse, there are nuts who think that singaporean must speak english, so the PRC who cannot speak proper english cannot be singaporean.</p>

              <p>The problem with Singpore's foreign labor policy is that they are bringing people in to contribute what the locals can do, and in doing so, steal jobs from the locals.

              <p>A foreign talent receives pay that is equivalent or more than the $$$ that a local talent earns in that country. A foreign talent that goes to another country to work does not take lower pay. Otherwise, THAT is not a foreign talent, BUT foreign labor.</p>
              <p>The pay I receive here is in the top bracket of American pay. I am not being paid lower than an American, otherwise, I am NOT a foreign talent here, but foreign labor.</p>
              <p>Another thing is, you keep mentioning Singaporeans are expensive. What is your basis of comparison? Do you even understand the differences in costs of living between countries? Do you not understand that due to our cost of living, Singaporeans can never accept a pay lower than those foreign labor?</p>
