              <p>I would say that FTs are never that loyal to their home country.</p>
              <p>1) If they are that loyal to their home country - why should they even 'betray' their home country and come to a foreign land to make money? They should have find ways and means to improve their home country should they be that loyal.</p>
              <p>I would say they're selfish. For their own gain and interest, they come to Singapore and make money. They are neither loyal nor  'faithful'. However, that apply to some FTs, not all.</p>
              <p>I agree that some FT are here in Singapore to earn money only however I would beg to differ that not all FTs are like that.</p>
              <p>Imagine a poor farmer boy in China, he attends school and make his way to the top (in term of academic). He wanted to improve the life of his and his family hence he finds work opportunities in Singapore.</p>
              <p>He comes to Singapore to work and earn money. And here we are .. Singaporeans .. complaining ..</p>
              <p>It's a win-win situation. We need talents but they're not for FREE. Hence we pay them and offer them jobs. SHOULD SINGAPOREANS have that 'talent' - we don't even need to 'import' them.</p>
              <p>However, Singaporeans DO have talents .. but we DEMAND too much. Should we be that humble like those FTs - take small pays at a time and get promoted etc .. those money will come to you naturally .. </p>
              <p>In short, Singapore 'talent' workers are EXPENSIVE. </p>
              <p>See, there are other COUNTRIES in the world that offer a even HIGHER pay for these foreign talents but WHY ARE THEY NOT IMPORTING THEM???</p>
              <p>Think about it. </p>
              <p>I am talking about the upper FTs - not construction workers etc.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There are cons to importing too much FTs here though .. </p>

              <p>I am not talking about intergrating into the local communities.
              Canada, oz and the us are so big, you don't really need to
              intergrate like living like an angmoh, except when you live in
              cities. you can live in china town of san fransco for
              months, a life that is more of a chinese than in
              singapore, without knowing how to speak english. Go to the
              shopping mall called aberdeen in richmond, vancouver, you will hear
              announcement in cantonese and mandarin, no english, and you can
              hardly see a caucasian in the area.</p>
              <p>But, will the people there call their new country HOME? do
              they hold the american green card just for convenience, and give up
              when they have to declare all their assets in HK to the US
              government for tax purposes. how many are still holding
              on to their singapore, or malaysian passports after years
              living there, just in case?</p>
              <p>I feel very proud being singaporean when I met many singaporean
              who hold on to their singaporean identity, but when people come
              here and bash the new immigrants who are contributing to the local
              economy, doing jobs that nobody want to do, I find these
              singaporean double standard, and hypocrite.</p>
              <p>worse, there are nuts who think that singaporean must speak
              english, so the PRC who cannot speak proper english cannot be
              singaporean.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Like what you said: Canada, the Oz and USA are big countries, compare it with Singapore. Can we afford that kind of situation as mentioned in your example, where a Chinese can live in China town of San Francisco without the ability to speak and understand English here in Singapore? That's why foreigners have to integrate into our community.</p>
              <p>Is there any statistic for the number of Singaporeans still holding to their SG passports when they had lived in another country for years? Not counting those living in exile for obvious reasons.</p>
              <p>Yes, we all feel proud to be citizens of Singapore but let's face it PAP had opened the floodgates without control and label FTs and FWs under one term "FTs"</p>
              <p>Yes, there are FWs who are contributing to the local
              economy doing <strong>jobs that nobody want to do</strong>. Note these are FWs not FTs and the government kept justifying the influx of FWs by hiding it under the term "FTs".</p>
              <p>What are the jobs that nobody want to do? Let's take cleaner for an example, shall we?</p>
              <p>Sure you can employ a FW because it's assumed locals wouldn't want to be one isn't it? But think about it, the government had raised the age limit for one to retire isn't it? So what happened to the elderly who are out of a job at their age? Some of them would gladly take up the cleaner job as long as they have an income isn't it?</p>
              <p>So is being a cleaner a job that locals doesn't want or is it assumed to be?</p>
              <p>I remember an MP once said there was a problem in his ward about a cleaner who is not performing well in his/her job and what did he do? He hired a FW...I guess that said a lot of thing by his action.</p>
              <p>For your last point, our first language is English isn't it? Unless you're telling me that PRC will only encounter Singaporean Chinese for the rest of his/her life here, if not I hope he/she is improving his/her English skills by taking a English language course.</p>
              <p>I'm okay with people who speak broken English provided it's understandable.</p>

              <p>this may not be true for all foreigners and FT, as some
              willingly gave up their citizens to migrate to Singapore for good.
              but the some are very rare and in the minority. I believe most
              foreigners come to singapore to earn as much money as they could
              and then return to their home country, so dun expect any loyalty

              <p>you can see so many PRC's people coming to singapore to work,
              because of the high exchange rate. if they saved SGD 10K in

              <p>I don't think you even truly understand what a Foreign Talent
                  means</p>
              <p>A foreign talent receives pay that is equivalent or more than
                  the $$$ that a local talent earns in that country. A foreign talent
                  that goes to another country to work does not take lower pay.
                  Otherwise, THAT is not a foreign talent, BUT foreign labor.</p>
              <p>The pay I receive here is in the top bracket of American pay. I
                  am not being paid lower than an American, otherwise, I am NOT a
                  foreign talent here, but foreign labor.</p>
              <p>Another thing is, you keep mentioning Singaporeans are
                  expensive. What is your basis of comparison? Do you even understand
                  the differences in costs of living between countries? Do you not
                  understand that due to our cost of living, Singaporeans can never
                  accept a pay lower than those foreign labor?</p>

              <p>I admit that I don't know everything.</p>
              <p>I also believe that you may have misunderstood my 'Farmer Analogy' .. Sorry about that but the key point is this : To agree with the TS that Foreigners and FT are in Singapore to earn money only. </p>
              <p>The below is my basis for 'Singaporeans are generally more expensive'</p>
              <p>"A worker in Singapore will cost $1000 per month or more, but there is a bountiful stream of workers in China who will gladly work for $100 per month ... that is why we should lower our wage costs." - Labour chief Lim Boon Heng, Straits Times, June 17 2002</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I understand the difference in terms of 'Cost of living'. I lived in Sydney,Australia for a period of 3 months and Canada , Toronto for a period of a year.</p>
              <p>In Sydney, you buy a 'MyMulti 1' ticket which will cost about $50SGD for an adult. </p>
              <p>It's valid for a period of a week. Let's not compare about the distance from A to B etc.</p>
              <p>Transportation itself is expensive there</p>
              <p>A coke cost about $4SGD in Coles.</p>
              <p>It's true that Singaporeans can never accept any pay lower than a foreign labor but look again .. </p>
              <p>Can we say that the Foreign Labors aren't living well in Singapore? I am sure they're living happily and leading a  simple life in Singapore and perhaps 3/4 HDB Flat. </p>
              <p>What I am getting on is this ... they work for a cheaper pay in Singapore - but to compare it back to their home country - it's considered a 'high pay' for them. They can use the money earned to feed for themselves and even to send some money back home etc .. </p>
              <p>As an employer - you get a cheaper worker / X2 hardworking than a Singaporean. And I strongly believe in working hard and working smart to get a promotion. Hence .. who's likely to get promoted and eventually have their pay increase?</p>
              <p>Say in a sales person in XYZ Shopping Centre.</p>
              <p>Foreign Labor earn : $500 per month</p>
              <p>S'pore Worker: $700 per month</p>
              <p>Foreign Labor because of hardwork and 'smart work' - get promoted as compared to that S'pore worker .. (promoted to a sales manager/supervisor)</p>
              <p>Hence his pay will increase to a 'cheaper' Supervisor fee range. Therefore he gets a FASTER promotion than that Singaporean.</p>
              <p>Hence .. it's not whether Singaporeans can accept a lower wages but whether they see the big picture behind it and not chasing the 5 'C's at the 'wrong time'.</p>
              <p>And I don't think that 'low wages' will be of that much different. that's IMHO</p>
              <p>Like today's news .. in China .. factory workers are demanding for a higher pay - they go on strike. Foxconn's workers commited suicide because of terrible working hours and low pay.</p>
              <p>What does these reality tells us ?? </p>
              <p>These poor workers aka labors got to go elsewhere to another country to earn more money. </p>
              <p>Talking about  Foreign Talent.</p>
              <p>They definitely got more experience in term of 'looking outside the world' as compared to a Singaporean. In Chinese proverbs : A frog in a well .. and that frog is us. </p>
              <p>I am not pro-FTs and I am a 101% Singaporean. I agree with the doings of the government. </p>
              <p>There are CONS in all these plans but looking at the PROS - it will benefit Singapore as a whole nation and not individual/sectors in the working world.</p>

              <p>However noting that Singapore is the best in Education / etc .. Foreigners move to Singapore because of the benefits .. for their future.. or even so .. to escape natural disaster etc ..</p>

              <p>"A worker in Singapore will cost $1000 per month or more, but there is a bountiful stream of workers in China who will gladly work for $100 per month ... that is why we should lower our wage costs." - Labour chief Lim Boon Heng, Straits Times, June 17 2002</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I understand the difference in terms of 'Cost of living'. I lived in Sydney,Australia for a period of 3 months and Canada , Toronto for a period of a year.</p>
              <p>In Sydney, you buy a 'MyMulti 1' ticket which will cost about $50SGD for an adult. </p>
              <p>It's valid for a period of a week. Let's not compare about the distance from A to B etc.</p>
              <p>Transportation itself is expensive there</p>
              <p>A coke cost about $4SGD in Coles.</p>
              <p>It's true that Singaporeans can never accept any pay lower than a foreign labor but look again .. </p>
              <p>Can we say that the Foreign Labors aren't living well in Singapore? I am sure they're living happily and leading a  simple life in Singapore and perhaps 3/4 HDB Flat. </p>
              <p>What I am getting on is this ... they work for a cheaper pay in Singapore - but to compare it back to their home country - it's considered a 'high pay' for them. They can use the money earned to feed for themselves and even to send some money back home etc .. </p>
              <p>As an employer - you get a cheaper worker / X2 hardworking than a Singaporean. And I strongly believe in working hard and working smart to get a promotion. Hence .. who's likely to get promoted and eventually have their pay increase?</p>
              <p>Say in a sales person in XYZ Shopping Centre.</p>
              <p>Foreign Labor earn : $500 per month</p>
              <p>S'pore Worker: $700 per month</p>
              <p>Foreign Labor because of hardwork and 'smart work' - get promoted as compared to that S'pore worker .. (promoted to a sales manager/supervisor)</p>
              <p>Hence his pay will increase to a 'cheaper' Supervisor fee range. Therefore he gets a FASTER promotion than that Singaporean.</p>
              <p>Hence .. it's not whether Singaporeans can accept a lower wages but whether they see the big picture behind it and not chasing the 5 'C's at the 'wrong time'.</p>
              <p>And I don't think that 'low wages' will be of that much different. that's IMHO</p>
              <p>Like today's news .. in China .. factory workers are demanding for a higher pay - they go on strike. Foxconn's workers commited suicide because of terrible working hours and low pay.</p>
              <p>What does these reality tells us ?? </p>
              <p>These poor workers aka labors got to go elsewhere to another country to earn more money. </p>
              <p>Talking about  Foreign Talent.</p>
              <p>They definitely got more experience in term of 'looking outside the world' as compared to a Singaporean. In Chinese proverbs : A frog in a well .. and that frog is us. </p>
              <p>I am not pro-FTs and I am a 101% Singaporean. I agree with the doings of the government. </p>
              <p>There are CONS in all these plans but looking at the PROS - it will benefit Singapore as a whole nation and not individual/sectors in the working world.</p>

              <p>i will disagree..</p>
              <p>firstly : sporeans are "protected"  by the employment act, in the past for some sectors i know benefits were given to offset the low pay.</p>
              <p>secondly at present please ask around those sectors who those people work before for 20years the policies then and now..you will notice something..the pay changes little, but most of the benefits is gone, add salt to the wound, rising cost of living..no matter how i see it. i don't see the way that they do it is a pro.</p>
              <p>lastly sporeans for some are not choosy, but as proof i would like to ask you if you are willing to take a job here but at 1/3 or 2/3 the pay you had overseas? i believe you would say yes if you were single, but what about those married and having 1 or more kids with a HDB flat? have you ever thought of that angle?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i am also like you a 101% singaporean, served my 2 yrs full time NS, my 10 years reservist, been there seen thru the changes here got bad to worse.</p>
              <p>the only thing is i cannot imagine how much more worse it will get, but i know more will come.</p>
              <p>also is it also a pro when ministers pay and officers of the govt sector get pay rise but the rank and file workers there don't?</p>

              <p>No one knows everything. I am the top in my domain, and I do not fear any other nationalities like the Chinese, Indians, Europeans, etc, for they are at most my equals. But I do not know everything.</p>
              <p>The only sad thing about your posting above, is that you quote a minister that has no achievements to substantiate the point that Chinese  work for $100 per month, whereas Singaporeans work for $1000 per month.</p>
              <p>Again, you are trapped in the vicious cycle of listening to the govt's ramblings about how we must squeeze our locals, because the Chinese work for $100.</p>
              <p>Let me tell you, if that's really the case, why then are locals in other countries doing well? Why then are locals in other countries earning a pay that is way higher than our pay in similar positions? If the minister whom you quote is so right, then why then other countries not face the same problems as we have now?</p>
              <p>The truth is, it's our policies that are killing us. It's our govt's short-sightedness, and lack of judgement in deciding some focal points for our economy, that is killing us.</p>
              <p>We aspire to be the hub of all hubs, but we are nothing but a confused hub. We don't have much of a competitive advantage against other upcoming countries, because we cannot even decide what we want to focus on, and end up dumping money in all directions, achieving little in the global arena. Even our great Temasek bled and lost so much of our hard earned money. As Jim Rogers said, the 'talents' in our great Temasek are nothing but idiots.</p>
              <p>And because we don't have any focal points, the only thing our govt come out with, is how to squeeze wages so that we continue to remain affordable to attract investments. But given the rising cost of living, this is getting more and more impossible to do.</p>
              <p>As I mentioned, giving companies here free access to cheap labor results in killing innovation.</p>
              <p>But you know what is the saddest thing of all?</p>
              <p>It's not our govt, but my fellow countrymen, who continue to vote for the PAP, even when life is getting harder for them. My fellow countrymen, who allow PAP leaders to humiliate them on the media, and yet continue to vote for the PAP. Outside of Singapore, Singaporeans are ranked among the top in productivity, but back home, you hear nothing but insults from our leaders about how lousy our people are.</p>
              <p>The ones that I think should be condemned are not those that believe blindly in the propaganda of the PAP, but those who complain about them, yet in the end, vote for the PAP because (1) they are afraid to vote otherwise, (2) they hope someone else takes the responsibility of protesting against the PAP, (3) couldn't care less.</p>
              <p>It's precisely these people, that will condemn Singapore to a living hell. Working outside of Singapore only strengthens my view that in 20-30 years time, (1) people will end up jobless at 40, (2) there will no longer be any identity as a Singaporean because of the blatant influx of foreign labor, (3) society will start to break apart due to the rising number of unemployed.</p>
              <p>I feel sad, but at least I have moved out to become a foreign talent and not just a local talent. I do not need to depend on anyone, as I have enough to provide for myself and my loved ones. And I will do my part come elections, but I have little faith in my fellow countrymen.</p>

              <p>Yes, we sgporeans shouldnt demand too much because polytechnic pay 10 years ago averaged about $1500. Today, it is still about the same. University pay also averaged about $2500 then and today it hasnt changed much. I mean what are HDB prices? They only incread 2 fold, GST shot up to only 7%....so yes...I agree we shouldnt demand too much.</p>
              <p>Does not matter if our engineer, lawyer, businessmen friends are earning so much more in other countries but we are still cheap hunting ground for MNCs. Does not matter too if other foreigners can come in and depress our wages too because without them, we wouldnt even have jobs! lol</p>

              <p>well the secret is I believe is that at the rate the malays reproduce, the chinese population will decrease significantly from the majority of 77% in the long term. I mean...the govt is not stupid right? They know that they are bringing in a lot of those who can do our work and cause us to be jobless. So what do they do? They try to create more employment to neutralise the cons with ideas such as the IRs and casinos.</p>
              <p>And it also helps pro-MNC singapore cos these foreign companies are always on the lookout for cheap, albeit skilled and language proficient labour.</p>

              <p>Yes, we all feel proud to be citizens of Singapore but let's face it PAP had opened the floodgates without control and label FTs and FWs under one term "FTs"</p>
              <p>Yes, there are FWs who are contributing to the local economy doing <strong>jobs that nobody want to do</strong>. Note these are FWs not FTs and the government kept justifying the influx of FWs by hiding it under the term "FTs".</p>
              <p>What are the jobs that nobody want to do? Let's take cleaner for an example, shall we?</p>
              <p>Sure you can employ a FW because it's assumed locals wouldn't want to be one isn't it? But think about it, the government had raised the age limit for one to retire isn't it? So what happened to the elderly who are out of a job at their age? Some of them would gladly take up the cleaner job as long as they have an income isn't it?</p>
              <p>So is being a cleaner a job that locals doesn't want or is it assumed to be?</p>
              <p>I remember an MP once said there was a problem in his ward about a cleaner who is not performing well in his/her job and what did he do? He hired a FW...I guess that said a lot of thing by his action.</p>
              <p>For your last point, our first language is English isn't it? Unless you're telling me that PRC will only encounter Singaporean Chinese for the rest of his/her life here, if not I hope he/she is improving his/her English skills by taking a English language course.</p>
              <p>I'm okay with people who speak broken English provided it's understandable.</p>

              <p>Yes, in singapore we do need people to integrate, but we don't expect the mandarin speaking chinese, the tamil speaking indian, and the malays to integrate into one english speaking people whom we think is the only type of singaporean.</p>
              <p>Singapore is a multi racial, multi cultural, multi religious, society, we should accept the difference. If you read the opinions on the weightage on psle chinese in the lianhe zhaobao and the straits times, you will see that there are still big difference between opinion on the importance of mother tongue and first language. I have gone past the argument on whether everybody should speak english in singapore, or laughing at people who call themselves chinese but don't know how to speak chinese.</p>
              <p>Is there any statistic for the number of Singaporeans still holding to their SG passports when they had lived in another country for years? well, I don't have statistics. I get my impression from people I met in these places, actually, after talking to them, I concluded that singapore is still the best place for me, hahahaha. ask the people who are overseas here! talk so much but they themselves are also modern nomad, go where there is greener grass.</p>
              <p>the double standard is that these modern nomad landed in america, they think they had gone to heaven, and start pointing fingers at other nomad who landed in singapore. Hypocrite!</p>
              <p>I won't want to debate with you on the FT issues, but I also think that many who debate on this issue is taking a simplistic approach by put the blame on the government, and the FT of a particular ethnicity. We forget about the role of the employers, the MNC, the foreign companies, they are the one who want to employ the foreigners instead of the locals, they are the one who apply to the government to bring in this FT. You should also look at the different industries, some industries like the construction industries, they are really in need of workers, the service industries are bringing in thousands of philippinos. Who are the one who got laid off before 50s? the MNC. So, there is a lot more to learn on this issue. those who just cpcb, waste time.</p>
              <p>have a good day. </p>

              <p>well the secret is I believe is that at the rate the malays

              the majority of 77% in the long term. I mean...the govt is not
              stupid right? They know that they are bringing in a lot of those
              who can do our work and cause us to be jobless. So what do they do?
              They try to create more employment to neutralise the cons with
              ideas such as the IRs and casinos.</p>
              <p>And it also helps pro-MNC singapore cos these foreign companies
