            <div class='col-md body'><br><blockquote>Quote:<br>Originally Posted by limboonhee View Post<br>I am outraged that all the local banks have resorted to dubious underhanded methods to boost their profits such as forcing high annual-fee, exorbitant interest rates unsecured credit lines on to unsuspecting customers using the opt-out scam. They are emulating the success of the opt-out strategies such as organ donation. It is sickening to have to waste time calling up to cancel what you did not sign for and worse, these day-light robbers have the cheek to charge interest on non-payment of the $50-80 annual fee for these unasked for credit lines. Bank consumers are screaming for better protection from these scheming unscupulous marketing techniques the local banks are employing. As far as I am concerned I do not trust any of the banks anymore whenever they accost me in public places like soliciting prostitutes or steal my handphone number to harass me on some stupid unsolicited products. Of course the finer print and risks are not highlighted to you. The credibility of local banks is zilch!! This is from a very very angry Singporean.</blockquote>This disease of government using its legalistic power to get what it wants as demonstrating in the organ donation "Opt out" scam and "benchmarking of ministers' salaries" to a few lucky CEOs as if all CEOs are paid such salaries is simply overwhelmingly and invitingly tasty for the biggie banks and other monopolies to emulate for financial success.<br><br>The same habit is being engaged in by many credit card companies now - too late to stop it seems with justification by many government's own policies and action on such matter. That is why the judge in Alpha has to concede to SIA pilots' claims to boost their salaries by similar benchmarking against some other salaries irrespective of appointment contracts based on supply and demand which should be the current salary increments/bonus practices.<br><br>How lucky some CEOs of GLCs are now that so many GLCs for doing a standard bill collector job will now be able to reward themselves by similar benchmarking exercises not available to ordinary workers in the private sector at all who do not even get to emulate NWC increment quantum liberally granted to the civil servants.<br><br>I had to call up Citibank to query one charge to my credit card for phone order of insurance which just because of a phone-call made to me some three years back was continuously charged to and paid by me without my knowledge without going through the usual proposal and acceptance formality or annual re-verification of status. So many hidden assumptions such as excess clauses and exclusions were made that one wonders if one is buying any insurance at all.<br><br>I wrote to Citibank pointing out that it is wrong to charge me in this manner with copy to MAS. There was no reply to date but I was given a voucher of S$50 apparently to calm my disquiet over the matter.</div>
