              <p>Whether you are looking at moving to Taiwan to work, or retire, you will be interested in the Taiwanese economy. The government has achieved amazing growth of around 8% a year over a period of thirty years, known as the Taiwanese Miracle. Both inflation and unemployment are under control and the country has a strong economy internationally. <br><br><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">The largest sector of the economy by GDP is the service sector, which accounts for nearly 75% of GDP.</span></strong> The sector is dominated by the technology industry, and it is one of the worlds largest computer and electronics designers and manufacturers, producing LCD Panel displays, Silicon Chips, computer networking equipment and consumer electronics goods. <br><br>Taiwan has a unique corporate ethos. Rather than encouraging large companies, the Taiwanese prefer to split a company into seperate, smaller companies if it they consider it has become too large. This strategy allows Taiwanese companies to remain highly flexible and enables an incredibly fast response to customer requirements. Partly due to this continued efficiency, there is a continual flow of business moving to Taiwan. The country, which controls the design of components is increasingly moving the manufacturing end of the production process to mainland China, where a growing number of Taiwanese live and work in the Taiwanese owned factories. <br><br><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>The retail sector of the economy continues to grow as the country reaps the rewards of its labor.</strong></span> The demand for high-end designer goods imported from the West is increasing, and the architecture of the city of Taipei is a product of its recent economic success. <br><br>The city of Taipei, the capital of Taiwan, and the largest city in the country, is home to some of the worlds most impressive buildings, including Taipei 101, currently the world's tallest building, with 101 floors and a height of 508 meters! <br><br>Taiwan's agriculture sector, which used to dominate the economy now accounts for less than 3% of GDP, mainly in rice, sugar and vegetables. <br><br>Around 3 million people visit Taiwan each year, and the government is trying to increase tourism to its many destinations. The country offers not only the urban, with shopping in Taipei in the many malls, including in the Taipei 101 building, but also large areas of mountainous countryside, and outdoor activities to rival any country. In addition to the mainland there are many beautiful outlying islands, like turtle island, so called due to its shape (like a turtle lying in the ocean) where wildlife thrives in an unspoilt environment. <br><br>The government is attempting to ensure Taiwan's strong economic position in the world in the future by diversifying its export market (it is currently trying to grow its European market) and developing its service sector even further, as China and other Asian countries gain shares of its more labor-intensive production work.</p>
