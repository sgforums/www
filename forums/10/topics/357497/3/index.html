              <p>Dear Mr Yap,</p>
              <p>1) I didn't say anything that links you with opposition.</p>
              <p>2) Do you vote in ppl just to oppose and monitor? Or do you want
              them in because they have solutions to the problems?</p>
              <p>3) So far I only see the problems that she brings up which is
              already known by all Singaporean. I'm actually more interested in
              solution. If you only brings out the problems without the solution,
              why bring it out in the first place :S</p>
              <p>**why would you want someone in if he/she cannot solve the
              problem? sit there shake leg and oppose?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Like what mao mao say last time: Black cat/white cat, the cat
              that catches the mouse is a good cat.</p>
              <p>If the cat can't catch any mouse, will you still want that

              PAP is GOD??!!!"</span></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">2) Why should we be screwed for 5
              years?</span></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">The civil service will still be
              there and the PAP will still be there as opposition. The courts
              will still be there, the police and the military will still be
              there.</span></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">3) The country will be better because cronyism and
              nepotism will be gone.</span></span></span></p>

              <p>Dear Mr. Yap,</p>
              <p>1) This is what you think not what I think. Please don't put words into my mouth. It has never been stated in any of my post that I think they are Gods or whatsoever with the same meaning to God.</p>
              <p>2) GE is once every 5 years. If the opposition is the government and they're not able to come out with good policies or if there's major happening around the region,  I don't see the reasons why we can't be screwed?</p>
              <p>Like what you said earlier on: "<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">The Opposition do not and cannot make policies
                                      and execute policies. That is the government's
                                      job</span>."</span></span></p>
              <p>3) Back to the question, "How much opposition is enough??" &amp; "How to go about doing it???"</p>

              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">What major happenings around the region? You have to be specific and tell us why the civil service, the foreign service, the military, would not be able to handle that.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Right now there are two opposition MPs and you are thinking of zero to 100% overnight just because you vote the opposition. That is delusional, don't you think?</span></p>
