            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Rock^Star:</div><div class="quote_body">Doesn't mean that if one studies, one has a bright future. Just look at diploma holders today in S'pore, most are stuggling to start a family.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> </div></blockquote>The one with a diploma is certainly better off than one without any qualifications.<br><br>How much you earn will obviously depend on the nature of your qualification, the demand in the market and the number of competitors you face. You must consider how much demand there is in the market for your particular skill and how many people possess that skill or can acquire it quickly.<br><br>If you have a general Arts degree from NUS and decide to work as a bank officer, you are at a disadvantage. Firstly, your skill is not specialized enough: the bank can just as well employ a Science graduate rather than you. If they need more specialized skills, they would look for an accountancy or finance grad. What do you have to offer that other grads do not? Secondly, there are many grads in the market who can compete with you for the bank job you can do. Thirdly, even if you get the job, it wouldn't be difficult to replace you with a cheaper, fresh Arts grad 10 years down the road. Of course, if you are good enough and able to distinguish yourself in the job, that's fine...just that you have to work that much harder to keep your job.<br><br>Tertiary education is a significant investment of both money and time. You have to go beyond personal interests and also consider the direction of the economy. With the IRs coming up, there will be a demand for people with experience and skills with running a casino. If I were 17 and considering a tertiary education, I might consider a course in hospitality management with a special emphasis on the gaming industry. (For example, here are some links: http://www.morrisville.edu/academics/Business/Gaming_Casino/student_stars.htm<br>http://www.easb.edu.sg/updated_pages/uwic_baihm_cm.html).<br><br>I would intern myself with various big casinos in Macau and Las Vegas. When the IRs come online, I would be well-placed to find a job there and it is well-known that casinos pay well. There will be few in Singapore who have the kind of specialized skill in casino management and whoever gets there first will have a better chance of landing the job.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>Over the holiday with frds, there r 3 suggestions which might help 2 prevent the similiar tragedy as follows:<br><br>1 To set up an  assistance poor bank with all workling ppls invest in  this bank to lend $ to the really poor with the lowest interest rates in Spore.<br><br>2. To set up a co-ordination  body, any outstanding bills be it electrial/water and school fees for more than 6 months must send them to the said org to investigate into the reasons.<br><br>3. An org arranging  staff to pay a visit to all the HDB units in spore find out each n every housedholds'  finanacial situation on site inspection,following which reported the real poor to the relevant orgs.<br><br>Any  other ideas!!!!</div>

My point is that even putting up there for 2 weeks cost that amount of money do you still think its cheap here? I would like to see you foot the bill for 2 weeks 8k. I can use that to survive in Singapore for half a year or more. And if I was rich would I care? talking about bull you all the bull all words and no action. Did you do any volunteer work recently? help some old people clean their homes for free or you are just one of those idealist use mouth talk talk talk and came to action too busy to help?If you are none of the above don't tell others they are bull... you are the bull.<br><br>For your info I'm not rich I am average S'porean like everyone else takes MRT, bus walk and eat hawker / home cook. But i do volunteer work at least once every three month helping old people clean their one room flat room. I know its really little but at least i try a little.

If you have been to europe, you will know some parts of it are just as bad as the third world countries, I've not beenmy self but some of my old classmates have and they show me pics of them. Ask around your friend, don't ask those on holidays for goodness sake ask those that go there to study and does a little travelling they would tell you that not all places are developed like in the TV box.<br><br>How sure are you that these people are getting assisted?<br>Do you know how they recieve assistance?<br>What conditions does these people get assistance have before assistance are provided?<br>Do you know why the person jump?<br>Are you familiar with his condition ? Does he gambles, did he save ? did he not save?<br><br>Talk about Bull Sh.it. You know nothing and you open your big mouth and talk and accuse others ok in this case me?<br><br>Correct respect is to be earn. People like you are just idealist with a mouth and a useless hand for typing. Come to action don't know where you will hide.<br>Ask you for help you would just shun away and so did you donate anything to the family of the man that jump?
