              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Singapore Tax loopholes (income, GST) that the rich dance circles around</strong></span><br> <br> - Regarding <strong>personal income taxes</strong>: <br> "Singapore follows a progressive tax rate starting at 0% and ending at 
                  20% above S$320,000": ['Singapore Personal Income Tax Guide' (<a href="http://www.guidemesingapore.com/taxation/personal-tax/singapore-personal-tax-guide">link</a>)].<br> <br> - Regarding <strong>Corporate taxes</strong>:<br> 'Corporate Tax Rates'</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Zero tax for new Singapore companies on the first 100K annual profits for the first 3 years</li>
              <li>All resident companies to enjoy approx. 9% corporate tax rate for profits up to 300K</li>
              <li>Overall company tax rate is a flat 17%</li>
              <li>[Source: 'Singapore Corporate Taxes' (<a href="http://www.singaporesetup.com/singapore-corporate-taxes/">link</a>)]</li>
              </ul>
              <p>According to 'Singapore Company Registration Guide' [<a href="http://www.guidemesingapore.com/incorporation/company/singapore-company-registration-guide">guidemeSG</a>]:
                   "Most companies in Singapore are registered as private limited 
                  liability  companies (commonly known as private limited companies). ....
                   According to Singapore Companies Act, <strong><span style="color: red;">any person (foreign or local) above the age of 18 can register a Singapore company</span></strong>."<br> <br> Thus a <strong>tax consultant Mr X usually earn SGD680k p.a.</strong> can very easily reduce his income tax burden (YA2010) of $114.7k (tax table [<a href="http://www.iras.gov.sg/irasHome/page04.aspx?id=1190">IRAS</a>])
                   to ZERO by providing his services under the auspices of unlimited 
                  'shell' companies: A, B, C and so on to exploit the corporate tax 
                  benefits aforementioned listed, namely: "Zero tax for new Singapore 
                  companies on the first 100K annual profits for the first 3 years".<br> This by simply earning a max personal income of only $20k p.a. (zero income tax on first $20k: (tax table [<a href="http://www.iras.gov.sg/irasHome/page04.aspx?id=1190">IRAS</a>]))
                   and then dividing all subsequent earnings over as many companies as it 
                  takes to exploit the first $100k profit zero tax scheme. In accordance 
                  to Mr X purposes, all his shell companies pay full dividends on all 
                  profits made to its share holder- none other than Mr X himself.<br> "Singapore currently adopts a one-tier corporate tax system. Under the  
                  one-tier corporate tax system, tax paid by a company on its chargeable  
                  income is the final tax. <span style="color: red;">All dividends paid by a company are exempt from  tax in the hands of the shareholders.</span> ": (One-tier corporate tax system [<a href="http://www.iras.gov.sg/irasHome/page04.aspx?id=1396">IRAS</a>])<br> <br> In accordance with Mr X's exploitation of SG taxation loopholes, he 
                  incorporates as many companies as is necessary to benefit from the "Zero
                   tax for new Singapore companies on the first 100K annual profits..."<br> <br> As Mr X has paid himself through his 'consultancy' companies' revenues- 
                  an annual salary of $20k p.a. only; Mr X would then have, for the 
                  purposes of his legal tax evasion scheme, the need to operate under the 
                  auspices of 6 or more companies, each earning an annual profit of $100k.<br> <br> Has the corporate tax system been subject to flagrant misuse by the rich
                   and sneaky in  'legally' evading personal income taxes- definitely.<br> <br> As for evidence of corporate cheats pillage of government revenue 
                  through illicit GST reimbursement applications, see: 'GST cheat gets 
                  jail, $1m fine' [<a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/BreakingNews/Singapore/Story/STIStory_535672.html">ST, 4June2010</a>]<br> <br> Suggestion:<br> If SG really wants a vibrant economy, then reduce personal income taxes 
                  by encouraging companies not to skimp on employee salaries by raising 
                  the corporate tax rate (17%) above the max personal income tax rate 
                  (20%)- put $ in the pockets of employees and allow them to invest/ spend
                   this money as they deem fit/ better still, in investment as SME/ 
                  corporate shareholders.<br> Corporate income tax rates  should NOT be LOWER than the highest rate of
                    personal income taxes and NEITHER should there be any discounts on 
                  corporate income taxes. If corporate taxes need be lowered, then please 
                  lower personal income taxes first, just having a flashy headline 
                  grabbing corporate tax rate is just cheap advertising a cover-up the 
                  socio-economic rot festering beneath.<br> <br> Always remember that corporates are NOT Humans, as such, conferring 
                  corporates MORE tax benefits then we confer humans is certainly placing 
                  the cart before the horse if not the opening of a Pandora's box of human
                   evil.<br> <br> The preferential tax regime of corporates over individuals is certainly syndromic of the Singapore government's worship of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammon">mammon god</a>, a worship that is doomed to destruction of the Singapore economy if not society.<br> <br> <br> <em><strong>"Those who would give up Essential Liberty to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety."</strong></em>--  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Franklin">Benjamin Franklin</a><br> <br> Definitions:<br> - <strong>'Mammon'</strong>: <em>"Mammon is a term, derived from the Christian
