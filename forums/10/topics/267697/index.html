            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Learned Helplessness</strong><br><br><blockquote>Martin E. P. Seligman and his collegues, while studying the relationship between fear and learning, accidentally discovered an unexpected phenomenon while doing experiments on dogs using Pavlovian (classical conditioning). As you may observe in yourselves or a dog, when you are presented with food, you have a tendency to salivate. Pavlov discovered that if a ringing bell or tone is repeatedly paired with this presentation of food, the dog salivates. Later, all you have to do is ring the bell and the dog salivates. However, in Seligman's experiment, instead of pairing the tone with food, he paired it with a harmless shock, restraining the dog in a hammock during the learning phase. The idea, then, was that after the dog learned this, the dog would feel fear on the presentation of a tone, and would then run away or do some other behavior.<br><br>Next, they put the conditioned dog into a shuttlebox, which consists of a low fence dividing the box into two compartments. The dog can easily see over the fence, and jump over if it wishes. So they rang the bell. Surprisingly, nothing happened! (They were expecting the dog to jump over the fence.) Then, they decided to shock the conditioned dog, and again nothing happened! The dog just pathetically laid there! Hey, what's going! When they put a normal dog into the shuttlebox, who never experienced inescapable shock, the dog, as expected, immediately jumped over the fence to the other side. Apparently, what the conditioned dog learned in the hammock, was that trying to escape from the shocks is futile.</blockquote>Taken from <a href="http://www.noogenesis.com/malama/discouragement/helplessness.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.noogenesis.com/malama/discouragement/helplessness.html</a><br><br><blockquote><strong>Learned helplessness is a psychological condition in which an animal has learned to believe that it is helpless.</strong> It has come to believe that it has no control over its situation and that whatever it does is futile. As a result, the animal will stay passive in the face of an unpleasant, harmful or damaging situation, even when it does actually have the power to change its circumstances. Learned helplessness theory is the view that depression results from a perceived lack of control over the events in one's life, which may result from prior exposure to (actually or apparently) uncontrollable negative events.<br><br>Learned helplessness is a well-established principle in psychology. It can be observed in the effect of inescapable punishment (such as electrical shock) on animal (and by extension, human) behaviour. Learned helplessness may also occur outside the laboratory, in everyday situations or environments in which people perceive (rightly or wrongly) that they have no control over what happens to them. Such environments may include repeated failures, prison, school, war, disability, famine, and drought. </blockquote>Taken from<br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learned_helplessness" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learned_helplessness</a><br><br>So have many of the apathetic Singaporeans learned to be helpless?<br><br>"aiyah what can we do, just follow gahmen loh" A common line used by many Singaporeans, even if they are unhappy with the polices of the ruling party.<br><br><blockquote>people in a state of learned helplessness view problems as personal, pervasive, or permanent. That is,<br><br><strong>* Personal</strong> - They may see themselves as the problem; that is, they have internalized the problem.<br><strong>* Pervasive</strong> - They may see the problem as affecting all aspects of life.<br><strong>* Permanent </strong> - They may see the problem as unchangeable.<br></blockquote>Or do some singaporeans end up internalizing the problems they face?<br>"I'm not good enough so I earn less"<br>"I didn't get a chance to go to college coz my A Levels not good enough, and parents cannot afford overseas uni. What to do? like that lor"<br><br>Again another symptom of learned helplessness. Did government propaganda and top down culture create these mindsets among Singaporeans?<br><br>Then again, whatever is learned, can be unlearned.....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Learned helplessness</strong><br><blockquote><br>The common theme is an internal pattern called "learned helplessness" Learned helplessness results from being trained to be locked into a system. The system may be a family, a community, a culture, a tradition, a profession or an institution.<br><br>Initially, a system develops for a specific purpose. But as a system evolves, it increasingly tends to organize around beliefs, perspectives, activities and taboos that serve the continuation of the system. Awareness of the original purpose fades and the system starts to function automatically. It calcifies. The beliefs, perspectives, activities and taboos shift in subtle (and sometimes not so subtle) ways, to ensure continuation. <strong>And those beliefs, perspectives, activities and taboos are trained into the people that comprise the system. </strong></blockquote><a href="http://www.unfetteredmind.com/articles/helplessness.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.unfetteredmind.com/articles/helplessness.php</a><br><br>What is the <strong>system</strong> in this case I wonder....</div>

The older generation had to endure 30 odd years of almost exclusively govt controlled media intake into their minds. That proportion is alot lower and also they were exposed over a shorter period of time. I guess the circumstances(in this case, the media intake of the people) is no longer under the full control of the ruling party.<br><br>Well there are also those in the younger generation who have the "aiyah, what can we do" syndrome. Or as some would say, the "rice bowl" mentality.</div>
