              <p>which MP said that. yes its paper lost, but still there is value in the paper. if you dun sell it, there is still a paper lost in the value, although you can still recoup back the money when the market go up, but if you decide to sell it, there is money lost when it is realised.</p>

              <p>Your friend must have a contract with IPO underwriter, so he cannot run away, most IPO today dun surge, in fact, most goes down, but if you can hold, some of their dividends are not bad.</p>

              <p><br>If you are a half-baked lawyer - stop pretending to be an accountant, and now pretending to be an economist.</p>
              <p>Stay with your position as a Taiwanese 'hum' and as a pimp, as well as a Bar operator.</p>
              <p>Only you will attempt to convince anyone that "investment dun mix with politics".</p>
              <p>This can only reinforce your position as a pseudo-Singaporean with your ignorance to the ways that business is conducted by the Singapore Government.</p>
              <p>Even when one invest, one must be expected to take risks - one do not have to be blindly stooopid to give away US$30 Billion for worthless shares to prop up a sinking financial system - and hoping to walk away as the biggest winner and owner of a sinking system that belong to someone that is a thousand times bigger then oneself.</p>
              <p>Only a Taiwanese 'hum' will attempt to sink its money to save a pretentious MAFIA calling for help, and hope to be the next Mafia boss with its small effort to bail out the Mafia in their times of trouble.</p>
              <p>Keep your stooopidity to yourself, and no one will know that you are stooopid as a Taiwanese 'hum'.</p>

A reminser dun really give u advices as a stockbroker do, any tom and dick can be train as a reminser, but as a stockbroker, you need certain qualification in finance and banking. Usually reminsers work for the stockbroker, reminser will handle the lower ah beng and ah lian shares while the broker (boss) will handle the fund managers or any rich guy. Reminser also earn a salary, with service charges, how can the boss pay him?</p></div>
