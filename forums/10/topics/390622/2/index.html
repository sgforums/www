              <p>An accounting "paper loss" cannot be replaced - that amount has to be earned and covered by new profits.</p>

              <p><br>Investment dun mix with politics, a free market capitalist economy embrace a free investment policy, and when you invest, you must prepare to take risk, the higher the risk the greater the gain, but of course, the greater the lost. The differences is that you can study the market and place your bet, unlike gambling, it is all depend on you luck.</p>
