This does not mean that they were ignorant. They simply based their observations on what they knew to be correct at the time. The fact that they dared to put forward a hypothesis to the scientific world to be critiqued is not something to bemoan or to dismiss as ignorance when they are later found out to be errorneous.<br><br>True ignorance is to accept the status quo unquestioningly. To live life without curiosity about the world we live in. To accept that we live in a world where the proles should listen to whatever their political masters say as fact. To accept that there should be a ruling class and a class that is to be ruled, and that such an arrangement is the natural order of things.<br><br>I agree we should always check and balance our beliefs against fact.
