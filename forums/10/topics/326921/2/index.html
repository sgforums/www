              <p>You have the right to your opinions, but do not insult my country and fellow citizens, if you wish to work in our country and make use of our facillities and political stability, opportunities of which your country lacked that you had to beg such on our shores.

              <p><br>Dearest xtreyier</p>
              <p>As a guest in your country, i would really appreciate it if your immigration people would stop hounding me year after year to take up Singapore citizenship. Please do point out which figures of authority did i disrespect and i will behooves myself to behave with more circumspect with regards to them. As a member of the PR community i believe i am more suited to speak on their behalf compare to you who is not a member of that community.</p>
              <p>My insinuation that an unnamed 'japanese propagandist from WWII' ruled your country is not an insult to you citizens. All I am doing is stating an example of a successful propagandist who have the ability to influence people minds up to the point that he/she/it can take over a whole country.</p>
              <p>Please mention all the japanese collaborators you need to. Again, with everything stated, the important component of "japanese propagandist" is not JAPANESE but PROPAGANDIST hence, it would be more suitable for you to mention all the propagandist you know of.</p>
              <p>So dear xtreyier, if you really are not connected to any local propaganda department and you really are as naive as your posts, just observe the local media by reading local newspapers and watching local TV. When government says Singaporeans need to have more babies, suddenly the local media is full of tips/tricks of having/taking care of children. TV dramas all centered around having babies/ family stories. When the government says need to give chances to ex-convicts, the newspaper prints the success of ex-convicts and tv drama shows ex-convicts stories. I am pretty sure as a local, you have received at least 10 years of brain washing. It takes an outsider to really see what is going wrong.</p>
              <p>I also agree that everyone have the right to their own opinions that is why i do not usually go into details in my posts, just some wisecracks at this and that. and do believe me when i say i am not out to insult anyone but saying that there is no propaganda here is like saying there is no durians here. wake up and smell the durians man. the government practically shoves propaganda in your face, down your throat, past your colon and out your anus. and i do respect your previous generations. they turn an island village with no resources into a city state that is the current singapore. it is the current generations that i have a problem with, a bunch of whiny, money grabbing assholes destroying all what the previous generations had built.</p>

              <p><br>Dearest xtreyier</p>
              <p>As a guest in your country, i would really appreciate it if your immigration people would stop hounding me year after year to take up Singapore citizenship. Please do point out which figures of authority did i disrespect and i will behooves myself to behave with more circumspect with regards to them. As a member of the PR community i believe i am more suited to speak on their behalf compare to you who is not a member of that community.</p>
              <p>My insinuation that an unnamed 'japanese propagandist from WWII' ruled your country is not an insult to you citizens. All I am doing is stating an example of a successful propagandist who have the ability to influence people minds up to the point that he/she/it can take over a whole country.</p>
              <p>Please mention all the japanese collaborators you need to. Again, with everything stated, the important component of "japanese propagandist" is not JAPANESE but PROPAGANDIST hence, it would be more suitable for you to mention all the propagandist you know of.</p>
              <p>So dear xtreyier, if you really are not connected to any local propaganda department and you really are as naive as your posts, just observe the local media by reading local newspapers and watching local TV. When government says Singaporeans need to have more babies, suddenly the local media is full of tips/tricks of having/taking care of children. TV dramas all centered around having babies/ family stories. When the government says need to give chances to ex-convicts, the newspaper prints the success of ex-convicts and tv drama shows ex-convicts stories. I am pretty sure as a local, you have received at least 10 years of brain washing. It takes an outsider to really see what is going wrong.</p>
              <p>I also agree that everyone have the right to their own opinions that is why i do not usually go into details in my posts, just some wisecracks at this and that. and do believe me when i say i am not out to insult anyone but saying that there is no propaganda here is like saying there is no durians here. wake up and smell the durians man. the government practically shoves propaganda in your face, down your throat, past your colon and out your anus. and i do respect your previous generations. they turn an island village with no resources into a city state that is the current singapore. it is the current generations that i have a problem with, a bunch of whiny, money grabbing assholes destroying all what the previous generations had built.</p>
