              <p>When you know of foreigners wanting to become citizens, do tell them about the ruling party, for some don't know Pay and Pay well enough.    Expose the PAP to them.   The more people know of their ways the better.</p>

              <p>Foreigners from the western hardly will want to bcome citizens here.  Their govt in their countries take better care of the people compare to Pay and Pay.   I come across many ang mohs complained to me about the Pay and Pay.</p>

              <p>I respect your right to express your personal view, but your statement must be made to stand corrected.</p>
              <p>Citizens are never treated as bottom of the pit. White or black, rich or poor, we are all equal, accorded full rights that PRs can only drool over, such as HDB subsidies, travel ease, employment, education, etc.</p>
              <p>Whether the citizen has ancestry that stretches back to Sir Stamford Raffles or he just got his citizenship today, he is an equal in the eyes of our State (our society). There is no caste or class system in Spore. So called 'Elites' are nothing more than labels a few mischevious ones, even within the ruling elites used, and are not recognised universally in Spore.</p>
              <p>Most critically of all, the citizen reserves the right to vote and comment upon the governance of our country, and the direction it should take through voicing out in the relevant and respected channels.</p>
              <p>PRs are nothing more than mercenaries paid to perform a job, based on their qualifications and capabilities, and as guests within our fair country, given the opportunities to be housed along with our cheap HDB but paying rates above what a 1st timer purchaser citizen pays or loan.</p>
              <p>While they may enjoy equal fare in public transportation, so do the same with tourists, and so do too us when we are in their country, as tourists or PR.</p>
              <p>I am aware that i will not be able to convince you with such facts, but i do hope that you may consider other citizens who had hard workingly contributed to this nation, to build it to what it is today, would feel with your totally irresponsible comments.  </p>

              <p>U think they make brilliant governance ? I can compare with UK or US or Australia and I still stick with my impression tat even they r Ang Mo Countries, their governance is also half here half there.  U need to realise one thing. Wat cards r u dealt with. Singapore is just a small island surrounded in a region with relatively more turbulence under competition with Hong Kong, China and India with no resources.</p>
              <p>U think George Bush is governing well ?</p>

              <p>I respect your right to express your personal view, but your statement must be made to stand corrected.</p>
              <p>Citizens are never treated as bottom of the pit. White or black, rich or poor, we are all equal, accorded full rights that PRs can only drool over, such as HDB subsidies, travel ease, employment, education, etc.</p>
              <p>Whether the citizen has ancestry that stretches back to Sir Stamford Raffles or he just got his citizenship today, he is an equal in the eyes of our State (our society). There is no caste or class system in Spore. So called 'Elites' are nothing more than labels a few mischevious ones, even within the ruling elites used, and are not recognised universally in Spore.</p>
              <p>Most critically of all, the citizen reserves the right to vote and comment upon the governance of our country, and the direction it should take through voicing out in the relevant and respected channels.</p>
              <p>PRs are nothing more than mercenaries paid to perform a job, based on their qualifications and capabilities, and as guests within our fair country, given the opportunities to be housed along with our cheap HDB but paying rates above what a 1st timer purchaser citizen pays or loan.</p>
              <p>While they may enjoy equal fare in public transportation, so do the same with tourists, and so do too us when we are in their country, as tourists or PR.</p>
              <p>I am aware that i will not be able to convince you with such facts, but i do hope that you may consider other citizens who had hard workingly contributed to this nation, to build it to what it is today, would feel with your totally irresponsible comments.  </p>

              <p>It may be inescusable for them to do so, but what else could they do, when the western colonnialists who kept the population stupid, did not armed them and then aborrogated their defense of the population whom they raped economically by fleeing with tails inbetween their legs back to their homeland in the presence of a highly efficient Japanese Imperial army who would not hesitate to lobbed off any heads if they failed to even bow?</p>
              <p>You have the right to your opinions, but do not insult my country and fellow citizens, if you wish to work in our country and make use of our facillities and political stability, opportunities of which your country lacked that you had to beg such on our shores.
