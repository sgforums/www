              <p>When government says Singaporeans need to have more babies, suddenly the local media is full of tips/tricks of having/taking care of children. TV dramas all centered around having babies/ family stories. When the government says need to give chances to ex-convicts, the newspaper prints the success of ex-convicts and tv drama shows ex-convicts stories. I am pretty sure as a local, you have received at least 10 years of brain washing.</p>

              <p>Well considering the gov do fork out million of dollars for mediacorp, it is not a wonder tat try to please their biggest sponsor.

              <p>Hey beggar, don't blame for your own stupidity nor put words into my mouth. Where did i say there was 'no propaganda' in Spore? I only said no propaganda dept which you begged me, a citizen disparaged by your insinuations, for a job, you word twisting cowardly utter vermin of the worse kind of PR that shamed many of  the other hardworking PRs i know.</p>
              <p>You yourself may consider yourself as peasant, whom need to surrender your human dignity to bow, kneel and scrap before your own monarchy, but don't insult us republican citizens any further.</p>
              <p>Your intentions were clear - to bad mouth our country and singapore citizens as you wish, whether as reply to my post or others.</p>
              <p>It's ok for you to feel envious of our nation and its achievement, and you feel ashamed of your own country, BUT you have no right to take it out on us! This is a Singapore Forum, a singapore site. Not 3rd World forum. Read the title of this site again, ignoramus.</p>
              <p>This is my advise to you, mercenary, STAY OUT OF OUR AFFAIRS if you wish to continue working here in peace.</p>

              <p><br>i was involve in a DSO project during my university years, cant go into the details.</p>
              <p>Apparently, they were pretty keen to have me continue on with the project after i graduate but non-citizens do not have the security clearence to work on that project (dont ask me why a non-citizen can work there as "attachment" staff but not full time staff cos i also dont know).</p>
              <p>I got my PR status the month i graduate (in July) but come Janauary of the next year, i was asked to go to SIR (it was still call SIR then) for "interview" where i was asked to convert to a citizenship.</p>
              <p>for some reason when i refused, the officers turn hostile and threatened to revoke my PR status if i do not want the citizenship. feeling pissed myself, what i actually said was "If you feel the need to revoke my PR, please do so but you will need to inform MOE why i cannot complete the 3 years bond I am obligated to serve for accepting MOE's s<span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">cholarship grant." SIR back down then.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">I am sure for those who have read by posts would conclude that i am mentally unstable to a certain degree but i am still not crazy enough to really ask ICA officers to suck my cock. Its just a figure of speech.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">After that incident in SIR, the immigration people still mails me every january asking me to convert to a singapore citizen which i promptly ignore every year.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">Thats the whole story.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">Now I came from Brunei where the government covers all medical, dental and education expenses for its citizens. Why would i give that up to become a Singapore citizen where i need to pay for everything? As to why I am working in Singapore, the pay here is way better than if i were to get a job back in Brunei. Basically now, i am enjoying the benefits of both countries. Why would i give that up?</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">the point of all my posts is just to tease <a href="/users/242785">xtreyier</a>.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">in fact, all this started when i jokingly asked <a href="/users/242785">xtreyier</a> for a job as a government propaganda writer and he started to flame me so i decided to push more of his buttons. In no way am i trying to insult singaporeans except <a href="/users/242785">xtreyier</a> perhaps but redDUST decide to join the fight (maybe hes got a singapore flag shoved up his ass too).</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">look at <a href="/users/242785">xtreyier</a> and redDUST posts, they can only post hostile and threatening statements without an ounce of evidence to back up what they are saying</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">sure, <a href="/users/242785">xtreyier</a> decided to change his stand of there is no <strong>propaganda</strong> in singapore to there is no <strong>propaganda department</strong> in singapore but if that is the case, where are all the propaganda coming from? the quality of propaganda used to be good, "<strong>Singapore will not bow down to American pressure, Singapore will still cane that American vandal</strong>" brings pride to Singaporeans compared to the quality of propaganda nowadays, "<strong>Singapore not facing economic depression</strong>" when people are getting retrench left and right.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">there is no such thing as no propaganda/ propaganda department, even private companies have their own propaganda/ propaganda department. Only they call it advertising/ advertising department.</span></p>

              <p><br>i was involve in a DSO project during my university years, cant go into the details.</p>
              <p>Apparently, they were pretty keen to have me continue on with the project after i graduate but non-citizens do not have the security clearence to work on that project (dont ask me why a non-citizen can work there as "attachment" staff but not full time staff cos i also dont know).</p>
              <p>I got my PR status the month i graduate (in July) but come Janauary of the next year, i was asked to go to SIR (it was still call SIR then) for "interview" where i was asked to convert to a citizenship.</p>
              <p>for some reason when i refused, the officers turn hostile and threatened to revoke my PR status if i do not want the citizenship. feeling pissed myself, what i actually said was "If you feel the need to revoke my PR, please do so but you will need to inform MOE why i cannot complete the 3 years bond I am obligated to serve for accepting MOE's s<span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">cholarship grant." SIR back down then.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">I am sure for those who have read by posts would conclude that i am mentally unstable to a certain degree but i am still not crazy enough to really ask ICA officers to suck my cock. Its just a figure of speech.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">After that incident in SIR, the immigration people still mails me every january asking me to convert to a singapore citizen which i promptly ignore every year.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">Thats the whole story.</span></p>

              <p>what moe scholarship grant are you talking about? can you be more specific? a scholarship is a scholarship. a grant is a grant. who are you trying to snook?</p>
              <p>if it is the standard 3 yr bond that is required for non-citizens to serve to `contribute to singapore economically', then this is a standard clause all non-citizens graduate takes. it has been there for the longest time. i have been guarantor to non-citizens in my undergrad days to frens. basically, if one breaks the bond, you just need to pay back the subsidize amount, consisting of mainly fees, tuition, etc.</p>
              <p>so, it is not a scholarship as you imply if that is what you are referring to. if not, be more specific what scholarship you have that makes you so indispensable here to the singapore gahmen?</p>
              <p>even for those, i have seen cases where the bonds are broken by mutual consent, for different reasons.</p>
              <p>you think too highly of yourself. not only are you cocky, you talk cock just as well. </p>

              <p>err...  ChiBet let me get this straight... r u trying to stay in S'pore purely as a PR, but not a citizen, so that u can enjoy benefits of a PR, use our taxpayers $$$ to study and use our transport system etc., at the same time skipping NS and other duties or watever supposed to be fulfilled by a citizen of S'pore?</p>
              <p>On the hand, retain ur Brunei citizenship and enjoy the benefits they offer?</p>
              <p>I have nth against ur thinking, every1 wants the best for themselves at the end of the day right? but dont u think u should contribute back to S'pore society? Let me ask u this, r u willing to become a S'pore citizen eventually? i guess the ans is a big fat NO.</p>
              <p>For that i have nth more to say. i love my country Singapore, but i guess the rulers r trying to make me feel otherwise. </p>
