              <p>it had alway been an honest mistake, but that was that time.</p>
              <p>I think education and knowledge brought about both good and bad, good being a higher level society, bad being less birthrate due to the knowledge of having to take care, paying high cost to it and less personal enjoyment. Therefore education and knowledge bring about fears and selfishness to it citizens.</p>
              <p>So, by instilling education with great emphasis on it, LKY might had make a mistake in educating us.</p>

Developed countries are suppose to colonise or have big influences on undevelop or developing countries, but how come Singapore, as a developed country, is depending on FTs, what is going on&gt;&gt;&gt;??? thot LKY declared independency in 1965 liao..somemore at that time, he was crying.

Besides havent you heard? the gahmen cut down the PR's subsidy on healthcare instead of just raising up our benefits as citizens, which means other people have to suffer in exchange for our benefits.</p>

              <p>As for beta, yes its true, our future generations now are becoming dumber... why is LKY always overlooked this situation about our young generations going down the drain?. We see them everynight untill morning hanging outside MRT, malls, esplanade kissing (not just kissing by the way they might be one of your daughters or sister hahaha), skating areas in somerset or some obscure areas where they can do anything illegal freely. I see some students pretending to study in mcdonalds (who are they kidding), how can you study in a crowded place right, besides its not a studying place (signs are already posted). But in day time till noon, the library is not even crowded.</p>
