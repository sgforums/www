              <p>Man n Woman are like a pair of human hands.If u are left-handed,u use more of it.If u are right-handed,similarly,u will use right hand more.But the thing is,both hand are equally important.</p>
              <p>So if a man n a woman married,maybe the husband will contribute more to the family,or vice versa.But the thing is,both are equally important.So if there is a divorce occur,any money or property that originally belong to the spouse,should continue to be so.And not all goes to the wife.</p>
              <p>Moreover,many divorce nowadays can be the husband's fault,or wife's fault.So it is very unfair for our law to give everything to the wife.If our PAP ministers,particularly that senile old man,want to encourage more ppl to get married n born more babies.They should treasure "2 hands",not a particular hand.</p>

                                  cent from the spouse,if there was any divorce occur later on.</p>
              <p>Or divide the money n property equally if there was a divorce
                                  taking place.</p>
