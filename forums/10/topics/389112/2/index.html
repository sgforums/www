              <p>Naw, it's not just the women's charter.</p>
              <p>Singapore's dismal birth rate is the result of several factors, and mostly a case of the government trying to do many different things at once, and ending up not doing any of these things well.</p>
              <p>Case in point, one has to admit that the original population control policies were greatly myopic. The natural development of the nation will bring down the birth rate on its own, and in fact one might argue that had the government not embarked on such an aggressive "stop at two" policy, Singapore soceity would have had quite a lot more Singaporeans to buffer and set off our current population issues by quite a while.</p>
              <p>Additionally, baby bonus and the like aside, one cannot avoid the fact that the rising cost of living in Singapore ultimately outweights whatever baby bonuses the government can provide. The fact remains that by and large our pragmatic concern with economic sucess and the lifestyle it creates in our society is often at odds at us wanting to encourage our population to have more children.</p>
              <p>And of course, people are marrying and having children later as well. This adds even more to the problem.</p>
              <p>The women's charter really has little to do with it, and I say this as a member of the male gender. Yes, I think it's unfair and ultimately in the long run does not really benefit either women or men the way it is currently done, but I do not think think it's the main reason.</p>
              <p>The current practice of importing "talent" to make up for the shortfall of course, is not socially or economically sustainable in the long run. It is a stop-gap measure. The crux of the issue is, and will always be the birth rate and who will truly become citizens. Because that is largely what it means to be Singaporean.</p>
              <p>I do not think Singapore will die if our birth rate carrys on like that... but it will radically redefine what it means to be Singaporean... given locals will feel increasingly disconnected from their homeland, as well as seeing citizenship as a liability. This cannot bode well for national identity.</p>

              <p>If we are to select opposition who can really replace the PAP we need to have a good understanding of the problem.</p>
              <p>For one, our current population growth problem is about RATE, not numbers. Our population numbers aren't dwindling like that of Japan yet.</p>
              <p>The rate of replacement is particularly important for us because of our "social security" measure - the CPF. In an ideal scenario, as more and more Singaporeans retire it becomes a neccessity to ensure that the amount of contributors is constant with the amount of people drawing their retirement funds from.</p>
              <p>Of course, since our government treats the CPF like a free piggy bank using it for god knows what without accountability it becomes crucial to ensure that there is enough money to pay off the initial contributors to the CPF. Essentially the CPF (Including its counterpart - the Social Security and Pension System in the US) is a Ponzi Scheme.</p>
              <p>My theory is that they realised there isn't enough remaining currently in the CPF to pay off the increasing number of retirees leaving the workforce that's why they were so eager to impose limits on the withdrawal amount and the bullshit annuity measures.</p>
              <p>That's also why they're so eager to let in so much foreign workforce.</p>
              <p>If a PR wishes to leave Singapore and wants to withdraw his or her CPF, they would have to put back the money PLUS interest if they want to ever come back here to work again. Since very few are so confident to do that, they're not so eager to withdraw their whole CPF.</p>
              <p>SO basically that means the opening of the floodgates is to refill the coffers of the CPF, not because we have a dwindling population. They're using a potential future problem to cover up the fuck up they're having now.</p>

              <p>I'm quiet doubt about the theory you have....you maybe right....but problem of low birth rate is not only happen in sg.  it oso happen in many others country like japen, aussie, NZ, Germany, Holland...&amp; they're oso giving out incentive &amp; other benefit in order to increase the birth rate. it show that it is a major issue to a country...whether is developted or developing country. we dont see it a problem is becos we wont understand the potential problem we may face in the future due to population shortfall &amp; work force replacement.</p>
