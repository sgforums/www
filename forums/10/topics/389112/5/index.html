              <p>These days they have PR taxes? Then how do PR pay higher taxes? I thought main sources of government revenue are, income taxes (personal and corporate), GST, stamp duties, property taxes and motor vehicle taxes. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Do they have special category of taxes so that PR pays higher taxes? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p><br>Gentlemen,</p>
              <p>As PR, there is less tax reliefs and rebates, that is all.</p>
              <p>Saying that our population is not enuf and that foreigners are here to help us, both in low and high skill, is actually not necessary and can be prevented,</p>
              <p>Firstly, our Govt had educated our people wrongly, we failed miserably to create our own industrial the likes of Acer, samsung, LG, not to mention the japanese. Instead we created a class differentiation in our education system, that is so rigid base on working class and comparing idealogies. It only brings about working for others, kiasee, kiasu, proudness and killing each other for the glory climbing up the coperate ladder. That is totally absurd and wrong, but yet our govt is still so proud to say that our education is the best, only best in english, but failed to create a gracious and entrepreneurship mentality.</p>
              <p>I quote you an example of a country, much like singapore in terms of population, small and yet with no natural resource, but they are doing extremely well without foreigner intervention and had the least crime rates in the world until the recently killing.</p>
              <p>Finland, a land that even British once said a waste land, it is much bigger than singapore, but mostly make up of waste ice lands and swamps, it had a population of only 5 millions, called as Finnish. In the earlier years, they will not get noted anywhere in the world, not the mention with giant like german, sweden, france etc etc up above them in economy and strenght, the finnish will consider quiet and low class..but instead of getting peoples in to help their economy, they put their citizens into entrepreneurship education with top creativity and innvocation idealogies, and out of nowhere, they create many new industrials, in shipbuilding, marine, transportation, communication and big MNCs of their own. Who would believe that Finland created Nokia and beat the jap, german, usa, etc etc out of the blue.</p>
              <p>With so much industrial, how is the finnish going to cope with so less population? Their Woman Prime Minister said that instead of getting workers from the eastern europe or asian in, we build factories in those land, China, Russia etc etc,...all have Nokia and marine engine plants of Finland. We sent our management team to guide those workers there, in this way, Finland will remain solely to Finland, and we give our Finnish people our own domestic jobs, shares in our industrial operating in other countries, so that we all prosper together, live happily and this will helps to increase our birthrates, she understood that a society long hours working and stress in cost of living and working can hardly produce any childrens.</p>
              <p>Why our govt think differently ar??? why they dun do a study of Finland?</p>

              <p>I have the benefit of serving National Service (NS) at $200 a month for 2.5 years. The only tax relief I get that PRs don't get is National Serviceman relief which is $3,000 for active and $1,500 for non-active, with a tax bracket of 3.5%, the $3,000 translates to a savings of $105. Other than that, I probably get an extra $1,000 to $2,500 voting fees during election year to remind me to vote in PAP again so that they can "fix" me up another 5 years. But rest assured the money they spend on "voting fees" will be recovered with interest within the first year. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For the 2.5 years in NS, if I had made $1,200 a month for the 2.5 years, I would have made like $36,000.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I also get "subsidized" public hospital treatments which are priced higher than an equivalent GDP per capita country.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We also get "subsidized" "public" housing which is priced higher an equivalent GDP per capita country. For the subsidized $450,000 (5 room HDB public housing), you could get a very nice private apartment in Australia.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Really makes you wonder how does PAP manage to get all those reserves doesn't it. It comes from over taxing and over charging Singaporeans. Good thing for them there is no Boston Tea Party and Democracy in Singapore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The only greedy ones are those in power, they demand that they be paid a salary 5-6 times that of the world's No.1 leader, but they perform at a dismay middle rank. Do you know how much are the Myanmar Junta paid? My guess is they are probably paid higher than all the world leaders.</p>

              <p>If you are a PR, you are lucky that our bum leaders have allowed you to come into this beautiful island as a PR.  If you are pure blood Sporean, open your eyes, get some grey matter between your ears and stop being a running dog of the govt.</p>

              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">the govt still fails and ignore the ground discontents that men feel it but couldn’t help it as the law is over protecting the women….men’s fear of commitment has increased …this comes as no surprise…</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">the govt tried subsidies of all kinds, promoting on dating, icebreakers, .....all these measures have failed and repeatedly fail with decreasing birth rates….they just dun dare to touch on whats need to be done to improve and lift men’s fears of unreasonable and unlimited liabilities of men to serve the country and worse, to get huge fines upon divorce….</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">Men’s liabilities are just too high…the due is overly and fearfully high…its better to be single…it is so clear and yet so stubbornly ignored</p>

              <p>women forms a substantial support for the ruling party....women charter is also an instrument to gather greater support for them....it is no surprise this is a golden votes gathering instrument.....</p>
              <p>society tends to use catchphrases like "gentleman" to contain men's image...but the push for women charter was overdone to the effect that they now realize it is unstoppable..they can't back their words...women is used as an electoral strategy....and marketing women charter's in line with the world protects Sg from adverse bad image and criticism from human rights and feminists...</p>
              <p>Thus they resort to other solutions like subsidies, dating promotions and marriage agencies to spruce up the singles and late marriages issue...but to date it is not effective....singles, divorce and very late marriages are still on the rise..and exponentially....</p>
              <p>they simply refuse to touch on the sensitive issue of marital and divorce laws which everyone is aware to the women great (ridiculously great) advantage....</p>
              <p>FCUKPAP - your sons will suffer as a result...dun HE has an albino grandchild to his anger? evil statement...women u ask for it...one day u become mothers and u will know what i mean</p>

              <p>You are either a running dog ,pure-bred sporean who will believe whatever you are told by the authorities that be. or you have a vested interests in these 500K blood suckers who are coming into this beautiful island of ours, becos of flawed policies.</p>
              <p>Or you are actually a PR who couldnt hack it in your own home country, you will probably bumming around trying to get a job in that dead beat home country of yours.  The way you talk. the only English word you learnt in school is idiot and i think the teachers must hv been using it on you becos of your pea-brain arguments.  You speak as if 1965 when we gained independence, we (pure bred sporeans) were all starving becos there were no PRs to come and earn $$$$ for Spore.</p>
              <p>If you are a PR, you are lucky that our bum leaders have allowed you to come into this beautiful island as a PR.  If you are pure blood Sporean, open your eyes, get some grey matter between your ears and stop being a running dog of the govt.</p>
