              <p>Foreign men who married foreign wives and retired in foreign country ? DO you have any idea how many actually lived happily ever after ? Or did you just conjured this fantasy in your head ?</p>
              <p>How many of these men didn't get flushed clean and booted back to Singapore Empty handed and their children had to stay in the foreign land. Because the foreign lands child custody judgements are BIASED to their own citizens ? Will this kind of story gets reported on the gossip newspapers you read everyday ?</p>

              <p>FCUKPAP - one weakness of policy makers is that the lack of
                                              feeling the grounds of common people..the worst off scenarios of
                                              the lots...it should be deliberated from bottom up....all good
                                              corporate management practiced in this manner....the ministers and
                                              columbo scholars are assuming from statistical regressions that
                                              could be adjusted to achieve its desired levels...and the lack to
                                              include social understanding to achieve balanced
                                              results.... </p>

              <p>The only way your nonsense can work  is to DUMB DOWN all females.</p>
              <p>Ya think females are just baby making machines, all ya need is a flick of the switch ? Ya sick fuck.</p>
              <p>what other INTEREST OF MEN are you interested in ? </p>
              <p>Ya think FOREIGN women will flock to tiny Singapore to copulate with Singaporean men if they know women's rights arn't well protected here ? NO WAY.</p>
              <p>It's not because Singaporean men are more SUPERIOR than their local men, it's because women are MORE <strong>legally</strong> protected HERE in SG.</p>
              <p>YOU SHOULD BE GRATEFUL there's a WOMAN'S CHARTER in SG.  So foreign chicks dares to even touch you !!</p>
              <p>Sure, go ahead.. take away more priviledges from the woman's charter.. go and balance your male interest.</p>
              <p>The result will be, more SG ladies flocking to the west or scandies to look for mates.</p>
              <p>Less foreign girls will want to come here to seek a husband.</p>
              <p>In the end.. SG males can all go be gays lah. Willing males marry willing males. Reproductive rate = ZERO.</p>
              <p>So be careful wat you wish for. Once you tipped the scale.. the consequences will be to your own disadvantage.</p>
              <p>Talk about deliberating from the bottom up... Ya the kind that deliberate with your bottom . OK ? Good.</p>
