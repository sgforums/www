Twisted Evil </blockquote>Correct, they pay themselves millions, wrongfully like in the NKF self-rewards by Durai and Richard Yong with their benchmarking logics and rationale fully and robustly debunked as totally without any substance.<br><br>So much for PM Lee's constant dare to engage critics in robust arguments to debunk their rubbish. Look at the posts by their countering agents like Gazelle or Oxford Mushroom and see how robust have been their debunking on such issues.</div>

Very sad, as we or rather I donÂ’t see any improvement in the future.<br><br>It continues to look gloomy.  His (lee hsien loongÂ’s) motive of entering politics is questionable.  I am not against him personally, but rather it is the way he runs the country, his attitude, arrogance, insincerity and failure/refusal to understand and serve the needs of the people of Singapore that put many people off that make me wonder the reasons why he wants to be in politics.  Besides, base on all that he has been talking and doing, people consider him mercenary.  Being mercenary, drives him to place making $$$$ as the priority over serving the needs of the people of Singapore.   If making $$$ is of the top priority, a politician is not fit to serve the people, rather he be a businessman.  A country cannot be run like a company.<br><br>Have they been sincere and care enough to evaluate the way they treat and serve the people.   Do they care to rectify whatever mistakes they have been making to improve on their service to the public/people of Singapore, I doubt!  Doing things to please oneself at the expense of the people of Singapore is uncalled for, is this the way of the ruling party Â– I think we all have the answer.<br><br></div>
