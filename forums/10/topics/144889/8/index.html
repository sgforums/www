The CMP mandates India to pursue an independent foreign policy and promote multi-polarity in international relations," Karat said at a seminar on "Relationship with India and America," organised by the CPI-M and student unions here.<br><br>"Our contention is the wider Indo-US joint statement, signed during Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's visit to Washington last month, and the (earlier) Indo-US defence policy have gone against the letter and spirit of the CMP."<br><br>Terming the defence agreement, signed by Defence Minister Pranab Mukherjee and US Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld in June, as a betrayal, Karat said it was wrong on the part of the UPA to have first agreed to such a pact without taking the nation into confidence and keeping the parties supporting it in the dark about its contents.<br><br>"Though the defence minister stated he was going to the US on an exploratory visit, he returned after signing a 10-year framework agreement in Washington. This is a serious matter as such a pact on defence matters has far-reaching implications on our national security. In a democracy, we simply cannot accept it.<br><br>"We find the UPA government following in the footsteps of the previous National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government, which carried out secret negotiations with the US for over 15 months, involving then foreign minister Jaswant Singh and US assistant secretary of state Strobe Talbott," Karat recalled.<br><br>Karat said after signing a similar agreement in 1995 to train Indian armed forces, conduct joint exercises and exchange programmes, the US put the defence cooperation on the back burner after the Pokhran nuclear tests in May 1998.<br><br>"Post 9/11, the US again started warming up to India and restored military training so as to have access to our armed forces. It followed it up by sending its troops for joint strategic exercises and jungle training in Mizoram and high altitude training in the Ladakh region.<br><br>"We consider the latest agreement as a continuation of the military collaboration process. By signing it, we have accepted to be part of the US global strategy and join the US in its Asian strategy. Why Rumsfeld suddenly has this new love for India as against (earlier) bitter hostility towards us?<br><br>"We all aware that the US has a close and strategic relationship with Pakistan. Why this sudden change? We believe in the new strategic doctrine of the US, its main and long-term target is China, to contain China and prevent it from gaining parity with the US in terms of economic or military strategic strengths.<br><br>"In this new doctrine, the US sees India as a counter weight against China. It underlies the new American approach to draw India into military and strategic collaboration to fulfil its global designs," Karat told about 500 participants.<br><br>While complimenting the prime minister on a successful visit to the US, Karat regretted the Indo-US joint statement.<br><br>"Being a major developing country and the world's largest democracy, how can India be a strategic ally of a unipolar country like the US?<br><br>"This agreement is against the CMP's foreign policy of maintaining and promoting multi-polarity with other countries the world over."<br><br>(IANS)<br></div>

Spokesman Liu Weijiang said only that they had been signed, China Daily reported.<br><br>"Liu did not elaborate on the content of the agreements, saying CNPC would remain low-key before any concrete progress has been made," the paper said in its weekend edition. The Chinese firm published only a four-line statement on the visit, while PDVSA provided a detailed account of several deals.<br><br>The two countries aim to increase Venezuelan imports to over 300,000 barrels per day in coming years, from an average of under 70,000 bpd in the year to date, PDVSA said without giving detailed dates.<br><br>"The purpose...is to cover 15 to 20 percent of total crude imports to be made by China," the statement said.<br><br>However with China already sucking in a average of 2.45 million bpd in 2004, Venezuelan imports would have needed to be near 370,000 bpd last year alone to meet even the lower end of that target.<br><br>Venezuela sells most of its crude and products to the giant U.S. market -- where it has an advantage over Middle-Eastern and African producers because of its proximity.<br><br>But left-wing President Hugo Chavez frequently clashes with Washington and is looking to new markets like China and India for the oil production it plans to bring on line in coming years, even though analysts say the cost of shipping crude further afield could prove problematic.<br><br>The Orinoco block allocated to CNPC is the 640 square kilometre Junin 4, and the Chinese firm will quantify and certify reserves estimated at 20 billion barrels, PDVSA said.<br><br>When the survey is completed, the two firms will discuss a joint production project, to be combined with a refinery in China.<br><br>The Zumano area where the two firms have a preliminary agreement to form a joint exploration and production firm has remaining reserves of around 400 million barrels of light and medium crude, and 4 billion cubic feet of gas, PDVSA said.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Â© Reuters 2005.

Two decades ago, Japan came under U.S. criticism for its growing global presence, and that spurred all sorts of protectionist talk out of Washington.<br><br>The Japanese hysteria eventually died down as the country fell into a long recession. But don't look for that to happen with China, where its politics combined with its potential for growth may make it a far tougher force to reckon with going forward.<br><br>China has drawn the ire of many countries because of the vast amount of T-shirts, toys and everything else that it is exporting at lower prices than many local markets' products.<br><br>The United States' trade deficit with China hit $162 billion last year, making it the largest imbalance ever recorded with a single country. This year's deficit is already running 32 percent above last year's pace, and political pressure is heating up to put tighter restrictions on imports from China.<br><br>American lawmakers have blamed some of this on China's undervalued currency. They threatened to impose punitive tariffs on China if it didn't switch to a more flexible currency system rather than have the yuan trade at a fixed exchange rate that was pegged to the U.S. dollar -- which has kept its export prices low.<br><br>In July, China announced it would gradually let the yuan rise in value against a basket of currencies, though some critics say that its move isn't enough.<br><br>And Chinese companies have come up against great resistance when expressing interest to acquire U.S. assets. Their bids this summer for American oil and gas company Unocal Corp. and appliance maker Maytag Corp. didn't ultimately result in any deals, but such interest was seen as a sign of greater Chinese ambition in the global marketplace.<br><br>All this China-bashing is reminiscent of the talk directed at Japan in the 1980s, when fuel-efficient Japanese cars were gaining popularity with U.S. consumers while the Japanese were buying up American companies as well as trophy U.S. real estate.<br><br>Back then, the U.S. trade deficit with Japan was ballooning, and there were many claims that Japan was keeping its currency artificially low to boost its exports. To fix that, U.S. politicians demanded that Japan either strengthen the yen, or face trade sanctions.<br><br>"What is being said about China sounds like the same speeches and arguments that were heard about Japan. Back then, we had senators protesting on the steps of the Capitol" about foreign-made goods, said Milton Ezrati, a senior economic strategist at the money management firm Lord Abbett.<br><br>But while China today looks a lot like yesterday's Japan -- before its asset bubble burst and it headed into a prolonged economic slump -- Morgan Stanley global economist Stephen Roach sees big differences. "In terms of the scale of their economies and financial markets, China and Japan are like day and night," he said in a recent note to clients.<br><br>Among the distinctions: Japan's equity-market capitalization amounted to 41 percent of the world's total market capitalization in 1989; by contrast, China's equity markets currently account for only 0.5 percent of the value of global equity markets.<br><br>He also notes that China has a much more outward-looking growth and development model than Japan. In 2004, exports and imports combined equaled 74 percent of Chinese GDP, more than three times Japan's 23 percent share.<br><br>That is why Chinese currency reforms take on much greater importance, Roach said, pointing out that the Chinese might have learned from the Japanese to resist U.S.-led political pressure for currency revaluation. Japan ran into trouble in the late 1980s, in part by abdicating control over the yen and letting the dollar-yen conversion soar from 259 in 1985 to 121 by the end of 1987. Many blame that for setting the stage for an asset bubble that eventually collapsed in Japan.<br><br>"The last thing China wants is to go down that road -- placating U.S. politicians on the currency front while, at the same time, sowing the seeds of an increasingly dangerous liquidity bubble of its own," Roach said.<br><br>There are also significant political differences between the two. While the Chinese have been more open to foreign investment than Japan, there are some concerns that the communist political structure means that the Chinese won't embrace all kinds of foreign involvement such as an American company buying a big Chinese company.<br><br>In addition, Standard &amp; Poor's chief economist David Wyss points out that China's huge population -- which he estimates is 10 times as large as Japan's -- means that China has the capability of taking over world production of just about everything.<br><br>So talking about China today as though it were Japan 20 years ago might not accurately size up the situation of this fast-growing empire. China's might just be beginning to build its power as an economic force.<br><br>To the dismay of many Americans, that will likely mean a bigger, bolder China to contend with for many years to come.<br><br>Rachel Beck is the national business columnist for The Associated Press.

BHPB's bonanza was very much Australia's bonanza.<br><br>Striking was not just the sheer size of China's economic boom, and so its voracious appetite for raw material, revealed in the BHPB numbers. But also the speed with which it has erupted.<br>Even just three years ago when BHPB was bedding down the first results from its merger, no one could have and no one indeed did anticipate the coming size and speed of the China impact.<br><br>In 2002 group revenue was "just" $US15 billion.<br><br>In three years it's more than doubled, to $US32 billion ($42.2 billion). Profit has grown even faster - at the EBITDA level, from $US4.7 billion to $US11.4 billion.<br><br>With China leapfrogging Japan to become the company's single biggest geographic customer. Japan! The country on which BHP - and Australia - had built prosperity, running back over nearly 40 years, caught and supplanted in just a few years.<br><br>Advertisement:<br>China benefits BHPB - a pretty good proxy for Australia more broadly - in two direct ways. Obviously, what it actually buys and the price it pays.<br>The most striking example is iron ore to feed its exploding steel industry. The volumes it buys have been rising exponentially and, after the latest price negotiations, it is going to pay 70 per cent more on every tonne of those higher volumes.<br><br>The second benefit is less obvious but just as direct. The way Chinese demand is pushing up the price of all commodities. So BHPB, and Australia, gets the benefit on stuff it/we sell to someone else.<br><br>The most striking example is oil and gas. It is Chinese demand that is the new kid on the block - since the late-1990s rising Chinese consumption has been the crucial "swing factor" between global demand and supply of oil and gas, but especially oil.<br><br>Depending on which measure you use, China is somewhere between 5 per cent and 10 per cent of the global economy; and even in population terms is only a little bit more than 20 per cent of the world. Yet, it has been driving one-third of the increased global demand for oil.<br><br>This is also why oil, on its own but also as a proxy for all commodities, is tellingly important on two other fronts in which China again sits at the very centre.<br><br>The first is the short-to-medium term sustainability of the China growth story; and more narrowly, but crucially linked, whether it will significantly up-value its currency.<br><br>The second is broader, longer-term and more opaque. Is it really different this time? Is what's happening in China and the impact on the world different from, say, Japan's growth story in the 1970s and 80s?<br><br>Arguably it is, both in its own terms, and because it's happening in a very different world, really to anything that was experienced in the 20th century. And it "works" so well with that different world.<br><br>First the currency. Macquarie Bank's Mark Tierney recently made the telling point of how the rising oil price provided reason alone to upvalue the Chinese yuan.<br><br>Because the yuan was fixed to the US dollar and oil is priced in US dollars, China has felt every penny of the higher oil price.<br><br>Up-valuation would in one stroke slash the imported price of oil. And cut the price of all commodity imports. Before considering second- and third-round impacts, it would be a win-win outcome for a company like BHPB and a country like Australia, along with China.<br><br>China would get its crucial raw material imports cheaper, but the prices to our exporters would not fall - at least, not in US dollars. What happened in A-dollar terms would depend on the impact on the $US-$A rate.<br><br>Arguably, it would also be a win-win as between the US and China. US exports and import-competing industries would become more competitive off a lower dollar.<br><br>But China would not lose as much competitively because of both the huge benefit of cheaper raw material inputs and its ability to manage - hold down - domestic costs.<br><br>In short, the "best-case" outcome could keep the global music playing longer, while being as particularly beneficial to us down here as the last couple of years have been.<br><br>If so, though, it would deliver pluses - strong demand and higher prices for our commodities; and minuses - probably even higher oil and petrol prices.<br><br>So what of the "bigger picture?" Is it different this time? And how different? Like BHPB CEO Chip Goodyear's once-in-a-century "super cycle", or something that is actually unique?<br><br>It has already been very different. The way China has interfaced with a world made in America, and made especially by Alan Greenspan through the 1990s and the extraordinarily low US interest rates post-9/11.<br><br>We have had sustained strong global growth and low global interest rates and yet no sign of the wages and inflation explosion that always accompanied and always terminated earlier periods of boom.<br><br>Inflation seems to have been confined to property, in just about every major economy; and those rising property values have in turn also sustained consumer spending.<br><br>The great disciplinarian, so to speak, has been China. Becoming the world's factory, it has not simply stopped the price of consumer goods in the developed world going up, but actually sent them down.<br><br>This, though, would not have been possible, or at least not able to have been sustained for so long, without the relentless march of technology in a globalised world, helping deliver continually cheaper and better goods.<br><br>That's why, I suggest, this time it really is different. We've never really had anything like China before - its unique mix of size, sophistication and poverty. Japan didn't come close, nor South Korea, Taiwan and all the other "little tigers" wrapped into one.<br><br>We've also never had a world like we have today, in which China is happening. The technology and globalisation in all its forms. Nor in particular, the architecture of and the flows through global financial markets.<br><br>To say that it "is different", is not to claim that it is therefore the boom that will never end. We have also never had all this happening in a world in which global oil supply is right at the edge of current, far less emerging, demand.<br><br>Or a world in which the US is running $US700 billion current account deficits. To say nothing of all the geopolitical issues.<br><br>What it does tell us, is to live with, if we don't fully understand, the unconventional and the seemingly unsustainable. That we are like BHPB, leveraged to the China/global upside.<br><br>In a reversal of the old truth that when America sneezed we caught cold; now, China gets prosperous and we, more especially a BHPB, get rich.<br><br>Hopefully, that when the music does stop, or pause, we are not as leveraged to the downside. But be alert to that possibility.<br></div>

Beijing-based Construction Bank last month said Temasek would invest $1 billion in the IPO itself.<br><br>Temasek, which has $55 billion of assets, wants to boost returns that averaged 3 percent in the past decade by investing in China's $1.65 trillion economy, which is 15 times the size of Singapore's. European and U.S. banks spent more than $6 billion buying stakes in China's lenders since 2003 to tap an economy that's grown an average 9.5 percent during the past two decades.<br><br>``Banks usually benefit more than other industries in a rising economy,'' said Kingston Lee, director of Nomura Asset Management in Hong Kong, who helps manage $15 billion of global stocks. ``There aren't many good investment opportunities in China and banking seems to be the last sector available.''<br><br>Singapore Base<br><br>Temasek said last year it had more than half its assets in Singapore, with China, Taiwan and Korea accounting for 6 percent of total holdings by the end of March. The Singapore government is forecasting economic growth of 3.5 percent to 4.5 percent this year, down from 8.4 percent in 2004.<br><br>Eva Ho, a Singapore-based spokeswoman for Temasek, declined to comment on investment plans. Fan Yifei, a Construction Bank spokesman, didn't return calls seeking comment.

But Brookings Institution scholar Stephen Cohen thinks reporters should be exploring what the fallout would be in such areas as non-proliferation and relations with China.<br><br>By Stephen Philip Cohen<br><br>scohen@brookings.edu<br><br>Q. Will the new US-India relationship trigger a counter-response from those states that might regard it as threateningÂ—notably Pakistan and ChinaÂ—possibly speeding up the Asian arms race?<br><br>Q. Will it induce other states to accelerate their own covert nuclear weapons programs?<br><br>Q. Has the Bush administration miscalculated IndiaÂ’s ability to keep its side of the bargain, and can the present state of very good US-Indian relations survive the failure of the nuclear deal?<br><br>Q. Even if India does deliver, what assurances does the Bush administration have that a nuclear-armed and fast-growing India will remain a "natural ally" of the United States?<br><br>People close to President Bush, notably former Ambassador Robert Blackwill, have often stated that back when Bush was governor of Texas, he had Â“one big ideaÂ” regarding foreign policy, and that idea was India.<br><br>Blackwill, who was one of the original close-knit group of advisors known as the Vulcans, notes that Bush came into contact with AustinÂ’s Indian-American IT community and was duly impressed. Bush later envisioned a strategic relationship with New Delhi, one that might potentially balance out China. Further, as the worldÂ’s largest democracy, India fit into BushÂ’s strategy of democracy-promotion.<br><br>One early target of the Bush administration was the sanctions imposed upon India (and Pakistan) as a result of their 1998 nuclear tests, and these were removed early in BushÂ’s first term, to the howls of the non-proliferation community. Then followed the appointment of Blackwill as ambassador to India, and joint US-India military exercises. A planned presidential visit to India, disrupted by 9/11, is now set for early 2006.<br><br>However, a major obstacle to India-US normalization is an American law: The 1978 Nuclear Non-proliferation Act (NNPA). IndiaÂ’s clandestine nuclear program has been a bone of contention between it and the United States ever since IndiaÂ’s 1974 nuclear tests, which led directly to the passage of the NNPA.<br><br>In a dramatic announcement last month, Bush and the visiting Indian prime minister, Manmohan Singh, agreed to take steps that would allow the full flow of civilian nuclear technology to India, in exchange for India becoming a de facto member of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). India cannot become a formal member of the NPT because it tested a nuclear device after the treaty went into effect in 1968.<br><br>The nuclear dimension of the Bush-Singh communiquÃ© brought headlines in both India and the United States. The agreement was supported by Mohammed el Baradei, the Director of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), and by Great Britain, but other countries are wary, with China so far remaining silent.<br><br>A major debate is shaping up here and in India.<br><br>In Washington this debate will be over the administrationÂ’s request to Congress to modify the NNPA to permit the flow of nuclear technology to India.<br><br>In India there is some question as to whether New Delhi should abide by whatever changes are made in the NNPA, some of which might limit IndiaÂ’s military nuclear program.<br><br>While I have for many years  advocated a grand bargain in which India accepts certain restraints on its military nuclear program in exchange for civilian nuclear technology, I foresee a number of problems:<br><br>Politically, the potential deal has divided Republicans and Democrats, liberals and conservatives. While everyone is opposed to nuclear proliferation, there is already strong disagreement as to whether the deal will advance or retard this goal. The administrationÂ’s secrecy and its unwillingness to consult even with Congressional leaders may make it harder to build support for the necessary changes in legislation.<br><br>A second political calculation is the role of the India lobby, which has become moderately influential, as American stereotypes of India have changed from highly negative to highly positive. Yet, will pro-Indian legislators vote against the deal because they believe it hurts the cause of non-proliferation?<br><br>Almost all of the publicity surrounds the nuclear and proliferation component of the communiquÃ©. Lost in the shuffle are significant agreements over business cooperation (a forum of India and American CEOÂ’s), American assistance to IndiaÂ’s faltering agricultural sector, and the potential for greatly expanded defense cooperation. If the administration is unable to bring about a change in the NNPA (or if India is unable to meet the criteria that Congress builds into the new Act), what happens to the rest of the US-India relationship? Has Bush put it at risk by proposing a deal that may be politically difficult to bring off?<br><br>Will the new US-India relationship trigger a counter-response from those states that might regard it as threateningÂ—notably Pakistan and ChinaÂ—possibly speeding up the Asian arms race? And will it induce other states to accelerate their own covert nuclear weapons programs? The administrationÂ’s calculation is that Israel and Pakistan might be brought into a new halfway" house regime, something short of the NPT, but is this calculation correct?<br><br>Also: Has the Bush administration miscalculated IndiaÂ’s ability to keep its side of the bargain? Indian law will have to be rewritten and New DelhiÂ’s military nuclear program will be circumscribed. Will Manmohan SinghÂ’s coalition government, kept in power by anti-American communist and left parties, be able to deliver?<br><br>Even if India does deliver, what assurances does the Bush administration have that a nuclear-armed, and fast-growing India will remain a "natural ally" of the United States? In the past, some of our allies have decided that the US alliance is disposable or discretionary (for example: IranÂ’s reversal after the Shah, France and GermanyÂ’s decision to stay out of Iraq). Might this major change in American law and policy simply make it easier for India to continue to pursue an independent policy, one that often runs counter to American interests?<br><br>Conversely, if either the US or India are unable to deliver on the nuclear component of the agreement, will the present excellent status of US-Indian relations be unaffected? There are growing economic and political ties between New Delhi and Washington, are they strong enough to surive the collapse of the nuclear center-piece of the summit?<br><br>These questions deserve careful attention. The answers will determine whether BushÂ’s long-cherished visit to India will be a fiasco or one of the great successes of his two tumultuous terms as president.<br><br>Stephen Cohen has been a Senior Fellow in the Foreign Policy Studies Program of the Brookings Institution since 1998. He was a member of the Policy Planning Staff of State from 1985-87, and is the author of numerous books and articles on India and South Asia, notably the recently published India: Emerging Power (Brookings, 2001), and The Idea of Pakistan (Brookings: 2004).<br>E-mail: scohen@brookings.edu<br></div>

The CMP mandates India to pursue an independent foreign policy and promote multi-polarity in international relations," Karat said at a seminar on "Relationship with India and America," organised by the CPI-M and student unions here.<br><br>"Our contention is the wider Indo-US joint statement, signed during Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's visit to Washington last month, and the (earlier) Indo-US defence policy have gone against the letter and spirit of the CMP."<br><br>Terming the defence agreement, signed by Defence Minister Pranab Mukherjee and US Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld in June, as a betrayal, Karat said it was wrong on the part of the UPA to have first agreed to such a pact without taking the nation into confidence and keeping the parties supporting it in the dark about its contents.<br><br>"Though the defence minister stated he was going to the US on an exploratory visit, he returned after signing a 10-year framework agreement in Washington. This is a serious matter as such a pact on defence matters has far-reaching implications on our national security. In a democracy, we simply cannot accept it.<br><br>"We find the UPA government following in the footsteps of the previous National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government, which carried out secret negotiations with the US for over 15 months, involving then foreign minister Jaswant Singh and US assistant secretary of state Strobe Talbott," Karat recalled.<br><br>Karat said after signing a similar agreement in 1995 to train Indian armed forces, conduct joint exercises and exchange programmes, the US put the defence cooperation on the back burner after the Pokhran nuclear tests in May 1998.<br><br>"Post 9/11, the US again started warming up to India and restored military training so as to have access to our armed forces. It followed it up by sending its troops for joint strategic exercises and jungle training in Mizoram and high altitude training in the Ladakh region.<br><br>"We consider the latest agreement as a continuation of the military collaboration process. By signing it, we have accepted to be part of the US global strategy and join the US in its Asian strategy. Why Rumsfeld suddenly has this new love for India as against (earlier) bitter hostility towards us?<br><br>"We all aware that the US has a close and strategic relationship with Pakistan. Why this sudden change? We believe in the new strategic doctrine of the US, its main and long-term target is China, to contain China and prevent it from gaining parity with the US in terms of economic or military strategic strengths.<br><br>"In this new doctrine, the US sees India as a counter weight against China. It underlies the new American approach to draw India into military and strategic collaboration to fulfil its global designs," Karat told about 500 participants.<br><br>While complimenting the prime minister on a successful visit to the US, Karat regretted the Indo-US joint statement.<br><br>"Being a major developing country and the world's largest democracy, how can India be a strategic ally of a unipolar country like the US?<br><br>"This agreement is against the CMP's foreign policy of maintaining and promoting multi-polarity with other countries the world over."<br><br>(IANS)<br></div>

It's tough to talk intimately when you're both rushing for the door at the same time."<br>India, which initiated the idea, imports nearly 70 per cent of its oil needs while China relies on foreign producers for more than a third of its oil.<br>Their ever-expanding energy appetites to fuel booming economies have strained world supplies and helped propel oil prices to record highs.<br>"The logic for India is 'if you can't beat them, join them'," said Rahul Bedi, New Delhi-based analyst for Janes Defence Weekly. But India would have to accept that "China will be the senior partner," he said.<br>China has been regularly outbidding its neighbour, most recently last Monday when India's state-run Oil and Natural Gas Corp lost out in a offer for Kazakhstan's third-largest oil producer.<br>"The first test case (for cooperation) is right before our eyes: PetroKazakhstan," said Energy Asia's Ng. "Chinese media has been celebrating the catch... I haven't see a story or commentary from anyone in Chinese oil circles saying, 'Let's see if we can share this bounty with the Indians'."<br>While China and India signed a declaration in April committing themselves to energy cooperation, the Indians have been doing most of the cheerleading.<br>The head of the Indian oil ministry's international division, Talmiz Ahmad, told the news agency.<br><br></div>

A correct understanding of the current Sino-US relationship requires not only close follow-up tracing from the policy angle, but also effective explanations made from a theoretical high. Theoretical value lies in whether it is possible to draw a most central and crucial variable from numerous and changeable reality, thereby bringing people's subjective understanding close to the objective reality to the greatest extent.<br><br>In the face of the reality of the current Sino-US relationship, realism of the mainstream research method of international politics and neo-liberalism have, to different degrees, exposed theoretical "poverty" It is impossible for realism to explain the strategic constructive cooperative ties of China and the United States and the ever-closer interdependent ties of the two countries in the economic field. Neo-liberalism cannot shake off the "state centralist method characterized by wrapping oneself up in a cocoon". Since the 1990s, the development of China-US relationship has gone beyond the mode of inter-state ties, commodity, capital, technology, personnel and information exchanges that cross the Pacific Ocean have brought bilateral ties deep into the two societies and touched the daily life of each ordinary citizen, under such circumstances, a structural inter-dependent relationship has been formed between China and he United Sates. Understanding of such relations requires three basic theoretical visual angles:<br><br>First is economic globalization. The current China-US relationship is different from the US-Soviet ties during the era of Cold War and will not fall into the same old road of the rise of Germany and Japan in history. The most fundamental factor lies in the background of economic globalization. Economic globalization has changed the connotation, nature and gaming rules on China-US relationship, causing the transnational behavioral entity to go beyond national boundaries and forming a network of close interaction relations. Economic globalization will not automatically avert the contradictions and frictions between China and the United States, on the contrary, it will bring about more friction points. However, due to the interdependence between China and the United States, it is difficult for either side to sustain the cost of suspending bilateral normal economic and trading relations, this makes the mission of "containing China" become impossible.<br><br>Second is domestic politics. The distribution of the profits gained from interdependence between China and the United States among different domestic interest groups is unbalanced. Some industries, trades, social groups and even individuals benefit themselves, while other groups and individuals may suffer losses. Both the profit-making group and the group suffering losses will rise into action on the domestic political stage and will exert influence and pressure on national policies, this is especially noticeable in the United States. The influence exerted by US domestic political factors on Sino-US relationship has become increasingly evident in recent years. We can neither react radically like the shadow of a snake in the cup, nor can we fail to know the gains or losses and make unprincipled concession. In fact, the interest group in US domestic politics is a usable resource in diplomatic work.<br><br>Third is geographical strategy. In the foreseeable future, the drop in the stage of Sino-US economic and social development as well as international positions and the drop in foreign strategic focus have made it possible for the two countries to find out harmony in geographical strategy. As the overlord of the world, the United States needs China's cooperation in regional and global affairs; as a large regional country being devoted to economic development and the building of a well-off society, China needs a stable and prosperous international environment. Of course, the harmony of geographical strategy needs run-in through dialogs and inter-action, this is identical with China's requirement for "a period of 20-year strategic opportunity.<br><br>This article by Yu Wanli, deputy director of the foreign affairs office of the American Institute under the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, on the 11th page of Global Times, August 19, is translated by People's Daily Online</div>

You have a cartel of countries who represent the supply side. I think if major countries on the demand side of the oil domain are able to pool their resources and requirements, I think itÂ’ll put them in a better position at the negotiating table with the states in the supply cartels. We have an OPEC for the oil producers, I think there is a case for an OSEC or oil consumers kind of consortium. And in Asia, countries like India, China and perhaps at some point, Indonesia, plus Korea and Japan who also have large oil requirements, could pool their efforts together. I think itÂ’s inevitable actually.<br><br>JT: What could be included in the initial steps for this collaboration?<br><br>UB: Well, I think there is a clear interlink today between the energy dimension along with the growth rates and the environmental impact. So I think we need to do some consultation between the long term energy supply and demand. And the correlation with economic activity and impact on the environment because of greenhouse gases, and the commitments which the Kyoto protocol represents. So I think we need a kind of strategic dialogue, which would be strategic in a non-military sense. That is if we can make reasonable projections into the future, I think we have to carry out very informed assessments. So that there is a sense of cooperative effort as far as major oil consumers and the demand side is regulated in the appropriate manner. I also foresee a point in the not too distant future when these countries might have to look at alternate sources of energy. Now, whether these are solar, whether theyÂ’re wind or nuclear, will depend on individual countries and their own options and constraints. But hypothetically, whether we talk about nuclear or the wind, I think again, a certain degree of cooperation will be mutually beneficial.<br><br>JT: Should the United States and Europe be worried by such a deal between India and China?<br><br>UB: I think not. As I believe energy will very soon become the driving force or the driving determinant for many bilateral and multi-lateral relations. And given the United States own dependence on hydro-carbons at this point in time, I think the US itself could also be brought on board, so that there is a sense of transparency, and whatever China and India are proposing to do that in the long term would not be detrimental to a country such as the United States.<br><br>JT: What will this collaboration mean for western oil firms who have not been able to compete on the same level as these state-backed oil firms from China and India?<br><br>UB: Well, I think the fact that the western oil forms did not bid for Petrokazakhstan is not an indication that they would be outbid or that they did not want to. I think as far as western countries are concerned, I think here we have a clear political dimension which is the way that the governments of individual countries, whether itÂ’s the United States or Japan, are looking at hydrocarbons. ThatÂ’s one aspect. The second is the degree in which they are looking at it from a purely business and commercial point of view, which is another strategic dimension. My understanding of the Petrkazakhstan deal, was that the Chinese were determined to get it and this happened in the back drop of the attempt by CNOOC for UNOCAL, and the fact that they did not get it, I think ChinaÂ’s determination and the fact that China would have paid a price that was higher than what others were willing, was more or less evident. So I think there was a sense of prudence that may have dictated the response of the western oil companies.<br><br>Commodore Uday Bhaskar, from the Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses, in India.<br></div>
