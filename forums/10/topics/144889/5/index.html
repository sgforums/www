            <div class='col-md body'>China will be the next economic power. i dun think anybody doubts that. dun forget that China is still technically a socialist state. China's development has juz started. Out of the many provinces .. the current promiment ones are the pearl river delta area (mainly guang zhou) and Yangtze delta area (shanghai, jiang shu, etc). 400 of the top 500 companies in the world are located in the Hubei area alone. These companies bring in billions in FDI as they start developing the Yangtze area. These are not the FDI that we have seen in the 1980's, where China focused on light or low-value added manufacturing. These are high-tech firms that perform value-added manufacturing. As Dr Wang Yue of UNSW stated, the firms need China more than China need these foreign firms. By not locating in China, these top firms lose the competive advantage.<br><br>not forgetting, only the eastern and southern coastal provinces have started developing. the inner cities havent started their industrial policies yet. when they do.. it will be scary.  the prospect of the development of the western provinces growing and the domestic market growing will only result in an increase in income, etc...<br><br>Why is there corruption? simple... poverty. Only when people are ensured of a stable income and 3 meals can they then concentrate on social rights, enviromental laws etc. ask anybody in the field of developmental economics.<br><br>So the US is like the moral crusader? in 2001, a study was done by Oxfam concluded that just in Mali, where the US gave 37 million in foreign aid to the nation, the tariffs and subsidies that the U.S govt enforced on the nation resulted in a loss of 41 million dollars. simple maths tells u that this causes a deficit of 4 million dollars to Mali. not so nice eh?<br><br>American subsidies on cotton depressed world prices by more than 50% .. causing brazilian farmers to lose abt 640 million in exports. not so nice too eh?<br><br>So why do people hold the U.S in such high regard? maybe the proponents could explain this to me? i am not advocating that China is without its faults. At least China doesn't pretend to be the moral voice of the world. The government always work in the interest of the country ... u cant expect the Chinese govt to not prioritise the China development right?<br><br>Now then.. why is the Chinese economy so messed up and corrupted? because its still in its developmental stage. different provinces have different policies and with the old party structure .. there is a lot of inertia... in 40 years.. China will definately be one if not .. THE top economy in the world. at least 400 of the fortune top 500 fortune companies agree with me.. thats why they relocate plenty of their facilities there.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i re-read the topic .. guess i'm out of point with my earlier post.<br><br>however, instead of fearing... a better strategy would be to treat the growth China as an opportunity to grow our economy. Although China has made quantam leaps economically speaking, their designing, marketing and capital management are generally weak. a good time for s'pore to hop on the band wagon in these areas.<br><br>in a nut shell... why should we fear China? There's no need to<br><br>in all honesty, we r not a threat to them. we have no military power, we do not pose a threat to their economy and we dun have huge S'pore MNCs wanting to transfer an influx of FDI onto their shores.<br><br>We'll probably be effected in terms of losing jobs to FT, but the fiscal and macro-management of S'pore should ensure that things do not get out of hand. at least in the next 10 years i hope. but we seriously should look at re-positioning ourselves in the global market.</div>

Chinese televisions are broadcasting hundreds of programs on China's resistance against Imperial Japan.<br><br>Â“The two countries find themselves playing out old grievances in a new era of direct rivalry for power and influence. Never before in modern times has East Asia had to contend with a strong China and a strong Japan at the same time, and the prospect feeds suspicion and hostility in both countries,Â” commented the New York Times article written by Norimitsu Onishi and Howard F. French.<br><br>China has experienced 25 years of extraordinary economic growth, extending its influence throughout Asia. But just when China's moment in the sun seems to be dawning, Japan is asserting itself: seeking a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council, transforming its Self-Defense Forces into a real military and revising its war-renouncing Constitution.<br><br>In Japan, major newspapers have published articles defending the Class A war criminals convicted by the postwar Tokyo Trials, and a growing number of textbooks whitewash Japan's wartime conduct. Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi makes annual visits to Yasukuni Shrine, where war dead including Class A war criminals are enshrined.<br>In China, a new television series called "Hero City" tells of how cities across China "fought bravely against Japan under the leadership of the Communist Party." In Beijing on August 13, six former Chinese airmen from the Flying Tigers squadron are to recreate an air duel with Japanese fighters, the newspaper said.<br><br>"On the one hand we have a victim's mentality, and on the other we don't see this much smaller country as being worthy of comparison with us," the paper quoted Pang Zhongying, a professor of international relations at Nankai University ChinaÂ’s northern port city of Tianjin. "The reality is that they must accept the idea of China as a rising military power, and we must accept the idea of Japan becoming a normal nation, whether we like it or not."<br><br>The conservative news media of Japan have helped demonize China, as well as North Korea, to soften popular resistance to remilitarization. Sankei Shimbun, Japan's most conservative daily, recently ran a series about China called "The Threatening Superpower."<br><br>Hiromu Nonaka, 79, who retired as secretary general of the governing Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) about a year ago, said the present situation reminded him of prewar Japan, when politicians manipulated public opinion to rouse nationalism through slogans like "Destroy the brute Americans and British," the newspaper reported.</div>

It's natural he should do that as the prime minister of Japan. There is nothing so idiotic as refusing to go to Yasukuni Shrine," Yoshitake said.<br><br>"I know there are complaints from China and it is difficult from the diplomatic viewpoint. But really, I want him to take the lead by worshipping there," he said.<br><br>CHANCE ENCOUNTER<br><br>Three days after receiving their orders, Yoshitake and his unit took off in their two-seater Type 99 aircraft, heading for the Philippines, where they planned to launch what Yoshitake calls in his memoirs, published in 1999, "a mission to exterminate American fiends."<br><br>Yoshitake did not set out on an attack until Dec. 12.<br><br>Ironically, an interception by U.S. fighter planes saved the 22-year-old's life.<br><br>After coming under attack, he crashed on the tiny island of Mactan, where Japanese rescuers dragged him, seriously wounded, from the wreckage of his overturned aircraft.<br><br>Later transported to Taiwan, then a Japanese colony, Yoshitake spent the remaining months of the war piloting dignitaries around the island.<br><br>The suicide missions were a tactic born of Japan's desperation in the last year of the war, when it became clear that Tokyo was about to lose its hold over the Philippines, a key Pacific base.<br><br>The pilots themselves, mostly aged between 18 and 22, were convinced Japan could still come out on top in the Pacific War.<br><br>"We knew we were in a tight spot, but we thought if we gave it our best shot...," Yoshitake said.<br><br>The attacks crescendoed through the first half of 1945, reaching a peak during the Battle of Okinawa, when more than 1,000 suicide aircraft were unleashed on Allied forces. More than 100 manned torpedoes were also deployed on suicide missions.<br><br>Yoshitake rejects any comparison between the kamikaze, named after the providential typhoons that blocked Mongol invasions of Japan in the 13th century, and present-day suicide attackers, like those who destroyed New York's World Trade Center in 2001.<br><br>"We think that is completely different," he said. "That was peacetime and what we did was in the middle of a war. What they did was senseless destruction caused by resentment. 'Special attack' had a purpose."<br><br>Figures are inconsistent, but a Japanese encyclopedia says around 2,000 planes were used in kamikaze attacks.<br><br>Some sources say nearly 4,000 pilots died. In the process they sank 34 U.S. ships and damaged 288.<br><br>Six decades later, Yoshitake still keeps his mementos close to hand.<br><br>There is the white silk "1,000-stitch belt," a good-luck charm on which each well-wisher in his village sewed a single stitch, a model of his plane, and even the kimono-clad rag doll given to him by the sister of a comrade who died in training.<br><br>Like many surviving "special attack" pilots -- sometimes called "the cherry blossoms that did not fall" -- Yoshitake was reluctant to return home after the war.<br><br>He planned to stay on in Taiwan, until fears of an invasion by Chinese communists forced Japan to order its troops home.<br><br>Now retired from a job with an air transport company and living with his wife in a cramped apartment in a Tokyo suburb, Yoshitake says he often wonders why he survived.<br><br>"Who really are the lucky ones? Those who gave their pure lives for their country, believing in victory and knowing nothing of defeat? Or we who lived through defeat and eked out our days grudgingly in this corrupt world?" he asks in his memoirs.</div>

"But that was the day our post-war life of fleeing and hiding began."<br><br>Tojo, who became a symbol of wartime militarism for many both in and outside Japan, was hanged for war crimes in 1948.<br><br>He is also one of 14 Class A war criminals honoured at Tokyo's Yasukuni Shrine, making visits there by Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi controversial and a source of friction with China and South Korea.<br><br>Tojo was convicted on counts of waging wars of aggression against the Allies and China and of authorising inhumane treatment of prisoners of war and others forced his family into decades of reclusion so profound that letters were mailed to them under a different name.<br><br>Yuko decided to break that silence a decade ago to argue for a new view of her grandfather and history.<br><br>"My grandfather was certainly responsible for the nation," she said, surrounded by pictures of her grandfather in her modest Tokyo home. "But having responsibility and doing bad things are different. He was not a criminal.<br><br>"Post-war history was tampered with by the Allies," she added. "Japan's culture and the Japanese spirit, right down to the bottom of (our) hearts, were all dyed with this version of history. And it's been that way for the past 60 years."<br><br>Yoko's campaign to repair her grandfather's image coincides with a growing debate about who was to blame for Tokyo's wartime aggression, and a shift to the right among Japanese politicians.<br><br>"It reverberates in the larger debate," said Brad Glosserman, director of research at Pacific Forum CSIS, a Honolulu-based think-tank. "The political debate in Japan has shifted and the centre of gravity has moved to the right."<br><br>Now 66, Yuko has only vague memories of her grandfather, prime minister from 1941 to 1944, whose bespectacled face became a symbol of Japanese evil among Japanese enemies during the war.<br><br>"He was very kind and sympathetic, especially towards people in a weaker position in life, like servants or children."<br><br>She still cherishes several mementos, including the stub of Tojo's last cigarette and a photo taken when he became prime minister, where she is seen leaning against his knee.<br><br>TEXTBOOK REVELATION<br><br>The days after Japan's defeat were bewildering for Yuko: she didn't understand why she was ostracised by classmates on the school playground, or why neighbour's children whose parents had died in the war came after her with sticks and stones.<br><br>She didn't even find out her grandfather had been hanged until she was in the fifth grade.<br><br>"One of my classmates used to clutch his throat when he saw me, saying 'Tojo, death by hanging.' I wondered why he did that," she said. "It wasn't until I read in my social studies textbook that my grandfather and six others had been hanged that I knew.<br><br>"It was a shock. I thought he had died fighting the war."<br><br>Yuko upheld the family code of silence about her grandfather until the early 1990s, when the release of new records of the words of the late Emperor Hirohito that showed him expressing deep trust in Tojo made her feel times had changed.<br><br>A memoir about her family was followed by TV appearances and other media interviews, all an attempt to raise interest in what she calls the true history of her grandfather and the war.<br><br>"All of Japanese society has been brainwashed by the Allied view of history put forth by the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal, that the war was an invasive war," she said.<br><br>"The tribunal was made up only of victorious nations, there was not one neutral nation involved. So of course it could not be a just trial."<br><br>Some conservative politicians have recently aired similar views. The government's top spokesman, Hiroyuki Hosoda, has said such remarks do not reflect the stance of the government, which has accepted the results of the Allied tribunal.<br><br>Herself a frequent visitor to Yasukuni, Yuko wants Koizumi to keep his pledge to visit the shrine on the Aug. 15 anniversary of Japan's surrender in World War Two, an emotive date he has avoided so far for fear of the diplomatic furore it would cause.<br><br>"That he doesn't go to Yasukuni (on Aug. 15) just because of the so-called Class A war criminals shows he is a real failure as the nation's top leader," she said.

Scores were tortured. At the end of the war, a few weeks later, only half were alive.<br>Then the perpetrators got off lightly.<br>Three employees of Kajima Gumi, the construction company overseeing the workers, were sentenced to death and another to life imprisonment by the Allied war crimes court in 1948. But the penalties were later reduced, and all were released by 1955. The man responsible for laborers in the town is celebrated in a bust near where his charges were killed.<br>The "Hanaoka Incident' could easily enter the record as yet another example of how Japan, 60 years after the end of World War II, has not convincingly faced up to the colossal slaughter of innocents as it conquered a wide swath of Asia in the 1930s and '40s.<br>But there is another side to the Hanaoka story.<br>As a boy of 9, Yasuo Togashi cheered with his neighbors when the bone-thin escapees were recaptured. Then, as he entered adulthood, he was overwhelmed with regret as he learned details of what those Chinese endured, and he joined a group of townspeople who dedicated their lives to keeping those memories alive.<br>"We thought the Chinese weren't even human, and we were happy when they were caught," said Togashi, 69, a retired elementary school teacher. "Now, I feel nothing but remorse. I didn't really understand it at the time, but as an adult, I was really shocked about it."<br>Since the 1950s, Togashi and others have tried to set things right: They have built monuments, hosted survivors visiting from China, and taught their schoolchildren about the past. The town holds an annual remembrance for the victims.<br>Repeated efforts<br>Few countries have apologized as often as Japan has for its aggression in Asia and to so little effect.<br>Since the 1970s, Japanese prime ministers and even emperors have expressed varying degrees of regret and remorse over the suffering caused by Japan.<br>Just last April, Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi sought to defuse a surge of war-related tensions with China during a speech at an Asian summit: "In the past, Japan through its colonial rule and aggression caused tremendous damage and suffering for the people of many countries, particularly those of Asian nations."<br>Tokyo's commitment to peace goes beyond rhetoric.<br>The country's U.S.-drafted constitution forswears war to settle international disputes, and no Japanese soldier has fired a shot in war since 1945. Japan is the world's No. 2 source of developmental aid after the United States, and it has paid billions in reparations to nations it invaded.<br>Not all of Asia is clamoring for further atonement. Singapore, the Philippines, Indonesia and Vietnam, all conquered by the Japanese, have mostly come to terms with the war and are more interested in lucrative ties with the world's second-largest economy than in dwelling on the past.<br>Yet, with the approach of Aug. 15, the day Japan marks the end of World War II, it is clear many Asians have nagging doubts about the depth of Japanese remorse.<br>Those doubts can erupt into violence, particularly in countries that bore the brunt of Japanese expansionism: China and the Koreas. Anti-Japan riots broke out in China this year, triggered by the Japanese government's approval of a history textbook that critics say glosses over atrocities in the 1930s and '40s.<br>The main reason for the doubt is the awesome scope of Japanese brutality as Tokyo built an empire that, at its wartime height, stretched from deep in the Pacific to Southeast Asia.<br>The Japanese assault was merciless. Civilians were bombed, doused with biological agents, machine-gunned and subjected to cruel medical experiments. Tens of thousands of women were forced into brothels for Japanese troops. Prisoners were tortured, executed, starved or worked to death.<br>Ambivalent nation<br>But at bottom, the Japanese themselves have not decided how much remorse they feel, and their ambivalence is reflected in myriad ways that undermine their statements of regret.<br>On April 22, while Koizumi was apologizing for the war, at least one member of his Cabinet and more than 80 Japanese lawmakers visited Yasukuni Shrine, a bastion of the emperor-worship at the heart of Japan's imperialist ambitions and the burial place for executed World War II war criminals.<br>An increasingly powerful clique of nationalist educators is encouraging a rollback of mentions of Japanese atrocities from wartime accounts in school books.<br>Even the verdicts of the war crimes tribunal that sat in Tokyo from 1946 to 1948 are being prominently questioned.<br>Ground zero in Hiroshima, meanwhile, symbolizes a view of the war long engraved in Japanese hearts: that of Japan as victim.<br>That a single bomb on Aug. 6, 1945, could kill 140,000 people and another on Nagasaki three days later could kill 80,000 obliterated from Japanese consciousness the history of much of what preceded it: Japan's invasions of Asia, the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor.<br>Outside the city there is the Holocaust Education Center to teach Japanese about Nazi atrocities. Its operators insist they make no connection between the Holocaust and Hiroshima, but the museum's location resonates deeply with the Japanese view of the bombings as a slaughter of innocents.<br>And nowhere does the museum mention that Japan was Germany's ally during the war, or that Japanese soldiers, like the Nazis, perpetrated mass killings and medical experiments on human beings.<br>Nazi parallels<br>Comparison with Nazi Germany is not a welcome one in Japan. The stock response is that what the Nazis did the extermination camps, the atrocities on an industrial scale far overshadow the haphazard, disorganized way Japan ran roughshod over its victims.<br>Not everybody in Japan buys that reasoning.<br>Kiyoko Nakano, taking photographs with her husband beside the ruins of the Hiroshima dome, draws the standard Japanese lesson from the bombing of her hometown: that all killing of innocents is a crime and should be condemned.<br>But, unlike many Japanese, she includes her own country among the list of criminals and bitterly criticizes those who seek to obscure Japan's wrongdoing.<br>"They always want to hide those bitter experiences," she said. "But if we don't face ourselves, Japan can never progress."<br></div>

But to their mission's critics, the crews that dropped the atomic bombs on Japan were part of a war crime.<br>Three men involved in the attack on Hiroshima shared with the BBC their memories of a day that has stayed with them for 60 years.<br>Theodore "Dutch" Van Kirk - Navigator<br>Morris "Dick" Jepson - Weapons test officer<br>Dr Harold Agnew - Scientist, on observation plane<br>________________________________________<br>Theodore "Dutch" Van Kirk, 84<br>The day before the mission we sat through briefings on Tinian island where they told us who was assigned to which plane, and we ran through what we were going to do.<br><br>Mr Van Kirk (left) has never doubted the bomb's morality<br>About 2pm we were told to get some sleep. But I don't know how they expected to tell us were we dropping the first atomic bomb on Japan and then expect us to sleep.<br>I didn't get a wink. Nor did most of the others. But at 10pm we had to get up again because we were flying at 2.45am.<br>They briefed us that the weather was good, but they were sending weather observation planes up so we would have the best information on targeting Hiroshima.<br>We had a final breakfast and then went down to the plane shortly after midnight.<br><br>There was a great jolt on the aircraft and we were thrown off the floor. Someone called out 'flak' but of course it was the shockwave from the bomb<br><br>Dutch Van Kirk<br><br>Crew's joint statement<br><br>There was a lot of picture-taking and interviewing going on - by the military - and it was a relief to get in the Enola Gay about an hour before we took off.<br>We flew in low over Iwo Jima while the bomb crew checked and armed Little Boy (the uranium bomb) and once we cleared the island we began climbing to our bombing altitude of just over 30,000 feet.<br>It was perfectly clear and I was just doing all the things I'd always done as a navigator - plotting our course, getting fixes to make sure we were on course and reading the drifts so we knew the wind speed.<br>As we flew over an inland sea I could make out the city of Hiroshima from miles away - my first thought was 'That's the target, now let's bomb the damn thing'.<br>But it was quiet in the sky. I'd flown 58 missions over Europe and Africa - and I said to one of the boys that if we'd sat in the sky for so long over there we'd have been blown out of the air.<br>Once we verified the target, I went in the back and just sat down. The next thing I felt was 94,000lbs of bomb leaving the aircraft - there was a huge surge and we immediately banked into a right hand turn and lost about 2,000 feet.<br>We'd been told that if we were eight miles away when the thing went off, we'd probably be ok - so we wanted to put as much distance as possible between us and the blast.<br>All of us - except the pilot - were wearing dark goggles, but we still saw a flash - a bit like a camera bulb going off in the plane.<br>There was a great jolt on the aircraft and we were thrown off the floor. Someone called out 'flak' but of course it was the shockwave from the bomb.<br><br>Within a minute of the blast a white cloud had reached 42,000ft<br>The tail-gunner later said he saw it coming towards us - a bit like the haze you see over a car park on a hot day, but moving forwards a great speed.<br>We turned to look back at Hiroshima and already there was a huge white cloud reaching up more than 42,000 feet. At the base you could see nothing but thick black dust and debris - it looked like a pot of hot oil down there.<br>We were pleased that the bomb had exploded as planned and later we got to talking about what it meant for the war.<br>We concluded that it would be over - that not even the most obstinate, uncaring leaders could refuse to surrender after this.<br>In the weeks afterwards, I actually flew back to Japan with some US scientists and some Japanese from their atomic programme.<br>We flew low over Hiroshima but could not land anywhere and eventually landed at Nagasaki.<br>We didn't hide the fact that we were American and many people turned their faces away from us. But where we stayed we were made very welcome and I think people were glad that the war had ended.<br><br>Click here to return<br>Morris "Dick" Jepson, 83<br>I was a young second lieutenant in the US Air Force and was designated as the weapons test officer on the Enola Gay.<br><br>For Dick Jepson, the Enola Gay flight was his first combat mission<br>The bomb was designed to detonate when it was about 1,500 feet - or about one-and-a-half seconds - above the ground to ensure the maximum possible destructive range.<br>To that end it contained a range of radar-designated electronics.<br>In the run-up to the mission I had spent five months at Harvard and three months at MIT studying radar design.<br>For several months I worked on developing the electronics that would allow the bomb to detonate above the ground, flying test missions over southern California.<br>The Manhattan Project [to build the atomic bomb] was compartmentalised so the thousands of people working on it could not know the full details of the plan, but I was in no doubt I was training for an atomic bomb drop.<br>On the day of the mission, I had to perform some final tests on the electronics that operated the bomb.<br><br>Everyone's thoughts turned to what devastation there would have been down below - we all had that thought on our mind because we had seen what the bomb could do<br><br>Morris "Dick" Jepson<br>There was a box in the plane's forward compartment that connected to the bomb via a cable system.<br>My final job was to climb down into the bomb bay, crawl around the bomb and manually arm the device. I took out three testing plugs that isolated the bomb and put in three red firing plugs.<br>The most important thought in my mind was that this would detonate and end the war.<br>Unlike the others, this was the only combat mission I had been on, but there was only one point when I was apprehensive.<br>I knew how long it took for the bomb to fall and detonate - 43 seconds - so I counted but nothing happened. I just thought this was devastating.<br>But in the excitement I had counted too fast. That second, the crew reported a huge flash and it had gone off.<br>A few seconds later I felt the first blast wave.<br>There was a second shockwave and I knew by the delay that it had detonated at the right height - and this second wave was the force of the bomb bouncing back off the ground.<br>Everyone's thoughts turned to what devastation there would have been down below - we all had that thought on our mind because we had seen what the bomb could do.<br>But it was the right thing to do.<br><br>Click here to return<br>Dr Harold Agnew, 85<br>I had come from working on the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos and my abiding memory is of it being a very exciting time, working with all the best scientific minds of the day.<br><br>Dr Harold Agnew, with the plutonium core of the Nagasaki bomb<br>I describe myself as a 'grunt' at that time, I did what I was told to do. But I was part of a great undertaking.<br>For the Hiroshima mission I was on board The Great Artiste, a second B-29 that had tailed the Enola Gay to the bombing zone.<br>We'd flown alongside them all the way up there and were about four or five miles off to one side of Hiroshima, dropping gauges with parachutes that would measure the yield of the bomb.<br>After we dropped our gauges I remember we made a sharp turn to the right so that we would not get caught in the blast - but we still got badly shaken up by it.<br>I don't think anyone realised exactly what would happen. It was the only uranium bomb to be dropped.<br>My honest feeling at the time was that they deserved it, and as far as I am concerned that is still how I feel today.<br>People never look back to what led up to it - Pearl Harbour, Nanking - and there are no innocent civilians in war, everyone is doing something, contributing to the war effort, building bombs.<br>What we did saved a lot of lives in the long run and I am proud to have been part of it.<br>After the war I returned to the University of Chicago to continue my studies and later rejoined Los Alamos, where I eventually became director of the laboratory.<br>About three-quarters of the US nuclear arsenal was designed under my tutelage at Los Alamos. That is my legacy.</div>

The Japanese were forced to give plenty of perks , etc to these colonial powers. The Jap government then understood the need to build up economic powers so as not to be held ransom by the western forces.<br><br>The Jap government started its economic policy by building up industries. these industries were then passed to conglomerates called 'zaibatsus' It was these powerful business groups that financed the 2nd world war. To understand how this is possible, it must be said that these zaibatsus were the drivers of the economy. The top 5 zaibatsus; sumitomo, sanya, etc controlled abt half of the total economy. It was this strong backing that allowed the Japanese government to finance the war.<br><br>When the forces came in after the atomic bomb that had the Jap. surrendering, these zaibatsu were broken up. The family owners were forced to dissolve their company. In today's japanese economy, it is now controlled by kieretsu. technically, it is very much different from zaibatsus, in the sense that there is plenty of cross-holding of shares and control is horizontal not vertical.<br><br>With such and economic structure and with western companies taking a share into these kieretsu, the chances of a replay of the second world war is close to zero.<br><br></div>

Do u reckon their level of corruption will decrease? the field of developmental economics through empiracle studies have proven that corruption decreases when the country developes.<br><br>Yes i know that China managers take bribes. These are ad hoc cases but no doubt plentiful. i am talking as a whole and black sheep do exist.  but it has been proven that when a country developes, corruption lowers and environmental protectionism improves.<br><br>With reference to Japan, my main point is that, Japan would no longer be able to amass an attack on another nation without suffering repurcussion that will throw their economy back 200 years. Lets look at who is controlling their economy. the 6 main kieretsus; mitsui, mitsubishi, sumitomo, fuyo, sanwa and ikkan. these companies all have billions invested overseas. in any case where an attack is launch on any nation, these companies will face sanctions.<br><br>how would this stop Japan from attacking? simple. the Japan government works in a triangle, the kieretsus, political parties and beauracracies. political parties have backing from kieretsus. the kieretsus push for policies that favour trade.. they will nv agree to any plans that will jep[ardise their business. trying not to digress too much... lets go on to the next point.<br><br>what is global market? i might be missing your point and maybe u could rephrase it. i think u slightly misunderstood mine too (which reading back, is probably my fault for the wording and phrasing). but basically China has its hands full with the U.S and its own macro-fiscal policies. the market of China is such that it is actually made up of different markets with different policies and Beijing is trying to revamp the whole system. With these matters at hand, Singapore is the last country that China will focus its attention on.<br><br>Like u, although i am living abroad, i am a Singaporean. and Singapore is my home.. how are we going to reposition ourselves? maybe one day i will be able to confidently answer that. right now, nothing is certain and Singaporeans will need to be our toes as we find the right position to take in this global market.<br><br>i feel that i am probably not answering your question and rebuttals coz i can properly see where u r coming from ... many apologies</div>

Guanxi or networking isnt as straightforward as bribery, its recipocracy and relationship. Yes people do take bribes (so do s'poreans in that manner.. ) but forming 'guanxi' (using business terms and not a literal translation of Chinese) is actually a resource. that helps business overcome hurdles due to a lack of institutional resources and strong property rights (i cannot futher stress that it is not bribery).<br>if people are interested, do read up on books on 'guanxi' which there are many in the bookshops</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by ben1xy:</div><div class="quote_body">i accept your point. this are all what the Western scholars use to argue their case. lets do a hypothesis; if China reaches the living standards of Singapore. Do u reckon their level of corruption will decrease? the field of developmental economics through empiracle studies have proven that corruption decreases when the country developes.<br><br>Yes i know that China managers take bribes. These are ad hoc cases but no doubt plentiful. i am talking as a whole and black sheep do exist.  but it has been proven that when a country developes, corruption lowers and environmental protectionism improves.<br><br>With reference to Japan, my main point is that, Japan would no longer be able to amass an attack on another nation without suffering repurcussion that will throw their economy back 200 years. Lets look at who is controlling their economy. the 6 main kieretsus; mitsui, mitsubishi, sumitomo, fuyo, sanwa and ikkan. these companies all have billions invested overseas. in any case where an attack is launch on any nation, these companies will face sanctions.<br><br>how would this stop Japan from attacking? simple. the Japan government works in a triangle, the kieretsus, political parties and beauracracies. political parties have backing from kieretsus. the kieretsus push for policies that favour trade.. they will nv agree to any plans that will jep[ardise their business. trying not to digress too much... lets go on to the next point.<br><br>what is global market? i might be missing your point and maybe u could rephrase it. i think u slightly misunderstood mine too (which reading back, is probably my fault for the wording and phrasing). but basically China has its hands full with the U.S and its own macro-fiscal policies. the market of China is such that it is actually made up of different markets with different policies and Beijing is trying to revamp the whole system. With these matters at hand, Singapore is the last country that China will focus its attention on.<br><br>Like u, although i am living abroad, i am a Singaporean. and Singapore is my home.. how are we going to reposition ourselves? maybe one day i will be able to confidently answer that. right now, nothing is certain and Singaporeans will need to be our toes as we find the right position to take in this global market.<br><br>i feel that i am probably not answering your question and rebuttals coz i can properly see where u r coming from ... many apologies</div></blockquote>I am from Singapore.
