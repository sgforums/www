Try to lobby your Prime Minister to sever ties with China if it is such a horrible country as you see it. Go ahead!<br>But China will grow regardless. You can stay in your cocoon and get busy sprouting all your ridiculous anti-China sentiments. Still, China will improve and grow, as one of the forumites said, with or without your approval.

Barring the Govt Linked Chinese Company from buying a US oil company. I have already mentioned the british small factory owner who is afraid of what he described as the new wild west. Many in africa are certainly afraid that China is stealthily colonizing Africa.<br><br>From the posts here, it appears that Singaporeans who fear china growth feel that way because they think that PRCians have a long way to go intellectually and socially, and they are afriad that China's influence will grow faster than any improvements in 'mannerisms'.<br><br><blockquote><strong>The fear of china among many singaporeans are out of ignorance!! but nobody will accept that. We ask the unskilled chinese nationals to leave for taking up space but the ones we are really afraid of and are angry with are the ones with skills, who are competing with us for jobs. Whats wrong with unskilled chinese here, doing the jobs that we don't want to do, and we only pay them peanuts (oops, peanut now costs $600,000)??</strong></blockquote>Why do you say ignorance? Ignorance of what? Personally, i see nothing wrong with citizens being afraid of foreigners taking our jobs. The chinese/indians/fillipinos(sp?) can accept lower salaries because they are not based here. They do not have to support 2 kids through university in Singapore. They do not have a S$400000 mortgage to pay. I do not think that is an irrational fear. I do not however, have a solution to this problem. If we do not hire cheap workers, and the factories leave singapore, then we will have lost more jobs. Right now, at least these guys are paying taxes and some jobs are still in Singapore.<br><br></div>

There are good guys, bad guys, nice guys, ugly guy, and of course, the asssholes in every country, among every race, in every continent. You surely can find all kind of people among 1.2 billion chinese nationals. We need to learn to come to term with them, if not, you must not meet anyone anywhere! how not to meet any chinese nationals these days?</div>

Personally, i see nothing wrong with citizens being afraid of foreigners taking our jobs. The chinese/indians/fillipinos(sp?) can accept lower salaries because they are not based here. They do not have to support 2 kids through university in Singapore. They do not have a S$400000 mortgage to pay. I do not think that is an irrational fear. I do not however, have a solution to this problem. If we do not hire cheap workers, and the factories leave singapore, then we will have lost more jobs. Right now, at least these guys are paying taxes and some jobs are still in Singapore.<br><br></div></blockquote>Read my post again, we have no disagreement here. The real fear indeed is the FT taking our jobs at lower pay, not the unskilled labourers!! that is why we should not be asking for the unskilled to go home.<br><br>I have not heard of one valid reason why singapore should be afraid of china so far in the forum,  except when we looking at the size of china with a negative approach. If we can identify what we fear, then there is nothing to fear because we can work towards overcoming the fear. There appears to be fear that we cannot identify, because we don't know enough about china, or anything about china, that is ignorance.<br><br></div>

Times<br><br><blockquote><br>July 26, 2005 latimes.com : Opinion :<br><br>Robert Scheer:<br><br><strong>On China at least, Nixon was right</strong><br><br>"China will never make it economically."<br><br>That's what I was told four decades ago, during my days as a graduate fellow at UC Berkeley's Center for Chinese Studies. That widely shared pessimistic view was based on the notion that the Chinese economy, plagued by scarce resources and massive overpopulation, would never take off, no matter what ideology dominated.<br><br>Everyone knows those experts were wrong. China, despite having almost a billion more mouths to feed now and being far more dependent on foreign resources, is frightening not because of the prospect of its economic failure, but because of its success. You could smell panic over China's offer to buy Unocal.<br><br>Sadly, the prospect of hundreds of millions of people being lifted from abject poverty seems to alarm even leading Democrats in Congress, who claim to be driven by a standard of social justice. And many Republicans, who tend to trumpet the virtues of free trade when it involves the domination of world markets by U.S. businesses, are also raising the protectionist flag against the prospect of Chinese ownership of a single mid-size American-based oil company.<br><br>The signals we send to China have always been bizarrely mixed: Play in the capitalist ballpark but not so well that you become one of the big stars. It is a message that, as with the Japan-bashing of the 1980s, is at best paranoid and at worst racist. We in the West can be trusted with enormous economic power, but not the children of a lesser god.<br><br>The contradictions in U.S. policy were on full display last week when China untied its currency from the dollar, a move long demanded by American China-bashers. The upward valuation of the yuan was welcomed by those concerned about the U.S.-China trade imbalance; it also caused shivers of fear that China might not continue to lavishly invest in U.S. Treasury notes.<br><br>Of course, if you believe the protectionists, the trade imbalance with China is a reflection not of the hard work of the Chinese people but rather trickery on the part of China's leaders. Such irrationality is finding broad bipartisan congressional support. The House voted, 398 to 15, to condemn a sale of Unocal to the Chinese, alleging it would "threaten to impair the national security of the United States."<br><br>"Trade should be mutually beneficial, and it is certainly not with China," Sen. Byron L. Dorgan (D-N.D.) said.<br><br>Tell that to the American consumers storming Costco and Wal-Mart to buy affordable Chinese-made goods, or the millions who have benefited from low-interest mortgages made possible by the Chinese subsidization of our huge budget deficits under President Bush.<br><br>And why isn't it a good thing that China is seeking access to Unocal's cleaner-burning natural gas as a substitute for coal, thereby lessening the danger of global warming?<br><br>The fear-mongering must be confusing to Asians, who've been hectored by the West for two centuries about the ineffable beauty of free trade. Americans, for instance, don't think that Asians should feel in the least bit threatened because of Unocal's ownership of natural gas fields on their continent. That's just the market in action.<br><br>Upon examination, the national security argument against Chinese ownership is absurd. Access to oil is determined by the international market, and the only nation with the military power to implement or prevent a worldwide blockade of this or any other vital resource is the United States.<br><br>And consider the hypocrisy: The Senate that authorized the "preemptive" conquering of the nation with the second-biggest oil reserves on the planet is now challenging China's right to use dollars it earned exporting legal products to buy a U.S.-based multinational company.<br><br>The Bush administration, led on this issue by Treasury Secretary John Snow, has managed to bring some reason to the congressional debate, and for the moment thwarted the wilder suggestions to dramatically increase tariffs on Chinese goods. But that hasn't silenced the protectionist demagogues lurking in the political shadows eager to once again scapegoat the "yellow hordes" of China as an alternative to facing our serious, but domestically rooted, economic problems.<br><br>The protectionists must be defeated and U.S. policy should stay rooted in the wisdom of Richard M. Nixon Â— a prosperous China is good for us all. </blockquote></div>
