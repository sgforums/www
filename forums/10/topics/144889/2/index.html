The Chinese language system in Singapore is no different from that in China. Mandarin pronunciation still goes by the four tones: flat, rising, falling then rising, and falling. Chinese characters written in Singapore could be read with equal ease by readers in China.<br><br>Unless you're referring to the Chinese equivalent of Singlish, which incidentally is a improper bastardised form of English, there really isn't much distinction (other than the accent) between the Mandarin spoken in Singapore and the Putonghua spoken in China. The British have been laughing at the Americans for speaking an improper form of Queen's English -- the British invented the language anyway -- so what is wrong with the Chinese joking at Singaporeans for speaking an improper form of Mandarin/Putonghua?<br><br>As you've mentioned, the Chinese in Singapore and China share a common "cultural heritage". Language is part of that "cultural heritage". When a person feels his or her Chinese language is not up to par with the common standard, he or she should humbly work to improve and learn from the betters, rather than indignantly expect the betters to come down to the same level as him or her.<br><br>As long as the Chinese in Singapore are able to speak proper Mandarin without mixing English, Malay and other dialects, there is no reason why the Chinese from China would tease them for speaking the language, albeit with a different accent.</div>

Please stop putting words in my mouth. you presumed wrong and you are debating with your wrong presumtion.

We don't follow blindly what the PRC or the american tells us, but what has PRC told us and expect us to follow blindly? I see more followers of the american hawks here.<br><br>In learning chinese, singapore used traditional chinese until the late 70s or early 80 when we accepted over 6000 simplified chinese characters from china so that we can understand literature from mainland china better. They did not force us and todate, Hong Kong, Taiwan, even Malaysia are still using the old traditional chinese. We are  still the only one using simplified chinese characters outside of china. I believe we did this because we saw the need to understand them.<br><br>We also see that in mainland china, the old traditional chinese characters are being used again, some say the mainland scholars are beginning to appreciate the beauty of traditional writing, but I believe it was done to accommodate the taiwanese and hongkongers. There are a lot more exchanges in cultures among the different chinese then meet the eyes in singapore.<br><br>We should be using our chinese heritage and our sovereign national identity to our advantage in dealing with them. But first, we should know what is our chinese heritage? why do peranakan speak hokkien and not cantonese? why taiwanese would accept out hokkien readily but shanghainese would throw they "superior shanghainesee" at your face? (that is why mandarin is a compromise!) when do we speak english but show our singapore passports so that we will not be misunderstood as those lao wai?<br><br>A chinese used to tell me this, "we just came out of a pitch dark cave, many of us haven't seen light since we were born; you are the light, but we can't look at you as you expect, for we will be blinded by the bright glaring light. Lets find some other ways to work this out."<br><br>We need to go there to do business, we need their tourists to come here, we decide what we can gain if we engage them correctly, we know what we would lose if we blindly contain them.<br><br>Many singaporeans went to china and had bad experience in china, many sit in singapore and wonder what china is all about, fear begins to grow in some as they find they cannot grasp the truth. We see that these people are not sure what they need to know and they came up here and scream in their disillusion.  This is pathetic.<br><br>Lets hear out more opinions and information that can help us understand china better. Declaring them our potential enemy and waiting for them to come and understand us lead us nowhere.</div>
