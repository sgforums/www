Hehehehehe...<br><br>I can't, of course tell you exactly everything, but I can only tell you that Singapore in thr currently state is in no position to interfere or effect much balance... I suspect MM Lee intends to play middleman for US and China (afterall, isn't Singapore 70% <span style="font-style: italic;">Chinese</span>). But I am quite certain it will not work now. China-US is not Weaker China-Taiwan situation.<br><br>ASEAN itself is still too weak to do much. And... regretfully speaking, many academic <span style="font-style: italic;">experts</span> could be still day-dreaming...<br><br>You have to understand this, in order to effect a balance where Singapore stands to gain a lot, China would have to be re-educated. How'd a nation be re-educated? Not only so, in order to have a balance of interest, there must be a really good buffer, especially when US is already quite shaky.<br><br>If you say we should see China's growth as better opportunities... then you should first ask yourself one simple question:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Do you expect the Chinese premier to recognise the possibility of elevating the entire China whereby rich-poor gap will be totally minimised?</span><br><br>I tell you straight away... The answer is No.<br><br>Will China hence be a democratic nation?<br><br>I can also tell you straight away... Fat hope.<br><br>Why?<br><br>Because simply, in oriental China, it's Chinese to establish hierachies down to the very simplest social units. In order to hold these social units, you cannot democratised the way US divide itself into states. Doing so sow the seeds for huge mega rebellions, and social orders totally disrupted. But you cannot remove the Chinese characteristics as a whole.<br><br>Why?<br><br>Because if you cannot reduce rich-poor gap consistently, empty stomach always fire emotional flames and that creates political potential for chaos...<br><br>So in order to understand what you are dealing with, you'd have to understand even deeper.<br><br>Once you realise that, you'd find that if the world cannot contain China comfortably, the world must be ready. While the world is finding a balance to China, trying to close one eye on China's political issues is going to be a very bad idea... for it'd simply push China to an extreme. When the Hello Kitty grows to a full-flung jaws biting tiger... How is the world going to tame it?<br><br>Do you know that the more you conveniently let China by, the more the people's perception of greater China, China supremacy, Chinese arrogance and not forgetting... the urge for revenge...<br><br>The premier and the 1.5 billion of emotions... ... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>You ain't dealing with North Korea with the ultimate world police in charge.

Use your brain, see? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  Why would there be a struggle if passion of LKY could solve everything?<br><br>The simple reason is... Alright, let's assume now is 1960s, and you are the PM or secretary-gen, and you look at the candidates slating for elections... and you come across Mr LKY.<br><br>Would you choose him?<br><br>The answer is probably no. Too high a risk, said Lim Chin Siong. 'This guy has no background.'<br><br>You'd look at your biggest voters' base... 'This guy can't even read Chinese properly...'<br><br>Fong would tell you, 'Compare to David Marshal, this Kuan Yew probably'd never make it... is he as handsome as Elvis?'<br><br>If he was not Secretary-Gen... You'd probably shrug and say, 'Maybe get some heavy weight, like those Tan Tock Sengs who are dirt rich, well-known, speaks mandarin, old enough...'<br><br>If you even bother to think more, you'd realise that it was just that tine line between him governing and him staying in Sentosa... That was his fight he could not lose. And timing was on his side. Now, if the population would have been more educated, Barisan Socialis would surely prevail then.<br><br>Close shave eh? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>So you have to realise certain things in politics... from MM himself. He was really kinda political outcast, and he struggled, and the title of father of Singapore carried him far enough to where he need to be. The second or third LKY might not be that lucky. Firstly, they have to survive in the political apathetic environment due to the first LKY; secondly, they have to survive LKY himself.<br><br>Thirdly, they'd already migrate if they could... You see... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>So it's really luck if this second LKY fulfills the followings:<br><br>-Tahan the idiotic environment;<br>-Enters PAP and/or pull up by LKY;<br>-Haven't migrate/ most probably kena-ed stuck in Singapore;<br>-Haven't been suffering under PAP and turn against the incumbent;<br>-Still breathing.<br><br>But if you really wanna read, I suggest you find chance to talk personally with MM Lee himself... Most Singaporeans seldom get much beyond the stories by reading... If MM Lee still cares for Singapore, he'd truthfully tells you certain things...<br><br>Then you'd know how risky is the future of Singapore. And why he's so particular about talents... though how he perceive talents and such is another thing altogether.<br><br>It was reported that '...he who is like MM Lee would be a leader...'...<br><br>But the truth is... ...</div>

The market in China is fragmented and information is assymetrical. Culture difference between Western and Chinese companies are still wide.
