Without proper laws in place, there would always be people who would take advantage of other people. These people who are victimised, in turn make victims of others, and the vicious cycle just goes on.<br><br>Besides, this is not really "alien". The same situation occurred in the early years of Singapore's independent history. If not for the strict laws against corruption and breach of trust in Singapore, don't you think the same situation would have happened to Singaporeans as well?</div>

That means many ppl from shoe factories in Spain gonna be jobless.<br>And for garments, US still using the quota system to control china's garment export to US.<br>The most simple lighter(plastic, roller type) that we buy in mama shops for 0.7-1.0 SGD, is selling in china shops for 1RMB only. u can imagine how low is the manufacture cost.<br><br>In the past, car only manufacture cars for thier own chinese brands like "hong qi", "zhong hua".<br>Volkswagen went in to china, which the model "santana" become almost every taxis in china, with other models like "golf","passat","bora" etc, Volkswagen cars are the most common car u see in china.<br>For now, u can see "made in china(or at least assemble in china)" mazda(323), honda(odessy,Fit,Accord), buick, nissan(blue bird),toyota, hyundai(coupe,sonata,elantra), BMW, Ford, Peugeot, volvo, and even Cadilliac. I have missed out some brands too, there are more.<br><br>talking abt fake stuff, ya, some of them, in fact many of them still making fake stuff. But big companies are setting up thier own brand in china, which makes they import less from other countries.<br><br>The computer brand "Legend", makes chinese buy cheaper PC with same quality and same fuctions as foriegn brands., no need to buy Dell, IBM, Compaq.etc. "TCL" which manufactures PC monitors and handphones, affect the sales of philips monitor and nokia phones in china, cos they are much cheaper with similar quality.<br><br>And Home elec products, like TVs, air-con, hi-fi, etc, chinese got thier own brands, which helps the china citizens no need to buy expensive japanese brands. Esp. "haier" air-con, which is the most popular brand in china, offers good quality and service, so why pay more to buy jap brands?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There's nothing to worry about China and their "growing" economy. They (it's people) may outwardly appear to be "growing" or "advancing", but behind all that glitter and fancy flashy lifestyle, their still primitive mentally. Lacking in internationally acceptable mannerisms. They're just running too fast for themselves to catch up, that's all.<br><br>As a country, they may be huge, but they are also clumsy.<br><br>I tell you, No worries at all.<br><br>The only thing the whole world should be noticing about China, is their heavy investments in Military Weapons, and advancement in Military Technology.<br><br>Big bunch of fighting cocks, if you ask me.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmm..actually my opinion is based on the Pentagon report on whether China would prove a concern globally. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>It shows we're not the only ones worrying as well <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmmm.. china has a life span spanning 5000 yrs..  it took them great lengths to hold on to thier empire. I can just imagine if every city is as developed as Fujian ,  Shichuan and other few major cities, China can and will be the next super power on par with the US. The US is not upset or overly worried if you are behind them or doing something else..  they are worried that china is staying a step behind them.. following them. Basic example about China trying to buy over this american oil drilling company with such a huge amount of money that the US decides to bar them from buying the company over. China has the expertise but not the experience.. like i said.. they are following. Why u think the ang mo trying to learn chinese.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

If i remember correctly, the chinese company was a nationalised company and one argument put forth by a talking head on tv to explain the intervention is that this is a clash of ideologies - Communism vs Democracy.<br><br></div>

That means many ppl from shoe factories in Spain gonna be jobless.<br>And for garments, US still using the quota system to control china's garment export to US.<br>The most simple lighter(plastic, roller type) that we buy in mama shops for 0.7-1.0 SGD, is selling in china shops for 1RMB only. u can imagine how low is the manufacture cost.<br><br>In the past, car only manufacture cars for thier own chinese brands like "hong qi", "zhong hua".<br>Volkswagen went in to china, which the model "santana" become almost every taxis in china, with other models like "golf","passat","bora" etc, Volkswagen cars are the most common car u see in china.<br>For now, u can see "made in china(or at least assemble in china)" mazda(323), honda(odessy,Fit,Accord), buick, nissan(blue bird),toyota, hyundai(coupe,sonata,elantra), BMW, Ford, Peugeot, volvo, and even Cadilliac. I have missed out some brands too, there are more.<br><br>talking abt fake stuff, ya, some of them, in fact many of them still making fake stuff. But big companies are setting up thier own brand in china, which makes they import less from other countries.<br><br>The computer brand "Legend", makes chinese buy cheaper PC with same quality and same fuctions as foriegn brands., no need to buy Dell, IBM, Compaq.etc. "TCL" which manufactures PC monitors and handphones, affect the sales of philips monitor and nokia phones in china, cos they are much cheaper with similar quality.<br><br>And Home elec products, like TVs, air-con, hi-fi, etc, chinese got thier own brands, which helps the china citizens no need to buy expensive japanese brands. Esp. "haier" air-con, which is the most popular brand in china, offers good quality and service, so why pay more to buy jap brands?<br></div></blockquote>One small-factory owner i knowdescribed China as being akin to the wild west. Clearly, he is afraid of China because of how cheap you can manufacture things there. More than that, however, i think there is consternation at how China is seemingly not playing 'fair', that the low cost is in part due to the lack of regulation by the Chinese govt.</div>
