Any flaw multiplied or magnified just becomes more stink. I only take a bit of shit from the singapore government, bo pian! But I take no shit from other countries, whether malaysia, america or china, and american's shit don't stink, or smell better? I don't think so.<br><br>How will china develop into the future, with flaws mulitiplied and magnified? unlikely! some flaws will stay, new flaws appears, but most old flaws will disappear. I believe china will improve, in humanity along with its economy, may be not in the same pace but it will certainly improve.<br><br>But the realy issue is, china's growth or no growth WILL influence us, one way or another, and the influence will only grow stronger, whether we like it or not! We need to pray that china contain the bird flu and SARS, just like the brits and americans containing their mad cow diseases, and the malaysian containing their pig disease. We banned beef from UK and america, we banned pork from malaysia and  rejected shipments of vegetables from malaysia and china due to high pesticides contamination, we can even ban tourists from china but can we ban our people from travelling to china for business???<br><br>The fear of china among many singaporeans are out of ignorance!! but nobody will accept that. We ask the unskilled chinese nationals to leave for taking up space but the ones we are really afraid of and are angry with are the ones with skills, who are competing with us for jobs. Whats wrong with unskilled chinese here, doing the jobs that we don't want to do, and we only pay them peanuts (oops, peanut now costs $600,000)??<br><br>Unless we take a positive and constructive approach towards china, or india, we will never come to terms with the growth of these giants, soon we will have nightmares and then go into depression. sigh......<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>China was to blame for not responding quickly to the Sars epedemic when it stared. But you may also wish to know that after the government realized the severity and magnitude of the disease, it made everything related to Sars transparent internationally. Subsequently the Chinese and American virologists worked together for a vaccine of Sars, albeit unsuccessfully. If China had already honestly admitted its mistake and had taken concrete measure to reverse the situation, then it would not be fair for anyone to incessantly lambaste criticisims. After all, Sars is all behind us, with lessons drawn,  so that should future epidemics strike, hopefully, a more responsive action would be taken.<br><br>I do not think Bird Flus originated from China. I remember one year ago there was a Bird Flu outburst in Malaysia and affected the egg supply in Singapore. I dont remember that particular incident hacing anything do do with China.<br><br>As to the natural disasters, the government have always reacted as fast as they could. After all, it is human lives at stake. Do you read the news?<br><br>Which general said that? Was he supposed to speak for the government? I doubt. If not, then whatever he said could not be taken to be official opinion of the Chinese government and thus could not be used as evidence in your criticisms of China.<br><br>What makes you think I do not understand English?

            <div class='col-md body'>Are you aware of the connotations of the term "Chink"? Do you know that in the country where the term originated, namely the US, it is a derogatory term for all people with East Asian appearance (that would include Japanese, Koeans and yes, Singapore Chienese as well)? You would be a chink yourself. So stop using the term if you do not really know what it means.<br><br>Yaoming disgracing the entire nation? Really? How about Singapore?
