Even the US industrial and political leaders had acknowledged that China is a market that is cannot be ignored. The recent RMB evaluation has caused much stir in the Forex market, and had done US a favour in holding down the USD for boasting the export which is a gift to Mr Geoge Bush.

See the difference?<br><br>Singapore needs to continue to maintain the good relationship with both US and China. It is going to be very tricky, but the first step should be sending our bright scholars to China top notched university for study.

This will enhance our knowledge on the Far East Bloc and with these knowledge we can make better policies on riding the Dragon wave.<br><br></div></blockquote>Totally agree... send the scholars out make sure they don't come back... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  Our scholars should show those Chinese scholars Singapore is the best, and compete out there for their lifetime. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Kidding lah...<br><br>But you see, actually we do have many such exchanges... but what we really need is not such sending scholars out there come back make better policies. That won't solve the problems. We even have mainland Chinese high notch migrants to Singapore... so? Don't they know even better than scholars sent to China for educational exchanges? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>If such exchange were to be effected to learn the better ways from China as Japan had done so to westernise, it'd be quite efficient. If you are talking about political upgrading due to such exchanges... that could be another thing.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I have been living in China for the past few years. I am not worried about China's rise. It has already been proven that China throughout most of its history preferred to focus their ambitions on developments at home rather than expansions aboard.  Unlike Japan, China has never posed any threat to peace and security of Asia.<br><br>In fact in recent years more and more people from around the world think of China as a good place to live and are migrating there in huge numbers.

The Chinese government is actually doing a better job fighting corruption than most other developing nations. In fact if u compare China with other big developing nations (Russia, India, Indonesia), China is actually the least corrupted.

A government official said Friday the government unofficially told China of the decision.<br><br>It could formally notify China during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Busan in November. Giving China market economy status is expected to affect Korean businesses, since that status makes it difficult for Korea to take punitive measures against China like anti-dumping tariffs. When joining the World Trade Organization in 2001, China accepted the condition that it would not insist on market economy status for 15 years.<br><br>But Beijing has won market economy status from 40 individual countries including 10 ASEAN members, Australia and Peru. The U.S. and European Union granted Russia market economy status in 2002 but rejected ChinaÂ’s request. Japan maintains it will not grant China the status until 2016 in accordance with the WTO condition. China officially asked Korea to grant it market status in April last year.<br><br>Market economies cannot be penalized as extensively as non-market economies. In the case of dumping, Korea can penalize a non-market economy based on the domestic prices of a market economic country whose industrial situation is similar to ChinaÂ’s rather than on Chinese domestic prices.

The Chinese academic thus becomes the first foreign student to graduate in both North and South Korea. Â“Having studied on both sides of the peninsula, I hope reunification can happen soon,Â” Li said.<br>Â“Despite the large difference in culture between the North and South, they are the same in their love of drink, song and dance,Â” he said. Â“I often think thatÂ’s why they are both Korean. Also, one common factor among the two peoples is the fact that they are warm and considerate of the feelings of others, which is their strong point.Â”<br><br>Li was chosen as a national scholarship student in 1983 when he was 17 and went abroad to study at Kim Hyeong Jik College of Education in North Korea.<br><br>He majored in educational psychology, graduated in 1989 and returned to his hometown of Shandong, were he worked as an official tour guide. In 1992, after Korea established diplomatic ties with China, South Korean academics visited Mt. Baekdu from the Chinese side, and as a tour guide Li was with them some 60 times and met many of the staff at Sungkyunkwan University.<br><br>Â“I have always liked literature, and speaking with them revived my passion,Â” he said. After some hesitation, he finally entered Sungkyunkwan University in 1998.<br><br>Asked about the differences between North and South Korean students, Li said, Â“Most North Korean students are quite bright and selfless. However, as their military service is long there are many college students in their 30s, which is too bad.Â”<br><br>By contrast, he was Â“impressed how liberal and animated South Koreans are. Still, the way senior students treat freshmen is very severe.Â”<br><br>Li is to teach Korean literature at Shandong University starting Monday.<br><br>(englishnews@chosun.com )<br><br></div>

You have a cartel of countries who represent the supply side. I think if major countries on the demand side of the oil domain are able to pool their resources and requirements, I think itÂ’ll put them in a better position at the negotiating table with the states in the supply cartels. We have an OPEC for the oil producers, I think there is a case for an OSEC or oil consumers kind of consortium. And in Asia, countries like India, China and perhaps at some point, Indonesia, plus Korea and Japan who also have large oil requirements, could pool their efforts together. I think itÂ’s inevitable actually.<br><br>JT: What could be included in the initial steps for this collaboration?<br><br>UB: Well, I think there is a clear interlink today between the energy dimension along with the growth rates and the environmental impact. So I think we need to do some consultation between the long term energy supply and demand. And the correlation with economic activity and impact on the environment because of greenhouse gases, and the commitments which the Kyoto protocol represents. So I think we need a kind of strategic dialogue, which would be strategic in a non-military sense. That is if we can make reasonable projections into the future, I think we have to carry out very informed assessments. So that there is a sense of cooperative effort as far as major oil consumers and the demand side is regulated in the appropriate manner. I also foresee a point in the not too distant future when these countries might have to look at alternate sources of energy. Now, whether these are solar, whether theyÂ’re wind or nuclear, will depend on individual countries and their own options and constraints. But hypothetically, whether we talk about nuclear or the wind, I think again, a certain degree of cooperation will be mutually beneficial.<br><br>JT: Should the United States and Europe be worried by such a deal between India and China?<br><br>UB: I think not. As I believe energy will very soon become the driving force or the driving determinant for many bilateral and multi-lateral relations. And given the United States own dependence on hydro-carbons at this point in time, I think the US itself could also be brought on board, so that there is a sense of transparency, and whatever China and India are proposing to do that in the long term would not be detrimental to a country such as the United States.<br><br>JT: What will this collaboration mean for western oil firms who have not been able to compete on the same level as these state-backed oil firms from China and India?<br><br>UB: Well, I think the fact that the western oil forms did not bid for Petrokazakhstan is not an indication that they would be outbid or that they did not want to. I think as far as western countries are concerned, I think here we have a clear political dimension which is the way that the governments of individual countries, whether itÂ’s the United States or Japan, are looking at hydrocarbons. ThatÂ’s one aspect. The second is the degree in which they are looking at it from a purely business and commercial point of view, which is another strategic dimension. My understanding of the Petrkazakhstan deal, was that the Chinese were determined to get it and this happened in the back drop of the attempt by CNOOC for UNOCAL, and the fact that they did not get it, I think ChinaÂ’s determination and the fact that China would have paid a price that was higher than what others were willing, was more or less evident. So I think there was a sense of prudence that may have dictated the response of the western oil companies.<br><br>Commodore Uday Bhaskar, from the Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses, in India.<br></div>

Talks are also under way with South Korea, which Mr. Ong says has shown more flexibility than Japan in negotiations.<br><br>ASEAN's head has warned Tokyo that it is being too inflexible in trade talks, and that could have consequences. The leader of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations - ASEAN - is warning Japan that it could lose its position in the regional market to rivals such as South Korea, unless it compromises more in free trade talks.<br><br>ASEAN Secretary-General Ong Keng Yong says the 10 nations of the group want to expand exports to Japan. However, they are frustrated by what ASEAN says is Tokyo's unwillingness to open its market more to tropical fruit and other agricultural products.<br><br>"We are now reaching a critical point," said Secretary General Ong. "I now believe that we should look for re-establishing a normal trade relationship. Yes, you have some difficulties in regard to certain products. We can find a way to overcome it. But for some other products for which you do not really grow, why pay such a high price?"</div>

Four ships have run aground in the area -- 1,700 kilometers southwest of Tokyo -- in the past 10 years.<br><br>Nagasaki said the plan has not yet been approved.<br><br>His comments followed a report by the Yomiuri newspaper Thursday saying the coast guard would build an unmanned, solar-powered lighthouse in the area by March 2007.<br><br>Japan claims the Okinotorishima outcroppings -- heavily fortified by cement embankments -- are islands that enable it to extend its exclusive economic zone far into the Pacific.<br><br>Yomiuri said the coast guard will ask for 30 million yen in its budget request for fiscal 2006 ending March 2007 to build the lighthouse.<br><br>China says Okinotorishima is only a couple of rocks, not islands governed by rules of sovereignty. The land therefore can't be used by Japan to extend its economic zone and prevent Beijing from exploiting the natural resources in the surrounding Pacific Ocean area, Beijing says.<br><br>The dispute heated up last year after a Chinese research ship twice came within 370 kilometers of the crags, triggering a diplomatic protest by Japan. China said the ship was conducting scientific exploration on the "high seas."<br><br>Japan has been stepping up efforts to boost its claim that Okinotorishima is an island.<br><br>In May, Tokyo's outspoken nationalist governor made a one-day trip to the islands and kissed a plaque bearing the islets' name: "Okinotorishima, Japan." He also released fish from a boat near the islet.<br><br>As attention to the Okinotorishima islets increases, dozens of people have started moving their permanent address there. About 70 households have registered the islets as their permanent address, according to Tokyo's Ogasawara Village, which has jurisdiction over Okinotorishima. (AP)<br><br>August 25, 2005<br></div>

It's already a 100,000 copy print," a spokesman for Shinyusha, publisher of the controversial book, tells Shukan Shincho.<br><br>"Kenkanryu" tells the story of a Japanese high schoolboy who becomes interested in Japan-South Korean relations when the two countries co-host soccer's World Cup in 2002. He goes on to university, where he joins the history club and discusses with a group of Japan-born-and-raised Koreans prickly issues involving Japan and South Korea.<br><br>The Japanese student accuses his country's leaders of kowtowing to Korean protests and paying out huge sums of money in connection with such issues as Japanese colonial rule and comfort women, the weekly says. It also puts a strong anti-Korean stance on its handling of disputes between the countries, such as the rightful ownership of the islands Japan calls Takeshima, as well as Japan's annexation of Korea in 1910.<br><br>Korean media have been outraged by the manga; it's three largest newspapers already running pieces condemning it.Sharin Yamano, the little-known manga artist who created "Kenkanryu," is described as a man in his early 30s, whose star sign is Leo and blood of type B. He has written a love-comedy manga, but also worked stints as a designer and illustrator. He has gone on record as saying the work was inspired by ultra-nationalist comic writer Yoshinori Kobayashi.<br><br>"Kenkanryu" comes with a belt loudly proclaiming it as: "A controversial work publishing companies deemed too dangerous to print."<br><br>Indeed, several publishers turned it down before Shinyusha agreed to pick it up.<br><br>"Yamano brought in the original work to publishing companies, but most of them turned him down, saying things like there would be big problems if he got any of his historical facts wrong and that the publishing company bosses would have to attend enlightenment lectures given by (Korean residents groups) Chongryun and Mindan," the editor of "Kenkanryu" tells Shukan Shincho.<br><br>Other print media has also shunned the manga, with the Mainichi among the major newspapers to refuse to advertise "Kenkanryu."<br><br>Byon Jil-il, managing editor of the Tokyo-based "Korea Report," says he is not surprised that a book like this has come onto the market.<br><br>"Even I thought the South Korean boom that started with (Korean TV drama) 'Winter Sonata' was too much. The resistance to this boom has deep roots," Byon tells Shukan Shincho. "This manga has effectively tapped into this sentiment. And I think that's why it's selling so well."

Some experts are saying that the US could withdraw its security commitments to Taiwan if the people of the democratic nation decide not to take visible steps to defend their country against the possibility of a military attack from China.<br><br>"The US has been impatient at the government's inability to get the special arms bill passed," Chang Kuo-cheng (Â�ÂˆÂ‡Ã¸Â³Ã‡), the former director of the Democratic Progressive Party's department of Chinese affairs, said.<br><br>"But the US has been even more concerned about whether the boycott of the arms bill by the pan-blue parties and its voters signifies an indifferent attitude by Taiwanese toward their country's defense," he said.<br><br>"This would imply that there would be the possibility of a peaceful unification with China in the future," he said.<br><br>Chang noted that if the US concluded that unification was possible, the country would gradually withdraw its security commitments toward Taiwan and would stop selling advanced weaponry to the country, because Washington would be concerned that the technology might fall into the hands of the People's Liberation Army (PLA).<br><br>Chang said that since the pan-blue's boycott of the arms procurement bill has been through legislative procedures -- a democratic process -- it might be considered a sign that Taiwanese don't see China as a threat. The US would have no choice but to accept the decision reached by the people of a democratic county, Chang added.<br><br>He said a vicious circle might occur if the pro-China trend gets stronger in Taiwan, and that once the US gradually withdrew its security commitments toward the ocuntry, the military weakness of the nation would make even more Taiwanese accept the pro-China approach.<br><br>Chang said history showed that the US had abandoned its security commitments toward foreign countries when necessary. He said the US had abandoned former president Chiang Kai-shek's (ÃŠYÂ½Ã©ÃŠÂ¯) Nationalist government and had withdrawn from South Vietnam.<br><br>In fact, the US closed its embassy in Taiwan on March 1, 1979, under the administration of then-president Chiang Ching-kuo (ÃŠYÂ½Â›Â‡Ã¸), and established the Taiwan Relations Act in the same year.<br><br>Chang said "the US would lose few strategic interests in East Asia if Taiwan reconciled with China or even unified with the country in the future."<br><br>Chang said that "the US understands" that China would not confront Washington and Tokyo in the Pacific Ocean after it unifies with Taiwan.<br><br>"China's strategic interests are in the country's west and south, its oil supply resources and its transportation sea lanes -- not in the east," Chang said.<br><br>He said that because of its huge business interests with the US and Japan, China would have no interest in confronting those two countries in the Pacific Ocean.<br><br>Chang said that if China unified with Taiwan, it would immediately declare Taiwan a demilitarized area, and also ensure that sea-lanes through the Taiwan Strait were safe for the US, Japan and other countries.<br><br>On the other hand, Ou Si-fu (ÂšWÃ¥aÂ¸Â»), a researcher with the Institute for National Policy Research, who has also provided research papers on the PLA for the Mainland Affairs Council and Ministry of National Defense, said the US would not withdraw its security commitments toward Taiwan, because the US would want to use a containment policy toward China.<br><br>Ou said that the US had 80 P-3C Orion maritime patrol aircraft stationed in Japan, and Japan itself had 120 P-3Cs intensively patrolling the waters of East Asia, including the waters around Taiwan.<br><br>"That means that the US would not decrease its military deployments in East Asia even if Taiwan was unable to defend itself," Ou added.<br><br>Ou said, however, that the US does not have to rely on Taiwan to defend the so-called the "first island chain," which runs from the Aleutians through Japan, South Korea, Okinawa, Taiwan and the Philippines to Singapore, because China has geographic disadvantages in regards to the Pacific Ocean.<br><br>He said Chinese submarines must pass through one of the few narrow passages in order to enter waters off of eastern Taiwan, and that the US and Japan's advanced anti-submarine forces could easily bottle up the Chinese subs there.<br>This story has been viewed 2360 times.<br></div>

At least that's the message of "Three Billion New Capitalists: The Great Shift of Wealth and Power to the East." The author is Clyde Prestowitz, a veteran Asia watcher who began his career as a trade negotiator in the Reagan Administration. Prestowitz thinks all those factory workers in China and outsourcing jobs in India you keep seeing on the news are just the beginning of an economic tidal wave that Americans had better learn to live with, better learn to contend with. We sat down with Prestowitz recently to discuss the book.<br><br>PAUL SOLMAN: What's the basic thesis of "Three Billion New Capitalists"?<br><br>CLYDE PRESTOWITZ: We're in the middle of a two- part revolution. Three billion new people, billion and a half Chinese, billion Indians, half a billion people from former Soviet bloc, have suddenly come into the global economy all at one time. Within these three billion people is a population as big as the United States, bigger than anybody in Europe or Japan, who are every bit as skilled and can do anything that could be done in the U.S. or Japan or any of the developed countries for ten cents on the dollar.<br><br>PAUL SOLMAN: When you say "every bit as skilled," you don't mean as skilled as our top doctors, our top scientists --<br><br>CLYDE PRESTOWITZ: No, I do. I mean, as good as us or better. They've got their PhD's from Harvard and MIT, they've worked at the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta; they've been top professors at top U.S. universities. They've started companies in Silicon Valley with Silicon Valley venture capital. They are every bit as skilled and they can do this for 10 percent maybe 25 or 30 percent on the dollar.<br><br>PAUL SOLMAN: So why do they go back to their home countries?<br><br>CLYDE PRESTOWITZ: Because they got great opportunities. People who have that kind of a background in the U.S., going back to India today or going back to China today have just wonderful opportunities to start companies, to do things, to build things in their own country that are going to push those countries to be the winners of the 21st Century.<br><br>PAUL SOLMAN: So then in your view, the outsourcing we've been hearing so much about is just the tip of the iceberg?<br><br>CLYDE PRESTOWITZ: Just the beginning, yeah. And that's the second revolution. Not only have you had three billion people come in, but the Internet and FedEx have canceled time and distance. So anything that you do on the Internet, it's two seconds from any other place in the world; two seconds from Boston to Bangalore. And even if you're working in atoms, even if you're producing and actually have to deliver something, FedEx can deliver anything anywhere in the world in 36 hours. So effectively, all these people are right across the table.<br><br>PAUL SOLMAN: So what do we do? Are you just going to tell me we have to knuckle down, study harder, go to school longer, retrain our workforce?<br><br>CLYDE PRESTOWITZ: We have to do that. Our educational system is an embarrassment, and we definitely have to do that but that in and of itself is not enough. We need to have a new approach to international economics. And one of the things that needs to be addressed is something like the following: U.S. semiconductor manufacturers, despite the fact that the U.S. is the best place to make these kinds of products, are increasingly looking at putting plants elsewhere. In fact, two-thirds of the semiconductor plants being built today are being built in Asia. And you ask yourself, "Well, if the U.S. is the best place to make these things, why are they putting the plants in Asia?"<br><br>And the answer is because the economic development boards of Singapore and Malaysia and China and many of these countries are visiting regularly the executives of these companies and saying, you know, "What would it take to get you to my country? How about a tax holiday; how about a capital grant?" And you know you're talking $3 billion investment, so if a government is willing to put up $1 billion or $2 billion, that's a lot. So in effect, they bribe these plants to come there and this, of course, has nothing to do with market forces. It has nothing to do with Adam Smith and all the free trade theory that we talk about. And yet, the U.S., both Democrat and Republican administrations, has never responded to this.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>PAUL SOLMAN: You know, this reminds me of what you were saying fifteen or twenty years ago. The United States had to come up with a national, competitive industrial policy or else-- it was Japan back then-- was going to eat our lunch. But the U.S. economy has been doing pretty well almost ever since.<br><br>CLYDE PRESTOWITZ: But the point is this: In response to the challenge that Japan posed in the '80s, the United States Government actually did a lot of things. We established, for example, Sematech, a joint industry and U.S. Government-funded research and development organization to promote development of the U.S. semiconductor equipment industry.<br><br>We negotiated agreements with Japan which stopped Japanese dumping of chips in the U.S. market and which opened the Japanese market to substantially more foreign penetration than had taken place before. People forget that because the success of the U.S. in the '90s is always attributed to the wonderful qualities of U.S. entrepreneurial capitalism, and certainly it had something to do with that, but it's wrong to dismiss the impact of the response of U.S. government policies through the challenges posed by Japan in the '80s.<br><br>And what we're seeing now is kind of a rerun of the whole Japan story in the '80s, except that the numbers are bigger, there are more players, and one of these players is a very different kind of player than Japan, a much tougher player than Japan: China.<br><br>PAUL SOLMAN: But economically, America is growing, isn't it, faster than Europe, faster than Japan?<br><br>CLYDE PRESTOWITZ: Right. But this growth of ours is fueled by debt. The U.S. has swung from being the world's biggest net creditor to being the world's biggest net debtor to the tune of $3 trillion, growing at $700 billion a year. We're now soaking up as a country, 80 percent of available global savings.<br><br>Well when you hit 100 percent, the music stops. Paul Volcker has said publicly 75 percent chance of a major financial crisis in the next five years. Warren Buffett has bet something like $20 billion of Berkshire Hathaway Funds investing in foreign currencies. George Soros has made a bet against the dollar. They're all looking at these numbers and they're saying, this doesn't compute.<br><br>PAUL SOLMAN: But given the trends you're citing, what real hope is there, even if we come up with a national economic strategy, work harder, study harder and so on?<br><br>CLYDE PRESTOWITZ: Let me give you hope, let me give you hope. They face huge challenges, too. We have -- if you think of this as a game of bridge, and ask yourself whose hand would you like to play-- China's hand, India's hand, U.S. hand -- I'll take the U.S. hand any day. We've got more trumps and aces than anybody else.<br><br>We've got stable institutions. We've got the best graduate schools. We have got the best infrastructure. We've got an entrepreneurial culture. We reduce risk in this society to encourage people to fail and try again. We have challenges on the pollution side and global warming, energy and so forth, but if you look at China and India, enormous challenges in pollution, trying to find clean water, just trying to find enough water in northern China and much of India, huge task. Energy, they're just beginning to become big energy users.<br><br>They don't have much at home. So they're going to have to go out and become much more dependent on the Middle East, for example, than we are; AIDS, health issues. In China, aging -- China in ten, fifteen years is going to age very rapidly and the population's going to begin to shrink. The "one child" policy means that you got two parents and one child. How do the pension and healthcare issues get taken care of?<br><br>That's an area where India actually has a great advantage. India's demographics are good. Less -- half the population is under the age of 25 in India, which is why I'm betting on India as the winner of the 21st Century. But they face enormous challenges. And the good thing is this: We want them to succeed. The worst thing in the world would be a failed China and India. That would be a threat to us as well as to them. So we want them to succeed and create a complementary economic relationship that lets them win and lets us win.<br><br>But the key here again is that we have to get our minds around the fact that we need to think about winning and we need to think about competing, and we need to think about having a strategy that enables us to do the things that are necessary to meet that challenge.<br><br>PAUL SOLMAN: Clyde Prestowitz, thanks very much.<br><br>CLYDE PRESTOWITZ: My pleasure.</div>
