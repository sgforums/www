              <p>that's the problem. they will hire more of their own firedns and buddies come in. unless its a corporate decision on big issues nothing can be done on minor issues regarding work. and turst me these people are very bonded even they got own families, unlike singaporeas who are separated and keep killing one another in jobs. you see lots of recruiters now FTs. somehow mayb they got their PRS or citizenship but their accent never fades. i don;t feel safe with them looking at our personel particulars. they are also in HR i think SG is SG no more. </p>

              <p>I said 'esp from India'  because India is a huge country with English as their communication, medium of instructions and teaching.</p>
              <p>India's Indians presence here is huge. I think not just in the public sector. Ask any private sector and you get a sense of the picture. Indian applicants are huge in sg. </p>
              <p>But the reality on the ground is that anyone from anywhere can apply for jobs in sg. You get teachers from Britain teaching in our sec school, doctors from eastern europe etc etc.  </p>
              <p>About cultures from Indian and China, you should ask moe, not me. </p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>like Arapahoe said, it's a dog eat dog world out there. u guys complain foriegn talent has infiltrated singapore. true. that has happened, and there is no doubt it will worsen. thing is, my friends, THIS is a problem anywhere else in the world, even in the 'free' heaven u call america. since i've raised america, let's talk abt it. today, in almost every major ivy league university, more than 50 percent is dominated by foriegners(complain abt our schools and scholars from vietnam?). Even in sillicon valley, huge names like microsoft, apple and dell have all declared that they are desperately looking for chinese(singaporeans, preferably cos we can speak english:) ) and indian physicists and researchers and even now, most of the R&amp;D departments in sillicon valley are already dominated by indians and chinese. NASA employs tons of indian researchers, but hires so few of their own americans, and it is a well-known fact many big names put foriegners as higher priorities. thing here is, LOOK at the world now. it isnt the PAP's fault per se, but perhaps u could blame it on globalisation. blame PAP? would u guys like to blame the Obma and the democrats? Cameron and the british admin? truth is, anywhere u go, be it usa or britain or france, there is always foriegn talent perpetuation, and no matter what u say, it is inevitable anywhere in the world, save for malaysia or indonesia with their maly-protectionist policies, but look at the state they r in.</p></div>
