              <p>Seriously, if Singaporeans don't stick together and do something for their country, rather then feeling anxiety, then scared, then vote for incumbent, this country is doomed. Do you want your children, who will be supporting you in the next 50 years, be subjected to betrayal as per below?</p>

              <p>whenever our govt said, that it is hard to rule a diverse multicultural and multiracial society, I would challenge them that because of the differences, govt knows that singaporeans will not stick together as one, and that allow them to do whatever they want, because singaporeans are individualistic people, and that is exactly what the govt wanted and singaporean fall into it, because as individual, you can do nothing. So, being multiracial and multicultural work to our govt advantage, that is why I said , govt works smart</p>

              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">I was cycling around Singapore one day, and reached right down to Tuas South Avenue 16.  A huge amount of land had been recently reclaimed and there were brand new factories sitting upon it.  I spoke to an informed friend that night, who said that an arrangement had been made to reclaim that particular bit of land and to sell or lease it under an umbella private organisation.  That organisation happened to be owned by a relative of a the MIW.  I looked up the website of that company to find not a mention of who was behind the company.  So here we had an extremely expensive bit of reclamation by some government body, changing the shape of the map on the nightly weather, funded by God-knows-who, and profited by somebody with some family link to the government.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">I continued back home, reaching the edge of the HDB estates a long while later, and realised as clear as day that Singaporeans are nothing in this scheme.  They are a segregated bunch living in workers quarters with play-pen coffee shops while industrial-sized projects are going full-steam ahead 24/7 with profits handed to the few.  I understood then, that since Singaporeans complain so much (and rightly so, as it is their country and it's being stolen from them), then as unimportant and replaceable ants, that it makes perfect sense to replace them with cheaper alternatives that complain less.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">This is the reality of it.  I don't think it will or can end in the next election, but something in the future may provide a hope.  A split of the PAP which will very likely happen after LKY's passing?</p>

              <p>Singapore wants to ride above the intensive global competitions by going high tech, high value, innovation based.</p>
              <p>We gets China/India Phds to come for research and study. They come because the money conversion rate is good but these people are also smart to know that end of their slogs, the results belong to the uni or research institution or company or Singapore.</p>
              <p>So? They did what they need to get by and bring the 'real' results to China/India for further refinement or mass production (and cheaper cost).</p>
              <p>Reap their own rewards! Why give it to Singapore?. Even if it is blatant copyright infringement, so what? How is Singapore or Singapore govt going to catch them?  <br><br>So you see, we have been talking and talking, pumping money and money and high profiling and profiling high tech, high value, innovation based industries but really where are the results so far?</p>

              <p><br>PAP had set the future for you, they already have the blueprint for the future in the next making of Singapore, for the youngs, the adults and old alike, if you dun vote for PAP, whatever past, present and future would had no significant anymore, everything will be focus on political struggle rather than social and economy building, there will certainly be no future.</p>

              <p>I know of a european bank.</p>
              <p>They dun want to hire european system analysts n programmers cause of the strict labour law n life time employment over there.</p>
              <p>They offshored the european main office's job here in sg. But they also dun want to hire sinkies cause they can't squeeze n whip them for more o/t.</p>
              <p>They only hire indian and pinoy with over ten years exp. Pay them 10k to 20k per mth on contract basis. 10k to 20k compare to hiring a european - still cheapo.</p>
              <p>The ah neh and pinoy all dancing mad at this. They can retire rich in their home town. But some ah neh and pinoy  - more clever. They know that with 10k to 20k salary, they are still a class above the ordinary sinkies and maybe lord over them someday.</p>
