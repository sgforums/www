              <p>I was in WAtson and as usual met  PRC Chinese
              who refused to speak to me in English tried her best to sell
              me products.  I was politely telling her that she is in the
              customer service line thus should learn to speak English which is
              the working language in Singapore.   There was this Malay
              Watsons staff who instead of encouraging the PRC to speak to
              customers in English told me to speak to PRC in
              Chinese.    I told her there was no need to condone
              the refusal of the PRC Chinese in speaking English, the Malay staff
              did not look pleased.     I think the service
              staff in Singapore generally have bad attitude and think that
              customers must meet their needs instead of them meeting the needs
              of Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>Anyway, think PAP just simply cannot be bothered by theproblems
              bring about by these PRCs and continue to encourage them to invade
              our land.  </p>

              <p><br>I did not buy any product from her.   Before I left her alone I gave her a piece of my mind.   Any way, besides her refusal to speak English she was demonstrating bad customer service.</p>
              <p>Sad, we have a ruling party who only cares about their own needs by "importing" all these not up to standard type of foreigners to our land.  Everyone of us needs to do our part for a better tomorrow for all.</p>

              <p>Yes, a number of times I heard the sickening PRC Chinese giving bad comments about local Chinese.  They are very unhappy that local Chinese are not or refuse to use Mandarin to communicate among themselves.   Really, I see no big deal about pleasing them to speak to them in Mandarin.   Will speak Mandarin to those nice ones.</p>
              <p>In Rome, do what the Romans do.   These sickos fail to realise and accept this.  They just want to insist their way.   I am surprised that our local govt is not having any words to say about this at all.  They are so biased and so into their favour.   </p>

              <p><br>And now you know why SM Goh said to the PR, become citizens or no more PR for you, because after this election, they know that most local singaporeans will start to change toward opposition, so they need to get those PR into citizenship so as to get votes from them.
