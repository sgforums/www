              <div class="art-PostContent">
              <p>Despite the feeble attempts of Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong to allay the concerns of Singaporeans over the relentless influx of foreigners into Singapore by reducing the intake of foreigners this year from 100,000 to 80,000, the majority of Singaporeans remain anxious about their future in Singapore which is increasingly dominated by the newcomers.</p>
              <p>According to a telephone survey conducted by the PAP regime’s feedback unit, “0nly 58 per cent, or close to six out of 10 respondents, agreed that Singapore should supplement the local pool by staying open and recruiting talent from the world.”</p>
              <p>The actual figure is probably much higher as Singaporeans tend to be shy, polite and diplomatic when interviewed by PAP-related agencies out of fear of being “marked” by the regime which is infamous for its pettiness and vindictiveness.</p>
              <p>Furthermore the questions asked are pretty vague – Singaporeans should be asked point-blank if they agree on the current rate of inflow of foreigners which is fast reducing native Singaporeans to becoming a minority in their own country.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans should not be deceived by the latest PAP’s “wayang” to seek their views on its policies for it will never bulge on major issues such as its pro-foreigner and ultra-liberal immigration policies (for uneducated peasants from China and India) which is a cornerstone to its continued political survival, relevance and dominance in Singapore.</p>
              <p>With the support from locals fast declining, the PAP has to shore up its flagging support base with new (grateful) citizens to ensure that it retains more than 95 percent of the seats in Parliament so that it can continue to pass policies, bills and legislation at its wimps and fancies without any opposition to hold it accountable to its words and actions.</p>
              <p>The next general election may be the last window of opportunity for Singaporeans to reclaim ownership of their country after which they will surely be relegated to being second class minorities in their own land of birth being overwhelmed by the hordes of foreigners the PAP is mass-importing to replace them.</p>

              <p><br>I suspect that in their plan they are gradually kicking Singaporeans out of Singapore.    Not surprise that the ungrateful tyrannical father, hopeless son and gang are disliking Singaporeans a lot from the way they speak about and respond to Singaporeans.    They are bunch of ungrateful creatures.   Without the people of Singapore it is absolutely impossible for them to pay themselves so much salary, millions and millions of salary.    We singaoreans definitely can do away with such self serving and ungrateful govt.</p>

              <p>Yup... Its extremely irritating.... how can you have service staff that does not try to understand the language that you are trying to convey... somemore...

              <p>I agree.</p>
              <p>I was in WAtson and as usual met  PRC Chinese who refused to speak to me in English tried her best to sell me products.  I was politely telling her that she is in the customer service line thus should learn to speak English which is the working language in Singapore.   There was this Malay Watsons staff who instead of encouraging the PRC to speak to customers in English told me to speak to PRC in Chinese.    I told her there was no need to condone the refusal of the PRC Chinese in speaking English, the Malay staff did not look pleased.     I think the service staff in Singapore generally have bad attitude and think that customers must meet their needs instead of them meeting the needs of Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>Anyway, think PAP just simply cannot be bothered by theproblems bring about by these PRCs and continue to encourage them to invade our land.  </p>
