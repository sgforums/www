Does that entitle him to use the company's money at will?  NO.  He has to go thru an independent board of directors.<br><br>Problem with Singapore is the organs of the state are NOT independent. Join opposition and be vocal?  The IRAS will scrutinise your tax records.  Dangle a police report at a rally?  The famous guard dog lawyer will come after you.<br><br>Now coming back to living standard, hmmm...is it really decent?  If you are talking about material comfort in terms of basic amenities, yes we have it but let's not forget the thousands of uneducated poor people who live in one room flats and have to go around scavenging for empty drink cans.<br><br>But Maslow's Theory prescribes that we have different level of needs even within the material level.<br><br>We see so many cars and so many condos.  But reality is many Singaporeans who live in them are saddled with debts. This applies even to people who supposedly own flats!<br><br>We have one of the most expensive car prices in the world.  Yest we have a chronically unrepentant fvced-up public transport company in the name of SBS who seizes the littlest opportunity to raise fares but drags itself when there are calls for improvement in service.<br><br>Our wages are artificially suppressed in the name of competition because the PAP keeps using the boogeyman of China and India to distract Singaporean workers.  At the same time, those PAP ministers are collecting hundreds of thousands every month and those MPs drive BMWs, jaguars and what not when they go to parliament!  And some of these ministers don't even deserve half a cent!!  Eg. Yeo Cheow Tong, Mah Bow Tan.<br><br>Let's just say that the PAP is a feudalistic institution bent on hanging on to power regardless of the cost.<br><br>Support PAP?

There was someone much more charismatic and perhaps as smart as LKY - Lim Chin SIong.<br><br>But they were all rounded up under the totalitarian tool of ISA.<br><br>And ever heard the allegory:<br><br>The Chinese Communist Party was holding a forum in which Deng Xiao Ping was the chairman.  The topic of Singapore's achievements came up and a provincial offcial duly informed Deng:<br><br>"Premier, Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew has done wonders for Singapore by developing the island from a backwater colony to a 1st class country. We can consider engaging his service."<br><br>Deng replied, "You are right. Okay, put him in charge of Shanghai."<br><br>Moral of the story?  Singapore's acheivements may be quite impressive but hey, really, it's just a little red dot of an island.<br></div></blockquote>Deng Xiao Peng was the truly great leader of China. He wielded strong power to be entitled to a autocratic leader but he stepped aside and preferred to have new and younger leader to take over from him.<br><br>His remark if true showed he is unselfish and unzealous a clear sign of his true grit and leadership quality.  He did not come across to me as being jealous of anyone like Lou Lee but he correctly suggested that Lou Lee should try Shanghai proving his greatness with a sense of overall concern for viewpoints and  perspective. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

Does that entitle him to use the company's money at will?  NO.  He has to go thru an independent board of directors.<br><br>Problem with Singapore is the organs of the state are NOT independent. Join opposition and be vocal?  The IRAS will scrutinise your tax records.  Dangle a police report at a rally?  The famous guard dog lawyer will come after you.<br><br>Now coming back to living standard, hmmm...is it really decent?  If you are talking about material comfort in terms of basic amenities, yes we have it but let's not forget the thousands of uneducated poor people who live in one room flats and have to go around scavenging for empty drink cans.<br><br>But Maslow's Theory prescribes that we have different level of needs even within the material level.<br><br>We see so many cars and so many condos.  But reality is many Singaporeans who live in them are saddled with debts. This applies even to people who supposedly own flats!<br><br>We have one of the most expensive car prices in the world.  Yest we have a chronically unrepentant fvced-up public transport company in the name of SBS who seizes the littlest opportunity to raise fares but drags itself when there are calls for improvement in service.<br><br>Our wages are artificially suppressed in the name of competition because the PAP keeps using the boogeyman of China and India to distract Singaporean workers.  At the same time, those PAP ministers are collecting hundreds of thousands every month and those MPs drive BMWs, jaguars and what not when they go to parliament!  And some of these ministers don't even deserve half a cent!!  Eg. Yeo Cheow Tong, Mah Bow Tan.<br><br>Let's just say that the PAP is a feudalistic institution bent on hanging on to power regardless of the cost.<br><br>Support PAP?
