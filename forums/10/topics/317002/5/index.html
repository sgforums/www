              <p>My question is why the Indonesian Chinese choose to stay in Indonesia when they know the majority of Indonesians are againts them?</p>
              <p>Why do they still choose to stay in Indonesia when they know</p>
              <p>1 - obviously the government is anti-chinese as Indonesian Chinese are not allowed to use chinese name, practice chinese customs/beliefs</p>
              <p>2 - local Indonesians are a bunch of savages whose hobbies/national past-times are raping people, head hunting, stealing/robbing others, raping people, assaulting others with knives, parang, pieces of metal pipes, setting buildings/cars/flags/people on fire and oh did I mention raping people</p>
              <p>3 - local indonesians hate chinese indonesians.</p>
              <p>It is comparable to jewish people purposely going to live in NAZI germany</p>

              <p>It was an isolated case where a few hundred ethnic Chinese were targeted for violence in some areas.You have to visit Indonesia today to see if the chinese there are living in fear of another attack.Like i said it was an isolated but a well planned attack involving the army.As Chinese we are all angry but it wasnt an act of ethnic cleansing just a dirty government doing it for political reasons.We dont just leave our homes,businesses and country just because some people of our  race were attacked.</p>

              <p>Indonesia was at the verge of civil war at that time.  I was told that tanks were aiming at each other below the monument of Jakarta.</p>
              <p>The marines were the only one helping the people, guarding housing complexes, etc.  The whole country police, fire station, army (except the special forces that was the instigator and provocator) were on paid holidays.</p>
              <p>Nobody mentioned about the commander of kopassus, also the son in law.</p>
              <p>The Chinese or anyone in Indonesia is safe as long as they are not the target of political manipulations.  After the May 13 riots, the theme was religion, which was why some Christains (Chinese or Indonesian) were beheaded and Churches were burnt in some parts of Indonesia.</p>
              <p>So the thing is not about Chinese, it's all dirty politics.  It depends on what they want to target and sacrifice.</p>

              <p>The so-called rule enforcement if they merely execute what they are ordered to, without thinking, then they are no difference with run-dog.  They are like the traitors of Chinese during the japanese occupation, after the jap left, some were stoned to death and their descendents continue to live lives of disgrace forever unable to lift up their heads because of what their forefathers did.  Things will always come to an end, no matter how absolute the power is now.</p>
              <p>Life is short, if the memories of your life is something you are ashamed of, then you wasted your life and made your descendents ashame of theirs.  If there is something you did in your life out of honour, then that honour shall live on after you are long gone.  Whether the future generations spit on your tomb or take a minute to salute your tomb, is all your decision now.</p>
              <p>Chee Soon Juan is someone not only Singaporean should be proud of, but a celebration of true democracy and fighter of human rights in this era.  UN ought to give him an award.  He was a high ranking officer in law enforcement and he knew things were not right, and he stood up against the oppression and live by his principle.</p>
              <p>How many Singaporean here, truly support him in action.  Most of us only support him morally at the back of our mind.  Why?  Because we are scared to being called to drink coffee?</p>
              <p>How much better are we for speaking up and for not speaking up?</p>
              <p>You be the judge and please do not bring out these kind of statement anymore.  Standup as one Singaporean.</p>
