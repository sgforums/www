              <p>dear googoo,</p>
              <p>i think many many indon chinese will still stay put even if another massacre happens.</p>
              <p>The past has proven itself about human psychology and the difficulty in migration.</p>
              <p>1. Psychology : not that this is the same case, but even in DESPOT controlled environments like N.Korea and Iraq, people living under the duress and violence and inhuman treatment and injustice and bullied by cronies and bootlicking dogs and news spindoctors will not come together and rebel against tyrants. They may have already been brainwashed such that their people will think : "What to do?"  "Its like dat lah"  "no choice lor"  "that is life"  "don't think about it lah"  "Cannot change wan lah" "no use wan lah"</p>
              <p>People with this mentality are zombies brainwashed to accept fate and life that their lives shall forever be led by a dictator who is not transparent and does not respect your freedom of expression and human rights and treat you like a pawn like a slave to have to work for them till you die and your money forever cannot taken out cos they will use it in all kinds of expenses and no need to reveal to you. This is what you want and this is what you shall get. Iraq is a DEMOCRACY. Its people deserves what they get if that is what they asked for. In democracy , who ever leads you, you have the prime responsibility to determine that leader and thus, you deserve the kind of leader you get if you do nothing about it if you find him to be evil in disguise - aka a DESPOT.</p>
              <p>2. CAPABILITY :  to migrate out of the indon, it takes </p>
              <p>QUALICATIONe.</p>
              <p>DETERMINATIONe.</p>
              <p>MONEY.</p>
              <p>GREED for better life.</p>
              <p>Not many have these qualities.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thus, I suspect many indons chinese will still stay there even if next massacre arrives.</p>
              <p>I may be right but also may be wrong.</p>
              <p>Despite all the difficulties of migration, at least 1 0 0 0 . 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  poreas migrated succesfully each year as I understand.</p>
              <p>That is a big number considering only so few are poreans with big chunk consisting of foreigners and that I include PRs (and their family tree hierarchy) and foreign workers and tourists and foreign students.</p>
              <p>what does it say? </p>

              <p><br>Murder as a matter of pride ?</p>
              <p>Does anyone murder as ''a matter of pride'' or is murder a senseless act of inhuman behavior ?</p>
              <p>The two Japanese officers that participated in their private competition of who can  behead the most number Chinese civilians during the 'Rape of Nanking' were performing this inhuman and senseless act of murder.</p>
              <p>Like the Indonesian riots that targetted the Chinese population in Jakarta, the acts were similarly inhuman besides the raping of the Chinese women but also women from other minority ethnic groups - that also included the mutilation of the women with broomsticks stuffed into their pubic areas.</p>
              <p>Are these acts of pride ?</p>
              <p>Surely, you are not that senseless to be unable to differentiate 'Right from Wrong' ?</p>

              <p>It's not easy to migrate out of Indonesia. Here's top 3 why:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1. Most Chinese do not have a good command of English and education and expertise needed to live and survive in other developed countries.</p>
              <p>2. Most Chinese feel that the only place they can flourish in their business is here in Indonesia. If they go out they'll go bankrupt.</p>
              <p>3. Majority of Chinese people in Indonesia do not have lots of money which is a requirement for people intending to leave a country. <strong>No country willing to take economic refugee gladly.</strong></p>

              <p>TS here. I did not go Missing -in -action. I just wanted to see other people's opinions first berfore coming out again.</p>
              <p>Some people say this rape thingy is history.....so long ago.</p>
              <p>Hey you cock ah? 10 years ago is not so long lah. Unless you are only 10 years old. Maybe you are the product of some Indon commando who deposited his stinking sperm into your mom's mouth.</p>
              <p>If Singapore does not have a strong defence force, you can bet these animals will cross over to Singapore to rob and rape. Singapore is only 25 km from Indonesia.</p>
              <p>Think over this fact: Indonesia has 17,000 islands. Yet they don't want to sell sand to Singapore. They cite environmental reasons. Bloody hell, these monkeys cannot even cpontrol the Haze. They don't want to sell sand to us because they hate Chinese, and Sinagpore is Chinese in their eyes. They look down on Malays too. (Indonesian rulers are usually Javanese people)</p>

              <p>Must always learn from history and not let it repeat itself, especially it's only as recent as 10 years ago.</p>
              <p>For those who cannot leave, consider the option of taking up arms. It's a need. It's a neccessity for their defence, if they've learned the lesson. The rioters and murderers are not fearless. They are humans too and are afraid to die.</p>
              <p>Perhaps the rich can afford to help arm the weak. That's the least they can do, besides fleeing with their money.</p>
              <p>However, the ethnic Chinese are too widely scattered. Integration has failed to save them. The former government under suharto has failed to protect them. That's a problem.</p>

              <p>We should not hold this against the Indonesian.  They are just objects of manipulations by previous Indonesian politicans.  Indonesia was ruled by iron hands for 32 years by the second President, a very good friend of our current leader.  The whole country is ruled to serve only a handful of elites, i.e. the president's family, relatives and friends.</p>
              <p>Wages were low and literacy rate was suppressed to ensure that citizens will always obey the ruler and not be influenced by foreign ideologies.  Elections were manipulated and votes were bought with money (very cheap about SGD0.80 per vote then), etc.</p>
              <p>1998 was a miscalculation by the then president.  He merely wanted to suppress the widespread resentment toward the hike in fuel prices.  But his motives was capitalized by someone he trusted.  They wanted to topple him by creating a wild fire that cannot be contained.  They deployed snipers on top of trees along the streets aiming at the hearts of demonstrating students.  Students were shot.  At the same time, they conducted a highly planned street riots by pouring their instigators (recruited from prisons, hooligans, soldiers, etc) systemically and strategically on various locations.  Like a starting fires somewhere and let them meet to create bigger flame.  These instigators were given drugs that made them lost their senses and do things they otherwise would never. </p>
              <p>Every riot must have a theme, and the theme is targeted toward something that divide the society, such as race, religion, etc.  Anti-chinese was a popular theme then, and it was the theme for that riot.  Chinese were targeted and they made them think that Chinese is the caused of their sufferings and poverty because the chinese were usually the rich ones.  With only 2.5% of total population, the chinese controls 60% of the economy.</p>
              <p>Indonesian are unique people.  Alone, they dare not do anything.  But in a group, they have the guts to do anything.  The instigators shown them how to do it and they followed.</p>
              <p>To be fair to the common Indonesian, we must see this as political manipulations rather then the nature of certain nationality.  The Javanese are very friendly people, but they are very prone to manipulations.</p>
              <p>May the victims of the past political crime rests in peace.  They can look for the person responsible for this, because he had recently joined them.</p>
