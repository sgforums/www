              <p>Ya. I was shocked last time when i read about this indo killed chinese news too and rape and torture. These suckers should be tortured and jailed forever for their deeds.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I dunno whether if government has captured all those responsible and give their enough torture for their deeds. If they had not, then it is very very bad and the world needs to punished the indo if they had not settle this issue properly thru various kinds of sactions.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As I know, besides Indo, there are many countries which are in world spotlight now in terms of inhuman activities like mynmar, kenya which i know of. There are probably more countries if you go and read up UN website which is happening now as we all live in  a working life in singapore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Our world is very large with many people and many events. In singapore, our lives revolve around being busy with work and relationship lives while in some other countries at the same time, their lives revolves around knives, guns and hatred.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If we want to solve world injustice, political, social bodies in the world is insufficient. Cos just not enuff manpower and resources....</p>

              <p>Any extremist ideology or religion is prone to manipulation.  Some countries promote extremism because it is an excellent political tool.  The religion that believes in one God and supreme authority will obey whatever their religion leaders say.  Eventually man becomes god himself.  Original scripts from founder were altered and only selected ones were made known to the world.  Meanings in the scripts were changed and emphasized to serve their interests.</p>

              <p>In Thailand, the conflict in the south is related to race and history rather than religions. There are Muslim population concentrated in Central Thailand and Eastern Bangkok too. However, they live peacefully side by side with other religious believers. You'd see Buddhist monasteries located next to Masjids.</p>

              <p>Actually religion and race is closely related....</p>
              <p>below is a more scientific look at race vs religion at a psychology level......</p>
              <p>obviously we could look at this issue many ways.... this is just one of them</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The roots of the relationship between racism and religion run far back
              into the evolutionary past. Racism is merely a special form of
              xenophobia. <sup><a name="B3" href="http://www.atheists.org/christianity/race.html#F3">(3)</a></sup> If xenophobia involves fear of persons who are merely "foreign," a
              fortiori it will involve fear of persons of other races, who -- quite
              literally -- wear their foreignness upon their faces. In the present
              day, when it is desperately necessary that people of all sorts learn to
              live together on the delicate spacecraft that supports their odyssey
              through space and time, xenophobia is a trait they well can do without.
              In the remote past, however, xenophobia appears to have served an
              important evolutionary function. If the theorizing of sociobiologists
              be correct -- and an increasing amount of evidence appears to indicate
              it is largely so -- xenophobia helped to accelerate the course of
              evolution when our ancestors were still at the evolutionary stage where
              the largest social groups were clans and tribes.
              <br><br> To oversimplify only a bit, xenophobia helped to keep the
              gene pools of various small groups fairly isolated from each other.
              This allowed for "group selection" to occur. Instead of individuals
              surviving or perishing in the struggle for existence, groups of
              individuals survived or perished. This presumably accelerated the rate
              of genetic change in the species as a whole. It is not unreasonable to
              suppose, therefore, that there may be a genetic factor biasing us
              towards xenophobic behavior. <sup><a name="B4" href="http://www.atheists.org/christianity/race.html#F4">(4)</a></sup> The function of xenophobia, basically, is to sharpen the distinction
              between in-group and out-groups ("us" and "them") and to intensify
              competition, motivating the elimination of out-group gene pools.
              <br><br> For success in the struggle for group survival, however, more
              than clear definition of group boundaries is necessary. In-group
              cohesion and cooperation also are essential, and that is where religion
              has come into the picture of human evolution. Religion, harnessing the
              forces of hypnosis and suggestion via the medium of rhythmic chanting
              and dancing, was just what was needed to fuse the individuals of a
              tribe into a kind of super-organism, a collective entity that could
              combine the singleness of purpose and efficiency of an individual with
              the power of a mob. The all-night war dances of certain Amerindian
              tribes are suggestive of the original function played by religion at
              the pre-civilized stage of human evolution. Once the religious shamans
              had gotten the warriors into a trance, they could be sent off to war as
              anxiety-free machines that could be counted on to do their utmost to
              wipe out the genetic competition. Thus, there is the possibility that
              there may be a genetic bias favoring religiosity (<em>i.e.</em>,
              the ability to be hypnotized, brain-washed, and sent off to fight for
              the survival of the in-group) as well as a bias favoring xenophobia.
              While it is not yet certain that genes for xenophobia and religiosity
              exist, it is quite clear that religion and xenophobia have been
              partners since long before the appearance of written records.
              <br><br> It is a fact that the racial features of the gods and
              goddesses that people have invented (ignoring, of course, the deities
              modeled after animals) almost always have coincided with those of their
              creators. The African gods are black, often with their race-defining
              features being exaggerated. The deities of the Asians look oriental. It
              comes as no surprise that the gods of the Caucasoids are depicted as
              white: Jesus, Thor, Zeus, Mithra -- none of them could be confused with
              a resident of the Congo or Rangoon. In keeping with the notion that
              each religion is responsible for enhancing the social cohesion of a
              particular group of people, it is not surprising to learn that nearly
              every religion considers its own little group to be "god's chosen
              people."
              <br></p>
              <p>If it be true that the original function of religion in the
              course of evolution was to enhance the selective advantage of the
              in-group at the expense of out-groups, we should expect that religions
              which have managed to survive from ancient tribal times up to the
              present would still show traces of their racist beginnings and would
              exhibit at least some degree of self-definition along racial lines.
              Unfortunately, almost all such religions went extinct long ago -- at
              least in the Near East, where written records survive in quantities
              great enough to allow some understanding of their nature. To my
              knowledge, the only modern Near-Eastern religions surviving from
              ancient tribal times are Judaism and Samaritanism. <sup><a name="B5" href="http://www.atheists.org/christianity/race.html#F5">(5)</a></sup> Since Samaritanism is nearly extinct -- and thus not a very good
              example if one is studying religious strategies conferring a survival
              advantage upon a group! -- we are left with Judaism as the only
              suitable religion with which to test the hypothesis that religion
              promotes racism and xenophobia in general, and that racism and
              xenophobia in turn have been associated with increased survival rates. <sup><a name="B6" href="http://www.atheists.org/christianity/race.html#F6">(6)</a></sup></p>

              <p>singapore also has a history with riots....</p>
              <p>this is all the three of them</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1) The <strong>1964 Race Riots</strong> were a series of <a title="Riot" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot">riots</a> that took place in <a title="Singapore" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore">Singapore</a> during two separate periods in July and September between <a title="Chinese in Singapore" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_in_Singapore">Chinese</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" title="Malay people" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malay_people">Malay</a> groups, also known as the <strong>Prophet Muhammad Birthday Riots</strong></p>
              <p>2)The custody battle for Maria Hertogh,
              which was fought by her Dutch birth parents and her Malay-Muslim
              adoptive family, who had raised Maria as a Muslim.</p>
              <p>3) May 1969, race riots in Malaysia spilled over to Singapore. They were
              fuelled by rumours and innuendos and indicative of the mistrust and
              tense relations between the Malays and the Chinese on the island</p>

              <p>Yes, often religion and race are closely related. Again, but not always.</p>
              <p>I no longer trust CNN, FOX, The Economist and most western news agencies as truly reliable sources especially after the Sep 19 coup in Thailand.<br> Most of these agencies' reporters look credible because we are familiar with them. But they often interpret and report the situations according to their own understanding. Sometimes they tend to simply apply what happened in the middle east to Southern Thailand even though the 2 are totally unrelated.</p>
              <p>The struggles in Patani to break away from Thailand has existed for more than hundred years since it was annexed to be part of the country. It was complicated by neglect from the central government and corrupt officials. The most recent was the result of Thaksin's mishandling of the region until it has gone out of control. If it is a religious conflict or linked to 9/11, the violence could have spreaded out of those 3 provinces to nearby provinces, which also have ethnic Malay muslims, and to other parts of the country, which also have sizeable muslim population.</p>

              <p>the incident is taken from a pretty neutral point...</p>
              <p>if its a chinese news or incident, then obviously taking information from chinese media would influence the news..... but thailand?  i dun think so</p>
              <p>CNN and FOX, xinhua and the rest, no reason not to report the news from a neutral stance...... esp this kinda of news..... that do not involve their immediate interest or national concerns.........</p>
              <p>obviously you would look for other countries new agencies to cross reference....... i think in our age, we need to look for many sources of information and learn it from many different points of view</p>

              <p>Yes, I always look for a cross reference from other news agencies. However, when it comes to political issues like racial conflicts, wars, coup d'etats, riots, protests, terrorism etc, most often they are all highly politicized. I have learned that I cannot rely solely on the mainstream western agencies for analysis. The event of Sep 19 Coup in Thailand and how these mainstream media misleadingly reported about Thailand to the world taught me so. <span style="color: #666699;"><span style="color: #99cc00;">You know what, in 2006 CNN got paid by a DC-based lobbyist firm hired by Thaksin, which is linked with many powerful US politicians, in order for him to air his lies around the world.  </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #666699;"><span style="color: #99cc00;">Also in April 2006, shortly before the coup, The Economist indirectly supported Thaksin by  purposely omitting the fact that the general election was rigged, fradulent, and extremely undemocratic.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #666699;"><span style="color: #99cc00;">And I am not done yet. Remember the snow storm in China in Feb 2008? Business Week reported as if there would be another great uprising against Beijing for severe food shortage and their failure to provide disaster relief. Luckily I called a very good friend of mine who is a farmer from Anhui. He laughed and said no one was unhappy with the government because it was a natural disaster. He said although most farmers there are poor, they are very self-sufficient.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #666699;"><span style="color: #99cc00;">This raised the eyebrows of many Thais who used to be big fans of mainstream western news agencies, including me, that ..... we may have been watching soap opera, not news. They may report the truth but what their reporters interpret and insert seamlessly into their reporting or the extent or frequency of the report are another story. We had absorbed these 'interpreted (or twisted?)' reports day by day and registered them into our brain. Until something very critical happened to us directly, then we'd wake up to the truth.</span></span></p>

              Chinese Indonesian woman who had been counselling women raped during
              rioting in May has been found murdered at her home in Jakarta.</p>
              <p>The body of Martadinata Haryono, 17, was found by her father on Friday night.</p>
              <p><br><img src="http://news.bbc.co.uk/olmedia/190000/images/_190632_Copy_of_protest_150.jpg" alt="[ image: width=150]" height="180"></p>
              <p>She
              died of multiple stab wounds. A report in the Indonesian evening
              newspaper Suara Pembaruan said a police autopsy indicated she may also
              have been raped.</p>
              <p>Miss Haryono and her mother both worked for Volunteers for
              Humanity, one of several groups established to counsel ethnic Chinese
              victims of the May unrest.</p>

              <p>My question is why the Indonesian Chinese choose to stay in Indonesia when they know the majority of Indonesians are againts them?</p>
              <p>Why do they still choose to stay in Indonesia when they know</p>
              <p>1 - obviously the government is anti-chinese as Indonesian Chinese are not allowed to use chinese name, practice chinese customs/beliefs</p>
              <p>2 - local Indonesians are a bunch of savages whose hobbies/national past-times are raping people, head hunting, stealing/robbing others, raping people, assaulting others with knives, parang, pieces of metal pipes, setting buildings/cars/flags/people on fire and oh did I mention raping people</p>
              <p>3 - local indonesians hate chinese indonesians.</p>
