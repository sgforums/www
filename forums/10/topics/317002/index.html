              <div class="byline">By SETH MYDANS</div>
              <div class="timestamp">Published: June 10, 1998</div>
              <div class="timestamp"><br></div>
              <p>In addition to the looting and arson that was
              largely aimed at Chinese neighborhoods in three days of rioting in
              Jakarta last month, human rights and women's aid groups have begun to
              document what they say appears to have been an organized campaign of
              assaults, gang rapes and killings of ethnic Chinese women.</p>
              <p>The
              aid workers say they have talked with dozens of victims or relatives of
              victims and they estimated today that more than 100 women and girls may
              have been attacked and raped in Jakarta alone as their neighborhoods
              were burning between May 13 and 15. There were reports of similar
              attacks during riots in other cities that preceded the fall of
              President Suharto on May 21.</p>
              <p>One worker at a women's aid
              center, Sita Kayam, said she believed that hundreds of women were
              receiving physical or psychological help at hospitals here.</p>
              <p>Other
              aid workers said most of the victims remained too traumatized to talk
              about their experiences and too terrified of reprisals to report their
              ordeals to officials or even to unofficial rape centers. The police
              said no reports of rape had been brought to the authorities.</p>
              <p>Another worker at the women's aid center, Ita F. Nadia, said some women had committed suicide after their ordeals.</p>
              <p>The
              reported attacks ranged from the degrading and humiliating to the
              horrific; from women who were made to strip and perform calisthenics in
              public to women who were repeatedly raped and then thrown into the
              flames of burning buildings.</p>
              <p>The reports involve girls and
              women ranging in age from 10 to 55, the aid workers said. Some were
              gang-raped in front of a crowd in the Chinese commercial district of
              Glodok, said Rita Kolibonso, executive director of the women's group
              Mitra Perempuan.</p>
              <p>''Some of the rapists said, 'You must be raped
              because you are Chinese and non-Muslim,' '' said Ms. Ita, who works at
              a crisis center called Kalyana Mitra. Ethnic Chinese citizens, who
              control much of the country's commerce, have been targets of violence
              in Indonesia for years.</p>

              <p>Are you a Chinese? Ya, some Chinese Indon are pretty, but no one deserves to be raped. Hogging the country's wealth? Hello, if you breed like rabbits, dun give a fuck about their education, let them wander out of school, have premarital sex and repeat the whole story, of course how to be rich??? How to even get a decent job to accumulate money to start a business? Semua kasi anak makan...all down the kids' mouth.</p>

              <p>you come to JB, you travel to some parts of Malaysia filled with Indons, then u know. Uncivilised and uncouth. That's how u differentiate the Malays and Indonesians in Johor. Indons there are the uneducated and uncivilised type, so they look more barbaric. These are the very people committing crimes in Malaysia. Why Johor got so many rape cases? Thanks to these pai kia.</p>

              <p><br>Do the Chinese deserve this ?</p>
              <p>This is tantamount to saying that the Chinese in Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam - and across the globe - for being more enterprising and hardworking then the local ethnic groups and ''hogging the country's wealth'' ?</p>
              <p>If the Chinese community did not exist in Indonesia, would the wealth have existed when there is no enterprise or commerce ?</p>
              <p>This remark shows the extreme stupidity of the writer.</p>
              <p>The wealth of Indonesia was not hogged by the Chinese community, but by a small group of Indonesian-Javanese elites, which also saw the efforts of the Achenese to break away from Indonesia and form their own nation.</p>
              <p>The riots was created by the late President Suharto's son-in-law, who attempted to create an emergency that will allow him to implement martial law and takeover political power - in similar scenario that occurred in 1969, when the Indonesian Communists killed several leading generals in an attempted coup but was thwarted by Suharto, who became President after confining President Sukarno for aligning with the Communist.</p>
              <p>The racial riots ten years ago resulted in Suharto's resignation, and opened the door to democracy.</p>
              <p>The first Government welcome back the ethnic Chinese to return to Indonesia, and had some Chinese in the Cabinet.</p>
              <p>The present Indonesian Cabinet has at least two ethnic Indonesian Chinese in leading government positions.</p>

              <p>While Singaporeans have a problem with PRCs, at least the most they do is pee inside MRT, talk rudely and steal jobs and husbands.</p>
              <p>Malaysians have to deal with Indonesian immigrants like Singaporeans with PRCs. And boy, do they make themselves very 'visible' in Malaysia. Committing robberies, rape and murder.</p>
              <p>Since TS topic is about RAPE, let me say this: A lot of rape cases involve Chinese victim and (sadly) non-Chinese rapists. Quite a number is due to these Indons. For example, how come so many rape cases are reported in Chinese papers but not in Utusan Melayu / Malaysia or Berita Harian? Why even The Star and New Straits Times cover up? Scared Chinese backlash la....Ever wondered that maybe they haven't truly let go of their anti-Chinese grudge after a decade?</p>
              <p>Chinese Singaporeans donate so much for the tsunami aid....but sorry to be politically incorrect, but I don't fancy keeping some of these crapsters alive. More so, ingrateful people who eventually cause trouble to the Chinese. Do you know that months after the tsunami, piracy rate along pirate-infested Straits of Malacca fell to ZERO? And people still donate to keep that "cute" Indon baby alive. He might just grow into a terrorist-cum-suicide bomber, go rape a Chinese girl in future, should relations turn bad, thanks to your monies for feeding him. Or worse, come to Singapore to commit crimes (given SPF slackness).</p>
              <p>When some Indon cleric said it's a punishment from God, I agreed wholeheartedly. Not bcos of letting kafirs (infidels = non-Muslims) come in, but more for the sins in 1998. To loot the shops deserves public execution but mass xenophobic rape? Gas chambers won't do enough justice.</p>
              <p>To sum it up, they are anti-Chinese with their 'ethnic cleansing'. And to think the Chinese actually help them when there's shit? Think about it, there seems to be more natural disasters in the years after 1998.</p>

              <p>its because of the human right thingy. people in trouble nationwide, other country feel obliged to help so they look good.</p>
              <p>talk about ingrates?? they pay back us with fogs by burning precious forests increasing global warming. they are so anti chinese to the point that such atrocities are committed and justified with God's Punishment.( which verse of the quran says to rape people who offend you again?) the point is the local chinese offended them by giving those imbeciles jobs and helped that country improve economy??if so, its really the chinese' fault wor.</p>
              <p>it has to be their religious leaders who warp the religion to serve their own end. so if only they stop lookin at them as humans and move them to paradise to reward them with their virgins. wouldnt it be better??</p>

              <p>Obvious and brutal racial crimes happen in Indo's Chinese.</p>
              <p>I could not comprehend why Chinese still call Indo home.</p>
              <p>Enlighten me if can.</p>
              <p>Chinese's heads are chopped away with parang, head stuck on a wooden pole and a burnt cig popped into the left nostril. I saw this on newspaper last time.</p>
              <p>Women were brutally raped and then murdered. Babies chopped to death. I read last time.</p>
              <p>Now, now crimes still happen?</p>
              <p>Without the many tycoon chinese in indo, i think indons would be mostly out of job.</p>
              <p>Even when life is at risk, chinese indons will still stay put.</p>
              <p>I think it could be due to:</p>
              <p>1. comfort zone.</p>
              <p>2. human weakness.</p>
              <p>3. Unqualified to migrate.</p>
              <p>Migration is tough. You need to 1st get a new citizenship issued to you. Yet, over 1 0 0 0 . 0 0   poreans do this despite all the tough conditions and situations they have to bear. This says something.</p>
