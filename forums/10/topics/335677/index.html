              This is an actual copy which I sent to MOE Feeback on
              1st November 2008, 17:55:
              
              
              What are these p.h.d. (permanent head damaged) and the scholar (saw lo ~ retard/ crazy) at the MOE trying to do to the adolescence of Singapore? Trying to drive them to be the like of them?
              
              I thank you. If that is what they are trying, then set up schools for the breed but spare the innocent adolescence. Leave and let them to have their happiest and most memorable childhood. There is no more quality life after that!
              
              My poor little girl is in P5 and she is a genius of the bordliners. I was informed by the form teacher that if she did not pass at least one subject in SA2, she will have to take Foundation in P6.
              
              Foundation? Isn't primary level already the foundation stage of the whole damn education system?
              Foundation? Didn't they just abolish the silly classification of 'EM1', 'EM2' and 'EM3'?
              WHAT FOUNDATION?
              
              Last year when she was in P4, her teacher already fore warned me never to opt for FOUNDATION. He had said that it would end her chance to enter into a normal secondary level. I remembered asking the teacher why teachers in Singapore do not voiced their opinions during meet sessions. He replied sadly that those 'people' at MOE don't listened.
              
              Leaving with no other choice; thinking she need to have at least a PSLE to get into a normal secondary, I tried my very best to prepare her for her SA2. I remembered those days and I hated myself for doing that. It was pure craziness that lasted 3 weeks. I can still heard myself screaming and yelling like a 'p.h.d.' or a 'saw lo' at the poor child!
              
              Results were out yesterday. FAILED all her subjects! DOES IT HELP? THE ANXIETY? THE WORRIES? THE STRESS? THE PRESSURE?
              
              YES! It helps to carry me to a step nearer to 'Woodbridge' or the Mental Health Hospital! (Why did they change the name? The SYSTEM is forcing a lot of 'saw lo' to consult MHH!) It helps increase my blood pressure! It kills a child's self-esteem; decreases her confidence!
              
              YES! It helps to increase the number of appointments at MHH, so MHH has to build extension!
              
              I had come to term. Fine! Since, I had similar thought as Albert Einstein in "the spirit of learning and creative thought were lost in strict rote learning"; except that the 'strict rote learning' is replaced by the quixotic of the MOE in its Education System! There is only one option left for me. If my poor child is been put to the SYSTEM CONDEMNATION DEN - FOUNDATION, I am ready to remove her from school next year.
              
              I had called MOE. No one can answer my question - CAN I OPT OUT OF FOUNDATION? MOE said it is up to the decision of the school principal. The kind lady had sent my request on 23 Oct 08 for the principal to call me. Yesterday, I called again for an appointment to meet the Minister of MOE (DR. Lee(?)). The same lady had came to the phone to tell me she WOULD get the school principal to call me. I told her the principal was very busy, she was not in. However, she did get hold of the VP to call me before 16:30.
              
              THE JOKE OF THE DAY: The VP told me the Foundation is as per MOE SYSTEM requirement. (See the usual pushing - 'chi kung'!)
              
              NO ONE nor especially THE SYSTEM, is going to condemn my little GENIUS! Even if I am at my last breath, this will act as a legal right or a legal will of a mother to fight for her child's right!
              
              Wonder what is the Society of Children or the Children Court (Is there one?) doing? If beating a child is abused, isn't condeming a child a more serious case?
              
              I hereby declared that if my little Genius is put to FOUNDATION, she will not be going to school next year. MOE is solely responsible for this, as I am doing this because I will not leave my child in the CONDEMNATION DEN! And that I am not violating the Law that education is compulsory. My little Genius will continue to learn English, Mathematics, Science, 'Real' Art and other more holistic subjects elsewhere.
              
              It is the MOE who is violating the Law for not providing an appropriate education for the benefit of the children!

              My biz partner was condemned during his time of education...P1 - P8 and passed very well in his PSLE but not at normal standard.
              
              He got into ITE, went through 3 years of ITE and got his NTC II.  He did very well too; and his teacher told him he got a chance to go Poly but unfortunately, the principal can only choose 2.  The chance was given to the 2 who were from the normal standard!
              
              Wasn't he been condemned in the subconscious mind of the others?  He personally felt so.

              <p>Don't pressure her too much, you need to re-look at your parenting methods. Not easy to teach a child properly, talk to other parents why their children is doing well, you might learn a thing or 2 from them. Don't resort to physical abuse, it never works now, at least for my generation. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p>

              <p>It brings me to this analogy.</p>
              <p><strong>&gt;</strong> = leads to</p>
              <p>Study &gt; get degree &gt; high paid job &gt; money</p>
              <p>Does it always work this way? NO!</p>
              <p>It all boils down to demand and supply for what the individual can contribute to the company. If you see many people going to study for the same course, eg. our over-hyped bio science course, that industry is going to be saturated when supply of grads outnumber the demand in the industry. It is happening now in the finance industry.</p>
              <p>Ultimately what we want for our children is to earn money next time. There is no proper route to achieve this. If your child can take short-cuts and knows what he/she is doing, why not? <a href="../../../users/25851">kopiosatu</a> is one example <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"> (ps, eh how you earn your money huh? share share leh)</p>

              <p>That is too extreme.</p>
              <p>In some areas Lee Kuan Yew has done well, in other areas not that well.</p>
              <p>Lee Kuan Yew's reign has been a long one, almost 50 years, so his performance must be judge accordingly as well.</p>
              <p>There is one period when he was acting as PM and another period as SM/MM.</p>
              <p>Now he is still alive, all media controlled by state, so no choice, all glorify him, positive comments etc.</p>
              <p>After he is dead, we will see.</p>

              <p>Don't you feel that your response to this situation is far from reassuring to your child?</p>
              <p>This anger and sarcarsm is just going to teach your child that SHE is a victim too. The reality is that... no system is perfect (and trust me, I think MOE has a lot of serious issues that really need examining) but by allowing yourself to think that you are a victim of it (first by forcing your child to match 'standards' of the system cos you are worried about her future then overcompensating by lashing out at the system when she could not 'match' those standards) then she will also learn that when she meets problems, it is never her own.</p>
              <p>No one is perfect. People have areas they are better in, and areas they are worse in. Does it mean that if they are not good at playing a game, then they reject the game? You can choose to play a different game - but it is a sad and insecure child that learns that if i am no good at something - then its the system that's wrong not me.</p>
              <p>what if you transfer her to another school that's outside the MOE system and she STILL can't do well academically? what if you decide to quit your job and homeschool her and then learn that studying is simply not her forte? The message  will be sending to her will be how IMPORTANT and absolute YOU think academic ability is - not reassuring her that its okay if you try your best and don't do well - you can still excel in other areas.</p>
              <p><br>Again - I repeat that I disagree with many aspects of the current education system. I am merely commenting on how you may project your disappointment and frustration to your child.</p>
