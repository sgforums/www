              <p>But then again..such thing especially on academics is especially subjective and might be biased..because there ARE people who do extremely well even in the context of world ranking, such as students who are actually sent on scholarship to oxford, harvard, stanford etc. However, what do we use as a gauge to measure the fairness of the system? Those who are academically inclined? What about those who have a more artistic outlook? And the disabled?</p>
              <p>Even you would notice that the highest ranking soldiers in the army is usually a scholar who pwns at academia, unlike other countries' whose rank is determined by performance in war/peacetime.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Section A &amp; B results show that her basic knowledge for
              Mathematics is quite good.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The problem lies in the method of teaching! A simple
              formula for triangle:</p>
              <p>1/2 x base x height</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>is taught as</p>
              <p>Step 1: base x height</p>
              <p>Step 2: take the answer divide by 2</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Why complicant a simple formula?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>How many parents who had learnt Algebra in secondary level can
              answer the question taught in primary level using bars
              comparison?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I'm wondering how much is taught in the classroom? Only the
              basic? And they expect a 10 - 12 year old to apply in a
              complicated and 'challenging' problems!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>ENGLISH</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>English is another dumb-found.  I still remembered my time,
              we learnt new words and their meanings.  We construct
              sentences with them.  We had spelling and dictation.  We
              also learnt cursive writing.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>From P1 - P4, she still had spelling once a week. But P5
              spelling was abolished after a few months.  She never have to
              do new words nor sentences construction.  No cursive writing
              lession!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Really wondering what was taught!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>SCIENCE</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Look at the text book.  They look very simple.  Not
              one guidebook covers everything, you have to buy a few.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Questions on experiments.  In the first place, were these
              children shown or done the experiments?  Do you think enough
              is done to make them understand?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ridiculous! What is holistic teaching?</p>

              <p>Hm. It took me 9years to finally realize why we need problem sums in primary school...that is after I have to start teaching my sister her p5 and p6 maths. Like your child, she also don't like problem  sums. But these problem sums are the most crucial section whereby a student uses his/her understanding of whatever that he/she has learnt for the term/semester and put into solving the scenerio placed. As for the simple formula of area of a triangle, I wouldn't say it's making it complicated...more like the way you see it. If one can't understand 1/2xBxH, then the other method (BxH)/2 would be just another alternative for one to understand. It's just like 3+4=7 and 4+3=7 yeah?</p>
              <p>I think the abolishment of cursive writing is because it's no longer important. And what's more important to note is that every change that the MOE system goes through, in my opinion, is because of the O levels standards. They want to start from the foundation of students and then as they move on the education ladder, there won't be too much adjustment and adaption.  Do you really think cursive writing is necessary?</p>

              <p>Well maybe that is why she did not perform as well.</p>
              <p>I am convinced that meaningful caning bring out the child's  potential most. A P1-P5 kid will only regard encouragement as sign of weakness. If u never yell at her all this while for failing, chances are she will just think it is ok to fail.</p>
              <p>Be realistic, human beings learn lesson the hard way.</p>
              <p>Me and my siblings were caned when we failed our CA tests in primary sch. My parents love us, but they believe in caning system. It is this caning system that brought all of us through Uni and some Phd.( Of course, my parents stop caning once we were in sec2 or sec3)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyway, it is too late to start yelling at her now. I understand your love for ur daughter, but have it occur to u that u might be actually an ineffective teacher to ur daughter?</p>
              <p>Actions should be taken when she starts failing in P2 or so....Get a good tutor, be prepared to coach her on her subjects and plan time table for her to study effectively and of course a balanced lifestyle. My mum does it when I am young. I learn how to plan timetable from her and I never need my mum to nag at me to study once I was in secondary.</p>
              <p>I hope ur appeal gets through. And do try things like planning timetable for ur daughter, get her a tutor, be more stern when she did badly in homework.</p>
              <p>I wish you n ur daughter good luck.</p>

              <p>Kim,</p>
              <p>My bro went through his ITE education and I don't remember him mentionining about the principal can only choose a certain number of graduates into a polytechnic study. You just need to be the top 5% of the entire ITE cohort (anyone please correct me if I'm wrong thanks!). My bro went ahead, graduated with his Polytechnic Diploma. He had completed his part-time Degree with NUS last year as well.</p>
              <p>Life isn't really that bad.</p>
              <p>Slow learning pace is not anyone's fault to point on.</p>
              <p>I was retained a year in my Polytechnic days because I kept failing my engineering maths too.</p>
              <p>You have to let go of the anger before constructive alternatives surface before you.</p>
              <p>An angry and negative mind states will keep attracting unpleasant things to happen to you.</p>
              <p>Relax.</p>

              <p>i think educating and motivating our kids is our responsibility. the school is a facilitor in this equation.</p>
              <p>unless you know what your children's are made of, i.e. temperament, steady type or kan-chiong type, etc., it is hard to provide the right level of support. as parent, we must be able to see and read them quickly and change if we must to do the right thing for them.</p>
              <p>mine is a classic example. both my kids did well in their previous school. so, i up the ante and initiated a transfer to a so-called `top' school. they passed the entrance exam and were posted there last year. however, in the last 2 years, i noticed they were miserable in school. the grades too dropped, altho' i can confirmed that their teachers told me that they typically set very difficult questions to condition their pupils for the main exam. their homework load is tremendous. they can hardly catch up on their work so me supplementing them with MY homework for them is definitely putting additional strain on them.</p>
              <p>i realized i made a fatal mistake in this case. i am pulling them out of the school.</p>
              <p>perhaps my kids do not have that kind of temperament for the environment the school provide. or they are not as smart as i thought they are. regardless, i rather they have a childhood that is happy and not be reminded of their early years as one of struggle.</p>
              <p>in the final analysis, we parents just need to do the right thing. our meritocratic driven society coupled with the kiasu-ness in most parents unfortunately will ensure that the current system will (still) prevail.</p>

              <p><br>not far from the truth, but in my opinion, it's the school's job to educate. the school cannot do too much to inspire the child, if the parents don't care.</p>
