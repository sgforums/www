              <p>From P1 to P5, her results had been on the borderline. She was never punished for failing her exams; I have always stood by her and encouraged her on.</p>

              <p>Why take away her chance to try out PSLE at standard?  Whether she passed or failed, it doesn't matter.  What matter is she is given a fair chance to try!</p>

              <p><strong>MATHEMATICS</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Take a look at her Mathematics result:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Section A - 15/20 (75%)</p>
              <p>Section B - 14/20 (70%)</p>
              <p>Section C - 14/60 (23%)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Section A &amp; B results show that her basic knowledge for Mathematics is quite good.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The problem lies in the method of teaching! A simple formula for triangle:</p>
              <p>1/2 x base x height</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>is taught as</p>
              <p>Step 1: base x height</p>
              <p>Step 2: take the answer divide by 2</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Why complicant a simple formula?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>How many parents who had learnt Algebra in secondary level can answer the question taught in primary level using bars comparison?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I'm wondering how much is taught in the classroom? Only the basic? And they expect a 10 - 12 year old to apply in a complicated and 'challenging' problems!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>ENGLISH</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>English is another dumb-found.  I still remembered my time, we learnt new words and their meanings.  We construct sentences with them.  We had spelling and dictation.  We also learnt cursive writing.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>From P1 - P4, she still had spelling once a week. But P5 spelling was abolished after a few months.  She never have to do new words nor sentences construction.  No cursive writing lession!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Really wondering what was taught!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>SCIENCE</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Look at the text book.  They look very simple.  Not one guidebook covers everything, you have to buy a few.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Questions on experiments.  In the first place, were these children shown or done the experiments?  Do you think enough is done to make them understand?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ridiculous! What is holistic teaching?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>HOLISTIC : treating the whole person rather than just the symptoms of a disease.</p>

              <p>Maths:<br>Section C is problem sums right? Could it be that it is her language that is pulling her down? Maths can't stand alone without understanding the language in which it can be used in context. That is why so many of us who used the older system find the current system very difficult - because language is AS important as maths. <br><br>For the models system - i understand what they are trying to start is to get younger students to learn how to use trial and error as well as logical analysis. Whereas algebra teaches more of simply 'steps' to get an answer - the current maths tries to teach why and perspective of looking at problems. This is to teach kids to try as many ways as possible to GET an answer and not just memorise steps to solve it. So, yes it is a lot harder because now you are required to really understand the concept - not just put <em>x</em> in the correct place. <br><br>Looks to me that your child understands WHAT to do - she just needs help to understand WHEN to do WHAT. <br><br>English:</p>
              <p>What other thing does she have in place of spelling? Some educators feel that spelling is not a very appropriate way of teaching a language because it is very artificial, forced and often does not have long term benefits as children forget after the test. It also puts children away from learning a language by making it very technical. (how many of us hate chinese thanks to 'ting xie'?) On the other hand - SENTENCE construction is very important. Maybe you can help her by getting her to read more by bringing her to the library. To help her with her spelling, I suggest you can borrow this software from National Library Board called Spelltrack. As for cursive writing...err.. as long as she writes reasonably fast, it isn't all that important is it? <br><br>By the way, not stopping you from lodging all your feedback and all with MOE. But please do it with dignity and don't let them have the excuse of taking your feedback lightly because you were unclear and sarcarstic about it. Some people don't understand sarcarsm u know :P</p>

              <p>ultimately all systems need to cater to children who need more time and more attention to learn. But if society always label these children as 'not good enough' without seeing it holistically (to borrow a word from TS). But taking the longer road doesn't mean you cannot reach the same (or further) destination. But labels are given by people - not the system. <br><br></p>

              <p>there is a reason why your child is going to foundation and the rest of her peers are not. Its simply because your child cant perform as well as them. You know what that means? That means she is not ready for mainstream.</p>
              <p>Going into foundation is not necessary bad. There, she can learn things at her own pace and really get the foundations right before progessing. After her primary school days, if you dont like her to enter a normal technical stream, you can do all the home tuition you like to prepare her for her O's. If she is really as genius as you think, then simply enroll her as a private candidate when the time comes.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Please do not blame the system. Its a dog eat dog world. If she underperforms, she drops down the rank.</p>

              <p>Maths:<br>Section C is problem sums right? Could it be that it is her language that is pulling her down? Maths can't stand alone without understanding the language in which it can be used in context. That is why so many of us who used the older system find the current system very difficult - because language is AS important as maths.<br><br>For the models system - i understand what they are trying to start is to get younger students to learn how to use trial and error as well as logical analysis. Whereas algebra teaches more of simply 'steps' to get an answer - the current maths tries to teach why and perspective of looking at problems. This is to teach kids to try as many ways as possible to GET an answer and not just memorise steps to solve it. So, yes it is a lot harder because now you are required to really understand the concept - not just put <em>x</em> in the correct place.<br><br>Looks to me that your child understands WHAT to do - she just needs help to understand WHEN to do WHAT.<br><br>English:</p>
              <p>What other thing does she have in place of spelling? Some educators feel that spelling is not a very appropriate way of teaching a language because it is very artificial, forced and often does not have long term benefits as children forget after the test. It also puts children away from learning a language by making it very technical. (how many of us hate chinese thanks to 'ting xie'?) On the other hand - SENTENCE construction is very important. Maybe you can help her by getting her to read more by bringing her to the library. To help her with her spelling, I suggest you can borrow this software from National Library Board called Spelltrack. As for cursive writing...err.. as long as she writes reasonably fast, it isn't all that important is it?<br><br>By the way, not stopping you from lodging all your feedback and all with MOE. But please do it with dignity and don't let them have the excuse of taking your feedback lightly because you were unclear and sarcarstic about it. Some people don't understand sarcarsm u know :P</p>

              <p>Yes, the children need to use trial and error, logical analysis and different perspective to understand the concept.  But are they trained in the classroom?  Time is needed, is 1hr 40mins enough for 16 - 18 Qs?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is true that English is highly tested in Maths.  Her spelling is great, but sad to say her vocabulary is not powerful. Anyway, I had already started her on 5-word-a-day to help build her vocabulary.</p>

              <p>This is intriguing. The TS child obviously is unable to cope with the rigour of the primary school education system. Instead of taking time to coach her child or ensure she studies properly, she starts blaming the schools...The school imparts knowledge to all equally but some absorb it faster than others. If your child can't keep up, perhaps foundation wiould be the platform to help him study at a more suitable pace.</p>

              <p><br>The ideology in math is not to ask you to calculate, but to improve your EQ and IQ, yes you are right that most subjects taught are not applicable in our daily adult life, however we still need the basic foundation, then from there, we see what the child is interested in, identify the training needs and put him on that speciality. Perhaps by Secondary School, he/she should be taking less subjects and concentrate on his/her speciality, let say if child is noted to interested to be a chef, he/she will be put on cooking courses, he/she will still have to take Math and Science as an extra knowledge only, no need to be tested or examined, attendence will be enough.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But then our education system protray a jack of all trade and master of done paradox, that is why we created less entrepreneurs and more wage earners. But then, our govt may not like entrepreneurs, they prefer we to be wage earners to work for both GLC and MNC companies.</p>

              <p>my suggestion ..... is that the TS brings her child to a shrink .... get a psychometric/IQ test done ... plus some tests to see if she's suffering from some sort of learning disability .....</p>
              <p>if she's on the left side of the bell curve ... then, tough cookie, there's really not much you can do ...cos they haven't invented a smart pill yet ... so there's no point blaming the system ..... no point blaming a lousy car if the problem is with the driver, neh ? ... whether it's a toyota or a ferrari, the outcome would still be the same ... the driver's still gonna crash, neh ? ... </p>
              <p>and if it's because she's got some learning disability ... (I dunno, autism ... ADD ? that sort of thing) ... then yes, it's better to take her out of the system anyways ... but it's not really the system's fault too ... cos the system has to cater for, and is designed for, the majority ...</p>

              <p>the education system in sg is a big joke; u stress the children out from pri 1 to the point that they nearly break, bestowed on them the title of "genius" for passing the rigourous gauntlets of studies, and dump them into the society with all the head knowledge but absolute zero on social and environmental awareness, personal and civil rights, not to mention a damaged personality that will take years to fix with counselling and medications. and all these for what?? in a tiny island of 24x48km?</p>
              <p>so if you the are parent and u see your children "suffer" under the rigorous system, what are u going to do about it?</p>
              <p>let me recall this incident that happened to my cousin back in the 90s; she was studying in a reputable sec school, parents are hawkers that her classmates made fun of. because of study and exam stress and coupled with changes in the family structure, she snapped when she finished her exam miserably. thinking that she had failed the exam, she lept to her death from a 20+ floor condo.</p>
              <p>the scene at the funeral was one that i will never forget. and i have been questioning the whys and hows behind this tragic incident.</p>
              <p>so how? will u consider taking your children out of the stress pit in sg before or after they jump to the death or commit to mental asylum? sure, many have survived the system, maybe it is too kia-see to speculate this but the possibility is always there.</p>

              <p>what nonsense from MOE, as usual.</p>
              <p>I feel your pain.</p>
              <p>No spelling for english..wtf? If that is the case, how is  student able to excel if he/she is unable to even express his/her thoughts clearly? I still remember like 6/7 years ago, we were forced to learn cheem cheem words and memorise them and learn to use them in essays. Good phrases..etc.</p>
              <p>Learn to manage such shit from MOE, just know that your support, love and respect for your child is so damned important, because whether a person succeeds in life is not based on academics alone. I've even known of people who are just too nerdish to even pass an interview and end up driving a taxi with a bloody PHD cert in the taxi (just joking for this part).</p>
              <p>Honestly, if my economic status was to allow me to be a second class citizen elsewhere, so be it; the aim of life is not to pwnt exams and be like 1337 n3rd.</p>
              <p>To think that the people of Singapore regard students from the Raffles family and many others as elites; I would not say this is a bad thing, but it is the result of the segregation in difference of learning abilities at such a tender age..Abolish EM3, come out with foundation..-.-<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/thumbs_down.png" alt="thumbs_down.png"></p>
