            <div class='col-md body'>ORAL SEX IS NOT A CRIME<br>-----------------------<br><br>With regards to the article "Cop jailed, career over because<br>of Oral Sex" that appeared in Straits Times dated Friday 07 November 2003,<br>I would like to raise some personal concerns.  Firstly I am shocked over<br>such practices of the justice system to intrude and intervene in the private<br>sexual activities of consenting partners, who are of or above the legal<br>age to indulge in sexual activities.<br><br>In my opinion I think most Singaporeans do not even mind parliament's decision<br>to award the Cabinet sweeping powers via 'Internal Secruity Act' for the sake<br>of National Interest as long as the ruling government do not abuse them.  But should<br>parliament reserve the authority to dictate on what is allowed and what is<br>not allowed in a consensual private sexual activity?  Advanced civilisations in the world<br>have renounced such laws, so why is our government is still hanging onto<br>these Draconian legal methods, especially when we are transforming into a Metropolitan city.<br><br>I am not a lawyer and like me most Singaporeans are not aware of the laws<br>that govern our daily ordinary activities.  We simply live by the slogan that<br>the government knows the best.  But this conviction prompted me to question if<br>oral sex is really a crime? or is it just accepted as such, all because the<br>prosecution said so? If I were to consult a lawyer about this then I have to fork out my own<br>funds, however I got a free access to the electronic version of the constitution and the penal code<br>over the web site 'http://www.agc.gov.sg' ( that's the Singapore's Attorney General's website).<br><br>One thing I learnt by reading the constitution is that freedom of speech and expression<br>is guaranteed by the Constitution Of Singapore as long as it is within certain legal limitations<br>that may be allowed by the constitution.  So when the female teenager consensually performed<br>oral sex on the Cop, she was freely expressing her affection and love for the Cop and was thus<br>exercising her constitutional right of expression. Now how could that be a crime? Definitely<br>not, unless parliament had imposed any law to bar oral sex as a form of expression.<br><br>Parliament can restrict freedom of speech and expression by the authority granted to it by the<br>following constitutional statements :<br><br>" Freedom of speech, assembly and association<br>14. Â—(1) Subject to clauses (2) and (3) Â—<br><br>(a) every citizen of Singapore has the right to freedom of speech and expression;<br><br>...<br><br>(2) Parliament may by law impose Â—<br><br>(a) on the rights conferred by clause (1) (a), such restrictions as it considers<br>necessary or expedient in the interest of the security of Singapore or any part<br>thereof, friendly relations with other countries, public order or morality and<br>restrictions designed to protect the privileges of Parliament or to provide<br>against contempt of court, defamation or incitement to any offence;<br><br>... "<br><br>However this authority had not been executed to restrict oral sex as a freedom of expression<br>as no law had been passed to explicitly restrict oral sex or sexual stimulation by oral means.<br><br>Even if parliament were to pass such laws, these laws could be invalidated if it could be proven<br>that such laws had been passed without the majority of parliament's consideration that<br>such laws were necessary or expedient.  E.g. Majority in parliament may not have considered or<br>could have considered against such laws, but voted for the laws any way under the instructions of<br>party leadership.  Even if nobody had challenged such laws, it is not impossible to legally challenge.<br><br>Since private oral sex as a form of expression between two consensual partners cannot cause any damage<br>to national security, friendliness between countries, public order, privileges of parliament,<br>or be translated as contempt of court or an act to incite offence, it therefore could be easily concluded<br>that parliament can only introduce law to restrict oral sex on the grounds of morality as provided for by<br>the constitution.<br><br>But the question is , is it moral or even constitutionally legal for parliament to<br>enact and impose laws to restrict oral sex as a form of expression between two consensual sex partners<br>on the grounds of morality if parliament during such enactment had permanently or temporarily had lost its<br>sense of morality.  E.g. Cigarettes can cause health problems and even death to consumers.  Alcoholic drinks can cause<br>law and order problems and even health complications or even death via or to consumers.  In a way consuming alcohol<br>and smoking cigarettes is immoral but are allowed by parliament.  Prostitution is also immoral but is allowed<br>by parliament.  Is private oral sex more immoral than prostitution? By allowing prostitution in the state, parliament had<br>demonstrated great tolerence towards a great immorallity as long as it is practiced within controlled environment.<br>So in the light of such tolerence how could parliament justify the imposition of laws restricting oral sex in the<br>name of marallity when greater immoralities are allowed under the law.  But that is not a issue yet because parliament<br>has not enacted any law to restrict private oral sex.<br><br>Since oral sex is a form of expression that had not been explicitly restricted by parliament, then<br>it is not a crime.  However there is a clause in another law , called the Penal Code, which say :<br><br>" Unnatural offences.<br>377. Whoever voluntarily has carnal intercourse against the order of nature with any man,<br>woman or animals, shall be punished with imprisonment for life, or with imprisonment<br>for a term which may extend to 10 years, and shall also be liable to fine.<br><br>Explanation.<br>Penetration is sufficient to constitute the carnal intercourse necessary to the<br>offence described in this section.<br><br>Outrages on decency.<br>377A. Any male person who, in public or private, commits, or abets the commission of,<br>or procures or attempts to procure the commission by any male person of, any act<br>of gross indecency with another male person, shall be punished with imprisonment<br>for a term which may extend to 2 years.  "<br><br>As seen from the above, the law clearly states that "carnal intercourse against the order of nature" is an offence.<br>The law did not say that oral sex is an offence.  The law did not even say that oral sex can be interpretted as<br>carnal intercourse against the order nature.  If parliament had wanted oral sex to be a crime then the law should<br>read that oral sex is a crime.  The law is not even seeking to protect nature! Clause 377A clearly states that<br>male homosexual activities are criminal offences.  Homosexuality is not only found in humanity, but is also found<br>in other spieces and primates, which makes it natural. However natural is not sufficient and acceptable to parliament<br>and it has clearly branded homosexuality as a crime.  So parliament is capable of creating simple and clear laws<br>to outlaw anything it wants to, and the fact that it did not outlaw oral sex is evident enough that oral sex is not<br>a crime by law.  Only the prosecution says that oral sex is a carnal intercourse that is against the order of nature,<br>and thus had secured the conviction of the cop.<br><br>Now every body knows that oral sex is carnal intercourse, but the important question is, is it against the order<br>of nature? If the prosecution insists that it is, then the onus is on the prosecution to prove that carnal intercourse<br>is against the order of nature.  Since the prosecution had not proved beyond resonable doubts that oral sex is carnal<br>intercourse against the order of nature, the conviction of the cop is not legal.<br><br>The problem is that the prosecution assumed that oral sex is carnal intercourse that is not in line with<br>the order of nature, and it had also assumed that anything that is not in line with the order of nature<br>should be against the order of nature.<br><br>But the fact is, oral sex which is a carnal intercourse is not agaisnt the order of nature, but infact<br>it is supplementing or even complementing the order of nature and sometimes it is neutral but never against the order<br>of nature and sometimes it is the order of nature. The public prosectors seem to have George Bush kind of attitude :<br>"If you are not with us then you are against us!".  Dear prosecutors please wake up, we are not in America.  It seems to<br>appear that the public prosecutors had either woken up in the wrong side of the globe or had woken up in the<br>wrong side of the millenium.<br><br>Before I go further lets look at the meaning of carnal intercourse.  'Carnal' means of the flash, and 'intercourse'<br>means one object penetrating another object. So 'carnal intercourse' means flash penetrating flash.  So if you put<br>your finger into your partner's or your own mouth, nose or ears it constitutes carnal intercourse. If you put any part of<br>yours into any part of your partner's it constitutes carnal intercourse.  'Carnal intercourse' has such a wide range of<br>meanings, but the law is only interested on those that are against the order of nature.  So it is vital to know what is the<br>"order of nature"?<br><br>The "order of nature" is the sequence or arrangement of natural things that are related to each other.<br>Scientists and researchers believed that things in nature are linked by certain relation and can be<br>naturally arranged or sequenced according to these relations. So they observed and documented what they<br>observed in an attempt to explain the order of nature.  The question is, is their observation<br>and documentation complete?<br><br>The "order of nature" is a field of science and not a field of artificial man made laws.  In science it is always<br>agreed that all laws discovered are true to the extend of the observation that led to their discovery.<br>True does not mean complete.  Which means future discoveries may extend or expand the current laws.  For<br>example, Newton's laws of motion can be used to explain the motions of large objects, but they cannot be used to<br>explain the motions of very very small particles.  So new equations in quantum physics were developed to study<br>the motion of small particles.  This does mean Newton was wrong, but it only means Netwon's laws were true but were<br>not complete.  Likewise the documented observations of the order of nature may be true, but are not complete<br>and can be extended and expanded with new discoveries.<br><br>When discussing the "orders of nature" we must understand that we are talking about nature, something that is constantly<br>changing.  Except for two things, nothing is constant in the Universe. 1) Change is always constant.<br>2)  The total mass of the Universe is always constant.  Of course this claim can be subjected to expansion and extension.<br>So if nature is changing all the time, is it justifiable to claim that the "order of nature" is constant or to force us<br>all to admit and submit to that one version of interpretation of the "order of nature" that is offered by the prosecution.<br><br>Of course when talking about "order of nature", the most a-priori (rationally assumed) and prima facia (obvious)<br>"order of nature" would be that that was observed in terms of pro-creation.   Yes, if you look at "order of nature" in<br>terms of procreation, you would observe that man and woman can be arranged in sequence by their sexual organs.  Which<br>means "order of nature" was observed in the view of a possible purpose that such order may work towards to achieve.<br>Pro-creation lead to the continuation of life, which is the purpose of pro-creation.  So are there other purposes in nature?<br>Why should all mentions of "order of nature" should be viewed in terms of Pro-Creation.  How about "order of nature" in<br>terms of Symbiosis and Co-Existence.  How about "order of nature" in terms of Natural Selection.  How about "order of nature"<br>in terms of genetics.  How about "order of nature" in terms of Evolution.  The list may go on.<br><br>When I was young, may be 11-years old or so, women began to look attractive. I naturally felt attraction towards women.<br>How could I have developed such an instinct or behaviour.  One might explain that my observation of the world could<br>have affected me.  But is it possible that the code for such behaviour was naturally imprinted within my genes.  Now I feel<br>that I need to sexually entertain my girl friend to keep her engaged in the relationship, and such relationship gives me<br>emotional security. So if I were to perform oral sex with her to gain emotional security, could it be the result of a<br>genetical code?  If it is, would not that make oral sex part of the "order of nature" at a different level?  Can the<br>prosecution prove that it is impossible beyond all reasonable doubts?  Do they really understand the mysteries of nature and<br>the codes of the genes.  Are they that GOOD?<br><br>Natural Selection, Evolution and other factors can all change the relations between natural things.  So we all have to<br>keep an open mind as far as nature is concerned.  In terms of nature it can be openly concluded that oral sex<br>is not against the "order of nature".<br><br>If the justice system still insists that oral sex is a carnal intercourse that is against the order of nature<br>then let's view the situation from another angle. For a moment let us all assume that oral sex is a crime.<br>Now think about condoms and physically applied contraceptives.  Are these things natural?  No they are not.<br>Though sexual intercourse is carnal intercourse that is not against the order of nature, sexual intercourse with the<br>aid of condoms or applied contraceptive in definitely carnal intercourse against the order of nature.<br><br>There are millions of condoms and contraceptives sold in Singapore every year.  That means there are  millions of sexual<br>intercourses with the aid of condoms and contraceptive that are being executed every year. Which translates that million of<br>carnal intercourses against the order of nature is being committed in singapore every year.  So how many people had<br>been brough to justice so far by the prosecution? Well the answer in none.  Why the prosecution chooses to ignore<br>certain group of criminals and seek to convict other groups of criminals who violate the same law?  Is the public prosecutor<br>negligent to ignore certain group of criminals?  If so, is the prosecutor's department directly protecting certain groups<br>of criminals.  If so, is it legal and constitutional to do so? It is clearly written in the constitution that :<br><br>Equal protection<br>12. Â—(1) All persons are equal before the law and entitled to the equal protection of<br>the law.<br><br>From what I see, the conviction of the cop is unconstitutional and therefore be overturned citing reasons that<br>the prosection's actions are in violation of the constitution.<br><br>Now should the court of law wait for defence to appeal or should it pro-actively free the cop in the interest of JUSTICE!<br>That is of course is a matter that had to decided by the electorate, the elected and those appointed by the elected.<br><br>This article is not written to challenge or harm the authority of the democratically established government,<br>and I truely regret and apologise if I did.  In the interest of SURVIVAL I now declare that I never wrote this article<br>and therefore you never read this article.  Adios.<br><br>Yours Sincerely<br><br>___________________<br><br>George Fernandez<br>e-mail: georgefdz007@yahoo.com<br>.<br><br></div>
