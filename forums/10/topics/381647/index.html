              <h3 class="post-title entry-title">Lee Kuan Yew's foreign talent policy destroys Singapore.</h3>
              <h3 class="post-title entry-title">Ladies and Gentlemen,<br><br>The Straits Times, Singapore's state controlled newspaper printed in it's online edition the story "Why we need immigrants". <br><br>Goh
                  Chock Tong, the Senior Minister, told an Indian gathering at Bradell
                  Heights Community Club that <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">unless Singapore continues to import
                  increasing numbers of foreign immigrants, it will "go the way of the
                  dinosaurs". </span></span>To justify his argument, he gave figures of people over 65
                  increasing by 100,000 and people under 15 shrinking by 50,000. He says
                  the reproduction figure has simply refused to increase which means more
                  people die than born. He went on to say that people are needed to build
                  the MRT, the glass towers and the services and there are insufficient
                  Singaporeans. <br><br>In my view, this is perfect recipe for disaster, which by the way, has already begun.<span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br><br>For
                  a highly educated and experienced million dollar minister to say this,
                  we can only conclude that he is not being entirely honest. </strong></span></span><br><br>If
                  he were to ask himself why do Singaporeans leave the country en masse
                  which is the major reason for the population decline, why do people not
                  have children, why does 3 out of 4 young people interviewed want to
                  emigrate if given the chance? In other words why do Singaporeans hate
                  Singapore so much? Why? <br><br>I bet he knows the answer. And if he
                  truly addresses those questions, Singaporeans would remain in the
                  country and procreate. They would be happy. But there is one down side
                  to it of course; Goh Chock Tong and his good friend Lee Kuan Yew would
                  be kicked out and perhaps tried, convicted and imprisoned. Not wanting
                  that of course, he comes up with this stop gap measure of bringing in
                  more and more foreigners which is nothing more than temporary first
                  aid. By the time it all eventually collapses, which will not be
                  overnight, he would either be dead and gone or into exile. That is why
                  he continues with this deliberate plan to keep increasing foreigners.
                  It keeps him and his friends at the top safe for the moment. He is
                  being deliberately dishonest in this. <br><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br>We all know why native
                  Singaporeans are beginning to hate their government and therefore,
                  their country. </strong></span></span>For one, it is the ongoing day light robbery of the men
                  in white (Lee Kuan Yew and the PAP). No single Singaporean can accept
                  the fact of Lee Kuan Yew and his friends paying themselves millions
                  while the majority of others have to eke out a living as best they can.
                  In order to inflict the maximum pain on his people while he and his
                  friends wallow in luxury, he makes sure of deliberately increasing
                  taxes, utility bills, transportation costs, medical fees, and you name
                  it. The people naturally ask what need is there to squeeze the last
                  penny out of the poor while he and his friends continue to grab more
                  than they could possibly spend? <br><br>While they live their
                  unimaginable lives of luxury, the poor are being kicked out of their
                  jobs because a foreigner has taken it; while they have no social
                  security or unemployment assistance whatsoever. A destitute unemployed
                  uneducated citizen is told that it is all his own fault and he should
                  go and line up ever day at his PAP Member of Parliament’s office for a
                  few crumbs of bread which he may or may not get. Now what about his
                  children? They starve. <br><br>Then he deliberately discredited the
                  very foundations of state, such as the judiciary and the civil service.
                  He requires his judges to be beholden to him and to abuse the law;
                  resulting in opposition politicians unjustly bankrupted and jailed on a
                  daily basis while his own get preferential treatment. I had given an
                  example of the corrupt judge Belinda Ang Saw Ean giving judgment for
                  Lee Kuan Yew's son's company Fraser and Nave and Asia Pacific Breweries
                  when they were sued by certain foreign banks. Please read my earlier
                  blog on this case. <br><br>The people have no means of venting their
                  grievances in this state controlled island. The newspapers are state
                  controlled and will not print anything negative of the government. The
                  judiciary is corrupt. The civil service is politicized which means only
                  government cronies and supporters get benefits while others are
                  disadvantaged. There is blatant and open racial discrimination. Malays
                  and Indians are disadvantaged in jobs, housing and benefits, what
                  little there is. <br><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br>There are adverts in the state controlled
                  press for job vacancies which disqualify Singaporeans from applying;
                  jobs reserved for foreigners only. </strong></span></span><br><br>The HDB Singapore’s
                  government housing monopoly gives choice locations to the Chinese,
                  while the Malays and Indians are required to disperse and live among
                  them. This is especially difficult for the Malays and Indian Muslims as
                  they do not eat pork which the Chinese relish. <br><br>The students
                  are deliberately not taught the skills that are needed in Singapore.
                  Goh Chock Tong rightfully says that foreigners are needed in
                  construction. Why, because Singaporeans do not have these skills. There
                  are no vocational schools and if there are, they deliberately do not
                  teach these skills. There are insufficient mechanics, insufficient
                  technicians and insufficient skilled people in every line of work. And
                  if there are, they are not well trained. There is no certification
                  process for vocational jobs. What little they know is what they picked
                  up from experience. And there are insufficient lawyers because the law
                  has been completely discredited. <br><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br>Even a boy can tell Goh Chock
                  Tong why there is this massive loss of people from Singapore. The
                  reason is himself, and his boss Lee Kuan Yew. It is their very presence
                  which causes masses to leave and not to have children. <br></strong></span></span><br>You can
                  solve this problem in one stroke. Stop abusing the law. Introduce the
                  rule of law. Tell your judges to stop their corruption. Stop paying
                  yourself millions. Build schools, real schools and educate the masses.
                  Stop persecuting political opponents. Free the press. Allow free
                  speech, expression and assembly. Give people some security in their
                  lives; introduce a minimum wage and social security for the unemployed.
                  Stop racial discrimination. Stop favoring foreigners at the expense of
                  Singaporeans. Give jobs to Singaporeans first before foreigners. And
                  last but not least, stop you arrogance. Do it and Singapore’s problems
                  would be solved overnight. <br><br>Let me tell you what is going to
                  happen with these increasing foreigners. The only ones who will sink
                  roots are the illiterate Chinese speaking imports. Not a single
                  educated foreigner will stay. They may come not knowing what Singapore
                  really is. But when they know what it really is, an island under the
                  grip of the Lee family with no rights whatsoever, they will go the way
                  they come. And while that goes on, increasing Singaporeans will
                  continue to leave.<br><br>At a point, foreigners and their offspring
                  will equal native born Singaporeans. These people will have no loyalty
                  and Singapore will turn into a revolving door, people coming and people
                  leaving. And those leaving will continue to discredit Singapore in
                  their native countries after knowing what it truly is. And among the
                  Singaporeans leaving, some would turn out to be bloggers like the
                  Singapore Dissident, continuing to expose the rot within. <br><br>It
                  is not something that can survive. Dubai can be contrasted to
                  Singapore. There, the royalty keep their power while the natives are
                  very well taken care of. Unlike Singapore, no citizen of Dubai wants to
                  leave his country. Surrounded by oil money, they have no worries on
                  that score. Their people are contended and foreigners do the work.
                  Dubai has the money to last this way. Singapore does not have that
                  luxury. <br><br>Singapore is not Dubai and can never expect to be one.
                  There is no oil money here. Singapore is not an emirate and we do not
                  have an emir. So when Lee Kuan Yew behaves like a king, this
                  antagonizes the people, resulting in hatred and contempt. Singapore
                  unlike Dubai is supposed to have a free press, fundamental human
                  rights, and a democracy. When these things are denied Singaporeans,
                  they will resist and if not, they will leave and not have any children.
                  Foreigners cannot solve the problem. In any case, no educated foreigner
                  would want to sink roots here. The only ones are the coolies from China
                  and India. And they cannot advance Singapore. <br><br>Don't say that I
                  did not tell you. Your policies are doomed to failure. And I hope
                  Singaporeans will have the courage to resist to save their island.<br><br>Gopalan Nair<br>39737 Paseo Padre Parkway, Suite A1<br>Fremont, CA 94538, USA<br>Tel: 510 657 6107<br>Fax: 510 657 6914<br>Email: <a href="mailto:nair.gopalan@yahoo.com">nair.gopalan@yahoo.com</a><br>Blog: <a href="http://singaporedissident.blogspot.com/">http://singaporedissident.blogspot.com/</a><br><br><em><em><em>Your letters are welcome.

              <p>Singapore is losing its competitiveness rapidly while its competitors are catching up very fast while many Singaporeans are still living in the era that Singapore is always one or few steps ahead of its competitors and hence Singaporeans can continue to earn high income.</p>
              <p>The import of foreign professionals are to meet the country's and companies' needs so that they can continue to compete in the world market.</p>

              <p>Singapore has been known for its success through import.</p>
              <p>During the 60 and 70s, Singapore solved its double-digit unemployment rate through the import of MNCs production factories into Singapore</p>
              <p>During the 80s and 90s, Singapore has imported the production and management skills and technologies from Japan, US and Europe to grow Singapore economy further.</p>
              <p>Singapore has always been known to import foreign talents. The success of Singapore owes a lot to foreign talent. Dr Goh Keng Swee is a Malaysian and he is the person who is responsible for the economic success of Singapore for the 60s and 70s and he lays a solid foundation for Singapore economy too.</p>
              <p>So, it is perfectly alright when there is one day when a foreign talent becomes a Singapore citizen and eventually he or she goes on to become the PM of Singapore as long as he or she has the capabilities.</p>

              <p>even if LKY one fine day say......"I WILL GIVE ALL YOUR MONEY AND GREAT PAYIN JOB BACK."</p>
              <p>it will take like 7 years at least to solve the complicated mess alone in their legislation regarding foreign employment.</p>
              <p>then it will take 2 years to plan and implement good career prospects,workplace matters for male singaporeans (national service) and salary for singaporeans.</p>
              <p>then it will take another 3 years for pricing to go down for essential food,housing ,cars etc.</p>
              <p>and give and take another 4 years for other issues.</p>
              <p>total would be like 16 years to lead normal comfortable lives if LKY or some leader says he will give you a  normal life after all the education and work experience in singapore.</p>
              <p>THAT IS IF HE SAYS IT TODAY  OTHERWISE CAN EXPECT TO WAIT 32 YEARS IF U CONTINUE TO WAIT OR HOPE FOR MIRACLES.</p>
              <p>SO IF U ARE 30 YEARS OLD TODAY........AND LKY SAYS TODAY HE WILL GIVE EVERYONE A GOOD LIFE IF THEY HAVE STUDIED AND WORKED HARD,,,U  WOULD BE 30+16 YEARS=46 YEARS OLD TO SEE SOMETHING.JUST THE BUD COMING OUT ONLY!NOT YET FLOWER!!DAMN.......I DUN HAVE LONG TO LIVE!</p>

              <p><br>Does the SINGAPORE GOVERNMENT have actors or real people who knows what is happening ?</p>
              <p>Or is it not a fact that those who have been appointed have no experience - and are all "works in progress", in the same manner as LKY had started 42 years ago when he became a Prime Minister without any political experience ?</p>
              <p>With the intelligence and experience of then DPM LHL - who had chaired both the Economics Review Committee after the 1987 economic crash, and also after the 1997 financial meltdown - it seems that LHL had been "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">ABLE TO PERCEIVE THE ISSUES FIRST OF ALL</span></em>", has LHL and his Government been "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">ABLE TO SOLVE THEM WHICH IS THEIR MAIN FUNCTION OF THEIR JOB IN SPORE POLITICS N GOVERNMENT???</span></em>"</p>
              <p>In the anxiety to prove its own relevance the Hitman3 will allow its X-rated factors to take control of its antics that surely will lead itself down a slippery slope.</p>

              <p>Umms well i find this post very interesting so dont mind i KPO abit ah.Well,i may know little about politics but what i know is it doesnt really matter if foreign talents come over to singapore to so called"steal our jobs" and "flood Singapore with foreign aliens".I personally feel that its more to the side where if you got the abilities because if you got the abilities why scared u no job?It will become u wan the job anot.And i think instead of complaining that the government left out some poors and they no job blah blah blah.Go help them la.U think the government very free ah.So next time donate more for charity larhs.And i agree that foreign talents are helping the growth of the singapore economy.Hahas Im only 13 forgive me if im abit dumb.</p>
