              <p>So be it, if dubai goes up, isn't it go for us too, same goes to China, at first we were worry about Chinese coming up, but MM enlightened us that China coming up is actually an opportunity for us, it is of great blessing that we had a multi-racial society, the chinese can tap on China progression, the Indians can tap on India progress and the Muslims can alway tap on the Arab business opportunity. So, if we look at competition in another way, we actually gain from it.</p>
              <p>Any country great economy blom is not going to say that someone will fall, we ride the wave of the boom by servicing and provide auxillaries industrial for them, and in turn, we also enjoy the fruit of the booming, but if you are to negatively sit there and complaining about competition here and there, you are just killing yourself.</p>
              <p>China economy upsurge itself had brought upon great economy for Asia, even Taiwan, Korea and  Japan gain from it tremedously. The south americans had benefit very much from USA economy blooming period too. So, in conclusion, we should embrace any economy that is moving up by networking and doing business with them.</p>

              <p>it doesn't take an old dick to know that singapore latched on taiwan's offer of a military training facility because it was a marriage of convenience. taiwan was yearning for any form of recognition and singapore needs a military training base. of course there is this big brother USA which is also selling military wares to taiwan to balance off the chinese communists threat then. singapore can always hide behind US's ass if there is any blow-ups.</p>
              <p>the geo-politics in the 70s &amp; 80s were very different. china wouldn't bat an eyelid on singapore then. </p>
              <p>today, it is a different political proposition. if china (want to) force singapore's hand, the latter would withdraw unconditionally out of taiwan. but of course china won't. after all, what is singapore to china? singapore is like another wanna-be BFF to paris hilton; eager to impress at any cost.</p>
              <p>singapore in fact has scale back it's military training in taiwan in the last decade; in favor for more `non-confrontative' locations like USA, australia and soon india.</p>
              <p>and of course, nothing is for free. singapore pays considerable $$$ to these countries facilitating land areas for the training. on the account of diplomatic ties alone, singapore can't find a square foot of sand to set foot in.</p>
              <p>lastly, you need to get your timeline right before you gloat.</p>
              <p>singapore started its military training exercise in taiwan in 1975, and established diplomatic ties with china only in 1990.</p>
              <p>post-1990, especially of late, singapore will not make a big deal out of conducting its military exercise in taiwan. in fact, singapore `diversified'.</p>
              <p>you bringing it up and beaming about how singapore can maintain and balance both ties will only make the singapore defence ministry's guys cringe.</p>
              <p>it's so 1970s.... </p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>The fact remains, singapore has not moved out of Taiwan, and it has not much headway into Malaysia and Indonesia, and have to go all the way to india and even south africa.</p>
              <p>Singapore actually doesn't need to keep the training camp in Taiwan. It can easily move to Guangxi and Yunan province, which was offered to us but rejected.  Why are we continuing to keep the risk to antangonize china? what is taiwan to us?  Obviously something hasn't changed since the 70s</p>

              <p>Why do Singaporeans keep complaing about foreign Talent ? I am a Singaporean working overseas. Lived and worked in many countries. Singapore has no resources to speak of, no man power to back the economy. if we do have the brains to work out a solution. Singapore will not be a clean and politically safe country to invest in. How many singaporeans are working for foreign invested companies in Singapore? All the major banks, Biotech companies. Yes, they do recruit foreigners in their companies as well but most for manufacturing sector where no young singaporean wants to work in a factory. No young Singapore is able to withstand hardships.</p>

              <p>go and handle your groups of international girls...still waiting for the US sailors?</p>

              <p>I am referring back to history, in the late 70s and 80s, i believe we already engaged with communism, and if you tell me muslim (referring to those extremist) are not a worrying issue, I think our National security agency can retrench peoples liao.</p>
              <p>Economy is different from military perspective, if we go into China, what happen is, American, South korea, taiwan and japan diplomatic relationship will be chaos, for that we are not going to loose all these ties. So, inorder to save the bruises, we better stay status quo and nothing happen, by the way, our forces are disintergrating, with lesser birth and boys been born due to weak Singapore men, next time Tekong and Ubin can already, dun waste so much tax payer money ya</p>

              <p>Is there standard philisophy? hahaha...do not think what you believe is standard, the world out there is more varied and different than your little brain.</p>
              <p>there are problems that I cannot resolve, for it is beyond my ability, for it does not impact me as much as it would impact others,...going around a problem does not solve the problem. You just avoid the negative impact of the problem. the problem remains there, and those who do not know how to avoid it will still be affected by it. so a) and b) are not the same. </p>
              <p>So you think running to america will solve the problem brought about by the FT policy in Singapore? NO, the problem is still there, many singaporeans in singapore are still affected by it, the problem is not solved just because you ran away to america. complaining and whinning behind the comfort of your room behind the computer is NOT the action needed to solve the problem, period.</p>
              <p>Singapore get burnt in China and Taiwan affairs? hmmm....we are still the only country with diplomatic relationship with PRC but military tie with ROC. The political world is more complicated than what your limited brain can imagine.</p>

              <p><br>I suggest you better back off before I start quoting the standard philosophy's originator. Playing punk with philosophy is like playing with fire, because I can see you don't even know there is such thing as standard philosophies</p>
              <p>Your posting again reflects your arrogance. You better do some self-examination, before you embarass yourself even further. The more you respond, the more arrogant you have become, thereby becoming Type (c) (according to your own twisted philosophy)</p>
              <p>And you are displaying your ignorance of philosophies. Resolution of an issue does not meant removing the issue as an obstacle, but entails how you work past the issue, regardless of the method. Your feeble attempt to defend your twisted philosophy only goes to show how you take philosophies on a superficial level, and not being able to see that philosophies are NOT rules, but is a flexible way of viewing how to live life</p>
              <p>Your hands are getting more and more burnt as we speak.</p>
              <p>And given the last statement, I trust you don't even read the news, when our leader took a trip to Taiwan, got the flak of China, said he was there to help China work with Taiwan, got the flak of Taiwan.</p>
              <p>Arrogance with ignorance. Even worse than ignorance. Kindly go educate yourself more before you come here to post.</p>
              <p>By the way, is it your intention to insult all Singaporeans outside of Singapore? Just because we are overseas do not mean we are not concerned with the issues of our friends at home. What gives you the right to make a comment about overseas Singaporeans being "running away" to other countries, and that we are "in the comfort of our room" complaining?</p>
              <p>This is the greatest display of arrogance of them all. You belong truly to the Type (c) in your twisted philosophy.</p>
              <p>And, some people don't run overseas. Some people go overseas because they are invited to, so kindly stay off this topic if you are ignorant about it.</p>
