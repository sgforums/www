              <p>No need to heap further praise onto yourself intentionally using my words. Do be a bit more original.</p>
              <p>Told you, you and the self admitted piece of shit's timmings comming in here and posting had been similar for days, your desperation causing your mistakes, and one would be forgiven for thinking you and her are the same person with clone nicks. Glad you took my advice to stagger your responses now. Good ____ ( I let you do the honour to derogatively call yourself for once)</p>
              <p>But then I will make no assumption, and will deal with you or her in my own orginal way. You or your both nicks serve a purpose for me.</p>

The only ones who will sink roots are the illiterate Chinese speaking imports. Not a single educated foreigner will stay. They may come not knowing what Singapore really is.

And while that goes on, increasing Singaporeans will continue to leave.<br><br>At a point, foreigners and their offspring will equal native born Singaporeans. These people will have no loyalty and Singapore will turn into a revolving door, people coming and people leaving. And those leaving will continue to discredit Singapore in their native countries after knowing what it truly is. And among the Singaporeans leaving, some would turn out to be bloggers like the Singapore Dissident, continuing to expose the rot within.</h3>

              <p><strong>Australian degree for MM Lee brings outrage</strong></p>
              <hr style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #ffffff;">
              <div>
              <div>By Rob Taylor<br>Mar 22, 2007<br>Reuters<br><br>CANBERRA, March 22 (Reuters) - A plan to award former Singapore Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew with an honorary degree has outraged academics at one of Australia's top universities, who on Thursday accused Lee of presiding over an authoritarian regime.<br><br>Lee, who was Prime Minister from 1959 to 1990 and is now Minister Mentor for the island state, will be given an Honorary Doctorate of Laws by Canberra's Australian National University next week.<br><br>But senior academics have written to the university's Vice-Chancellor Ian Chubb in protest at the award, complaining that Lee quashed all opponents during his three-decade rule.<br><br>"It's outrageous. You can admit that the man oversaw an extraordinary development, but the cost of that was basically a one-party state and an intellectual atmosphere that was intimidatory at best," Dr Michael McKinley, an ANU specialist in international relations and diplomacy, told Reuters.<br><br>Lee, 83, is due to accept the award during a visit to Australia with his wife. The ANU is regularly listed as one of the world's top universities and is Australia's peak research-based campus.<br><br>A spokeswoman for the university said there would be no comment on opposition by academic staff to Lee's degree, although ANU Chancellor Dr Allan Hawke said "the good outweighs the bad" on Lee's record.<br><br>Hilary Charlesworth, the Director of ANU's Centre for International Governance and Justice, said she was baffled by the decision to award Lee, whose son Lee Hsien Loong is Singapore's third Prime Minister.<br><br>"Any human rights lawyers would be really concerned by this," she told Australian media.<br><br>High-profile Australian barrister Stuart Littlemore, who was banned from entering Singapore to represent opposition politician Chee Soon Juan in a defamation case, told the Canberra Times newspaper that ANU's decision to award Lee "brings shame upon it".<br><br>The elder Lee is credited with transforming resource-poor Singapore into one of the world's most dynamic economies at the cost of political and social freedoms among the island's small 4.5 million population.<br><br>Lee banned public demonstrations, introduced tight controls over the press and has sued opposition leaders for defamation, arguing it was better to be feared than loved.<br><br>McKinley, who often speaks in Singapore, said Lee's government intimidated Singaporean academics, who felt they would be targeted if they were to talk about political issues.<br><br>"People still do not feel free to voice their opinions and certainly the chances of any political opposition being represented in parliament are absolutely minimal," he said.<br><br>"The politics of the country still remain essentially one-party and the anecdotal evidence is that he is still very, very powerful."<br><br>But ANU said the award was to honour Lee's achievements and further the university's relationship with Singapore.</div>

              <p>Hey, don't have to explain to me. :D. A person with integrity doesn't need to beg others to help testify their behavior. The more you explain, the more you look guilty. Not to mention the same expletives and attitude were in both postings, and you actually responded with a mere little jab at another 'poster' :D</p>
              <p>But continue on! :D It only helps to expose more of your inadequacy that you have to resort to clones to pretend there are people who support your lack of knowledge</p>

              <p><strong>From our Correspondent</strong></p>
              <p>A NUS student, Calvin Ng, has written to the Straits Times Forum expressing his disappointment at the recently concluded Kent Ridge Ministerial Forum with Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew!</p>
              <p>He wrote:</p>
              <p><em>“I was rather disappointed that questions directed at Mr Lee by the students were pre-selected and ‘politically correct’. This was despite the forum’s project director calling for ‘active participation from the audience’ in his opening address.”</em></p>
              <p>It is not revealed whether the setting was requested by MM Lee himself or arranged by the forum’s organizers.</p>
              <p>MM Lee was an excellent and much feared orator during his days as Singapore’s Prime Minister. He should not be overwhelmed by a few difficult questions from the students.</p>
              <p>Besides, Singapore undergraduates have become so de-politicized over the years that it will unlikely that they will dare embarrass the strongman with similar questions which he encountered in Russia when he was asked point-blank on whether he appointed his son to become Singapore’s third prime minister.</p>
              <p>As Calvin has rightly pointed out, a forum must involve active and spontaneous interaction between the audience and the speakers.</p>
              <p>It defeats the purpose to have pre-selected questions prepared beforehand for the speakers even before they begin their speeches!</p>
              <p>The Kent Ridge ministerial forum is an utter disgrace to the NUS community! How can the government expect NUS to become a world-class university when it don’t even trust its students to ask questions?</p>
              <p>It is little wonder that <strong>foreign universities like Warwick</strong> had declined Singapore’s invitation to set up campuses here due to concerns about freedom of speech.</p>
              <p>What’s so special about MM Lee that he must be shielded from certain sensitive and controversial questions? He is only a former prime minister of Singapore!</p>
              <p>The way the forum is conducted is making a mockery out of our students and leaders! If MM Lee is afraid to face questions from the crowd, then he should not speak at the forum in the first place.</p>

              <p>A Singapore recruitment agency posted on its website a list for jobs for foreigners, but locals need not apply!</p>
              <p><span>Allied Manpower is a licensed recruitment agency in Singapore which claims to provide services in human resources and manpower management. It has</span> over 29 years of proven experience in foreign recruitment.</p>
              <p>It offered a list of jobs for foreigners which can be easily filled by locals:</p>
              <p><span><a rel="lightbox" href="http://www.temasekreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/alliejob585.jpg"><img title="alliejob585" src="http://www.temasekreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/alliejob585.jpg" alt="alliejob585" width="288" height="172"></a><br></span></p>
              <p>As we can see from above, the jobs are offered only to specific nationalities such as Filipinos and Chinese nationals.</p>
              <p>Of late, senior cabinet ministers have stepped forward to defend the government’s pro-foreigner policy.</p>
              <p>MM Lee repeated the circular argument that foreigners are needed to take up jobs shunned by Singaporeans without which Singapore’s economy will stagnate:</p>
              <p><em>“Look at the Integrated Resorts. (On the) rooftop, not one (construction) worker there is a Singaporean. (They are) China Chinese and the Indians. If you don’t have that, where’s the IR, and the 10,000 jobs (they will create)?”</em> he asked in speech made at a grassroots event last week.</p>
              <p>Opticians, art teachers, beauticians and website designers are hardly considered as jobs shunned by Singaporeans. In fact, many locals will be keen to take up such jobs.</p>
              <p>The Singapore Polytechnic offers a three-year course in Optometry which is popular among students. Are Filipino opticians more highly qualified than ours?</p>
              <p>Saved for the positions of IT support analyst and opticians, the other jobs offer pay of less than $1,500.</p>
              <p>For a local website designer, $1,200 is surely too low a salary, but it is more than enough for a Chinese National who has no family here. Convert it to RMB and he will take home more than RMB$5,500 a month, far more than what he makes in China.</p>
              <p>Again, there are many qualified Singaporeans who will be interested in applying to become an Art teacher if not for the meager pay of $1,200.</p>
              <p>Imagine if you are a diploma or degree holder, will you consider taking up such a job?</p>
              <p>Instead of addressing the real concerns on the ground, the government has chosen to put the blame on Singaporeans for being too “choosy” about their jobs.</p>
              <p>The relentless influx of foreigners, especially the semi-skilled workers, has led to increased competition for the limited jobs in the labor market.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans often have to accept lower pay and longer working hours out of fear of being replaced by foreigners who generally have fewer demands.</p>
              <p>Despite the widespread unhappiness and resentment among the citizenry at its immigration policy, the ruling party is adamant that foreigners are needed to keep the Singapore economy growing.</p>
              <p>There is no minimal wage in Singapore. Neither are there any social welfare benefits for those who are retrenched or unemployed.</p>
              <p>Singapore’s population just cross the 5-million mark this year out of which 36 per cent are foreigners. This means that for every person you meet in the streets, he/she is likely to be a foreigner.</p>
              <p>The ruling party is able to force its unpopular policies down the throats of a subservient citizenry largely because there is no opposition in parliament to check on them and it controls all important state institutions.</p>
              <p>In Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea and other Asian democracies, citizens are able to gather and protest in the streets to show their frustration and anger against their governments.</p>
              <p>In Singapore, even a peaceful solo protest anywhere on the island except Hong Lim Park is illegal under the law.</p>
              <p>The lack of public expression of dissent helps the ruling party to recycle and perpetuate the myth through the state media that it is a “popular” government which have the “support” of the people to introduce these laws and policies.</p>
              <p>Unless Singaporeans wake up from their long slumber and reclaim their civil and political rights as citizens of their country, they will forever be subjected to the mercy of the ruling party.</p>

              <p>For Singaporean (citizens), after CPF of $800 to $1,200. What is left for living expenses and parental support? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But according to MIW, it's the only way to compete with China and India, we must lower our labour cost to their levels. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But wait a second, how come other advanced economies don't have such low salaries like Singapore? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It's really ironic, you look at other advanced economies, their workers salary is high but Singapore is low; if you look at their government leaders salary it is low, but ours is high. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Something is really wrong somewhere, or maybe Singapore is really unique like what the MIW claims. Burma is also unique, their leaders gets everything while the workers get low pay. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>And you are displaying your ignorance of philosophies. Resolution of an issue does not meant removing the issue as an obstacle, but entails how you work past the issue, regardless of the method. Your feeble attempt to defend your twisted philosophy only goes to show how you take philosophies on a superficial level, and not being able to see that philosophies are NOT rules, but is a flexible way of viewing how to live life</p>

What gives you the right to make a comment about overseas Singaporeans being "running away" to other countries, and that we are "in the comfort of our room" complaining?</p>
              <p>This is the greatest display of arrogance of them all. You belong truly to the Type (c) in your twisted philosophy.</p>
              <p>And, some people don't run overseas. Some people go overseas because they are invited to, so kindly stay off this topic if you are ignorant about it.</p>

              <p>keep your academic argument to your self.</p>
              <p>there is a big hole in the middle of the road, the fact that I saw it and manage to avoid it, doesn't mean I have solved the problem. A big hole in the middle of the road remains a problem for road users. To really solve the problem, you either fill it up, or call somebody to fill it. if you think the problem is solved just because you don't fall into it is a total igorant of the interest of other road users, that is a very selfish, for you only think for yourself. Ignorant, arrogant, and now selfish.</p>
              <p>Yes, the singaporean who find their life overseas and don't have to put up with the s h i t they don't like in singapore have found a solution for themselves, but what they call s h i t remains in singapore, others in singapore are still facing it, smelling it, so why should those overseas be insulted? and yr views don't represent all overseas singaporean, arrogant?</p>
              <p>our leaders kena flak from everybody, from the philippinos, the americans, the australians, not to mention the malaysian and the indonesian, that is part of politics , part of life. these are side effects of something of greater importance and significance, and we were able to contain the flak from turning it into wild fire. even LKY's recents speech about balancing the power in Asia also drew flak from the prc netizens, so? dont speak? no bloody principle, no guts....</p>
              <p>the more you speak, the more you expose yourself. get a life. </p>

              <p>I am too lazy to correct your flaws in philosophy. It is sufficient from your posting to see that you have limited knowledge about how to see things from the bigger picture. How one solves a problem is pertaining to that specific situation. You, by merely bringing up a hole in the road, attempt to make a standard philosophy look selfish, is foolhardy at best. Using a specific example, in a feeble attempt to defend your lack of ability to see the big picture, is pretty disgusting.</p>
              <p>As for the Thai Canal being a wet dream, this is absolute arrogance at its best. You belong to the type who will not know when the situation hits, coz you are choosing to pretend it is impossible to happen. Enough to know your personality, that of a tortoise hiding in his own shell</p>

              <p>what's the point? You are a die hard, means you never learn, and you will never admit that you are absolutely arrogant, and belitting our neighbours.</p>
              <p>So there is no need to continue on this, (you haven't even read the article to know that the threat of the thai canal is real, and behave just like our elite PAPs by ignoring that very risk), you can behave as badly as you want, after all, what you do is none of my business. I just know I am enjoying an alternate lifestyle elsewhere, and that's what matters</p>
              <p>Selfish? Maybe. Who isn't?</p>
              <p>But I am unlike you, self-righteous and arrogant *shrugs* At least I know "ignorant" is spelt like this, unlike you *lol*</p>
