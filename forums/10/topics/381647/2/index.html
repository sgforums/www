              <p>Can you appreciate that there is "<span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>NO MORE TIME FOR THAT</em></span>" ?</p>
              <p>What do you know about TIME ?</p>
              <p>What makes you think that "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">EXTREME POLITICIAN WITH A TEAM - WILL TAKE BETWEEN 20-40 YEARS REALISTICALLY</span></em>" ?</p>
              <p>What is the basis of your thinking, or is this not another subtle message to subvert the support given to the Alternative Political Parties ?</p>
              <p>Why will you limit your criteria to only EXTREME POLITICIAN ?</p>
              <p>Any SMART &amp; SENSIBLE POLITICIAN - who is given the opportunity to form the next Government must know that it has to make many SIMULTANEOUS changes under the different ministries, and MUST ACHIEVE some semblance of progress within the FIVE YEAR term before the next Election.</p>
              <p>Can Singaporeans give the next NEW cabinet any time beyond their first term ?</p>
              <p>Is your time frame of 7 years part of your knowledge that the first 2 years - in the New Term of a New Government - will have to be used to fight and change the OLD PAP system that it has installed over the last 42 years, and which was designed to allow PAP to control the system even as they have been thrown out of Government ?</p>
              <p>Or is this your way of subtlely undermining confidence that any Singaporean may have placed with the Alternative Political Parties - by suggesting that it is useless to think about "change of government" as it cannot solve any problems within its 5 year term ?</p>
              <p>It looks like when one can shake the dog by wagging its tail.</p>

              <p>It's not as straight forward as you think.</p>
              <p>Since you're thirteen you haven't really seen the reality of the working world. There are factors at play which would affect your chances of employment other than just ability.</p>
              <p>What's more, an employer would only know if you have ability if he actually employs you for a few years and have seen your trials by fire, it's not possible to know whether someone is truly capable just by interviews alone.</p>
              <p>But why would he hire a local employee if a foreigner could do it for cheap? (Especially if he doesn't chose to take PR, the employer don't have to pay the extra CPF)</p>
              <p>Worst still if you are male, having reservist obligations and IPPT. Why would i hire/promote a guy that would potentially go for reservist during a big project or fail IPPT and have to go for RT?</p>
              <p>If it's so much potential issues, why don't i just hire a foreigner straight off because i save myself so much trouble and it's so easy to hire one?</p>
              <p>Other than that though, i agree with the donation to charity part.</p>

              <p>It must certainly reflect the immense capability of a X-rated Fraud to handle the meek Bangladeshis and Indian foreign talents, or is the X-rated Fraud pretending to be of some higher calibre to handle the Ang-Moh Foreign Talents, immodestly suggesting the inflated self-worth of a X-rated Fraud ?</p>
              <p>Either ways, what does the X-rated Fraud intend to say - other then to take an easily available opporunity to boastfully drop hints to its suggested capabilities - when it will further attempt to dispute if "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">cheap even exist</span></em>" ? </p>

              <p>Yep, given your abrupt posting, I am pretty sure you are type (c). <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>
              <p>Seriously, your types (a) and (b) are one and the same. You are just trying to bend the standard philosophy and claiming it to be your own. How one person resolves a problem entails the direct method, the indirect method, the workaround, etc. They are one and the same (your so-called (a) and (b)). Taking action need not be direct bashing of a wall. It entails an action, period.</p>
              <p>Therefore, that's why you are Type (c), the arrogant guy who is a smart alec who twists a philosophy and claims it to be his own</p>
              <p>Sometimes, some people needlessly jump into a battle, and gets burnt. You are the perfect example. Reminds me of Singapore trying to meddle in China and Taiwan affairs, and got burnt both sides.</p>

              <p>The young may easily comprehend the foriegn talent policy than most of the older generation.</p>
              <p><br>I hardly could find time to play MMORPG games. However, it is an experience i felt i must go thru in order than I may gain an understanding of its concepts and popularity. Thus I tried my hand, found online friends and later joined up in their guilds to do battle with others.</p>
              <p><br>There were americans, Chinapersons, arabs, africans, europeans, etc, etc, an international motly group of us in this guild. We help each other level up, gain additional weapons, traded and created opportunities to expand our online avatars capabilities.</p>
              <p><br>When we did battle with others, those whom were xenophobic or racists kind were easily wiped out by us, because they were homogenous, and their capabilities were limited, unlike ours that were made up of all kinds of people, with different experiences and intelligences shared willingly.</p>
              <p><br><strong>Of course, this is only a game, no one gets hurt or loses a job unless he plays it whole day. But if one extrapoliated its concept onto the real world, it will bring home the necessity for foriegn talent.</strong></p>
              <p><br>Let me put it this way simply. It is better the foreign talent come here and compete <strong>WITH US</strong> on our shores, share knowledge and experiences, than they go to another nation that will surely compete <strong>AGAINST US</strong>.</p>
              <p><br>I do agree that a balance must be made, but the qoutas that are in place should be adequate enough, with further study and input to tweak the system to ensure we citizens would benefit more, as is our right.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It's not going to happen overnight, but patience and time, not KPKB or deliberate twisting of truth to sow hatred,  will see us through, afterall, civil servants and elected officials are our fellow citizens, with families, relatives and friends similar with ours.</p>

              <p>Yep, given your abrupt posting, I am pretty sure you are type (c). <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>
              <p>Seriously, your types (a) and (b) are one and the same. You are just trying to bend the standard philosophy and claiming it to be your own. How one person resolves a problem entails the direct method, the indirect method, the workaround, etc. They are one and the same (your so-called (a) and (b)). Taking action need not be direct bashing of a wall. It entails an action, period.</p>
              <p>Therefore, that's why you are Type (c), the arrogant guy who is a smart alec who twists a philosophy and claims it to be his own</p>
              <p>Sometimes, some people needlessly jump into a battle, and gets burnt. You are the perfect example. Reminds me of Singapore trying to meddle in China and Taiwan affairs, and got burnt both sides.</p>

              <p>I dont judge who are the smart, the brave nor the arrogant, but the arrogant who is quick identify himself only shows that he is not only arrogant, he is also foolish.</p>
              <p>Is there standard philisophy? hahaha...do not think what you believe is standard, the world out there is more varied and different than your little brain.</p>
              <p>there are problems that I cannot resolve, for it is beyond my ability, for it does not impact me as much as it would impact others,...going around a problem does not solve the problem. You just avoid the negative impact of the problem. the problem remains there, and those who do not know how to avoid it will still be affected by it. so a) and b) are not the same. </p>
              <p>So you think running to america will solve the problem brought about by the FT policy in Singapore? NO, the problem is still there, many singaporeans in singapore are still affected by it, the problem is not solved just because you ran away to america. complaining and whinning behind the comfort of your room behind the computer is NOT the action needed to solve the problem, period.</p>
              <p>Singapore get burnt in China and Taiwan affairs? hmmm....we are still the only country with diplomatic relationship with PRC but military tie with ROC. The political world is more complicated than what your limited brain can imagine.</p>

              <p>it doesn't take an old dick to know that singapore latched on taiwan's offer of a military training facility because it was a marriage of convenience. taiwan was yearning for any form of recognition and singapore needs a military training base. of course there is this big brother USA which is also selling military wares to taiwan to balance off the chinese communists threat then. singapore can always hide behind US's ass if there is any blow-ups.</p>
              <p>the geo-politics in the 70s &amp; 80s were very different. china wouldn't bat an eyelid on singapore then. </p>
              <p>today, it is a different political proposition. if china (want to) force singapore's hand, the latter would withdraw unconditionally out of taiwan. but of course china won't. after all, what is singapore to china? singapore is like another wanna-be BFF to paris hilton; eager to impress at any cost.</p>
              <p>singapore in fact has scale back it's military training in taiwan in the last decade; in favor for more `non-confrontative' locations like USA, australia and soon india.</p>
              <p>and of course, nothing is for free. singapore pays considerable $$$ to these countries facilitating land areas for the training. on the account of diplomatic ties alone, singapore can't find a square foot of sand to set foot in.</p>
              <p>lastly, you need to get your timeline right before you gloat.</p>
              <p>singapore started its military training exercise in taiwan in 1975, and established diplomatic ties with china only in 1990.</p>
              <p>post-1990, especially of late, singapore will not make a big deal out of conducting its military exercise in taiwan. in fact, singapore `diversified'.</p>
              <p>you bringing it up and beaming about how singapore can maintain and balance both ties will only make the singapore defence ministry's guys cringe.</p>
              <p>it's so 1970s.... </p>
