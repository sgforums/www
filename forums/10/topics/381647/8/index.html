              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Written by Our Correspondent</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Another full-time national serviceman had died in the course of duty yesterday, three days after he was warded in the intensive care unit.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Lance Corporal Mar Teng Fong, 20, an engineering systems specialist, was on watch duty on Tuesday on the Republic of Singapore Navy’s RSS Persistence.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">He was found unconscious on Wednesday morning, trapped between a hydraulic sliding door and the door frame of the ship which was out at sea for training at the time.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">He had gone on a routine round to check the engineering systems at 11.40pm. When he did not return after 15 minutes, a fellow ser-viceman went in search of him.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">According to the state media, LCP Mar was given immediate medical attention by a doctor on the ship, and was evacuated by helicopter to Singapore General Hospital at 1.15am.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The exact cause of his death was not revealed. LCP Mar’s case is the latest of a series of non-combat death to have hit MINDEF this year.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">In July this year, a 21 year old National Serviceman, Second Lieutenant Nicholas Chan Wei Kit died yesterday after a jeep which he was inspecting rolled over and hit him, pinning him under its wheels.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">There was at least a gap of about 30 minutes between the time he took over the vehicle and the time a recovery vehicle – located within the grounds of the camp – was dispatched.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">In June, an army sergeant, aged 30, was found dead in his bunk in Taiwan.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">A month before that, a 53-year-old parachute jump instructor at the Commando Training Institute died in South Africa when his parachute failed to open during a freefall exercise.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The others, which included a recruit and three warrant officers, all died in Singapore in separate incidents.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The circumstances surrounding their deaths were never released to the public. Like the cases before him, LCP Mar’s death will remain forever a mystery.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">All Singapore males have to served mandatory National Service for two years followed by more than 10 years of reservist service each year.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The duration of two years is long compared to other countries who maintain a conscription policy such as Taiwan (12 months), Ukraine (12 months) and Germany (9 months).</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">MINDEF has never revealed the exact figures for non-combat deaths and injuries to Singaporeans. In the case of the latter, it is not known if the victims are adequately compensated by MINDEF.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The case of Corporal Jeremy Tan showed that MINDEF is not always forthcoming in offering compensation to NSFs who suffered injuries during their National Service.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">In 2005, Corporal Tan, who was rostered as duty storeman at the Seletar East Camp, was found unconscious at the foot of the building where his bunk was located on the third level.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">His head injuries were consistent with a fall from height, but findings by SAF investigators as to how he came to be hurt were inconclusive. Mindef classified his injuries as non-service related and stopped paying for his hospital treatment from March 2007.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Corporal Tan’s parents have to sue MINDEF in High Court in order to seek disability compensation and medical benefits from them.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The Minister of Defence Rear-Admiral Teo Chee Hean is also the Deputy Prime Minister of Singapore and a former Chief of the Navy.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">There is no political pressure on the ground or opposition in parliament to exert pressure on the government to be more transparent about the figures of non-combat deaths in the armed forces.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">No senior MINDEF officers are ever taken to task for the unnecessary deaths of these young men in the prime of their lives.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The “internal” investigations conducted by MINDEF are almost always classified state secrets.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Such sensitive cases are rarely reported in the mainstream media which remains tightly controlled by the ruling party.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Without a free media and an opposition to fight for their interests, Singapore parents must pray that their sons are in safe hands during their two years in National Service.</span></p>

              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">By Eugene Yeo</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">A 21 year old National Serviceman, Second Lieutenant Nicholas Chan Wei Kit died yesterday after a jeep which he was inspecting rolled over and hit him, pinning him under its wheels (read article </span><a href="http://singaporeenquirer.sg/?p=4134"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #0000ff;">here</span></span></a><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">)</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">There was at least a gap of about 30 minutes between the time he took over the vehicle and the time a recovery vehicle – located within the grounds of the camp – was dispatched.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">As expected, MINDEF declined to disclose more information about the circumstances leading to the death.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">In all likelihoods, the public will probably be kept in the dark about the results of its “internal investigations” as well.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">This is the seventh non-combat death to have hit SAF this year.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Two of the past cases happened overseas. Last month, an army sergeant, aged 30, was found dead in his bunk in Taiwan.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">A month before that, a 53-year-old parachute jump instructor at the Commando Training Institute died in South Africa when his parachute failed to open during a freefall exercise.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The others, which included a recruit and three warrant officers, all died in Singapore in separate incidents.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">On average, SAF has one non-combat death per month which appears to be astonishingly high for a small country with a conscript army during peace time.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">How does this figure compare to other countries like Taiwan and South Korea? Is it acceptable? Are these deaths entirely preventable?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Serious questions need to be asked about Lieutenant Chan’s death:</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">1. Was Chan repairing the vehicle on his own or with others?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">2. What are the Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) in this case?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">3. What is the cause for the vehicle rolling over?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">4. How long was Chan stuck under the vehicle?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">5. Why did it take 30 minutes for the recovery vehicle to reach the scene though there was one present in the vicinity?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">6. What is the exact cause of death?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">7. Is the death preventable had he been sent to hospital earlier?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">No post-mortem reports were released of the previous six non-combat casualties. Why wasn’t the public informed?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">In spite of MINDEF”s repeated reassurances that safety measures were put in place during training and operations, Singapore continues to lose its fine soldiers through non-hostile events.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The premature loss of these young lives are entirely unnecessary and perhaps preventable on hindsight.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Who is the overall in charge of SAF? Why hasn’t anybody stepped forward to accept responsibilities for these mishaps? Are they purely unforeseen accidents or human errors caused by complacency, negligence or ignorance?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">It is most unbecoming and callous of SAF to remain nonchalant in the face of so many non-combat casualities as if they are another digit in the organization.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Singaporeans need to hold MINDEF accountable. We must know the real figures of the number of casualties, injuries and suicides of our servicemen throughout the years.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">For those who have lost their lives or limbs in the course of their duties, how much compensation is MINDEF paying them and their families?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">As expected, few Singaporeans will bade an eyelid at the latest death in SAF. No MP will take the Defence Minister to task in Parliament. A “wayang kulit” will be put up in the next few days to calm the nerves of concerned parents while those at the top echelon continues to receive their fat salaries and bonuses without any sense of shame.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">I do not know Lieutenant Chan in person. All I know is that his parents must be devastated by his sudden demise. They have spent the past twenty one years of their lives bringing him up and now by a cruel twist of fate, they lost him forever.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">It is time MINDEF gives us a proper answer. We are a small nation. Every citizen is an invaluable asset. How many more young men in the prime of their youths can we afford to lose through non-combat deaths?</span></p>

              <p>What an idiot that write this to discredit his own country. We feel proud to be Singaporean not because we are borned or eat Nasir lemak or Chicken rice here. It because this is the only place we can called home when no one in the world would say, 'Singaporean welcome to my country!!!</p>
