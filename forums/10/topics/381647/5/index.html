              <p>Many claimed that if Suez canal be built, so too can the kra canal. But such reasoning are childish and flawed. Using today's tech and science, it may be possible, but the politics involve is staggering.</p>
              <p><br>Very briefly and simply for better comprehension:-</p>
              <p><br>1. The middle eastern desert Suez canal was exvacated mainly on soft sand and over an ancient canal built to boot. It took 10 years and used 30,000 convicts and slave labour to carve it out. Thousands died.</p>
              <p><br>The Kra canal is to be created over geological granite hard formations, totally different from Suez. <strong>24 nuclear explosions have to be detonated to form the foundation line. Keyword: Nuclear explosions, not 1 but 24! If IEA would even agree!</strong></p>
              <p><br>2.Even if possible, China in 2005 had agreed to foot the bill. But the chinese<br>are not doing it out of goodwill. Paybacks and management of it will fall into<br>chinese hands. Will Thailand agree to surrender their soveriegnity to China, an avowed enemy of ancient past?</p>
              <p><br>3.  Even if possible, Thailand is not a corruption free state. Think of the fights between the powerful army and the civlian elites to seize control of the lucrative port management biz. Battle Royale! not to mention efficiency to match other world class ports.</p>
              <p><br>4. The cost is est to be 21billion dollars. Will the impoverished redshirts allow such extravagence instead of using it to elevate their lives?</p>
              <p><br>5. Southern Thailand had been and still is a restive region, control seeked by buddhists, christians and muslims. Whomever gains control will control the wealth and ideology of the region. Another battle royale! not to mention the losers playing terrorist tactics akin to the nigerians over their oil pipelines.</p>
              <p><br>6.Pirates had been active for centuries, and will only shift their operations north if the trade routes are changed. There will only be more fiercer pirates, the viets and khmers to contend with, with more island hideouts.</p>
              <p><br>7. Malaysia, Indonesia and Singapore had invested huge sums on developing their economies based on the traditional trade route. They will not take it lying down if it is shifted and by hook and crook will take issue with the Thais.</p>
              <p><br>8. Will USA allow China to dominate and control a vital international port? Will Europe allow an inefficient restive south coupled with pirates to dominate their vital trade routes?</p>
              <p><br>Thses are only the barest points. There is more. The kra canal is a pipe dream.</p>
              <p><br>But with all due respects, no one can see into the future. We can only define it as logically as we can and react for the best, and adapt to changes. But today and for the next 20-30 years, Singapore will reign supreme, build up our treasury and diversify. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/plain/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>

              <p>I assume this is from wiki, since the points you offered are basically 100% from the wiki page.</p>
              <p>Let me offer you an internal perspective from the maritime industry. This project benefits countries across the globe from Europe, to Asia. Several countries were very interested in this project. The investors were not mainly from China, not as what was on wiki page. The largest container shipping companies are not from USA, but are mainly from Europe and Asia. Maersk, Evergreen, Cosco, NOL, just to name a few. All the largest shipping lines were from Europe and Asia. I don't have to continue on this to make you aware of how the combined nations were very interested in this project.</p>
              <p>It was a real threat, one which PSA was ready to take on, by bidding for a port location on the canal. Plans were underway.</p>
              <p>That was, until the Thai govt got into problems. An unstable govt equals to the risk of long-term investments going down the drain.</p>
              <p>All other remarks made by you are just pure speculation.</p>
              <p>USA intervening is pure speculation.</p>
              <p>Pirates moving up north is another pure speculation. The reason why pirate activity exists in the straits is partly because it is NARROW, and henceforth more conducive for pirate attacks</p>
              <p>AND, can you please understand the geographic location of Vietnam and Cambodia before making stupid remarks? They are NOT on the shipping route to countries on the eastern side of the globe. Perhaps Vietnam might be should the canal project be successful. But with the open sea, it is much more difficult for pirate activity in that area. </p>
              <p>So for god's sake, if you don't understand how the shipping industry works, please don't open your mouth and make a fool of yourself</p>

              <p>This canal, the kray canal has been on the board for a long time. It would have already happened if it were viable.</p>
              <p>Suez canal and panama canal save vessels from going around africa and south america respectively. Both are continents. Kray will save vessels from travelling around the malaya pennisula. Big difference in the economics.</p>
              <p>Suez canal save time for vessels from europe to the middle east, strategic for oil supplies and panama for vessels between the east and west coast of the US, and is of strategic importance for the US. does the kray canal has any strategic significance for any country?</p>
              <p>Southern Thailand is potentially a problem area for Thailand with the muslim insurgents. The tension there is higher now than ever before. the project will certainly affect port klang and pelapas so I dont' think malaysia is keen to help solve the problem in southern thailand.</p>
              <p>If singapore remains competitive as a shipping hub, shippers would still want to use Singapore for distribution to countries in the region and australia. If Singapore remains competitive and efficient as a petroleum refining center, only tankers with cargo with specific destinations would want to go via the kray, if it is economical.</p>
              <p>So exactly how much would be the investment and how long it takes to recover the costs, nobody is certain.</p>
              <p>If the canal is built, Singapore would be affected, no doubt, IF it is built. I think Pelapas remains a greater threat to PSA .</p>

              <p><br>PTP is not a threat to PSA (yet), because of its business model.</p>
              <p>While PSA chose to stay on a neutral model (with the exception of having dedicated terminals to certain shipping lines), PTP chose to allow Maersk to take a 30% equity stake in the port. This effectively increases priority shipping for Maersk at the expense of other shipping lines without an equity stake. PTP is attractive only to shipping lines that are small.</p>
              <p>For the rest, they stay with PSA with its 100+ connectivity lines to all parts of the world, plus they are able to get preferential rates and fair shipping when visiting our ports. That is also the reason why the rumour about PSA combining with NOL is unfounded.</p>
              <p>PTP will remain as part of Maersk's plan, to develop itself into a port operator-cum-shipping line business.</p>
              <p>And, I believe Evergreen is actually back in Singapore.</p>

              <p>How accurate was the X-rated Fraud's claim that the canal to be built at the Isthmus of Kra is impossible due to its geology being hard granite rock formation ?</p>

              <p>Its claims - that the Isthmus of Kra has a geological foundation of hard granite rock formation - would have been more accurate if it had referred to the Gulf of Thailand on the east side of the Isthmus, in the disputed waters with Cambodia and Vietnam.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The Gulf of Thailand contains several structurally complex trans-tensional basins. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">These are made up of asymmetrical grabens filled with non-marine to marginal marine Tertiary sediments as old as Eocene. </span><span style="color: #0000ff;">Underlying the graben sediments are a variety of Paleozoic marine carbonates, granitic intrusive rocks, and metasediments. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Many of the basins contain thick sequences of oil-prone source rocks, but the limited lateral extent of these deposits, combined with vatiations in heat flow and depth of burial of the source rocks, causes the distribution of hydrocarbons to be complex and difficult to predict.</span></p>

              <p>Those who doubt that the canal with be built on the Isthmus of Kra has not considered that the maritime traffic passing through the Straits of Malacca has reached near congestion status, and with no possibility for the Straits to be widened - even as the vehicular-expressways can be widened if adjacent land is available.</p>
              <p> As mega-sized bulk carriers are built for economies in scale to be achieved in the transportation sector, it will create more congestions and danger to the maritime traffic negotiating the narrow Straits of Malacca that presently allow two-way traffic.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In geopolitcal terms, China will not allow herself to be subjected to chokepoints to her maritime life-line in the event of any outbreak of political-military crisis - as in any war that breakout over the possible Taiwan unilateral declaration of independence.</p>
              <p>As matters stand, China has explored and implemented plans to revive the Old Silk Route overland that linked China westward to Europe and the Middle-east, opened new roads and gas pipeline across the Yunan mountain range into Myanmar western coastline, and participated in the opening of the Pan-Asian Rail and Road Program that will connect Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam to China.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Is Thailand alone interested in the canal across the Isthmus of Kra ?</p>
              <p>The construction of this canal was again considered - <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.atimes.com/editor/AI10Ba01.html">‘in the 1980s, when Japan's Mitsubishi Research Institute under the leadership of Masaki Nakajima proposed over a dozen infrastructure super-projects worldwide to spur renewed global growth, the Kra project among them.’ (*4) </a></p>
              <p>Now that Thailand and Malaysia had seen an opportunity for economic co-operation that will jump-start economic activities in their respective regions that have not seen development for the last 50 years, and with international interests from China, Japan, and South Korea to ensure a secure maritime route for their oil and commerce, as well as Sovereign Funds from the Middle-eastern Countries - the prospect of the canal being built looks more real in the next decade or two.</p>
              <p>The instability of Southern Thailand is not as threatening as that which existed in the Acheh war of autonomy against central rule from Jakarta, and is even less significant that the MILF insurrections in the southern Philippines.</p>
              <p>The Isthmus of Kra is a smaller region than the northern territory of Sumatra, and if peace has returned to the conflict regions in Sumatra and Southern Philippines, why should cynicism persist that the "<em>storm in a tea cup</em>" in Southern Thailand cannot be similarly resolved ?</p>
              <p>Such jingoistic cynicism can only lull Singapore to sleep - when others will pursue with a dream to reality even if it takes a hundred years and more.</p>
              <p>Can X-rated Fraud be trusted for its cynical short sighted views ?</p>
              <p>Will the dog defer to its tail that controls it state of mind ?</p>

              <p>A very interesting article was posted on 18 March 2009 and carried an interesting details concerning the status of the Kra Canal project.</p>

              <p><img src="http://i209.photobucket.com/albums/bb111/atobe-album/KraCanal.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> The Kra Canal Project, which would link the South China Sea directly to the Indian Ocean by cutting across the Thai isthmus, has shown recent signs of being reactivated given the economic benefits it would bring to the region as well as the continuing problems with piracy in the Straits of Malacca and the current route for trade to and from India and South–East Asia to China.</p>
              <p>The canal, which was first recognized as a potential for boosting trade in 1677, would have the same impact on South-East Asia as the Panama and Suez Canals have had elsewhere.</p>
              <p>The canal would need to traverse a length of only 44 kilometers at the narrowest point of the Thai peninsula, however with rocky land of up to 75 meters above sea level; the engineering and labor requirements would be huge.</p>
              <p>China, not surprisingly, has offered to lend considerable assistance to the development of the project, which was tentatively approved by the Thai Senate in 2007.</p>
              <p>The project is currently stalled due to “environmental concerns”, however, this is largely interpreted as meaning political wrangling over the project, which has plenty of detractors. <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Two major voices of dissent</span></strong> are the <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Singapore Government</span></span></strong>, who would stand to lose their preeminent position as a shipping hub for South-East Asia, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">and the previous Bush administration in the United States</span></span></strong>, who’s then <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld showed concern about the plan amidst growing concern of developing Chinese influence in the region</span>.</p>
              <p><strong>The cost of the project is estimated at US$20 billion</strong>, and would take <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ten years to complete</span></strong>, with some 30,000 workers being involved.</p>
              <p>The project would also compliment the Highway 44 overland route, which links the West and East coasts of Thailand, and has currently been stalled with some 50 kilometers to go at either end – a victim of the recent political turmoil in Thailand.</p>
              <p>However, with domestic politics apparently heading for smoother waters and the previous Bush regime now out of the way, the Kra Canal project is certain to come back into public view, and <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">with South-East nations keen to develop trade with China, the project looks certain to come back to the drawing board.</span></strong></p>
