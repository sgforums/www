              <p>It is not a surprise for a Taiwanese "hum" to imagine it has close friends in PSA and NOL - as the "hum" is in the habit of dropping names like the "hum" drops it filth as it travels across the sea bed with the help of PSA and NOL to arrive into Singapore.</p>
              <p>The only pirates that will continue to appear when the Kra Canal open is probably the Taiwanese "hum" - which will surely open its Bar to the flood of sailors, and robbed them as they sleep with the Taiwanese "hum' and all its other "hums" that it recruit.</p>
              <p>We can depend on the Taiwanese "hum" to believe that the Thai, Malaysian and the Indonesian Governments will be so incompetent to allow the sea pirates to threaten the success of the Kra Canal, but to let the Taiwanese "hum" to exist to steal.</p>
              <p>Obviously, the Taiwanese "hum" must have forgotten that it had probably been eliminated with the Pirates of the Carribbean with the opening of the Panama Canal - when the US Navy, the Mexican Navy and Panamian Coast Guard became active to guard this new economic corridor.</p>
              <p>What is the basis for the negative views ofl the Taiwanese "hum" that are merely based on simplistic reasons and will not accept the broader geo-political and other economic and social studies that have been concluded that have called for the canal to be built to overcome the congested Straits of Malacca ?</p>
              <p>The reasons are quite obvious, as it is singing the tune of the PAP Government to kill the project - even as it will quietly make plans to find a role for Singapore in the project.</p>
              <p>The Taiwanese "hum" is no more then another proxy tool used by the PAP to create clouds of hot gas to befuddle the issues and lull reasons of concern to sleep - and to maintain a picture perfect calm in the horizon for Singapore.</p>
              <p>This is the ignorance that the Taiwnese "hum" can hope to spread that can only benefit the grip on a population whose voice has already been silenced and put into a corner, and is now even attempting to put a cap on critical thinking.</p>

              <p>dear friend, it's not a matter of enemy of SG. It's a decision based on practical and economic benefits. To equate investors aiding the construction of the canal to being an enemy of SG, is likened to saying that just because we help China build a dam, means we are an enemy of USA. The world doesn't run like that, but is run based on practical needs and benefits.</p>
              <p>The above also sounds like the rabbit that is close to the finishing line, falling asleep, while the tortoise catches up without the rabbit being aware. Like security, a corporation that is in an industry must be ever-vigilant of its competition and surroundings, and what is happening within its industry, in order to pro-actively react to reap the best benefits (or minimise its losses).</p>
              <p>Any corporation that sleeps on this monitoring, or becomes complacent and not keep tabs of its surroundings, will very soon become a giant of yesterday, given the fast-paced nature of global trade</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Sybase was a database company with lots of potential in its heyday, but made ONE SINGLE mistake that resulted in its immense fall in popularity. It failed to look around at its database competitors, and rejected SAP when SAP came to knock on its door requesting to build compatibility of SAP applications to Sybase (other database companies had agreed to it, including Oracle). The result is a massive loss of competitiveness when the next era of business computing (ERP), led by SAP, became the hottest thing in the industry (and still is now).</p>

              <p><br>Since you said sorry, i accept your apologise, I only knew those stockbroker dealing with NOL shares, as for PSA, I got to know their former boss, Mr Stephen Lee on a party, he likes my Vietnam girls which i introduced to him, he took two of them up swissotel, very generous in giving tip, the gals love him, but he is out of PSA, some kind of employer chairmanship he is holding now. He told me the nos 1 sport if taking from month to month, it switches, sometime it is the holland port, sometime, the Chinese, and of course sometime is our port, it become very vague, but no doubt many still view us as one of the best. He is saying that all canal needs United Nation peace keeper to take care, because many vessels are at stake, it is not easy to mend and manage.

              <p>Again, I doubt you got the correct info, and I seriously doubt you met Stephen Lee. The top port in throughput is usually between Hong Kong and Singapore in Asia. The maritime award of top ports are divided by region. In Asia, It's always either Hong Kong or Singapore (in fact, Hong Kong was ahead until just a few years back when we caught up).</p>
              <p>China was never in the picture, their port operations cannot beat us at all. It's about how the port is being used. Hong Kong and Singapore are HUBS, many other ports are receivers.</p>
              <p>In size, we are ranked 3rd. Hutchison is always 1st. So again, you did not get it right.</p>
              <p>The northern hemisphere is a very recent thing, but the ice caps only melt every 6 months or less, therefore that route isn't open 100% of the time.</p>

              <p>Personally, given the mega projects that China has been doing i don't really think it's a technical issue that the Kra Canal can't be built. Even then, the Japanese would definitely be interested in giving the technical support for such a project since it imports pretty much all its raw materials and would benefit from a shorter route.</p>
              <p>It's only a matter of whether China feels that the Malacca Straits is no longer a secured trade route and wish to opt for a route which is more easily defended and can't be cut off as easily. That is what i feel to be strategically important. </p>
              <p>I can see the Kra Canal benefitting 5 countries - China/Japan/Korea/Thailand/Malaysia.</p>
              <p>Personally i believe that social unrest stems primarily from poverty and that areas that run along trade routes tend to be more prosperous than those that aren't. Thus it benefits Thailand to have the Canal attract trade and investment into the area and hopefully more non Muslim Thais into the area to stablize the region.</p>
              <p>Personally i think Malaysia would also benefit from having a trade route running so close to its Northern border. I went to Trengganu once, and got the impression that it was pretty much a backwater compared to the seemingly more prosperous West Malaysia.It could certainly gain by having goods flowing through the North East.</p>
              <p>Of course, that is assuming that the Malaysian government could actually see things that way. But it is my impression that they are more interested in political infighting rather than make decisions of strategic importance.</p>
              <p>But right now i think,  the decision hinges on the currently cash rich China feeling secured enough with its relation with Thailand to have the Canal. I'm reckoning the recent political turmoil would have turn China off on the idea or perhaps China feels secured enough with its incoming 3 aircraft carriers.</p>
              <p> And of course, that we're compliant enough not to give it cause for concern. They could do it, they just haven't got a good enough reason for doing it yet.</p>

              <p>PSA today is not just a harbor or a port, but a collective facilities and terminals for maritime trades. It handles conventional cargo, container cargo, bulk cargo, dangerous cargo, transshipment....and is connected to over 600 other ports in 123 countries spread over 6 containers. This doesn't take into considerations the shares of many ports it has acquired over the years. Is there anything else they should do in order not to be complacent?</p>
              <p>so what are you doing now in case Singapore is struck by earthquake or tsunami?</p>

              <p>Again, I doubt you got the correct info, and I seriously doubt you met Stephen Lee. The top port in throughput is usually between Hong Kong and Singapore in Asia. The maritime award of top ports are divided by region. In Asia, It's always either Hong Kong or Singapore (in fact, Hong Kong was ahead until just a few years back when we caught up).</p>
              <p>China was never in the picture, their port operations cannot beat us at all. It's about how the port is being used. Hong Kong and Singapore are HUBS, many other ports are receivers.</p>
              <p>In size, we are ranked 3rd. Hutchison is always 1st. So again, you did not get it right.</p>
              <p>The northern hemisphere is a very recent thing, but the ice caps only melt every 6 months or less, therefore that route isn't open 100% of the time.</p>

              <p>Huh!!! what??

Wah lau!!! still HK, Tong will be laughing if you said that HK is a major port today.</p>
              <p>Stephen Lee can be met anything at those tripartite seminar, I am alway invited on behalf of my Dad SME business, we got the employers, we got MOM Gan Kim Yong, and we got that NTUC Sec Gen there too, he likes to joke alot.

              <p>As for the north Hemp, it is more appropriate for the West to move on that line, and moreover it is a natural opening and internation water, and it is happening, those ice breaker hull ships are trading on that line with Russia down into Japan. Unlike KRa which you have to built it with alots of political issues with countries wanting a piece of it, if not the surrounding seas territory.</p>
              <p>China may not in the picture because of Corruption and Trust is not there, even Cosco trust PSA more than their own port, but once China get the system and Trust right, they will control the Pacific lines, and that is why NOL bought APL, an American Shipping company.</p>
              <p>In term of trading directly with singapore, yes may loose to HK or Holland, because our populations dun demand that much of the goods, by in term of transitional trading services, we are nos 1, all over the world, put their goods in containers here waiting to be transit. So in term of world best port, you not only look at the busy part of it or the loads, you need to grade on the services, the trust and the competency of our workers. Each ports will like to claim they are the best, market it in whatever they like, cos this bring about good image to them and the country itself, but does the statistics in carrying out these grading perfect or corrupted.

              <p>Please go and study what I am talking about. I am talking about the Maritime awards, which PSA has won many years in this Asia region. In terms of throughput, Hong Kong was ahead of us, till just recently.</p>
              <p>In terms of size, Hutchison is still the world's biggest port operator, followed by Dubai Ports, followed by PSA.</p>
              <p>Within the short lines above, I already mentioned 3 different ways of assessing port operations. By criteria, by throughput, by size.</p>
              <p>No matter what Shanghai is doing, it's still not a hub like Hong Kong or Singapore. As I mentioned before, Hong Kong and Singapore operate as a hub, while other ports operate as receivers. Shanghai is not in a really good position to be a hub, and if it really does become a hub, it will bite into Hong Kong's pie, and not Singapore's.</p>
              <p>With the above, I doubt what you say about ever meeting Stephen Lee, or anyone else, but that's your business, not mine. I will not continue to comment on this matter.</p>

              <p>nothing left to say? At first you questioned whether the Kra Canal is feasible, and that there is nothing to worry about, to becoming you might invest in the project.</p>
              <p>and then you question what I would do about the earthquake, and when asked back in return, have no answer.</p>
              <p>there's nothing much left to say about you. Complacency with ignorance. I think there's nothing much left to be discussed given your poor attempt at trying to wriggle out of arrogant (and ignorant) statements which you made.</p>
              <p>That's about it. Putting you on ignore mode, not worth discussing issues with.</p>

              <p>you have a bad habit of interjecting your comment with your unfounded almighty personal wealth and capability of yours to try to impress; `i am the (old) sex god here, i almost paid up my PRIVATE property so i will relax and count my money and now, invest in kra canal'.</p>
              <p>talk is cheap. yours is probably the cheapest of the lot.</p>
