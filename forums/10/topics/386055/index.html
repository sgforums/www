              <p>Prices of Singapore’s public flats to continue increasing: MM Lee</p>
              <p><span class="time">December 26, 2009</span></p>
              <p>Singapore´s founding father, Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew, said public flats will appreciate in value as long as the country´s economy continues to grow, reported Channel News Asia.</p>
              <p>He was speaking at the launch of The <a href="mailto:Pinnacle@Duxton"><span style="color: #a91b33;">Pinnacle@Duxton</span></a> yesterday.</p>
              <p>Standing at 50 storeys high, this development is the tallest Housing Development Board (HDB) public housing project in Singapore.</p>
              <p>The issue on public housing affordability is a hotly debated topic that has divided Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>Data from the HDB shows that the Resale Price Index (RPI) has continued to climb even further, posting a record 145.2 points for the third quarter.</p>
              <p>This is a growth of 3.6 percent over the previous quarter.</p>
              <p>While the record rise has benefitted HDB upgraders, young couples and singles trying to get their first leg into the property market, are finding HDB resale flats far too expensive.</p>
              <p>The property boom means HDB upgraders made at least S$200, 000 in profit when selling their flats this year.</p>
              <p>This has enabled them to upgrade to mass market condominiums.</p>
              <p>Young couples and singles, however, have to deal with rising resale prices and increasing cash-over-valuations (COVs), which have resulted in many deciding to defer their purchase.</p>
              <p>PropNex notes that the overall median COV for the third quarter is $12, 000.</p>
              <p>This is a 300 percent increase compared to the $3, 000 figure in the second quarter.</p>
              <p>The rise in the RPI and COV are due to the lack of supply and increased demand from both Singaporeans and permanent residents.</p>
              <p>This has prompted the HDB to ramp up supply of its Build to Order (BTO) flats from 8, 000 to 9, 000 units.</p>
              <p>According to government data, Singapore´s population has grown to almost 5 million.</p>
              <p>Of this, approximately a quarter of that is foreign workers.</p>
              <p>The number of foreigners getting permanent residency status also surged more than 11 percent in 2009.</p>
              <p>MP Dr Muhammad Faisal, an assistant professor of real estate at the National University of Singapore (NUS), recently said young couples who were unable to get an HDB flat should plan ahead.</p>
              <p>However, some say the onus remains with the HDB as the increase in demand is due partly to the government´s liberal immigration policy. </p>

              <p><br>sori hor, now $270k is a smaller and shorter height flats, can't even compare to those $70k  flat, i remember last time i went to my Uncle HDB flat, very big, and each flats is quite far away from each other, very airing too. Today 5 rooms flat is like 4 rooms flat, somemore short short, and if you change cloth, opposite flat also people also can see you, lucky i never live in a flat, so get flatted.</p>
              <p>Mr. Mah, the ang mo tan,  is a shorty, so his idea is to build short short flats, so that HDB can build more flats on top to earn more money. Very clever shorty.</p>
