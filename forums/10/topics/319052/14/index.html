              The employers don't discriminate against local males with ns liabilities they merely choose the foreign person because the foreigner can contribute more. of course when the disadvantage originates fromthe government policies, pple are unhappy and certain legislation is needed to fix what the screwed.
              
              similarly for mothers and males. They don't discriminate because they are females or mothers. the employer chooses the male because the mother is more likely to want to spend more time with the family or the male is more likely to be willning to commit 24/7.
              
              It's discrimination when boththe male and female have similar abilities and are able/willing to commit the same amout of time and effort. (Well I'm not count PMS or personality lets assume they are the same. ) and the employer chooses the guy or the girl and even then It's hard to pin on whether it's just random chance or really a discrimination

              <p><br>Yes it is true, but also see this: it was the fact that the government enforced certain rules about maternal leave that has to be given to women that started the problem in the first place... Perhaps the government's move was not a wise one, but there is no denying it was made in the right spirit.</p>
              <p>In this case, perhaps the mother should be guaranteed her job for a certain period of time, but she should not be paid during this period. Maybe that way women would be hired more willingly without losing their job security. Perhaps taxpayers' money should go to the minimal salary for women during their maternal leave, that would show true support for women to have children, in the sense that individual companies are not penalised for hiring women, and yet they still keep their security.</p>
              <p>Also, again, recognise this: it is the fact that the government does not even recognise this as a potential issue that is really bugging us. Within reasonable expectations of the government's control over the law and the country, they have been doing their best to resolve the problems women face finding work, and outside the scope of their ability there is little more they can do.</p>

              <p>On this point, I agree with you to some extent. I do agree with hisoka in the sense that there is an actual reason behind it, but then again I question myself: does that mean we can do <em>nothing</em> to help?</p>
              <p>Dragon, if you can think of any feasible solution for this (or to reduce the impact of this) I don't think the others would be opposed to it. However, being unfair to men on the other side is not the way to balance this.</p>
              <p>As a government, they do indeed have a responsibility to their people. They are accountable to their people. They do <em>what</em> the can, <em>when</em> they can. The difference is that what's left of the bias against women they cannot change (unless you can propose any changes), but on the bias against men there is so much room for improvement that is within the control of the government.</p>
              <p>To all readers: I think, up to this point we all have come to some level of understanding and agreement. We all agree that under the law, men are prejudiced against, while we also acknowledge that outside the scope of the law and the influence of the government, women do experience some form of social prejudice.</p>
              <p>Yet what we disagree on is this: Some believe that in order to balance what is outside the scope of the law, we should make it unfair for men within the control of the law, while personally I (and hopefully a few others) believe that for true balance, balance and neutrality should be achieved individually on <em>both </em>levels instead of seeing them as one.</p>
              <p>What opinions do you have on this?</p>

              <p>As long as women are the baby carriers , there will always be a trade off.</p>
              <p>You make more laws to protect the mothers.. the employers will find ways to go around it or they simply hire less  mothers.</p>
              <p>You make less laws to protect the mothers.. less mothers will want to have babies.</p>
              <p>So you need to find a balance to it.</p>
              <p>Anyway you look at it.. women will always suffers from this need for a balancing act as long as babies are not grown in test tubes.</p>

              <p>so if you want to remove discrimination against women from spore
                  society, you can start convincing ur fellow women to stop
                  discriminating against themselves. that is one real positive step
                  you can take.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>So you are saying when women stop discriminating their own kind.. men will stop the discrimination too ?</p>
              <p>LOL.. don't ya think this is a little too far fetch ?</p>
              <p>Personally, I believe mothers should stay at home to look after their own babies until they are at least 5-6 years old before heading out to work. But that will also mean they need to sacrifice their career.</p>
              <p>The more babies a mother wants to have.. the more she needs to sacrifice. So, if men are unwilling to give due appreciation to their wives for the sacrifices.. I see no reason why women should have more than one baby.</p>
              <p>Since she is expected to fence for herself.</p>

              <p>Pretty much a no brainer, if you are business when you hire a female you run the 'risk' of paying for maternity leave - i.e paying for no productive work.  That's the way business see's it.  Likewise if you hire a Singaporean male citizen or 1st generation PR, you have the NS liability. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Soloution to both is simple: bring in paid PATERNITY (i.e for the father) leave for men EQUAL to the paid maternity leave provisions.  That sorts that, now the NS issue.  That can be solved by introducing NS for females and introducing non-military options for both men and women.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Once this is done, business have no reason to disciminate on basis of gender.  That then leaves the issue of racial and non-business related linguistic discrimination, which can be discussed in another post.</p>

              <p>Yes I agree.. good idea you go back study. Study hard ok ? Then can migrate to a country where they recognize pre-nuptial agreement. Then you will understand truly what a pre-nuptial agreement really means and how it will affect your marriage life.</p>

              <p>Why should there be a joint contribution ?</p>
              <p>Since your mother can support herself.. your father shouldn't have to pay for anything mah. Isn't this what you guys want ?</p>
              <p>Somemore.. if your father wants to start a new family with another woman.. his new wife have to move in with your father into your house.. then if he has to pay for your mother.. then how is he going to support his new family ?</p>
              <p>Base on the guys argument.. men shouldn't have to pay for his wife if she is self sufficient , NO ?</p>

              <p>Yes I agree.. good idea you go back study. Study hard ok ? Then
              can migrate to a country where they recognize pre-nuptial

              <p><br>yes, thats the whole point, that all laws no matter with how good an intention they were set out to be, they will eventually be abuse by some malignant creature.</p>
              <p>however, don't you agree that any potential victim should at least be given some sort of legal defence (not lawyers, but legalise laws), to prevent and deter the other party from exploiting his weakness?</p>
              <p>an analogy.</p>
              <p>an unarm man defending against a mad psychopathic women hacking people about with a parang (the WC). yes, you may say that men are equipped with better physiques and greater muscular strength, but that doesn't amount to anything when you are pitting ur bare arms against a sharp blade that is threatening to hack that very arm off.</p>
              <p>shouldn't the men be also equipped with a similar weapon ( men's charter), for deterrence? with the law being fair and on each other's side, people may think twice before actually setting out to harm others. in fact, people will have an equal chance against each other, instead of the current lopsided trend we are seeing now.</p>
              <p>and what good is strength when u r arguing for ur case in a court of law? punch the prosecutor and get urself extra jail term? legal protection and legal recognition is more important. </p>

              <p>Can a employer tell the female to guarantee not to give birth ?
              Cannot right?</p>

              mah. Unless miracles happen lor.</p>
