              Jojobeach...are you not only obstinate feminist but blind..FYI I reiterate again that I am married with a son and daughter.No need to be jealous of me as my wife is not the mercenary women but someone who loves the kids and family.
              
              Jojo you are from a single broken family without fatherly love hence that accounts for your 'ugly",lack self esteem always critical of men's views and always the women must win or be made to win and that the law shd always be skewed towards women..we're living in 21s storey,women are now highly educated and even surpassed men in earnings but Jojo still living in Stone Age,Ugh? can't stand on own feet,want an unreasonable share of alimony,divorce still want to live in luxury at husband's expenses.
              
              A Man's Charter will at least counteract the obvious biaseness the outdated Women's Charter(W.C) had inflicted and yet the society at large even MPs,lawyers and policeofficers acknowledge that men are always the losing party because of WC.I ever overheard at family court by 2 PRC ladies that SG's family is clearcut to their advanatge and hence they are here to reap the maximum wnd wutrh the 50-50% sharing in matrimonial asssets these ladies can return to their home land benefiting from divorcing the local men.
              
              I guess why Jojobeach remains an arm chair critics and a lonely spinster with no men ever dared to get near with her trademark characteristics-blindly following the feminist movement and just don't want to be objective.Jojo if U want to contribute constructively my advice is to not just to stick like a leech to your own viewpoints but be open to listen and reason with forumers here.
              
              In every law there are the loopholes but the traditional W.C is certainly arcane which favours the women from child custody,division of assets,granting of Police Protection Orders,...ever wonder why Parliament does not want to ammend despite these biaseness against men...they fear rocketing the women's voters which usually forms . than majority as women outlive men.
              
              Jojobeach wake up from your "Princess of Daydream",if not u'll continue to be left hanging on the shelf( or olive tree?) and remain an old spinster with not even a male maid to attend to your needs.Once again FYI I'm happily married with a son and daughter and happen to be Adrian's neighbour who happen to witness the atrociousness W.C. wreak havoc on a man's life by an evil Ivy.God is great as the mercenary Ivy is now suffering as a single mum but Adrian is also happily married but not foreign bride ok...in fact malaysian women make good wife material with similar culture ad just across the causeway only..no need to go Vietnam or China

              Jojo pple are not against you personallly and I also do not want to offend you but just sense that the road is not flat and hence I must wield my sword of justice.
              
              Your comprehension of my write up on Adrian's ordeal who had to fend off the relentless onslaught by his diabolic wife and vicious mother-in-law taking advantage of the Women's Charter.
              
              You had missed all the point -why Ivy wanted to claim $3700 monthly maintenance and 70% of adrian's cpf and matrimonial assets when the marriage lasted&lt; 1 year.Ivy did not contribute a single cent and yet lied to judge she contributed monthly towards the payment using Adrian's money but but her ATM's card after banking his $$$ into her account giving the impression she was the one paying the mortagage.
              
              Why was there a need for Ivy to stay 50 days in a maternal ward in SGH under class A ward when Adrian was prepared to give hera C/B2 ward?
              
              Why Ivy blantanly ignored Court's Order 5 times and no punishment was meted by the Family Court? The child visit was held at a neutral ground as Ivy in cahoot with her mum can shout abuse as anticipated any time despite Adrian having a PPO against both of them and vice versa.This suspicion was comfirmed when Ivy and her mum finally turned up after the 6th Court's Order but only to shout that adrian had physiclly assaulted her mum? This landed Adrian in 6 hr lock up.Ivy's reason for not turning up was because taxi's fare one way to Serangoon Family Service was $24(all ridiculous excuse).
              
              
              Further ivy even got guts to accuse adrian of trying to rape her and post the sexual acts despite the acriminious divorce proceedings.She was supposed to be charged by the police but was given a mere warning?
              
              Jojo wait up where is the justice?Isn't it the law is protecting women at men's expense..and that's lead to . women taking advantage knowing the SG law favours them.
              
              Ivy did not even want her husband to see or bond with his child and yet demanded exorbitant ailmony? Her Thalasimma condition was hidden from Adrian before and after the marriage.Adrian knew about the case when she tried to claim all medical expenses from him besides childbirth expenses.In fact Ivy's mum had deliberately told Adrian that the criss cross on her body was due to liposunction and not the operation to remove her spleen.A person without a spleen nor a woman with Thalsimma is not a dying women lah so jojobeach stop tryiny to fame up the sympathy for Ivy.
              
              I defended Adrian when I saw how unreasonable Ivy abuse the Law calling police to raid the matrimonila home on 2 consecutive Sundays just to collect 2 AA size battery and a packet of condoms,making complaints to HDB that Adrian conducted illegal lesson at his flat,complaint to IRD that adrian earns tons of $,complaints to NEA that Adrain was breeding mosquitoes in his home,cutting off his water and electricity,etc...this prompts me to defend man's right against a scheming wife and mother-in-law(a professional divorcee)..Jojo and yet yr eyes are covered with mud siding Ivy all the way despite all his devillishness..Are't you supposed to call this poisonus Ivy to join in the debate?

              <p><br>you still haven really explained why do you need a system to be unfair in order to be fair.</p>
              <p>first, would like to ask some qsns.</p>
              <p>assuming that laws are to be made equal for both genders, (ignoring WC or wadever), how is it to the women's disadvantage?</p>
              <p>if a man would "abuse" the system, when both men and women are on an equal footing, why couldn't a woman do the same? today's women are not the ignorant traditional illiterate housewives of yesteryears. they are highly educated, and know how to consult legal aid when required.</p>
              <p>so what is the society against, when it comes to women?</p>
              <p>Discrimination in:</p>
              <p>entrepreneurship? Its a market economy out there, if u r good, u'll survive. if ur business plan suxs, the venture will eventually collapse anyway. so far, i don't see the consumers frequenting a shop just because the shop owner is a man or a woman. just because a woman isn't up to it in business, it doesn't mean that she gets to have extra advantages over others in the market.</p>
              <p>in the workplace? there are plenty of female bosses out there. companies look at look makes the most profits. they don't sacrifice profits to meer "gender preferences", since profits are the main reason for the the company's continuing existence.</p>
              <p>education? there are currently a worldwide trend with more women studying in universities, as opposed to men.</p>
              <p>pay? in singapore, males are paid slightly more, (not much anyway, only about $200 more), for doing NS. if females want to earn the same pay as males, they are free to serve their optional NS. no one is stopping them from doing that.</p>
              <p>marriage? women generally are not interested in divorcees above 40 yrs old.</p>
              <p>affairs? society now frown on extra-marital affairs by both men and women.</p>
              <p>clothing? this is not like the middle east, when women have to conform to a strict dressing code. they have to be covered from head to toe. in singapore, if a woman is to go run about the neighbourhood in a bikini, she would at most attract catcalls from ppl. if a man is to run about his neighbourhood in a pair of trunks, he would most likely be sent to woodbridge.</p>
              <p>sexual preference? gay homosexuality is illegal, while lesbian homosexuality is legal.</p>
              <p>legal punishment: males can be awarded a maximum of 24 strokes of cane in one hearing. (that means that if he has multiple hearings, he may be awarded more than 24 strokes). for females, there's no caning.</p>
              <p>so after listing out so many things, can anyone show me in what ways are females discriminated against under the legal context?</p>

              <p>is the average woman able to get the same achievements as the man with the same amount of effort put in, that when a woman screws up at work, there will no longer be the immediate thought in ppl's mind, "woman..." and all the stereotypes?</p>
              <p>are any of u, 787180, MrSean, deathmaster, VOR, so certain that a men's charter will not be abused just like the women's charter is being abused? are u so certain that with the implementing of a men's charter, that the abusive women will be tamed, and everyone will be happy, and MEN WILL NOT ABUSE THE MEN'S CHARTER?</p>

              <p>Personally I believe that the reason the women's charter can be abused is simply because men do not have equal rights protecting them.</p>
              <p>As for women being discriminated against when they screw up at work... I think this is absolute rubbish and not relevant in present times, people don't do that anymore... Right now you make a mistake, your coworkers <em>comfort </em>you, they help you, regardless of whether you are a man or woman.</p>
              <p>In the government sector? Again, I do not see any problems with the current model. If anything, women's rights are being promoted even more in this area. (That's not to say that their rights are being overpromoted, not in this area at least, but in other areas yes.)</p>
              <p>In the workforce? Please, look at how they extend maternal leave rights so often. (Again, that's not to say that this is unwelcomed, just evidence that the government does respect women a lot.)</p>
              <p>In any case, I do not believe that the fact that a woman being abused by a man is more like than the reverse justifies men not receiving some form of protection...</p>
              <p>Yes, of course altering the women's charter with strict guidelines to prevent abuse would also be a welcomed solution... What we are fighting for, firstly, is the recognition by our society and our government that such issues do indeed exist. I, for one, am open to several different solutions. I just want our needs and rights to be <em>recognised</em>, for now that is what I am focusing on.</p>

              <p>Dear MrSean,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>After reading your constant whining about the NS and the need for protection of men's rights, I came to the conclusion that Singaporean men(or actually boy) like you are the reason we're looked down down by our female counterparts.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>First off, NS is no freaking big deal. Thousands have gone through it comming out unscathed and gaining from it as much as they hate to admit be it physcially, mentally or socially. True 2 years may be long but I feel if you make the choice to make the most out of it, you actually gain more than you lose. If you can prove yourself inside, there's no doubting you can prove yourself outside.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Secondly, as jojobeach have pointed out, male and females are fundamentally different, of course you can expect a difference in treatment between the two. Our law are a reflection of what society deems right and just and if society views that females need to be more so protected than men, of course our laws will reflect that.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I implore you to grow some balls which I hope you do in due time in light of your relatively young age.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p><br>Again, the view that NS is no big deal is simply your opinion, and I clearly do not share it. Anyway, if it was no big deal, then why aren't women put through it too? The reason: guys are assumed to be natural devils of the world while women are the angels who don't deserve to be punished.</p>
              <p>I disagree with the way a lot of things are run in NS. If the NS system at least focused on being productive, I would not be so against it, but the fact is that often they focuse on areas that are highly unproductive and are simply out to waste us away mentally and emotionally.</p>
              <p>Take for example, marching drills. They claim that this instills discipline, but they are assuming that all men are naturally without this, even by the time they reach the age of roughly 18 years. (I believe this varies depending on your education options.) If it instilled discipline, are women therefore assumed to be fully disciplined while men are not? Not only that, but it is unproductive. It's not like we're learning any actual useful skills or constructing something of worth...</p>
              <p>They also have several highly unnecessary rules (these may be petty, but I still feel that they are unproductive and a waste of time.) Even the simplest of things are taken advantage of by the army to exploit and to make a rule without good reason. Take eating for example, it is a warranted assumption that when they provide you with food, you are allowed to eat it. Yet you will probably be severely punished if you do not ask for permission to eat before doing so. I am unsure as to whether this tradition still stands so please correct me if I am wrong. In short, they are forcing upon us several cultural restrictions that we may not share with them. (I believe that this specific tradition that I have provided as an example may stem from chinese traditions of telling one's elders to eat before doing so. Probably evolved to what I stated above.)</p>
              <p> In any case, this is not the only issue that I have presented, please read the first post (and if you have time, other replies) for more information.</p>
              <p>Anyway, in response to your reply that women should be treated better because men and women are fundamentally different... Again I pose this question, people of different races are biologically different as well (some are more susceptible to certain diseases and disorders, some have different ratios of hormonal output etc.) , yet we promote racial harmony and equal treatment of all races. Why is this? It is for the simple reason that different though we may be, one is not valued above any other. Different does not translate to being unequal, and quite clearly our laws do not agree.</p>

                  just evidence that the government does respect women a lot.)</p>
              <p>In any case, I do not believe that the fact that a woman being
                  abused by a man is more like than the reverse justifies men not
                  receiving some form of protection...</p>
              <p>Yes, of course altering the women's charter with strict
                  guidelines to prevent abuse would also be a welcomed solution...
                  What we are fighting for, firstly, is the recognition by our
                  society and our government that such issues do indeed exist. I, for
                  one, am open to several different solutions. I just want our needs
                  and rights to be <em>recognised</em>, for now that is what I am
                  focusing on.</p>

              <p>Since you are not of legal age. It is hard for you to understand that gender discrimination DO exist in the work place, especially when it comes to a pregnant woman. Until you have the chance to come out and take a full time job , it is best you not discuss this subject.</p>
              <p>The gahmen needs to promote women's right. If not, less women will be willing to come out to work. Less women will be interested to contribute to society.</p>
              <p>In those countries where there is no women's rights. The women stays at home, few are out on the streets. Less women will be willing to migrate into that country.</p>
              <p>Women's right is an essential component of female movement in our economy.</p>

              <p>Oh come on, those are discriminations by small companies. The government is already hard at work trying to prevent companies from doing this and I'm sure you've read about this in the papers.

              <p>Women rights, of course, need to be protected, but the same stands for male rights. Men <strong>are</strong> less interested to contribute to society because they know that the government is not impartial to them.

              <p><em>Even if men still seek to contribute to Singapore's success,</em> (and I am sure there are many), all the more the government should be fair to them since we, too, are working for our nation.</p>
