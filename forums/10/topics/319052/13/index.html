              Despite public's acknowledge of the biasness of women's Charter but this obsolete Act has not undergone any changes.I agree a divorced women has to be compensated for her sacrifices for child rearing household chores and contribution to her hubby but the Law must certainly when being abused continued to remain status quo-something is absolutely wrongly.The Govt.dare not take enboldened steps to plug the loopholes and still allow abuses by estranged women to use it to wreak havoc on their husbands.
              
              Even on TV channel 8 currently showing at 9pm when the female character was confronted with divorce as initiated by her husband,one other character offered this advice'get as much ailmony as possible-$20,000 per month" to strain her husband and/or get custody of both children and normally women will 70% win custody of the kids-a pre conconceived bias that man is not in best position to shower love and care
              on his children.The female is not a saint either although her husband has strayed as her daughter was absolutely rude even though still in sec school she sold her mum and her grandmum undies in the internet to buy branded goods.Her son is always malingeering to avoid attending chinese tuition,etc.and this women has all the world and with the grandmum at her disposal to "provide good care" but the children turned out otherwise...fortunately the children have become more matured after the actual divorce as they now know how to protect their mum,a happy ending I hope and for the husband who has strayed and I guess he will be cheated by the mistress of his wealth soon.
              
              jojo I don't view all women as bad in a divorce as both parties are at fault as it takes 2 hands to clap but wad I can't condone is those mercenary women who went for their hubbies' neck when marriage turned sour and take advantage of WC just to get even with the men.It is now being made public conscious and public knowledge that there are indeed abuses althouch the Act original intention in the 1960s was to protect the housewives and aunties
              
              I believe the SG family Court is quite fair nowadays having the common knowledge that the abuse is on the rise but their hands are still tied esp when division of assets ,granting of police protection order and child custody

              <p>Dragon, he does not claim that a toyboy is a soulmate, he is merely expressing his disbelief through sarcasm... O.O</p>
              <p>Single old man, single old woman... They both lose out equally? I don't see the difference...</p>
              <p>Again, regarding employment, what we mean is that the law does not in any way restrict women from working. Even if this stereotypical view existed, it should be challenged in that scope, perhaps a campaign to educate companies and make it unlawful to dismiss a worker based on sexual discrimination. It does not justify hitting men back in other ways to make up for it. Personally, I feel that there are two scopes in discussion that you are confusing: the mainstream beliefs of society, and the laws of Singapore. Just because women MAY be (I'm not even confirming that they are) discriminated against when getting a job, that does not justify the laws being prejudiced against men to balance it out. The correct way to balance it out is to balance BOTH scales and not mix them together. Obviously to some degree there will be a grey area, but surely this can be minimised, far more than it is now.</p>
              <p>As for staying home to work... All couples have the decision to both have jobs. Seriously, in this day and age, how many men would force their wives to give up their careers? Even suggest that they are obliged to means divorce papers are probably coming your way already. In fact, if a couple cannot agree on a permanent arrangement regarding careers, they aren't prepared for marriage and shouldn't have got married in the first place. Any marriage counsellor would tell you that the first rule is not to rush in if you're not sure, because this is one of the biggest mistakes.</p>
              <p>Yes, providing for your family is both a moral and lawful obligation, but you are forgetting (or suggesting that we should all forget) that there are some cases where it goes too far. We are not suggesting that men should not have to provide for their families at all, just that the lines of distinction within the law be adjusted to be in equal favour of both sexes, while leaving that grey area for discretion. Yes, decisions can be appealed, by why bother waiting for the appeal? As deathmaster and richard geist (in the link provided on caning) say: If they don't go outside reason, they will not be hurt by the laws. So why leave the gap there in the first place? The laws we are suggesting are laws that will not be violated when something reasonable is asked for. We're not saying women should not be provided for at all in a divorce, rather there should be clearer distinctions to protect men from this situation.</p>
              <p>Yes, people in our society may view men and women differently. I therefore set this challenge to you: go into any school in Singapore, even RI or ACSI or Hwa Chong, and tell me that there isn't a single person in there who isn't racially prejudiced. We've all heard the chinese students calling students with darker skin names and all that. (I shall not go into specifics in order to prevent anyone's feelings from being hurt excessively.) So our society perceives people of different races differently, does that mean we support racial prejudice? No, we have strict laws against sedition and racism, and I challenge anyone here to say that they shouldn't be there.</p>
              <p>As for a marriage going bad... I think deathmaster has already proven how men can get hurt financially and emotionally, and physical abuse is not out of the question either. (Some men may be unwilling to retaliate and may allow their spouses to physically abuse them.)</p>

              <p><br>Yes, we are saying that the charter should be reviewed, and possibly, if required to balance the system while protecting the rights of women, a men's charter be established as well.</p>

I do not think that laziness is the only reason for them not stepping out.. as u said, hangovers from the 70s, 80s affect them, and guess what, it affects men too.. there are also unspoken biaseness against women in the workforce holding high positions, which will rear its ugly head every now and then.. u cannot solely put the blame on women that the unwillingness is due to their own fault.. if the situation is favourable, u will have seen much more females out there in leading positions..</p>

              <p>If your dad owns the property you are living in now.. are you expecting your mother to pack her bags and go rent a place outside on her own, and only have visitation rights to you and your siblings ?</p>
              <p>So when you were a baby till you are old enough to take care of yourself.. who took care of you ?</p>
              <p>How is your relationship with your father ? Is he very much involved with your life as much as your mother ?</p>
              </div>

              <p>No, she probably wouldn't need to claim much, except perhaps of course for separate living arrangements maybe there should be a joint contribution.</p>
              <p>Neither of my parents were involved in my life much. They played equal roles, but yes I admit I'm closer to my grandparents because they took care of me from young, mostly.</p>

              <p>I never say that it is fair did I ?</p>
              <p>And like I said.. so what if that discrimination originates from a cow or a giraffe ? Women is being discriminated, because of the limitations during and post pregnancy.</p>
              <p>Just because we are women does not means the inconvenience for hiring a pregnant woman or mother of young children doesn't apply.</p>
              <p>We can only try to be Understanding to these women.. but cannot say we are not affected by the circumstances.</p>
              <p>You as a men has a choice NOT to discriminate against such women. but you choose  to.. so why blame it on women who do ?</p>
              <p>What are you trying to prove ? That it is really women's fault for such discrimination ?????</p>
              <p>If you don't wanna discriminate, then don't. Why the finger pointing ?</p>
              <p><strong>Just because someone else is doing it.. doesn't means you are now not guilty of doing it too.</strong></p>
              <p>And like I said.. a woman has to sacrifice much more than men to stay in her career. So what are you still not satisfied with ?</p>
              <p>That women are more guilty of discriminating and men less guilty ?</p>
              <p>The answer is .. we are either guilty or not guilty of such act. Yes or No, not more or less.</p>
              <p>And both men AND women are guilty of such act of discrimination.</p>

              men face discrimination at work too right? As to which is more discriminated, I doubt any one has the answer.
              
              As for pregnant women, it's not discrimination merely practicality and business sense. I'll give you an example,lets take 2 males everything the same but you know one of them (male a) has to be gone about 5 months later for 2 months and you will have to pay him for the 2 months which is not included in his leave. Tell me which one would you choose to employ? Forget about loyalty issues, both are as likely or unlikely to leave.
              
              Now replace male a with a pregnant female and you get your answer.

              <p>Practicality or business sense.. it is still a form of discrimination.</p>
              <p>When you choose one over another.. without regards to individual merits you are already discriminating.</p>
              <p>In the case of men vs men.. Local men with reservist do face discrimination vs foreigners who has no obligation to serve reservists. So, in this regards.. ofcors employers will discriminate against the local men. That is why I do not agree with the open door policy our gahmen implemented.</p>
              <p>But when you are comparing a local man vs a mother for potential employee , employers will ofcors prefer to hire the man. So in that sense.. employers are already discriminating against a mother, (even if the individual ability may be the same).</p>
