              <p><br>im sure the caning process goes beyond just skin repairing.. it goes to the flesh too..</p>
              <p>and how do u test the pain endurance of a female? I don't even know how to start saying this, but isn't it already known that women tend to KO more easily when dealt with pain? or is this another misconception of mine and the whole world's dat is disproved suddenly after thousands of years?</p>
              <p>that a punch to a man and a punch to a woman will yield quite a different result? no?</p>
              <p>and as i stated initially, men and women are unequal, by physique, and by society's views, thus the treatment will automatically be unequal.. of coz, then ur points are to argue abt the minority.. to which i said, every law cannot satisfy every individual, and the implementing of new laws, if not done carefully, will only serve to upset more people than the number of people it can pacify..</p>
              <p>and if u read my posts earlier, u would have realised that i already said that the laws are unfair, to protect the victims.. just that the bad apples are abusing it.. and if u made it equal, abuses from the other side will come in.. so we have to limit the sufferings of the victims to as low as possible, because sadly, we cant remove it completely.. and i did say that if a new law that comes in can reduce the number of ppl who abuse the law to their advantage, all the better no?</p>

              <p>but u are talking about criminals you know? you shouldn't spare them, as they are in for jail and caning because they commited violent crime.</p>
              <p>if they don't spare the public, why should the public spare them?</p>
              <p>just because they may be weaker, women are not necessary more harmless. in fact, a woman can kill you as easily as a man. all it takes is a decent weapon.</p>
              <p>imagine, a woman goes around and stab people with a knife, severly injuring people, but din somehow manage to kill them. in this case, she would most likely be jailed for manslaughter, while a man commiting a similar offense will easily get caning on top of life imprisonment.</p>
              <p>my point is that female criminals are no less hardy than a male. spare them, and they will commit the same crime again.</p>

              <p>Purpledragon: Well you are right that women do experience more pain depending on their estrogen levels.</p>
              <p>Yes pain can be detected with PET scans to monitor brain activity in the part of the brain that controls endorphin release.</p>
              <p>A study found that women experience differing amounts of pain depending on their estrogen levels, which fluctuate throughout their menustral cycle.</p>
              <p>When their estrogen levels were highest, pain levels were roughly the same as what men reported.</p>
              <p>When their estrogen levels were lowest, the pain reported was worse.</p>
              <p>So actually, it is rather difficult with women in that their pain levels will vary over time. What could be a viable solution for this? Allow women to pick which time of the month they want their caning to commence? This is a more tricky one I guess.</p>
              <p>With regards to your point about the laws being equal... Perhaps we have misintepreted you in the sense that you didn't mean the laws shouldn't be equal per se, just that the actual amount of pain experienced should be equal. Is that your point?</p>
              <p>Also, I still don't really see what you mean that the laws are made unfair to protect the victims. Technically, if the laws were fair, both sides would receive equal and adequate protection.</p>
              <p>Deathmaster: I think you misunderstand him, he doesn't mean that women should be spared the cane, but that because of the natural differences in the human body of men and women, women may experience pain differently, to a greater depth, specifically when their estrogen levels are low.</p>
              <p>This is a rather tricky situation because pain from the cane lasts for a long period of time, several months at least to my knowledge. This means that through their menustral cycle, they will experience pain at different levels at different times.</p>
              <p>To be fair, though, I think we misunderstood him because he did not explain what he meant very clearly.</p>
              <p>You can read about the study I quoted here: <a href="http://www.med.umich.edu/opm/newspage/2003/painbrain.htm">http://www.med.umich.edu/opm/newspage/2003/painbrain.htm</a></p>

              <p>lol.. maybe my english sux.. but ok.. again i put forth an example..</p>
              <p>everyone working is subjected to income tax..</p>
              <p>will u mete out a flat tax of 50k annually to everyone that works? or a tax of 10% of a person's annual wage?</p>
              <p>that's my stand for caning. The end.</p>
              <p>now comes what i mean for the law as a whole or rather..</p>
              <p>why was the women's charter set in the 1st place?</p>
              <p>to protect women from men who were abusive towards them, correct?</p>
              <p>did the people who set it up think that women will abuse it? maybe not..</p>
              <p>now if a men's charter were to be set up, what makes u think that the same few abusive men will not use it to their advantage?</p>
              <p>again, lesser of the two evils..</p>
              <p>no women's charter, men abuse women</p>
              <p>got women's charter, women abuse WC..</p>
              <p>got men's charter, men abuse MC..</p>
              <p>when women in marriage abuse men, it's financially, verbally, almost never physically..</p>
              <p>when men in marriage abuse women, it's financially, verbally, and physically..</p>
              <p>As i said, a society, based on the majority, will not accept men abusing women, they will rather take the chances of women abusing men because that's the lesser of the two evils..</p>
              <p>and a law of a society will definitely have to suit the beliefs of the society, based on the majority..</p>
              <p>and like i said before, minority will raise issues(eg. MrSean and deathmaster), but sadly, minority are always sacrificed, and like i said before, unless the men's charter can further reduce the number of minority, implementing it will only lead to more ppl raising issues..</p>

              <p><br>You're right, they're more than capable of withstanding a caning, but due to their hormonal fluctuations, when estrogen levels are low they feel pain more than men do... Yet when estrogen levels are high, they feel pain roughly equal to what men experience. Should this be taken into account if new laws allowing women to be caned were established? This question has been posed to anyone willing to provide their views.</p>
              <p>Personally, I think it does not really matter and unless anyone can provide an innovative solution to overcome this problem, it should not need to be considered. The reason is this: at any one time, the pain experienced from caning will still be proportionate to pain experienced from other incidents (say, an inmate knocked her arm on something hard), and therefore will still bear the same significance relative to other situations. Although the pain experienced may be more relative to what a man feels, relative to everything else a woman feels the pain from caning will still be proportionate. I hope my explanation was not too complex...</p>
              <p>Purpledragon: If equal rights were given under the law to both sexes, it would lower the chances of the system being abused. The reason the system can be abused is because men do not have an equal amount of protection under the law. There is simply no reason to discuss lesser evils or greater goods, because there is an absolute good in this case.</p>

              <p><br>You're right, they're more than capable of withstanding a caning, but due to their hormonal fluctuations, when estrogen levels are low they feel pain more than men do... Yet when estrogen levels are high, they feel pain roughly equal to what men experience. Should this be taken into account if new laws allowing women to be caned were established? This question has been posed to anyone willing to provide their views.</p>
              <p>Personally, I think it does not really matter and unless anyone can provide an innovative solution to overcome this problem, it should not need to be considered. The reason is this: at any one time, the pain experienced from caning will still be proportionate to pain experienced from other incidents (say, an inmate knocked her arm on something hard), and therefore will still bear the same significance relative to other situations. Although the pain experienced may be more relative to what a man feels, relative to everything else a woman feels the pain from caning will still be proportionate. I hope my explanation was not too complex...</p>
              <p>Purpledragon: If equal rights were given under the law to both sexes, it would lower the chances of the system being abused. The reason the system can be abused is because men do not have an equal amount of protection under the law. There is simply no reason to discuss lesser evils or greater goods, because there is an absolute good in this case.</p>
              <p>In any case... How can we be considered the minority, it's half the damn country involved!</p>

              <p>and not all men think that women's charter is wrong.. all unfair, because they know that eventually, the men have a physical advantage over women, and eventually, when fights start, women lose.. and the purpose of the women's charter is to protect the women when the fight starts, and not to help women reap the men off..</p>

              <p>Well in this case... Actual abuse happens to be the same thing as system abuse, doesn't it...? I dunno I'm kinda confused again.</p>
              <p>Purpledragon, again, women do not always lose... I mean, like for instance richard's post in the link regarding caning, he was sexually abused as a child and yet the offender was not punished as heavily as she should have been.... (Was she punished at all? I can't remember.) Even in the case of divorce, we've all heard the story of the woman bullying the man and crushing him emotionally, even possibly physically where he may be unwilling to retaliate... Yes the women's charter is to protect women in the event that a relationship rots to the point of a divorce, so why can't a men's charter do the same? Can you name a specific example of how a man could abuse the system if a men's charter was started? That way maybe I would understand what you're trying to put across more clearly.</p>

              <p>2 person earn $50k each, in the same position in the same company. but 1 is taxed 20% while the other is not taxed at all.</p>
              <p>if you still can't see the link, here's a more direct example:</p>
              <p>a man molest a teenage girl, he gets jailed and 12 strokes of caning.</p>
              <p>an indonesian maid rape her employer's 2 yr old son, she gets jailed for a few months followed by deportation. (was reported in the papers before. employers caught her in the act on film)</p>
              <p>is this equal treatment to criminals? just because the person who commited the offense is a women doesn't make her a lesser criminal.</p>

              <p>i think ur analogy is off tangent. in fact, it more like:</p>
              <p>2 person earn $50k each, in the same position in the same
                  company. but 1 is taxed 20% while the other is not taxed at
                  all.</p>
              <p>if you still can't see the link, here's a more direct
                  example:</p>
              <p>a man molest a teenage girl, he gets jailed and 12 strokes of
                  caning.</p>
              <p>an indonesian maid rape her employer's 2 yr old son, she gets
                  jailed for a few months followed by deportation. (was reported in
                  the papers before. employers caught her in the act on film)</p>
              <p>is this equal treatment to criminals? just because the person
                  who commited the offense is a women doesn't make her a lesser
                  criminal.</p>

              <p>Priviledge from an earlier era ?? How laughable.</p>
              <p>Dude, in the early era.. women stays at home and men goes to work to bring home the bacon.</p>
              <p>Now, men expect women to bring home the bacon AND give birth to his offsprings AND take care of the family while the men "help out".</p>
              <p>Not only is she expected to do all the above.. she also needs to know how to groom herself so he can be proud of her. That's why so many women goes under scalpel just to make herself look good for her husband.</p>
              <p>In the older days.. mothers are frumpy and they don't need to even bother dressing up. But their hubby accepts them as they are because that's how it is after child birth.</p>
              <p>Now, when the wife loses her pre-pregnancy body.. he thinks she is too fat and ugly for him and goes out and find himself a nice young chick.</p>
              <p>Women nowadays needs to be a SuperWoman. Priviledge my ass.</p>

              <p>Jojobeach: I am not suggesting that this inequality exists only between a married couple. In fact, between a married couple, they obviously would have each other in the highest respect, or why would they have got married?</p>
              <p>I am suggesting that this inequality extends far beyond that, between people who otherwise have no relationship between themselves at all. It extends to the furthest depths of society. It's a question of principles and of impartiality as to the rights granted to men and to women. This does not solely exist between couples who personally know each other. We feel we are undervalued by our own government, and for all the work we do for our country, little thanks do we get in return. We feel that where there are rules and laws, one eye is on the men, and the other eye is closed. Where there are regulations, even ones without good reason, half our population is subject to them while the other half sneak their way past, unnoticed.</p>
              <p>The requirements you named, those are requirements set upon women by social standards. Our men are not without these too, and we do not complain for them. What we are against is that under the law we are forcibly subject to stricter regulations than women are, where they are undeserving of special treatment. These are laws set by the leaders of our country, and all are fully obliged to follow lest we face punishment. When you do not abide by those social standards, you do not go to jail, you're just held in lower regard by the people. Those are unwritten rules set forth by our people; the key to changing that is a campaign to change the mindset of people.</p>
              <p>We're not even asking for that. All we're asking for is a little official impartiality. Something to show that at least, on the surface, our government does not blatantly discriminate against us unfairly, whether society may or may not. How does this reflect on the Singaporean government, for one? There are boards to which international netizens read, and when they read of these double standards, their impression of Singapore is that we are a second-standard country and society, geared to traditionalist beliefs that may no longer stand but still steadfast in our belief that this is the way things must be.</p>
              <p>Surely by now, even though you may not agree with all our views, your eyes have been opened to the fact that we do not share equal privileges with the women.</p>

              <p>How conveniently put.</p>
              <p>While you men complain that the government blatantly discriminate against men.</p>
              <p>Have you , as a human think about how men had blatantly discrimate against women ?</p>
              <p>And yet.. you seek to separate the two ?</p>

              <p>Punishments is relative to the damages sustained by the victim.</p>
              <p>The more severe the damages, the bigger the punishment.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When a man rape a woman. The men deems her as being stained, filthy and used.</p>
              <p>When a woman raped a man, the men themselves see the victim as a weakling and the woman a tyrant. Does a woman deem the male victim a stained and damaged goods ? NO.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The female victim also run a risk of getting pregnant, now will a male victim sustain the same risk ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The damages sustained by a female victim vs a male victim is already UNEQUAL.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When man has an affair, he is just having a fling.</p>
              <p>When a woman has an affair, she's a slut.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>While a man usually has no problem remarrying again even though he may already has children.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A woman on the other hand.. is very unlikely to find a man who is willing to accept her.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Such perversity in thinking of men is the sole reason why men has to be treated different from women.</p>
              <p>Until men stop thinking themselves as the more superior gender, and until men's self serving attitudes are totally eliminated , there shall not be any such thing as "more" protection by law. Since in our male dominated society, the men already had an upper hand in many aspects of life.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So why don't you just be contented with the many priviledges you as a man already enjoy?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>By fighting minority rights, arn't you just a tad too greedy already ?</p>

              <p>I disagree with your point that men make themselves out to be more superior than women. Perhaps this was true in the past; yet this issue has already been resolved and it would be very unfair to bring this up against a generation that had no control over the actions of previous generations. You know as well as I do, that of all places, women in Singapore are definitely not put below men in our country.</p>
              <p>Going by your logic: Men did unfair things to women in the past, therefore now it is time for revenge (even though it involves totally different generations) and women should be allowed to do unfair things to men?</p>
              <p>Also, your arguement that "Punishments is relative to the damages sustained by the victim" does not stand. Take this hypothetical case for example: A man and woman commit identical sexual crimes against two different boys, and these two boys are assumed to have experienced (for the purposes of our discussion) equal amounts of distress from being a rape victim.</p>
              <p>Going by that line, that punishment should be relative to the damages sustained by the victim, both the man and woman would receive <em>equal sentences.</em> Yet if this case was heard in Singapore, would they receive equal sentences? The man will almost certainly be liable for caning and time in jail while the woman gets off serving the same amount of time in jail, <em>without the caning. </em>Therefore, even though they commit identical crimes, the woman is assumed to have a purer innocence than the man and is exempt from part of the punishment. She assumes a natural partial immunity to the law, based on just what she was born. It is not what we are born that determine if we have succeeded in life, rather <em>what we turn out to be. </em>Yet the laws we have in Singapore clearly do not agree.</p>
              <p>Also, I find your comment that men lose less when they are rape victims than women do, and it is because of this that people who violate the sexual rights of men deserve a lighter sentence than those who violate the rights of a woman, exceptionally demeaning, patronising and deragotary. In truth, who is the elitist here?</p>
              <p>You say that we've already got something and that because we have something we should be content. If I were to use an analogy that follows the same logic: "Women are already allowed to participate in voting, therefore they already have enough and they should not be pushing to be allowed to run for congress as well", I am sure you would not agree with me. These may be minority issues to you, but certainly to about half of Singapore they are not.</p>
