I am not sure where you are from or what sex you are, but let me ask you this question to you. Let’s say you are being robbed by the same pen knife welding teenager, what will you do? Will you fight back or just hand him the money? Judging from how you mock SG men, how many percent of the population from where u reside will put up a fight? 1% 10% 100%? <span> </span>Let me put it this way, those SG men go Malaysia is for holiday, not to become crime buster. It is not as if MY govt is going to reward them handsomely for apprehending the criminal. Besides, by not putting up a fight, this show that SG men are ppl that use their brains rather than just resorting to brute force just bcos of a spur of adrenalin rush. No point dying in the hands of a geena just bcos of a few ringgit. </span></span></p>

Well I would define dat as gossiping or bitching at best. This is a forum, naturally ppls would like to share and discuss issues that are close to the hearts of all heartlanders. If you visit forums from other countries, they are more or less like that too, unless you are claiming the men in ur state are completely uninterested in any of your country’s affairs. If so, then you ought to be worried.</span></span></p>

              <p>I have no intention to divulge my personal info. However, a
              casual look at singapore wusses vs foreign men will prove the
              correctness of my viewpoint</p>
              <p>Let's start from the more extreme cases. How many singaporeans
              were robbed in JB? Especially the case where a group of guardsmen
              got robbed by a single teen with a knife. Without any
              resistance.</p>
              <p>Or, how about the attitudes of singaporean males when faced with
              a problem? Invariably, they always ask for help from the
              authorities rather than attempt to solve it themselves. Just
              witness the number of whiny threads on NS. Also look at the ST
              forum, most male letterwriters pen letters of whining and griping,
              and the letters that actually suggest solutions to problems are
              always written by singapore females or foreigners.</p>
              <p>I could go on, but I'm sure you already get the point, if I
              hadn't overestimated your intelligence. In any case, I welcome any
              challenge to my positions without resorting to Internet Tough Guy
              posturing. You know what you're like, there's no point acting all
              macho when you're a pussy.</p>

              <p>Not sure if this was mentioned by anyone in the above post, but this happened to my best friend and me and my friends had to endure this along with him... THis is his history and how the woman's charter screwed him...</p>
              <p>Friend X was married for 8 over years to Lady Y and was earning more than Y. X was always very supportive of Y and doted on her, buying her expensive gifts like handbags, jewellery and holidays. One day Y said she wanted to improve herself through an overseas MBA. X being the usual supportive husband financed her 2 yrs overseas education. After graduating, Y came home and asked for a divorce as she had found someone else at biz school and was already in an affair.</p>
              <p>Despite begging her to change her mind, Y was adamant on the divorce. Y filed for divorce citing unreasonable behaviour of her husband. She also sued for maintenance as the husband had supported her lifestyle all this time.  The singapore law does not recognise who has the affair but just views the husband as the provider... so now Y is happily going on with her affair, all financed by our friend X... that is singapore law for men...</p>
              <p>becareful of getting married under singapore law! much less have babies!!!</p>

              <p>Hello people,</p>
              <p>I've seen the arguments from each side of the house today, and I thought I'd just say something. First and foremost, perhaps keeping this controversial debate friendly would be nice, I really would like to remind you all theres no need to have your tempers flaring at each other for voicing varying opinions (:</p>
              <p>Secondly, I believe this world, will never be able to be fair. Yes indeed women may be more "forunate" in certain aspects, such as being able to not attend 2 years of national service during their precious youth. However men, I wish to point out, (as a fellow singaporean youth who will very soon be participating in national service) that we should take a positive view of national service. For one it helps build up your character and toughens one out.Turn the 2 years spent into a time where you learn and gain much from it.</p>
              <p>However if you do persist in taking the chauvinist view that women should NOT be excluded from national service, I do think that that is a fair issue. I have heard arguments posted on pages 1 and 2 of reasons why women should not participate in national service. However "national service" the definition is not just joining in the army as many of you might think, it involves say social services, the police force, the SADF etc. Women too can participate in this aspects and serve their country.</p>
              <p>If i were to engage and deal with every point and aspect which is seemingly unfair, I would take ages to do so, in the process boring you and leaving you with more doubts, thus i wish to simply highlight the fact that our society is one far from perfect. We cannot expect to live in one so, for the universe (at least our galaxy) was never designed to be so. On the whole it would be unfair to say that women have it "better" in singapore. For one men have a huge advantage in the workplace, employers often seek men rather than women (GENERALLY), because of stereotypical reasons</p>
              <p>I ask everyone of us reading this to not fret about gender inequalities for Singapore, a very "unique" country has its own unique problems, thus let us not compare our situations with countries worldwide for I believe that we have already achieved a high level of gender equality. I would ask you to consider this: Laws and policies have been made not by whim and fancy of politicians, they are paid millions of dollars, with the new  perfect policy the government has recently implemented, to look into such issues.</p>
              <p>They would have probably thought about the solution/problem/issue that you came up with. (;</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Peace</p>

              <p>both side means something, maybe because you guys from different place different oringin, so think differently, singapore male, being educated like this, they should obey rules, not challenge the authority, the singapore government is like a parent government , they take care very thing, sometime, they do in their ways, overlook,what singaporean need, so when a guy rob a singaporean ,they will act this way, not causing any problem,</p>
              <p>seems that one accuse the other lack of physical advantage, the other accuse of no intelligence, anyway this thread will end up like thrash, and mutual accusation</p>
