              <p>If the judge ruled unfairly, either party can still appeal against the judgement.</p>
              <p>The so called " gap" in the system is to allow for flexibility.</p>
              <p>A divorce is not a criminal case, where you can prescribe fixed or very clear cut punishment once you are proven guilty.</p>
              <p>In a divorce, it is not about who is guilty and who is not.</p>
              <p>The judge has to look into many factors before he decides who gets what.</p>
              <p>Ofcors, a couple can always agree on the asset division so there will be no need to contest , that will make life so much easier. But during a divorce.. who's gonna be so nice to each other ? If they can be so nice to each other.. there wouldn't be a divorce now, yes ?</p>
              <p>By making it rigid, there will be a lot more who's gonna break their necks.</p>

              <p><br>Again, the view that NS is no big deal is simply your opinion, and I clearly do not share it. Anyway, if it was no big deal, then why aren't women put through it too? The reason: guys are assumed to be natural devils of the world while women are the angels who don't deserve to be punished.</p>
              <p>I disagree with the way a lot of things are run in NS. If the NS system at least focused on being productive, I would not be so against it, but the fact is that often they focuse on areas that are highly unproductive and are simply out to waste us away mentally and emotionally.</p>
              <p>Take for example, marching drills. They claim that this instills discipline, but they are assuming that all men are naturally without this, even by the time they reach the age of roughly 18 years. (I believe this varies depending on your education options.) If it instilled discipline, are women therefore assumed to be fully disciplined while men are not? Not only that, but it is unproductive. It's not like we're learning any actual useful skills or constructing something of worth...</p>
              <p>They also have several highly unnecessary rules (these may be petty, but I still feel that they are unproductive and a waste of time.) Even the simplest of things are taken advantage of by the army to exploit and to make a rule without good reason. Take eating for example, it is a warranted assumption that when they provide you with food, you are allowed to eat it. Yet you will probably be severely punished if you do not ask for permission to eat before doing so. I am unsure as to whether this tradition still stands so please correct me if I am wrong. In short, they are forcing upon us several cultural restrictions that we may not share with them. (I believe that this specific tradition that I have provided as an example may stem from chinese traditions of telling one's elders to eat before doing so. Probably evolved to what I stated above.)</p>
              <p> In any case, this is not the only issue that I have presented, please read the first post (and if you have time, other replies) for more information.</p>
              <p>Anyway, in response to your reply that women should be treated better because men and women are fundamentally different... Again I pose this question, people of different races are biologically different as well (some are more susceptible to certain diseases and disorders, some have different ratios of hormonal output etc.) , yet we promote racial harmony and equal treatment of all races. Why is this? It is for the simple reason that different though we may be, one is not valued above any other. Different does not translate to being unequal, and quite clearly our laws do not agree.</p>

              <p>MrSean, for someone who has YET to gone through NS, I can understand where you're comming from. However, apparently you have a pretty warped understanding of the things that are done in the army.</p>
              <p>With regards to marching drills, yes one of the reason is to instil discipline but many people do not see HOW it is so. In the army, everyone has to work together to achieve a specific goal and to do so, individual excellence is essential, however, teamwork is crucial. Marching drills instil that sense of teamwork when done in a unit. Every step, every swing of the shoulders and every movement of the rifle is synchronised. If done properly. not only is it a sight to behold, it aims to be a reflection of the mentality and attitude a soldier must have serving his unit, formation and country.</p>
              <p>It sounds very ridiculous to me that a men has to do marching drills to instil discipline therefore in the first place he lacks discipline? Its as good as saying some people have tution teachers, hence the people who don't are less capable academically? It doesn't work that way.</p>
              <p>Whoever that told you all about the food issue? Personally haven't experienced that. But Im sure many will agree that end of the day, the system is actually not flawed in the army. Its the people in command that are flawed. Some of these sorry SOBs just make it a personal agenda to make people's life miserable. But that being said, there are always others on the other end of the spectrum but most of the time the highlight and stories are often cast on the assholes. </p>
              <p>The difference biologically between races against the difference between genders are two totally different matters. Your analogy doesn't apply. Furthermore, mentally and physically, men are more suited to fight. I say do your part and serve your country. When it comes to national defence, due to these biological defence between males and females, it is deemed neccessary for a male to contribute as it is proven that they are more capable of doing so. However if females are willing, they can do so too. This is reflected by the number of female regulars.</p>

              <p><strong>in the workforce, who do u think a boss hires? a mother, a pregnant lady? or a man?</strong></p>
              <p>there are plenty of the above types of people working, as far as i can see. so far, i think age is the main factor affecting employment.</p>
              <p><strong>in the govt sector? what is the highest rank a woman can go? for the last 40yrs of NS.. ask urself..</strong></p>
              <p>how many women are there serving NS? if all women are to be made to do NS, no doubt we will see a roughly similar distribution of male and female officers.</p>
              <p>you want to go higher ranks in NS, first serve ur NS. if not, don't bother raising the status of women in NS.</p>
              <p>in govt sector, there are plenty of female perm secs around. if you want to run for MP, or to be minister (of which you first have to be a MP), no one is barring you to run for elections.</p>
              <p>with 50% of the populace being women, its their own business if women themselves can't win over the votes of fellow women.</p>
              <p>therefore, IMO, the fact that there are few women MP is attributed to the general females' lack of interests in politics.</p>
              <p><strong>just ask urself, how many female presidents.. democracy my balls..</strong></p>
              <p>again, no one is stopping you, if you meet the requirements to be a presidential candidate. not many men qualify for the post either, apparently, as seen in the walk-over in the recent presidential elections.</p>
              <p>and again, if you do qualify to be a candidate for presidency, as i am sure you know, selection of president  is carried out by voting. it is still the women to blame, if she is not convincing enough to win over the votes of the populace, since men and women are equal on voting grounds, with the population roughly at 50-50.</p>
              <p><strong>and abt ur women not interested in marriage to dvorcees above 40, seriously.. u noe the rules..</strong></p>
              <p><strong> </strong>wad rules? i am just stating a general observation. alot of single, divorced, never-married men above 40 yrs of age are turning to foreign brides. think this issue was covered in zaobao sometime back, where there is a lot of social debate over foreign brides.</p>
              <p><strong>and to answer deathmaster.. there are women who are educated, there are women who are not.. there are many who are unaware of how to seek legal advice.. even with the women's charter today.. as YOU quoted,  40% of abuse cases are women... even with the law blatantly siding with the women, the men are still doing it.. what will happen if there is NONE?</strong></p>
              <p>stats have shown that there are more female graduates than male graduates out in the society currently. by the rule of proportion, if there are women who are in some way unaware of how to obtain legal aid (i'm not sure why they don't, since legal aid, be it free or paid, are largely advertised and promoted in today's age. counselling center, the police, clan societies provides free of charge legal services, as they deem fit. an as far as i know, anyone can step into any law firm. even law firms are splashing their ads on TV and newspaper.)</p>
              <p>back to the pt, if there really are such ignorant women out there regarding legal aid, judging by the general education level of the population, there would be more males who also do not know where to seek legal aid.</p>
              <p>and how ironic for u to quote the 40% figure. u r just smashing ur feet with a rock. yes, there are 40% women in abuse case, but it also means that there are 60% men in abuse cases too. that figures just show that men are the majority of abuse victims.</p>
              <p>and since in this thread, where some individuals are advocating the sacrificing of minorities to fit the majority, so can we sacrifice these 40% women, since they are the minority?</p>
              <p>i'm sure you would say no. thus, i would like to ask you, why then the double standards? men also deserve equal protection under the law. i am not saying that they are incapable of fending for themselves. but there should be some sort of formalize statement protecting the rights of males.</p>
              <p><strong>and i din say the law must be unfair to be fair.. i said the law must be unfair to protect the victims..</strong></p>
              <p>u are not making sense here. if laws are unfair, what is the point of having a legal system then? you go to court expecting a fair hearing, not an unfair hearing.</p>
              <p>if the laws are fair, victims would have no doubt a mean to protect themselves. if they are unable to protect themselves in a court of law (a fair one), then they must be the guilty party. and u and i quoted, 60% of abuse victims are male, so indirectly, we are agreeing that the law should be made more favorable to males, to protect them, since males form the majority of victims?</p>
              <p><strong>i told u so many times.. the law IS unfair.. it IS biased.. but there is a good reason for it.. because men and women are different.. and the society ACKNOWLEDGES IT... that's why it stands, as a LAW..</strong></p>
              <p>i dare you to go up to any court and tell the judge that the law is unfair. they will just lock u up for lunancy, since its their job to make laws fair and just for everyone.</p>
              <p>as far as i know, a unfair court of law is known as a kangaroo court.</p>
              <p><strong>because SINGAPOREANS acknowledges that men and women are different, when they are in SINGAPORE.. get the idea?</strong></p>
              <p>are you really sure? from the replies we are getting on this thread, it don't seem that way.</p>
              <p><strong>ur views do not represent the majority.. my views dun represent the majority too.. and dun say all men, and half the population.. because not every guy wants to see women caned...</strong></p>
              <p>so, as we had long mentioned before, either impose it on both genders or to scrape it totally.</p>
              <p>so far, its mostly men who have been arguing on the issue of caning, with women generally uninterested, since it does not affect them at hand.</p>
              <p>if women are too caned, we shall start to see more protest on the part of females, and that would sure raise the eyes of our beloved garmen.</p>

              <p><strong>in the workforce, who do u think a boss hires? a mother,
              a pregnant lady? or a man?</strong></p>
              <p>there are plenty of the above types of people working, as far as
              i can see. so far, i think age is the main factor affecting
              employment.</p>
              <p><strong>in the govt sector? what is the highest rank a woman can
              go? for the last 40yrs of NS.. ask urself..</strong></p>
              <p>how many women are there serving NS? if all women are to be made
              to do NS, no doubt we will see a roughly similar distribution of
              male and female officers.</p>
              <p>you want to go higher ranks in NS, first serve ur NS. if not,
              don't bother raising the status of women in NS.</p>
              <p>in govt sector, there are plenty of female perm secs around. if
              you want to run for MP, or to be minister (of which you first have
              to be a MP), no one is barring you to run for elections.</p>
              <p>with 50% of the populace being women, its their own business if
              women themselves can't win over the votes of fellow women.</p>
              <p>therefore, IMO, the fact that there are few women MP is
              attributed to the general females' lack of interests in
              politics.</p>
              <p><strong>just ask urself, how many female presidents.. democracy
              my balls..</strong></p>
              <p>again, no one is stopping you, if you meet the requirements to
              be a presidential candidate. not many men qualify for the post
              either, apparently, as seen in the walk-over in the recent
              presidential elections.</p>
              <p>and again, if you do qualify to be a candidate for presidency,
              as i am sure you know, selection of president  is carried out
              by voting. it is still the women to blame, if she is not convincing
              enough to win over the votes of the populace, since men and women
              are equal on voting grounds, with the population roughly at
              50-50.</p>
              <p><strong>and abt ur women not interested in marriage to dvorcees
              above 40, seriously.. u noe the rules..</strong></p>
              <p><strong> </strong>wad rules? i am just stating a general
              observation. alot of single, divorced, never-married men above 40
              yrs of age are turning to foreign brides. think this issue was
              covered in zaobao sometime back, where there is a lot of social
              debate over foreign brides.</p>
              <p><strong>and to answer deathmaster.. there are women who are
              educated, there are women who are not.. there are many who are
              unaware of how to seek legal advice.. even with the women's charter
              today.. as YOU quoted,  40% of abuse cases are women... even
              with the law blatantly siding with the women, the men are still
              doing it.. what will happen if there is NONE?</strong></p>
              <p>stats have shown that there are more female graduates than male
              graduates out in the society currently. by the rule of proportion,
              if there are women who are in some way unaware of how to obtain
              legal aid (i'm not sure why they don't, since legal aid, be it free
              or paid, are largely advertised and promoted in today's age.
              counselling center, the police, clan societies provides free of
              charge legal services, as they deem fit. an as far as i know,
              anyone can step into any law firm. even law firms are splashing
              their ads on TV and newspaper.)</p>
              <p>back to the pt, if there really are such ignorant women out
              there regarding legal aid, judging by the general education level
              of the population, there would be more males who also do not know
              where to seek legal aid.</p>
              <p>and how ironic for u to quote the 40% figure. u r just smashing
              ur feet with a rock. yes, there are 40% women in abuse case, but it
              also means that there are 60% men in abuse cases too. that figures
              just show that men are the majority of abuse victims.</p>
              <p>and since in this thread, where some individuals are advocating
              the sacrificing of minorities to fit the majority, so can we
              sacrifice these 40% women, since they are the minority?</p>
              <p>i'm sure you would say no. thus, i would like to ask you, why
              then the double standards? men also deserve equal protection under
              the law. i am not saying that they are incapable of fending for
              themselves. but there should be some sort of formalize statement
              protecting the rights of males.</p>
              <p><strong>and i din say the law must be unfair to be fair.. i said
              the law must be unfair to protect the victims..</strong></p>
              <p>u are not making sense here. if laws are unfair, what is the
              point of having a legal system then? you go to court expecting a
              fair hearing, not an unfair hearing.</p>
              <p>if the laws are fair, victims would have no doubt a mean to
              protect themselves. if they are unable to protect themselves in a
              court of law (a fair one), then they must be the guilty party. and
              u and i quoted, 60% of abuse victims are male, so indirectly, we
              are agreeing that the law should be made more favorable to males,
              to protect them, since males form the majority of victims?</p>
              <p><strong>i told u so many times.. the law IS unfair.. it IS
              biased.. but there is a good reason for it.. because men and women
              are different.. and the society ACKNOWLEDGES IT... that's why it
              stands, as a LAW..</strong></p>
              <p>i dare you to go up to any court and tell the judge that the law
              is unfair. they will just lock u up for lunancy, since its their
              job to make laws fair and just for everyone.</p>
              <p>as far as i know, a unfair court of law is known as a kangaroo
              court.</p>
              <p><strong>because SINGAPOREANS acknowledges that men and women are
              different, when they are in SINGAPORE.. get the idea?</strong></p>
              <p>are you really sure? from the replies we are getting on this
              thread, it don't seem that way.</p>
              <p><strong>ur views do not represent the majority.. my views dun
              represent the majority too.. and dun say all men, and half the
              population.. because not every guy wants to see women
              caned...</strong></p>
              <p>so, as we had long mentioned before, either impose it on both
              genders or to scrape it totally.</p>
              <p>so far, its mostly men who have been arguing on the issue of
              caning, with women generally uninterested, since it does not affect
              them at hand.</p>
              <p>if women are too caned, we shall start to see more protest on
              the part of females, and that would sure raise the eyes of our
              beloved garmen.</p>

              <p>yes, VoR, you struck the nail on the head. feminists always want to push for more rights, and also at the same time expect to retain their privilege from an earlier era.</p>
              <p>Chivalry is conceive in a period where women, undeniably, has a lower social standing in society. nevertheless, it's application is solely optional, and there is no law stating that you must pay respect to women, nor to allow them any legal advantage.</p>

              <p>The difference biologically between races against the difference between genders are two totally different matters. Your analogy doesn't apply. Furthermore, mentally and physically, men are more suited to fight. I say do your part and serve your country. When it comes to national defence, due to these biological defence between males and females, it is deemed neccessary for a male to contribute as it is proven that they are more capable of doing so. However if females are willing, they can do so too. This is reflected by the number of female regulars.</p>

              <p>If you are going to cite biology as a reason, I am going to say several things.</p>
              <p>1. The army goes beyond combat. There are many other services in the army.</p>
              <p>2. It is called national service.. We are not caring how you serve.. you *just* have a moral obligation to serve, be it man or woman.</p>
              <p>3. It is also proven biologically that men make better leaders, judges etc(men are logical, women are emotional-fact), does this then mean we should categorically place all men into power? Or, it makes sense for the majority to be filled with male leaders?</p>

              <p>In the past, men were willing to fight and defend women because they were ladylike, possessing all the traits that a woman should be - mother to a family and a loyal wife. How many women are like that today? Materialstic? Superficial? Unfair privileges? Do I really need to go on? If women are transforming, so will men. Don't expect 'chivalry' .. be grateful for it.</p>

              <p><strong>in the workforce, who do u think a boss hires? a mother,
              a pregnant lady? or a man?</strong></p>
              <p>there are plenty of the above types of people working, as far as
              i can see. so far, i think age is the main factor affecting
              employment.</p>
              <p><strong>in the govt sector? what is the highest rank a woman can
              go? for the last 40yrs of NS.. ask urself..</strong></p>
              <p>how many women are there serving NS? if all women are to be made
              to do NS, no doubt we will see a roughly similar distribution of
              male and female officers.</p>
              <p>you want to go higher ranks in NS, first serve ur NS. if not,
              don't bother raising the status of women in NS.</p>
              <p>in govt sector, there are plenty of female perm secs around. if
              you want to run for MP, or to be minister (of which you first have
              to be a MP), no one is barring you to run for elections.</p>
              <p>with 50% of the populace being women, its their own business if
              women themselves can't win over the votes of fellow women.</p>
              <p>therefore, IMO, the fact that there are few women MP is
              attributed to the general females' lack of interests in
              politics.</p>
              <p><strong>just ask urself, how many female presidents.. democracy
              my balls..</strong></p>
              <p>again, no one is stopping you, if you meet the requirements to
              be a presidential candidate. not many men qualify for the post
              either, apparently, as seen in the walk-over in the recent
              presidential elections.</p>
              <p>and again, if you do qualify to be a candidate for presidency,
              as i am sure you know, selection of president  is carried out
              by voting. it is still the women to blame, if she is not convincing
              enough to win over the votes of the populace, since men and women
              are equal on voting grounds, with the population roughly at
              50-50.</p>
              <p><strong>and abt ur women not interested in marriage to dvorcees
              above 40, seriously.. u noe the rules..</strong></p>
              <p><strong> </strong>wad rules? i am just stating a general
              observation. alot of single, divorced, never-married men above 40
              yrs of age are turning to foreign brides. think this issue was
              covered in zaobao sometime back, where there is a lot of social
              debate over foreign brides.</p>
              <p><strong>and to answer deathmaster.. there are women who are
              educated, there are women who are not.. there are many who are
              unaware of how to seek legal advice.. even with the women's charter
              today.. as YOU quoted,  40% of abuse cases are women... even
              with the law blatantly siding with the women, the men are still
              doing it.. what will happen if there is NONE?</strong></p>
              <p>stats have shown that there are more female graduates than male
              graduates out in the society currently. by the rule of proportion,
              if there are women who are in some way unaware of how to obtain
              legal aid (i'm not sure why they don't, since legal aid, be it free
              or paid, are largely advertised and promoted in today's age.
              counselling center, the police, clan societies provides free of
              charge legal services, as they deem fit. an as far as i know,
              anyone can step into any law firm. even law firms are splashing
              their ads on TV and newspaper.)</p>
              <p>back to the pt, if there really are such ignorant women out
              there regarding legal aid, judging by the general education level
              of the population, there would be more males who also do not know
              where to seek legal aid.</p>
              <p>and how ironic for u to quote the 40% figure. u r just smashing
              ur feet with a rock. yes, there are 40% women in abuse case, but it
              also means that there are 60% men in abuse cases too. that figures
              just show that men are the majority of abuse victims.</p>
              <p>and since in this thread, where some individuals are advocating
              the sacrificing of minorities to fit the majority, so can we
              sacrifice these 40% women, since they are the minority?</p>
              <p>i'm sure you would say no. thus, i would like to ask you, why
              then the double standards? men also deserve equal protection under
              the law. i am not saying that they are incapable of fending for
              themselves. but there should be some sort of formalize statement
              protecting the rights of males.</p>
              <p><strong>and i din say the law must be unfair to be fair.. i said
              the law must be unfair to protect the victims..</strong></p>
              <p>u are not making sense here. if laws are unfair, what is the
              point of having a legal system then? you go to court expecting a
              fair hearing, not an unfair hearing.</p>
              <p>if the laws are fair, victims would have no doubt a mean to
              protect themselves. if they are unable to protect themselves in a
              court of law (a fair one), then they must be the guilty party. and
              u and i quoted, 60% of abuse victims are male, so indirectly, we
              are agreeing that the law should be made more favorable to males,
              to protect them, since males form the majority of victims?</p>
              <p><strong>i told u so many times.. the law IS unfair.. it IS
              biased.. but there is a good reason for it.. because men and women
              are different.. and the society ACKNOWLEDGES IT... that's why it
              stands, as a LAW..</strong></p>
              <p>i dare you to go up to any court and tell the judge that the law
              is unfair. they will just lock u up for lunancy, since its their
              job to make laws fair and just for everyone.</p>
              <p>as far as i know, a unfair court of law is known as a kangaroo
              court.</p>
              <p><strong>because SINGAPOREANS acknowledges that men and women are
              different, when they are in SINGAPORE.. get the idea?</strong></p>
              <p>are you really sure? from the replies we are getting on this
              thread, it don't seem that way.</p>
              <p><strong>ur views do not represent the majority.. my views dun
              represent the majority too.. and dun say all men, and half the
              population.. because not every guy wants to see women
              caned...</strong></p>
              <p>so, as we had long mentioned before, either impose it on both
              genders or to scrape it totally.</p>
              <p>so far, its mostly men who have been arguing on the issue of
              caning, with women generally uninterested, since it does not affect
              them at hand.</p>
              <p>if women are too caned, we shall start to see more protest on
              the part of females, and that would sure raise the eyes of our
              beloved garmen.</p>

              <p>MrSean, for someone who has YET to gone through NS, I can understand where you're comming from. However, apparently you have a pretty warped understanding of the things that are done in the army.</p>
              <p>With regards to marching drills, yes one of the reason is to instil discipline but many people do not see HOW it is so. In the army, everyone has to work together to achieve a specific goal and to do so, individual excellence is essential, however, teamwork is crucial. Marching drills instil that sense of teamwork when done in a unit. Every step, every swing of the shoulders and every movement of the rifle is synchronised. If done properly. not only is it a sight to behold, it aims to be a reflection of the mentality and attitude a soldier must have serving his unit, formation and country.</p>
              <p>It sounds very ridiculous to me that a men has to do marching drills to instil discipline therefore in the first place he lacks discipline? Its as good as saying some people have tution teachers, hence the people who don't are less capable academically? It doesn't work that way.</p>
              <p>Whoever that told you all about the food issue? Personally haven't experienced that. But Im sure many will agree that end of the day, the system is actually not flawed in the army. Its the people in command that are flawed. Some of these sorry SOBs just make it a personal agenda to make people's life miserable. But that being said, there are always others on the other end of the spectrum but most of the time the highlight and stories are often cast on the assholes. </p>
              <p>The difference biologically between races against the difference between genders are two totally different matters. Your analogy doesn't apply. Furthermore, mentally and physically, men are more suited to fight. I say do your part and serve your country. When it comes to national defence, due to these biological defence between males and females, it is deemed neccessary for a male to contribute as it is proven that they are more capable of doing so. However if females are willing, they can do so too. This is reflected by the number of female regulars.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>I disagree on your point regarding the marching thing. Surely there are more productive ways to learn to work as a team? More constructive ways? For example, in schools there is project work to encourage teamwork and cooperation, but at the end of the day it still serves a higher purpose. (Perhaps promoting environmental awareness, etc.)</p>
              <p>Also you are right in that men are more biologically capable of physical fighting, but since we are doing our part for our country in the first place, why is every recruit treated like &lt;insert worst swear words here&gt; when they go in? What I'm saying is that if the main purpose there was to serve our country, we are doing our country a service, and surely in return we deserve to be treated at least reasonably. (Many have commented that jail life is surprisingly easier than NS, for example. Of course, being neither an ex-NSman nor prisoner I am unable to verify this.) If the sole goal was to learn to protect our country, I don't think there would be so much of the undeserved yelling at + other undeserved punishments etc. Do you see what I'm getting at?</p>
              <p>It seems the goal of NS has changed from that of teaching our people to protect our country and ourselves to that of torturing and making everyone that goes through it have hell.</p>
              <p>You yourself contended that half of the SOBs (I don't know what an SOB is though) are assholes, so maybe our government should have policies to eliminate being an asshole. Perhaps it is time for the army to refocus on its original goals because it seems to have been sidetracked along the way.</p>
              <p>If women can serve society in ways that do not include being punished undeservingly, than perhaps men should be able to serve NS the same way...</p>

              <p>Regarding your point about how the highest possible rank for women in NS should be raised... Yes I agree with you on this one, but I think you misunderstood deathmaster. What he said was taken out of context, I believe he meant that when there are more women serving, the number of women of a certain status will be roughly equal to the men of that same status. I'm not sure about this though so perhaps he can clarify in his next post.</p>

              <p><br>yep. that was wad i am saying. PurpleD, you know that every year, there are around 20,000 or more guys serving their NS. double that for 2 batches, u get 40,000 males serving NS.</p>
              <p>and clearly, there are always a certain percentage of these males who chose to sign on. of course you will have more majors and other senior officers from the males.</p>
              <p>ask yourself, how many female actually volunteer to serve NS? yes, they do sign on. but how is signing on going to help them in their promotion, if they did not make the cut for ocs?</p>
              <p>officership observe the rule of proportion. if you have a small base of females to choose from, obviously you will end up having lesser female officers.</p>
              <p>likewise, assuming that even if women do get into ocs, and become one of the junior officers, for their subsequent promotion, they still have to compete with other officers of the same rank ( who are mostly males).</p>
              <p>ask yourself, wads the odds of women surviving thru all these challenges to rise beyond the rank of major?</p>
              <p>the army is meritocratic,elitist, and only the best among the best are selected for the highest command. wads the possibility of 1 woman competing with 99 men for a promotion? little.</p>
              <p>but if you have more women in the force, (which is not possible, since from the posts above, women are highly reluctant to serve their NS), at 50-50, they too will have a fair chance of attaining senior rank.</p>

              <p>wad are you trying to say?</p>
              <p>first, i shall try to clarify myself by quoting the example for the democrats election campaign between clinton and obama.</p>
              <p>clearly, if you have been following the reports on the election, hillary herself failed to convince female voters to vote for her, despite them being of the same gender.</p>
              <p>male and female candidates each have a fair share of the voting pie, where male and female voters each make up half of the voting population.</p>
              <p>to win, men not only have to win over the votes of fellow men, they must also be convincing enough to win over the votes of females. likewise, for a woman to win, she too must win over the votes of the male populace.</p>
              <p>if a woman can't even manage to convince and persuade her fellow women to vote her in, it clearly means that the person ain't fit for the job.</p>
              <p>there is no real gender discrimination in voting, since since members of each gender are allowed only 1 vote, and the distribution of the 2 genders are equal.</p>
              <p>yes, a man can discriminate against woman, but how is it going to affect the results of the election? even if the entire population of man choose to not vote for a female, they would at best only win 50% of total votes, which is not enough to be class as a majority, to be considered as victor of the elections.</p>
              <p>thus, for a male to win, females must have too vote for him.</p>
              <p>if females do discriminate against fellow females, then all i can say that its the problem of females and feminists to sort out their own problems. </p>
              <p><strong>rules meaning links.. anyway.. most men will not be interested in a single, divorced or never-married woman above 40 anytime, anyday.. and the woman cannot turn to foreign grooms..</strong></p>
              <p> are you sure? there are increasing reports featuring middle age singles, males and females tying the knot. these ppl are over 45, fyi.</p>
              <p>and not all men will want to marry cute young things 20 yrs younger than themselves. maybe if they are desperate to have a child, an heir wadever. but the trend now is for people to look for soul mates, rather than a potential child-bearer for him.</p>
              <p>and i am sure, with money, women can too go buy a toyboy, just like these men are looking to mail-to-order foreign brides.</p>

              <p>to become colonel etc, u have to get into ocs first, which is not easy to begin with. after that, if u sign on, after many many years den u may be raised to maj.</p>

              <p><strong>the fact that women who run for MP or presidency have to try to win votes from women, doesn't that show anything? that the men are already biased against a female candidate?</strong></p>
              <p>wad are you trying to say?</p>
              <p>first, i shall try to clarify myself by quoting the example for the democrats election campaign between clinton and obama.</p>
              <p>clearly, if you have been following the reports on the election, hillary herself failed to convince female voters to vote for her, despite them being of the same gender.</p>
              <p>male and female candidates each have a fair share of the voting pie, where male and female voters each make up half of the voting population.</p>
              <p>to win, men not only have to win over the votes of fellow men, they must also be convincing enough to win over the votes of females. likewise, for a woman to win, she too must win over the votes of the male populace.</p>
              <p>if a woman can't even manage to convince and persuade her fellow women to vote her in, it clearly means that the person ain't fit for the job.</p>
              <p>there is no real gender discrimination in voting, since since members of each gender are allowed only 1 vote, and the distribution of the 2 genders are equal.</p>
              <p>yes, a man can discriminate against woman, but how is it going to affect the results of the election? even if the entire population of man choose to not vote for a female, they would at best only win 50% of total votes, which is not enough to be class as a majority, to be considered as victor of the elections.</p>
              <p>thus, for a male to win, females must have too vote for him.</p>
              <p>if females do discriminate against fellow females, then all i can say that its the problem of females and feminists to sort out their own problems. </p>
              <p><strong>rules meaning links.. anyway.. most men will not be interested in a single, divorced or never-married woman above 40 anytime, anyday.. and the woman cannot turn to foreign grooms..</strong></p>
              <p> are you sure? there are increasing reports featuring middle age singles, males and females tying the knot. these ppl are over 45, fyi.</p>
              <p>and not all men will want to marry cute young things 20 yrs younger than themselves. maybe if they are desperate to have a child, an heir wadever. but the trend now is for people to look for soul mates, rather than a potential child-bearer for him.</p>
              <p>and i am sure, with money, women can too go buy a toyboy, just like these men are looking to mail-to-order foreign brides.</p>

              <strong>and i am sure, with money, women can too go buy a toyboy, just like these men are looking to mail-to-order foreign brides.</strong><p></p>
              <p>u look for a soulmate.. and u claim that a toyboy can be one? i dun see how u can equate toyboys to mail-to-order foreign brides.. not all women can afford toyboys, like not all men can afford mail-to-order brides.. but who do u think lose out more, a single old man or a single old woman? a divorced man with kids or a divorced woman with kids?</p>
              <p>and as i said, it is obvious who will be hired between a father of three and a mother of three..</p>
              <p>regarding elections, u claim that females and males are equal when it comes to election candidates.. u claim that the proportion of male and female population is roughly equal, u claim that there are more female graduates than male graduates, but where are the female? why are the men leading everything and women not given their share? you mean to say that all those educated women are unwilling to step out of their comfort zone to seek political rights? surely, the women are stuck somewhere.. somewhere called the KITCHEN..</p>
              <p>how many men are willing to stay at hm and be house-husband while the female goes out to work? are you? even in dual-income families, there are conflicts and times when someone has to sacrifice when something crops up.. and the women are the ones who has to take a step back.. don't ask me for stats because there aren't any.. because, quoting u, this is the general observation, that women despite all the education and so-called abilities in the office, are still the ones who has to be home to do the chores, where the men only "help out".. no matter what, eventually the woman has to be the one taking a step back to the family and eventually depending on the man to bring home the bacon..</p>
              <p>and what happens if the man goes out to have fun and make merry and refuse to give money to the wife "out of chivalry"? there is a thin line between chivalry and lawful obligation.. and giving money to ur wife is fulfilling your obligation..</p>
              <p>if until now u refuse to accept the fact that our society views men and women differently, which in turn leads to a difference in the treatment of the law, den lets not continue this topic anymore.. quite sick and tired of this topic which is so obvious.. that when a marriage turns ugly, it no longer becomes just about qualifications, or men and women being equal.. it may turn violent.. and the woman loses when it turns violent..</p>

              Jojobetch..so U finally found your match..Voice of reason is absolutely right..U're just an armchair critics spinster and lashe yr insults or disguised as comments sparingly.
              
              Now that U know I'm blissfully married with 2 kids and U're just envy or can't take it.Just bcoz U're from a single family and with a indifferent father,no wonder U're psychologically affected and always critical ans suspicious of pple.Perhaps for yr own health sake I sincerely advise U to consult a psychologist otherwise u may deteriorate further.Your tongue is worse than yr bite..why go into Vpoice or reason's personal life or his gf.
              
              Perhaps as a remedy U shd find some one to settle down or get a bf to keep yrself occupied or yr merciless tongues will sure to agitate or antagonise someone.I suspect U may hve divorced b4 otherwise U wld not hve been so bitter .For me my interaction with Adrian help me to read nad do more research as I feel man has been unfairly punished by the outmoded Women's Charter.
              
              Perhaps God only can save U ...jojo
