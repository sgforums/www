              <p><br>yes, VoR, you struck the nail on the head. feminists always want to push for more rights, and also at the same time expect to retain their privilege from an earlier era.</p>
              <p>Chivalry is conceive in a period where women, undeniably, has a lower social standing in society. nevertheless, it's application is solely optional, and there is no law stating that you must pay respect to women, nor to allow them any legal advantage.</p>
              <p>chivalry is an act of the willing, where men exhibit chivalry to those deserving females.</p>
              <p>ie. you show respect to an elderly lady, helping her cross the road etc. but you don't give a damn about female thieves. only those worthy are respected.</p>
              <p>respect for any person, be it male or female, is to be earned. only when you earned that person's respect then can you command his or her respect. you don't demand respect.</p>
              <p>and purpleD, the point about "<strong>you cannot laud yourself as my equal(as if, haha) and enjoy unequal privileges."</strong></p>
              <p>i think ur analogy is off tangent. in fact, it more like:</p>
              <p>2 person earn $50k each, in the same position in the same company. but 1 is taxed 20% while the other is not taxed at all.</p>
              <p>if you still can't see the link, here's a more direct example:</p>
              <p>a man molest a teenage girl, he gets jailed and 12 strokes of caning.</p>
              <p>an indonesian maid rape her employer's 2 yr old son, she gets jailed for a few months followed by deportation. (was reported in the papers before. employers caught her in the act on film)</p>
              <p>is this equal treatment to criminals? just because the person who commited the offense is a women doesn't make her a lesser criminal.</p>

              Jojo: Typical feminist replies. Missing the point, throwing out personal insults, running away from the argument at hand, coming up with bizzarre personal anecdotes and citing them as wholesale proof... the list goes on.
              
              Please, for the love of jesus, read through the replies directed to you.
              
              In essence, you are reluctant to give up anything which is...expected for a feministic women. Princess, the world doesn't belong to you. Chivalry is a privilege, not an expectation.
              
              You cannot have your cake and eat it, the same way you cannot laud yourself as my equal(as if, haha) and enjoy unequal privileges. Privileges, such as aforementioned, are for the weak. Don't be weak.
              
              -VoR
              VOR u're absolutely,jojo the princess of spinsters will never accommodate other viewpoints that are against women,she is just an arm chair critics bent on supporting the feminist movement,probably reason why difficult to attract the male sex-always fighting for her right,living in a world here women are always right.
              
              many women are bent on destroyibg their estranged husbands once divorce bekons,they will try to exact maximum mileage from Family Court,but nowadays judges in SG are not so stupid,they knew many foreign women including local women want 50%or &gt; for matrimonial and other assets owned by their husbands..really cheapskate,esp when their role are just homemakers ,I agree they shd be given a small share 30% the most to prevent outright abuse.Local situation when PPO(protection orders are granted easily) and women just cried 'wolf" to get their estranged husbands into trouble.Let their be justice in SG-jojo wake up from yr dream land

              <p>Your ignorance in the family law is causing your singlehood isn't it ?</p>
              <p>I suggest you go pay some lawyer fees and go find out from them what family laws are in proper details. Instead of letting it scare the shyt out of you because you don't understand it.</p>
              <p>After which you can start flipping through the mail order brides catalog and find someone you like to settle down with.</p>

              <p>is singapore today viewing men and women equally? in the workforce? in the government sector? in the home?</p>
              <p>is the average woman able to get the same achievements as the man with the same amount of effort put in, that when a woman screws up at work, there will no longer be the immediate thought in ppl's mind, "woman..." and all the stereotypes?</p>
              <p>are any of u, 787180, MrSean, deathmaster, VOR, so certain that a men's charter will not be abused just like the women's charter is being abused? are u so certain that with the implementing of a men's charter, that the abusive women will be tamed, and everyone will be happy, and MEN WILL NOT ABUSE THE MEN'S CHARTER?</p>
              <p>how can u fail to see that if a women's charter can be abused, why not a men's charter?</p>
              <p>if u can tell me that within such a men's charter, it is so foolproof and wonderful, then i tell u, well done! but hey, then there will be no need for a men's charter, just implement it to the current women's charter.. and women who really need help can seek help, and women who seek to rip men off will be unable to do so..</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>"When a man leaves a woman , he hurts her and allow her to emotionally detact herself from him."</p>
              <p>"When a woman leaves a man , she wants to destroy the man totally."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hope that everyone here will one day have children so that when they get bored of eachother, they still know where to give love and draw the energy to provide for oneanother.</p>

              <p>Dear MrSean,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>After reading your constant whining about the NS and the need for protection of men's rights, I came to the conclusion that Singaporean men(or actually boy) like you are the reason we're looked down down by our female counterparts.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>First off, NS is no freaking big deal. Thousands have gone through it comming out unscathed and gaining from it as much as they hate to admit be it physcially, mentally or socially. True 2 years may be long but I feel if you make the choice to make the most out of it, you actually gain more than you lose. If you can prove yourself inside, there's no doubting you can prove yourself outside.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Secondly, as jojobeach have pointed out, male and females are fundamentally different, of course you can expect a difference in treatment between the two. Our law are a reflection of what society deems right and just and if society views that females need to be more so protected than men, of course our laws will reflect that.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I implore you to grow some balls which I hope you do in due time in light of your relatively young age.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Zarks.. you're not even Singaporean. Do you even know how SG family law works ? Are you going to blindly believe a one sided story ?</p>
              <p>How about you tell us what Malaysian practises in the event of a divorce ? How are the assets divided? What about child custody ? Alimony etc.</p>
              <p>If Malaysia is a male Utopia.. I'm sure there's plenty of SG men willing to go live their life there and happily marry Malaysian wifeys and subject themselves to Malaysian law instead of the "Unfair" Singapore one.</p>

              <p>to me, nothing is bad when u can learn something new.. i dont know bout NS but i do know ,if u learn some military things, at least the knowledge and skills u gain can help u to protect yourself and also the loved one around u when there's trouble.</p>
              <p>mayb its torturing, but i think the skills that u learnt and the agony made u a tougher guy than just a home-boy. I do think that the physical training actually helps u to keep a better health, body and stamina.</p>
              <p>There's always pro and con in everything la.. since guy or gal are born with it, so just accept the fate that you are what your gender is unless u wanna change it. Guy or gal have their own responsibilities.</p>
