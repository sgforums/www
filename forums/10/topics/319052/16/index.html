              <p>Yes you are right as well. I do agree. And I think the same as you. But the garmen won't care. Not for a thousand years.</p>

              <p>When did he ever say that...? Clearly I'm missing something... O.O I don't see the connection...</p>
              <p>As per deathmaster's request, henceforth I shall refer to military NS service as MNS just to make things clear. The NS portion of the name still retains some importance as it is important to distinguish between the mandatory service and other enlistments.</p>
              <p>Either way I shall respond to your question because I do indeed have a theory on that. Really, in MNS, there is a vicious cycle of hate. It is a very psychological aspect of MNS that drives this cycle, and it is important to recognise it and understand it in order to understand the full mechanics of this system.</p>
              <p>Recruit A is tortured by sergeant B. (Forgive me if I have assumed the wrong rank, I am simply assuming this based on how I've read sergeants at MNS are bastards.) When recruit A becomes a sergeant himself, he feels that since he has gone through so much crap as a recruit, he has now earned the privilege of torturing recruit C of the next generation. He feels that since he's already paid the price, he might as well pick up the perks. He also may feel that as a sergeant, he is obliged to do this because he thinks that since HIS sergeant did this to him, he has a responsibility to do that same thing. Sergeant A also does not stand to lose anything at all, so he doesn't bother to question the system.</p>
              <p>It's a vicious cycle that will repeat itself because <em>no one wants to correct it.</em> No one wants to have paid the price of being tortured without getting their perks just to stand up for the rights of people they don't really care about. They don't even question the system; often they are unable to see that something is wrong, and they believe that because it has been happening for many years it's ok.</p>
              <p>Those that <em>do</em> feel there is a problem with the system, often are so pissed off they don't stay around with the SAF long enough to become BMT-trainers in MNS in the first place. They disagree with the politics of MNS (as do I,) and they don't want to stick around any longer than they have to.</p>
              <p>In fact, there are few who object to and disagree with MNS ethics in the first place, which multiplies the effect several-fold. In the end, only the bitter are left, and these bitter BMT-trainers want some amount of self-satisfaction that they get by "revenge", except that this is revenge on people who haven't done anything to deserve all that at all.</p>
              <p>Thus, the cycle of hatred turns once more...</p>

              <p>Then the NS camp will be more at peace because now got balance liao.</p>
              <p>A man without a good woman will become a savage.</p>
              <p>That's why hor.. I suggest LHL go find himself a sweet and loving wife or mistress lah. Then he will rule SG with a golden heart, instead of being such an ass with his powerful butch like second wife.</p>

              <p>it you not help to boost ur endurance you are the one who collapse under harshness.</p>
              <p>on the other hand, if you got a strong will and a strong mind, you can take anything, regardless of whether it is harsh or not.</p>

              <p>this is definately a petty view on women in the society. you talked about how girls are allowed to have long hair as long as they keep it tied up while guys are only allowed short hair. Sure it seems pretty biased, but you seem to forget that we would still have to tie up our hair. we don't run around with all over the place do we? you cut your hair in school, we have to keep our fringe above our eyebrows, you conveniently forgot that too. also, girls aren't allowed to shave off our tresses when we are in school. they either call it too cool for school or unacceptable. isn't that biasness too?</p>
              <p>if a model is picked up by a designer to do a 'certain' job and loses his deal just because of reservice, why don't you start complaining how hard it is for women to keep trim and fit and the extent of starvation they have to go through in order to even keep a foot in the modelling world? ppl don't get disfigured during reservice training right? that male model can always get another modelling deal again.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>you think its unfair that only you men are made to serve the national service. Sure you'd like to be able to goad about how women complain about what ns did to them and all, but it would hurt your pride if your mom told you that she can do more pull ups then u, wouldn't it?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>when women start going to ns, you'd start complaining that women in sg are too macho.</p>
              <p>unless u like bigger stout women,</p>

              <p>Dear MrSean,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>After reading your constant whining about the NS and the need
              for protection of men's rights, I came to the conclusion that
              Singaporean men(or actually boy) like you are the reason we're
              looked down down by our female counterparts.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>First off, NS is no freaking big deal. Thousands have gone
              through it comming out unscathed and gaining from it as much as
              they hate to admit be it physcially, mentally or socially. True 2
              years may be long but I feel if you make the choice to make the
              most out of it, you actually gain more than you lose. If you can
              prove yourself inside, there's no doubting you can prove yourself
              outside.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Secondly, as jojobeach have pointed out, male and females
              are fundamentally different, of course you can expect a difference
              in treatment between the two. Our law are a reflection of what
              society deems right and just and if society views that females need
              to be more so protected than men, of course our laws will reflect
              that.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I implore you to grow some balls which I hope you do in due time
              in light of your relatively young age.</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>When did he ever say that...? Clearly I'm missing something... O.O I don't see the connection...</p>
              <p>As per deathmaster's request, henceforth I shall refer to military NS service as MNS just to make things clear. The NS portion of the name still retains some importance as it is important to distinguish between the mandatory service and other enlistments.</p>
              <p>Either way I shall respond to your question because I do indeed have a theory on that. Really, in MNS, there is a vicious cycle of hate. It is a very psychological aspect of MNS that drives this cycle, and it is important to recognise it and understand it in order to understand the full mechanics of this system.</p>
              <p>Recruit A is tortured by sergeant B. (Forgive me if I have assumed the wrong rank, I am simply assuming this based on how I've read sergeants at MNS are bastards.) When recruit A becomes a sergeant himself, he feels that since he has gone through so much crap as a recruit, he has now earned the privilege of torturing recruit C of the next generation. He feels that since he's already paid the price, he might as well pick up the perks. He also may feel that as a sergeant, he is obliged to do this because he thinks that since HIS sergeant did this to him, he has a responsibility to do that same thing. Sergeant A also does not stand to lose anything at all, so he doesn't bother to question the system.</p>
              <p>It's a vicious cycle that will repeat itself because <em>no one wants to correct it.</em> No one wants to have paid the price of being tortured without getting their perks just to stand up for the rights of people they don't really care about. They don't even question the system; often they are unable to see that something is wrong, and they believe that because it has been happening for many years it's ok.</p>
              <p>Those that <em>do</em> feel there is a problem with the system, often are so pissed off they don't stay around with the SAF long enough to become BMT-trainers in MNS in the first place. They disagree with the politics of MNS (as do I,) and they don't want to stick around any longer than they have to.</p>
              <p>In fact, there are few who object to and disagree with MNS ethics in the first place, which multiplies the effect several-fold. In the end, only the bitter are left, and these bitter BMT-trainers want some amount of self-satisfaction that they get by "revenge", except that this is revenge on people who haven't done anything to deserve all that at all.</p>
              <p>Thus, the cycle of hatred turns once more...</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>Maybe the system is supposed to train Recruit A to be stronger than Sergeant B, so when Sergeant B insults Recruit A, Recruit A is SUPPOSED to take up his guns and defend his family honor by slaughtering Sergeant B for behaving in an enemy-like manner?</p>
              <p>If every new Recruit treated the MNS like a real war training and slaughter every Sergeant who tries to insult them in an enemy-like manner, then our army people will certainly be the best and the most feared in our S.E.A Region. Plus, the recruits will get equal respect from their sergeant who will treat them like their equal too.</p>
              <p>The problem occurs from the point when Recruit A decided to adopt the weak attitude and allow himself to be enslaved, insult, humiliated, surrender &amp; move on, by his Sergeant.</p>
              <p>Time to make our army people into a WORLD-CLASS REAL ARMY!</p>
              <p>If in army, insult and humiliation by an enemy-like attitude is allowed, then proving your ability to defend your countrymen against such enemy-like attitude should also be allowed to be displayed freely. Isn't it TO KILL OR BE KILLED? Why does it seems that our army people only have to endure or be trained in the TO BE KILLED attitude then?</p>
