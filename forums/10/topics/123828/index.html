            <div class='col-md body'>So much have been said about sex discrimination but so far most has been for the support of women. It is right that they must be given equal rights and oppurtunities, freedom from abuse and so on. The govt has done the right thing recently by granting women civil servants equal medical benefits as their men counterpart. I am all for women getting equal rights. Now how about equal responsibilities?<br><br>Aside from the sore point of women not having to serve NS, the reason I am writing this is that I have come across a few cases of divorces in which the men paid heavily and very often, unfairly for their divorces. I have came across some who have to fork out half of their take home pay, leaving themselves with less than a thousand bucks to survive. Very often, the women will emerge none the worse and in fact some of them came out laughing all the way to the bank!<br><br>The law must know that the days of uneducated ignorant women are over and that they have an equal responsibility to maintain the children. True, most women still perform a greater percentage of household chores over the men, but the disparity is becoming lesser nowadays. So pray tell me why must men shoulder the bulk of the burden of maintaining their children?<br><br>My friend recently had a divorce. He is earning a take home pay of $2000. Child and wife maintenance comes up to $601  Oh yes, the $1 is for the wife. Goodwill on the part of the ex-wife in only asking a token $1 for her maintenance? Hell no! Its because if she re-marries she'll only lose $1! How many average S'pore child needs $600 to survive? I mean if the father is only earning $2000? Don't forget the law says that both parents must share in child maintenance, so if say, the wife has her own salary, the child should be getting like $1k a month!<br><br>I can go on. If you want more details, ask me. Anyway, something here for you to ponder on:<br><br>When men dates women, they pay, dinner, movies, taxi......<br>When men marries they pay, wedding dinner, dowry, gifts....<br>When men married, they pay, renovation, bills, fees, family outings...<br>When men divorce, they pay, alimony, maintenance, legal costs....<br>When men don't marry, they pay prostitutes, karaoke hostesses....<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>All opinions welcome, including flames!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>first it was caramon. now another As hole.<br><br>if a woman has kids who stays with her after divorce, she has much slimmer chance of getting another marriage. she has to manage everthing on her own. the child may not need that much money to survive. but look beyond the near future. the kid has to grow up and his expences will rise. if they don't start getting the money now, how are they going to pay for their living?<br><br>besides, who asked the guy to breach the "i do" he told the priest in the first place? maybe they should change the vows to "will you take her as your wife, to love and to cherish, in wealth and in poverty, in health and in sickness, in marriage and in divorce."</div>

Everytime they amend a law, it's alien to the old folks.<br><br>Talk about fair. This world is never fair since everyone differs and every situation is different. Your father and mother grew up with a different mindset from yours. It's not easy to find a compromise between the generations. The law cannot account for every unexpected circumstances.
