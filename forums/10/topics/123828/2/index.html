Tat is why laws came about to protect the weak. Men r stronger, but for wat ? They r not gonna hunt or anything. One can argue women live longer and have litle problem with balding. So they deserves to be punished for it ? Nature is nature, rights is rights. We should be fair by looking at the role of male and female in society now and determine who is entitled to wat rights.<br><br><blockquote>Number 2. There is no such thing as fairness, if a men screws a women and after the pleasure the two gets, the women suffers hell for 9 months. </blockquote>But again, u can view it as the women understand tat she will get 9 months of hell yet she still wanna do it as well. It is not really forced into her either. So she got to go into labour, and she also got special rights to earn custody of the child and get a 3 months leave. So just because she is borned to be about to give birth then she can demand anything she want ? Just because men r borned to be a man, he have to forfeit his right to his possessions ? She might as well ask for a year leave, let the men give him all his possessions and have to be forever a slave tending to her every whims and fancy just because she is born as a women. Surely some place a line has to be cut isn't it ? Furthermore, there r male who actually want to have the chance to give birth to his offspring. The possibility of giving birth is a gift to them, not a burden. However they will never have the chance to do tat.<br><br><blockquote>Number 3. Unless the guy is impotent, he can have as many offsprings as possible.

He purposely made women have all these problems ? If u wanna blame, blame the maker. The male sexual organs is also at a vulnerable position as well. If there r some accidents occur at the groin area, the male may suffer death, impotency, a lot of pain and being humilated as being effiminate if it is lost as well. If u wanna compare about these natural features, it will be never ending<br><br><blockquote>Thus, it is therefore made to acknowledge that the man pays his due for screwing around.

It is not as though women r not enjoying the process as well<br><br><blockquote>Why should there be a MEN's charter as if they are oppressed by nature, forced to labour by nature, suffers due to nature poor health, down syndrome because of giving birth?</blockquote>Looking at the other side, men r forced into labour (working. Generally men have to work while women have the opton of being a housewife), oppressed by women in certain areas, die younger and depression due to child being closer to mother. Why shouldn't a men charter appears ?</div>

He is earning a take home pay of $2000. Child and wife maintenance comes up to $601  Oh yes, the $1 is for the wife. Goodwill on the part of the ex-wife in only asking a token $1 for her maintenance? Hell no! Its because if she re-marries she'll only lose $1! How many average S'pore child needs $600 to survive? I mean if the father is only earning $2000? Don't forget the law says that both parents must share in child maintenance, so if say, the wife has her own salary, the child should be getting like $1k a month!<br></div></blockquote>I understand that the wife is generally advised to ask for a token $1 instead of completely waiving maintenance for herself (even if she wants nothing from the man) bec this gives her an avenue to go back to the court to ask for a maintenance adjustment should it become a necessity.<br><br>$600 is about a third of your friend's salary. Apparently, if the man earns more,  depending on the lifestyle the family has been used to, maintenance can be awarded to as much as 50% of his salary.  It is really painful if you think of it just from the man's point of view but out of your friend's marriage came a child and the child has to be provided for. If you think of it the other way round, $601 is for his wife and child; but he gets $1,399 all to himself. And imagine, during the marriage, he might not even have been spending all that on himself but rather on his wife and kid when they go out, when the kid needs a medical, etc.<br><br>Depending on the age of the child, $600 <strong><span style="font-style: italic;">may not</span></strong> be very much. Bringing up children can be really expensive, even if parents don't choose to provide their kids with an extravagant life or top class medical attention.  School needs alone can add up to quite a bit already.  Perhaps part of the $600 awarded was also in consideration of providing a roof over the child's head? Or educational insurance? Won't any decent father want to at least be able to provide what he can for his own flesh and blood?</div>

Although I would add that it might be prudent not just to consider the male and female role in society today but within the family itself, which is what each case should be about, should it not?<br><br>In a situation where the wife is a home-maker or working part-time, who's devoted her time and life to her home and family, then I feel strongly that the WC should be enforced more stringently to protect her and her children.

If, while both parents are working their kids are cared for by a maid and grandparents of the father and most of their needs seen to by their father, is it fair then for the custody to be awarded to the wife just because she is the mother? If the man's salary is used to pay for the home they are living in while the woman has other properties, say up for rental to boost her savings, should <strong><span style="font-style: italic;">her</span></strong> properties not rightly come under "matrimonial assets" if they've been acquired during the marriage?
