            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by baderange:</div><div class="quote_body">So much have been said about sex discrimination but so far most has been for the support of women. It is right that they must be given equal rights and oppurtunities, freedom from abuse and so on. The govt has done the right thing recently by granting women civil servants equal medical benefits as their men counterpart. I am all for women getting equal rights. Now how about equal responsibilities?<br><br>Aside from the sore point of women not having to serve NS, the reason I am writing this is that I have come across a few cases of divorces in which the men paid heavily and very often, unfairly for their divorces. I have came across some who have to fork out half of their take home pay, leaving themselves with less than a thousand bucks to survive. Very often, the women will emerge none the worse and in fact some of them came out laughing all the way to the bank!<br><br>The law must know that the days of uneducated ignorant women are over and that they have an equal responsibility to maintain the children. True, most women still perform a greater percentage of household chores over the men, but the disparity is becoming lesser nowadays. So pray tell me why must men shoulder the bulk of the burden of maintaining their children?<br><br>My friend recently had a divorce. He is earning a take home pay of $2000. Child and wife maintenance comes up to $601  Oh yes, the $1 is for the wife. Goodwill on the part of the ex-wife in only asking a token $1 for her maintenance? Hell no! Its because if she re-marries she'll only lose $1! How many average S'pore child needs $600 to survive? I mean if the father is only earning $2000? Don't forget the law says that both parents must share in child maintenance, so if say, the wife has her own salary, the child should be getting like $1k a month!<br><br>I can go on. If you want more details, ask me. Anyway, something here for you to ponder on:<br><br>When men dates women, they pay, dinner, movies, taxi......<br>When men marries they pay, wedding dinner, dowry, gifts....<br>When men married, they pay, renovation, bills, fees, family outings...<br>When men divorce, they pay, alimony, maintenance, legal costs....<br>When men don't marry, they pay prostitutes, karaoke hostesses....<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>All opinions welcome, including flames!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"> </div></blockquote>I agree with you for the majority of your argument.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Some people like that one lah. If Singapore woman don't give birth. Can also what ? Go to foriegn country and steal babies from people's mother loh ! Then ga na complain here and there ! Hahahah!!!!!! So many Child lost in Indonesia,  because the Singapore woman don't want to give birth. And steal babies from oversea.<br><br>I told you already right. Singapore woman cannot give birth one. Living under a golden spoon. Still complain life hard. Give her eat FISH &amp; chip. She want SHARK-FIN TO WASH LEG, Bird's nest to wash her breast ! What to do ? I tell you already. Find foriegn ! Better ! She eat Fried small fish. You give her FISH &amp; CHIP she already smiling !<br><br>The best is to find woman that is grateful for your love. Singapore woman ? Never grateful only more and more greedy ! Cannot give birth in the end ! Like ZOE TAY LOH. 36 years old then give birth. If cannot give birth. 2 years later husband also become another woman husband loh.<br><br>If man can give birth. Will they need woman ?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If I'm wrong (Please correct me):<br><br>For divorce in Sg, the woman gets half of the man's money (as was already said),  and also matainence, for her lost of lifestyle and other "sarcrifice". that is the spirit of the law.<br><br>With time, it has become the norm, with many judges using it as default. BTW, it doesn't matter who initiated the breakup, whose fault is it. Even if you can get a PI to find OVERWHELMING evidence that the woman has an affair, the aforementioned is still the default.<br><br>If the man wants to fight to not pay maintainence, not lose half his property, he has to fight a long, costly, difficult legal battle which he might lose due to the woman's charter and law of presidence (however you spell it, i can't).<br><br>I didn't know that pre nup is not recognised here although I do know that most Sg gals would rather not get married than sign the pre nup.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Why man don't take divorce woman ?<br><br>If she can divorce once. She can do it again and again. There is no credit in it.<br>She can divorce you again. And one thing for sure. If she have a children, She just finding a man to support her children. Do you think she will give birth for you ? No credit. SO why find divorce woman. Why not left her to be single so that she can go back to the "HUSBAND". Isn't it better ?<br><br>Just like woman when choose man. Money....... . How much he got ?<br><br></div>
