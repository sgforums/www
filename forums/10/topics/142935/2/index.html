Let me ask you, how much are these groups of people doing dirty job getting?  Don't you agree that they are getting only <span style="color: red;"><span class="large">[b]partial of peanut's shell</span></span></strong>.  With high expenses and living cost to cope with, you think they do their work in hapiness?  <span style="color: blue;"><strong>Put your shoes in their situation and ask yourself.</strong></span><br><br>I myself working as a white collar. I fully understand these people.<br><br>To cut down my daily expenses; I took train for Bedok to Bishan and walk to Sin Ming Road and vice vesa when I finish work.  My walking distance took me one hour for go to work and going home.  So....you think we deserve this kind extreme thrifty way of livelihood; and where the High ranking officers of sg gov, GIC, GLC are enjoy swiss standard of living and laughing their way to the banks with their unreasonable super high salaries?<br>MM keeping saying paying top salaries for top people by comparing with the private sectors.  I wonder if these mini-stars or the high ranking officers were to be put in private sectors, how many will be able make through.<br><br>[/b]</blockquote>Before anything else, I admire that you live a thrifty life. However, I believe you miss the point altogether.<br><br>There exists jobs which do not command high pay. And of coz, there are jobs that fetch a handsome rewards. There is hardly any formula that we can apply to make the whole world equal. Otherwise, we will be living in a communism era.<br><br>You have asked me to put myself in the shoes of the blue collars workers who have worked hard with meagre pay. Have you put yourself in the shoes of those people you mentioned? Have you thought of the workload, pressure, and the sacrifice of their private life?<br><br>I am not advocating that their pay is reasonable. We can never end any argument on this issue.<br><br>The main thrust of my posting earlier on is my disappointment in a small group of Singaporeans who have become too choosy in finding a job. Amongst them, there exists some who blame the govt for not doing a good job.<br><br>I gathered from some successful entreprenuers and businessmen that working attitude of some Singaporeans are not as good as those foreigners who arrive here with a mindset to toil and work hard, in order to aim for a better life in the future. Such working attitude, which we can find in the essence and characters of our fathers and grandfathers, is losing its root and developing in neighbouring factories.<br><br>sg_aurora<br>signing off...<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>sg_aurora does have a point. To be honest, I think we as a society have moved on quite alot since our parents' time. We are more discerning and more demanding. If my child has a persistent cough for a month, I would bring him to see a paediatric respiratory physician. My grandmother refused to spend a cent to see the GP even though she had been coughing blood for months (she had TB).<br><br>It is the same with jobs. We think we are working hard and indeed I believe we are a hardworking lot. But I have seen employers who tell Indian nationals that at the end of their one-year contract, he will keep half of them and the other half will be sent back. These foreign workers practically fight with each other to do extra duties and work around the clock. They are more hungry than we are. Whether they continue to work in Singapore may mean if their children will get life-saving antibiotics.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>On the other hand, I agree with Lowclassman about the disillusionment over the high pay of senior civil servants and Ministers.<br><br>You can call it politics of envy but it exists. I am quite happy with my Maggie mee if the ministers themselves are eating Maggie mee. But if I am having char kwa teow each meal whilst my MP is having shark's fin all the time, I get angry.<br><br>We can put up with some differences in remuneration but with Singaporeans getting more educated all round, we do not see why our Ministers should deserve so much more. We think, "I may not be from Yale or Havard, but I am certainly no ignoramus. Why should they earn so much that 600k is nothing more than peanuts whilst I will never get close to half a peanut shell?"<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The use of Pay And Pay system  to fix all problems in Singapore has made more heartlanders felt dejected and disillusioned about the future of Singapore! Just imagine any poor Singaporeans who use $20 of water per month have to fork out another another similar amount for taxes is something they could not swallow!They told you that Singapore is short of water but you see floodgates wide open when the days were dark!Worst still in Singapore they use the highest salary in the world to tell themselves not to be corrupted, to erect and plant more ERP gantries to fix traffic jams even when you go home! They use COE as another excuse to tame the car population but actually they are profiteering from it as in their mind, the more the merrier!Trafic jams? just plant more ERP gantries and more $$$ will come in!See how contradictory the system is and at the end who benefit and who are the victims?Both ways they are the winners!More outsourcings are killing the lower income heartlanders becauses the Pay And Pay System keeps S$ as strong as a rock and the rich are getting richer, the poors are getting poorer!<br><br>No matter what happen, one thing is pretty worrying!IF Singapore are attacked by some neighbouring countries, will the rich just fly out of Singapore with their gold bars leaving the poor Singaporeans to fend for themselves?</div>

As long as no radicals gain power in our neighbouring countries.. we should be fine.<br><br>nonetheless, we should nv be complacent.<br><br>on the note of Singapore's economic collapse, well it's debatable.<br>Singapore's economy has reached the slow growth phase (although the government would definately disagree with me), looking at history, i.e. the Jap and korean examples... it would be impossible to achieve high growth rate. but our government did an extremely good job in soft landing the economy post-97 crisis.<br><br>the golden years have definately past.. and it will be tough for all of us. but looking at the global networks and how the world economy is evolving, opportunities are massive around the globe, and its up to S'poreans to grad these chances.<br><br>the only sad thing is that there are few large S'pore MNCs that can hold their own against foreign companies. In 2001, when i was doing some research on S'pore's economy, the largest listed S;pore company was singtel and Singtel was backed by the governemnt. we as a country really need to reflect on how to tackle such issues.<br><br>but we first need to acknowledge that S'pore will be in dire circumstances if this continues. there is this skewed mindset in S'poreans that we r doing pretty ok ... if complacency sets in ... all hell will break loose i guess</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think it is possible.<br><br>The way our govt rule  is only able to achieve results when the world is not so competitive. But now all our neighbours have caught up with us and the only way to compete is through ideas and creativity. Unfortunately, the tight control the government exert on us has choked the spirit of innovation out of us.<br><br>We are not only woefully lacking in entrepreneurs, our mandarins are also academics  who can't think outside the box.<br><br>Unless the government allow more freedom, then creativity will flow. And unless they drop their meritrocacy policy will we have leaders who have creative solutions to problems. We have been languishing in structural unemployment since 2000 and there are no solutions in sight.<br><br>Some forumites here think that our economic crisis started with the 1997/1998 Asian Financial Crisis but I understand that we escaped relatively unscathed in that crisis.  Our crisis started when the MNCs moved out to our low cost neighbours in 2000.  The 2001 recession in US also compunded our crisis.</div>
