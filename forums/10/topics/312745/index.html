              <div id="post_message_112598" class="vb_postbit">A
              society is a collection of individuals. Individuals have needs, desires
              and many aspirations. These various needs and demands of individuals
              create competitions and conflicts.<br> <br> There were wars between nations so were conflicts between individuals.  In governing a country, if leaders start to deviate from such first principle, what will happen to the country?<br> <br> Because of such conflicts the first principle in nation building should
              be to define a system of law based on justice and equity to prevent
              such conflicts from causing lawlessness and instability.<br> <br> For too many years our national leaders have forsaken morality, values
              like Justice and Equity and belittle them in favor of pragmatism. They have overzealously focused all their attention on making monies for themselves and government from foul means resulting in many problems to the people and whole society.</div>
              <div class="vb_postbit"><br></div>
              <div class="vb_postbit">They are not interested in serving the majority interests of the people in such areas but keep using their power to pass laws and give themselves more monies and more power.</div>
              <div class="vb_postbit"><br></div>
              <div class="vb_postbit">They have failed to see the bigger picture of nation building. Instead of bringing up a society with values like justice, equity, duty to serve
              the country, all that they are interested is to make money, money and more money for themselves and the
              government so that the government will be able to do anything it likes to serve its own interest and glory and
              its many hidden agenda. Many wrong doings like the Shin Corp and NKF remain unanswered. Civil servants are getting from bad to worse refusing to help people in need with more red tapes and bureaucracy. Many such examples of departments insisting on implementing unfair rules and regulations despite clearly deserving circumstances were recently given again and again to no end.<br> <br> All our leaders are interested in is to give themselves more salaries, many months of bonuses and power.<br> <br> They do not bother with lowering the costs of living affecting majority
              of citizens due to their wrongful increase of GST and fees under the wrong policy of taxing and avoiding spending on
              services and hoarding of such people's monies and claim success.<br> <br> We the citizens of Singapore therefore will have to check on such a government to stop their wrong doings and will have to stay united to uphold morality,
              justice, equity among the people and bring in new leaders who
              understand and practise such morality justice and equity which are the
              first principle of nation building long compromised.<br> <br> So to all immoral ministers this is another reminder, do not take people for granted. They are not that stupid.<br> <br> They can see the right and wrong in whatever they are doing. In the
              next cabinet reshuffle we would like to see new types of leaders for
              our onward nation building.<br> <br> Those who always give a false impression of talent or leadership by
              boast and false pretences will be exposed eventually by the people.
              Signs of such moral defects and falsehoods include constant talks about
              government success ignoring problems faced by people. Immoral increases
              using their power of their own salaries. Portraying an impression of
              their own talents which are not for them to judge but the people
              themselves as people pay their salaries and bonuses and give them the
              opportunity to serve the country not for them to become arrogant and
              demand respect for abuses and legal corruptions.<br> <br> Especially ministers who constantly about giving "no free lunch to
              others but easy taking of monies from the public for themselves" so as
              to keep increasing taxes, fees and make profits or hoard monies will be
              hated by the people. They should be shuffled out if PM Lee wants to do
              the right thing to correct the many big mistakes of his predecessors.</div>
