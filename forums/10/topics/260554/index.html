            <div class='col-md body'>Salaam,<br><br>A friend sent this to me and i wish to show to everyone here..<br><br><blockquote><br><br>LONDON - A father who ordered his daughter brutally slain for falling in love with the wrong man in a so-called "honor killing" was found guilty of murder on Monday.<br><br>Banaz Mahmod, 20, was strangled with a boot lace, stuffed into a suitcase and buried in a back garden.<br><br>Her death is the latest in an increasing trend of such killings in Britain, home to some 1.8 million Muslims. More than 100 homicides are under investigation as potential "honor killings."<br><br>Mahmod Mahmod, 52, and his brother Ari Mahmod, 51, planned the killing during a family meeting, prosecutors told the court. Two others have pleaded guilty in the case. Two more suspects have fled the country. Sentencing is expected later this month.<br><br>The men accused the young woman of shaming her family by ending an abusive arranged marriage, becoming too Westernized and falling in love with a man who didn't come from their Iraqi village. The Kurdish family came to Britain in 1998 when Banaz Mahmod was 11.<br><br>"She was my present, my future, my hope," said Rahmat Suleimani, 29, Banaz Mahmod's boyfriend.<br><br>During the three-month trial, prosecutors said Mahmod's father beat his daughter for using hairspray and adopting other Western ways. Her uncle once told her she would have been "turned to ashes" if she were his daughter and had shamed the family by becoming involved with the Iranian Kurd, her sister 22-year-old Bekhal Mahmod testified.<br><br>Banaz Mahmod ran away from home when she was a teenager but returned when her father sent her an audio tape in which he warned he would kill her sisters, her mother and himself if she did not come home, her sister said.<br><br>She was later hospitalized after her brother attacked her, the sister told the court. The brother said he had been paid by their father to finish her off but in the end was unable to do it, said the sister, who testified in a full black burqa. She said she still feared for her own life.<br><br>The years of Banaz Mahmod's abuse were compounded by police officers who repeatedly dismissed her cries for help.<br><br>She first went to police in December 2005, saying she suspected her uncle was trying to kill her and her boyfriend. She sent police a letter naming the men who she thought would later kill her.<br><br>On New Year's Eve, she was lured by her father to her grandmother's home, where she suspected he planned to attack her after he forced her to gulp down brandy and approached her while wearing gloves. She escaped by breaking a window and was treated at a hospital.<br><br>Police dismissed her suspicions, and one officer, who is under investigation, considered charging her with damages for breaking her grandmother's window.<br><br>Laying in her hospital bed after the escape, Mahmod recorded a dramatic video message saying she was "really scared."<br><br>The videotape, taken by her boyfriend at the hospital, was shown to the jury during the trial.<br><br>After she was released from the hospital, she returned home and tried to convince her family she had stopped seeing her boyfriend.<br><br>But friends told the family they spotted the couple together on Jan. 22, 2006.<br><br>Soon after, a group of men allegedly approached her boyfriend and tried to lure him into a car but he refused. It was that event that prompted Banaz Mahmod to go to police again. This time officers tried to persuade her to stay in a safe house. She refused, believing that her mother would protect her.<br><br>But her mother and father left her alone in the house the next day. Her boyfriend alerted police after time passed in which she failed to send him text messages.<br><br>Her body wasn't discovered until three months later after police tracked phone records.<br><br>Britain has seen more than 25 women killed by their Muslim relatives in the past decade for offenses they believed brought shame on the family. More than 100 other homicides are under investigation as potential honor killings.<br><br>Some Muslim communities in Britain practice Sharia, or strict Islamic law.<br><br>"We're seeing an increase around the world, due in part to the rise in Islamic fundamentalism," said Diana Nammi with the London-based Iranian and Kurdish Women's Rights Organization.<br><br></blockquote>Just wish to highlight that honour killin is not condoned in Islam.<br><br>It is a cultural thing.<br><br>Pls read below.<br><br><blockquote><br><br>Wa`alykum As-Salaamu Warahmatullahi Wabarakaatuh.<br><br>In the Name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful.<br><br>All praise and thanks are due to Allah, and peace and blessings be upon His Messenger.<br><br>Dear sister in Islam, we do really appreciate your question, which shows how far you are interested in getting yourself well-acquainted with the sound teachings of Islam. May Allah bless your efforts in pursuit of knowledge and may He keep us all firm in the straight path!<br><br>Sister, itÂ’s a well-known fact that Islam maintains the protection of life and does not sanction any violation against it. In the Glorious QurÂ’an, Allah, Most High, says, Â“Whoso slayeth a believer of set purpose, his reward is Hell for ever. Allah is wroth against him and He hath cursed him and prepared for him an awful doom.Â” (An-NisaÂ’: 93)<br><br>`Abdullah ibn Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him, reported that the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "The blood of a Muslim may not be legally spilt other than in one of three [instances]: the married person who commits adultery; a life for a life; and one who forsakes his religion and abandons the community." (Reported by Al-Bukhari and Muslim)<br><br>Focusing more on your question, Sheikh Ahmad Kutty, a senior lecturer and an Islamic scholar at the Islamic Institute of Toronto, Ontario, Canada, states:<br><br><span style="color: red;">There is no such concept in Islam that is called Â“honor killingÂ”. Islam holds every soul in high esteem and does not allow any transgression upon it. It does not allow people to take the law in their own hands and administer justice, because doing so will be leading to chaos and lawlessness. Therefore, based on this, Islam does not permit such killings. </span><br><br>First of all, in order to sanction killing, it must be through a binding verdict issued by an authoritative law court. Individuals themselves have no authority either to judge cases or pass judgments. Therefore, a Muslim should not sanction such killing because doing so will be leading to the rule of the law of the jungle. A civilized society cannot be run by such laws.Â”<br><br>Shedding more light on it, Sheikh `Atiyyah Saqr, former head of Al-Azhar Fatwa Committee, states:<br><br>Â“Like all other religions, Islam strictly prohibits murder and killing without legal justification. Allah, Most High, says, Â“Whoso slayeth a believer of set purpose, his reward is Hell for ever. Allah is wroth against him and He hath cursed him and prepared for him an awful doom.Â” (An-NisaÂ’: 93)<br><br>The so-called Â“honor killingÂ” is based on ignorance and disregard of morals and laws, which cannot be abolished except by disciplinary punishments.<br><br>It goes without saying that people are not entitled to take the law in their own hands, for itÂ’s the responsibility of the Muslim State and its concerned bodies to maintain peace, security, etc., and to prevent chaos and disorder from creeping into the Muslim society.Â”<br><br>Moreover, the eminent Muslim scholar, Sheikh Muhammad Al-Hanooti, member of the North American Fiqh Council, adds:<br><br>Â“In Islam, there is no place for unjustifiable killing. Even in case of capital punishment, only the government can apply the law through the judicial procedures. No one has the authority to execute the law other than the officers who are in charge.<br><br>Honor killing could be a wrong cultural tradition. It is unjust and inhumane action. The murderer of that type deserves punishment.Â”<br><br>Sister, if you are still in need of more information, don't hesitate to contact us. Do keep in touch. May Allah guide us all to the straight path!<br></blockquote>Just for your information.<br><br>http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar/FatwaE/FatwaE&amp;cid=1119503543392<br><br></div>
