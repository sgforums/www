              <p><em>"Two Straits Time forum letters raise the non-monetary aspects of the issue. For example, in the letter entitled “Tackle the problem, not the symptoms” published on 20 Aug, Mr Thomas Ling wondered aloud if the Government was “barking up the wrong tree regarding the issue of our falling population”.</em></p>
              <p><em>He said: “Our pursuit of economic excellence and rewards in the past 40 years has resulted in a new breed of young Singaporeans who hold different values about life”.</em></p>
              <p><em>I agree with him. Nowadays, Singaporeans are more individualistic and materialistic, no thanks in part to the rapidly increasing cost of living, over-crowding, the decrease in personal space, and the fast paced of life. And this is a global phenomenon, prevalent in the developed world. Look at Japan, for instance.</em></p>
              <p><em>Thomas Ling said: “While much of the blame has been pinned on our ‘Stop At Two’ policy in the 70s, the truth has to do with changing lifestyles rather than the success of that policy.”</em></p>
              <p><em>My take is that the ‘Stop At Two’ policy was shortsighted. It was not just a successful policy, but one that overshot its intended target. As a result, the decline in Singapore’s birth rate has been artificially accelerated over the years, and now the Government imports vast numbers of foreign talents in an attempt to make up the numbers."</em></p>
