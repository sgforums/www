As bear said.. not everyone is an engineer. And the funny thing is you can make such statement sounding like you are always right....<br><br>I think there are fields where you hire based or experiences and projects that you have done, e.g Advertising/ art design/modelling/acting/ IT  etc...<br><br>Usually a good portfolio beats qualification anytime. The person who hires based on qualification for these fields are simply inexperienced and naive.<br><br></div></blockquote>When I meant qualification, I also included the training given to that person on how he is taught to think. The process of getting a qualification in a university includes being taught a skill set that he is meant to apply to any field he is given. A qualification isn't just a piece of paper from a university you know.<br><br>Besides, companies look first at qualification then experience, unless you have ridiculously good reputation that precedes you already. Even for managing positions, MBAs look good on the record. Lots of executives, say in the top US companies have MBAs for that sole reason. Job Ads for higher positions always list the minimum and they always include a degree. Experience and what not is just to add icing to the cake.<br><br>Besides, just because I used engineers as examples doesn't mean this is limited to engineering. I know of psychology majors who end up doing HR work and marketing since they are trained to know how humans think and look out for trends in human behaviour.<br><br>And by the way, a person trained in an acting school on average acts much better than the trash that Hollywood occasionally grabs.  And even for advertising jobs, you are likely to get some arts major which specialises in drawing jobs unless you are some genius at art, which is hard to come by. As for modeling, that's a bit of ridiculous comparison isn't it? How many people are born with good looks?</div>

What you choose to study at college and what you ultimately decide to do for a living are two seperate entities altogether - while you could choose to study something that prepares you for a career in that field, you're not obliged to do so. Herein lies the paradox : what happens if you choose to pursue a career in a field unrelated to your area of specialisation?<br><br>Truth be told, degrees in the relevant discipline really aren't that sought after if you were to consider the practices of many of the developed nations ( I must stress this approach does not extend to include industries requiring professional certification like law, medicine and engineering ). One of the reasons why the finance industry proves so appealing ( besides the financial lure ) to all and sundry stems from the fact that most of the world's top financial institutions would actually - and quite readily - hire graduates from across a vast array of disciplines for numerous positions.<br><br>In truth, I think that has served them pretty well considering what such firms need are human beings equipped with the skills to analyse, think and make rational decisions ( known to many in such industries as "life skills" ), rather than a machine with a photographic memory capable of regurgitating knowledge/facts. In that sense, successful applicants for such jobs are deemed - at least, in the eyes of the employer - to have acquired sufficient skills to make these decisions in school ( while one may further contend that it isn't realistic to restrict such employment opportunities to college graduates, they unfortunately have to use some sort of benchmark to determine if you've been schooled sufficiently and competently to have acquired a reasonable grasp of life skills ). At the end of the day, that's what most employers care about.<br><br>Of course the abovementioned wouldn't apply to someone without a degree in a relevant field wanting to work as a doctor/lawyer/engineer/accountant...</div>

While you could self-learn the rotes of the trade on your own, you can only practise as an engineer if you're certified/accredited by the body that governs your particular specialised profession (if applicable) - that, in truth, is how things work for every industry that requires professionals (ie.people without accreditation are not recognised in that industry). In our case (assuming you and I decide to become practising engineers in Singapore), we - through our degrees - are accredited by the PEB (Singapore) to do that job. That is what seperates us from those who aspire to be an engineer - and may even be more knowledgeable than us - but do not have the qualifications to allow them to practise the trade by PEB (http://www.peb.gov.sg/peb/html/index.html).<br><br>What I'm trying to say is, if your alternative career is not a job that requires professional qualifications and accreditations, you're absolutely not disadvantaged just because you decide to work in a field that is unrelated to your studies...<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>After some thought i realized what i want to say abt singapore education system.<br><br>For primary and secondary school and JC, it does not charge alot so it is quite efficent thing.<br><br>For university and polytechnic, it charges alot for lecture fees. Lecture mainly teaches theory stuff and it brings alot of revenue to the university. Profits for university is good for university but bad for students becos if u calculate the lecture fees, it is going to cost a lot.<br><br>The point is this, lecture notes can be disseminated easily and people who are willing to read it will learn about it without the lecturer and save a lot of money.<br><br>Saving money is good news for students and it will leave us less debt when we enter the working world. This is precisely what i think the education system is not efficient enough.<br><br>The education system should allow self learning for theory part and hence allow students to save more money. This is not happening in singapore or other countries but lets leave out other countries for this discussion.<br><br>Usage of software and sophisticated computers, lab equipment, administration cost of setting test and project are hard to self learn so its fair that university charge student a certain amount of money.<br><br>As i have said, if my suggestion is implementated, the university/or polytechnic will has a great loss in revenue.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>this is precisely what lectures are about. there's too much to teach to squeeze everything into a few hours a week. the notes the lecturers give you should only consist of 10% of the curriculum, the remainder you have to learn using your own initiative, and when you're stumped, then you approach the lecturers for advice, that is their role, to advice, not to spoonfeed.<br><br>the students who aren't able to come up with the remaining 90% themselves, should not deserve to pass. IMO, that is the problem with singapore's education, as well as many other universities all over the world.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>this is for china situation from straits time may 10<br><br>Jobs are scare for millions of grads who lack skills needed in booming economy<br><br>much of the blame for the graduate glut has been directed at chinese universities that are enrolling students to profit from rising number of families.<br><br>"Most of what we are taught in school is useless after graduation. We have to learn a lot in society by ourselves and try hard to survive," said Mr Gao Jian, whose financial diploma earned last year from Bejing University was not enough to land him a job.<br><br>Mr Liu Haifeng, a recrutier for an electronics company said, "Students come out of college with a degree but not much else. The only real solution is to reform our education system to ....."<br><br><strong>I am not saying that Singapore university is like that also</strong> but i feel that singapore graduate has been shortchanged. Learning is a fine thing, so i have no complain whatsoever about every word i read for my 4 year course but to be charged such a high price, i think the university has to truly make its student become smart people who will be successful in their life and work.<br><br></div>
