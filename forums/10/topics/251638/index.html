Read some research in my ex-company by some Headhunter company previously. It said that most people will only know which career they truely want after trying 3 different ones, OR generally between age 28-33. However they are making alot of assumptions, which I can;t recall.<br><br>Moreover there is this family commitment issue. Even if you dun like the particular industry u'r in, u may not take action on your part to change it, unless something like retrenchment happens.<br><br>Also, the argument on 'comfort zone' Example After 3-4 years in studying say engineering, one might be comfortable to change to business.<br><br>Also, the 'qualifications' argument. Certain industry requires qualification that one need to obtain before he can join. It will be difficult for a engineer to go into accounting, and a lawyer to be a doctor.<br><br>Bottomline is we ourselves wun know what we wanna do in future. Most are unable to see himself/herself 20-30 years down the road.<br><br>Had a friend now 56 who worked all his life for a engineering firm. He was a head trainer and head QC in the company, but was retrenched at 53. He joined Dennis Wee then. Now doing relatively well. Just bought the new camry.<br><br>Another friend, studied IT, work in IT firm for a few years, now quite sick of it due to the long hours, smelly collegues (YES! He said his collegues ALWAYS never bath!!). But he can't leave unless he find another similar level paying job cos of his HDB, car and soon coming kid.<br><br>However, at the end of the day, it's not really a "problem" like u mentioned in ur 2nd paragraph, on wasting resources. Several companies I know of nowadays are headhunting for people trained in different industry, as they think differently, hence a "fresh" view on things that currently employees may miss out.<br><br>A example last year, one of our local bank started a scheme to encourage this. They got a senior teacher and a senior engineer to come into the bank as a AVP position because of different views/thinking patterns, hence potential improvements in processes.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>One question...<br><br><blockquote>we may study a field but end up learning another new one when we work</blockquote>Will the new one be related to the field you studied or totally unrelated or perhaps partially related?<br>______________________________________________________________<br><br>The working world is not just restricted to degrees. What qualifications you need will solely depend on your field. Generally, in Singapore, a degree is what you need. If you intend to work overseas, then the answer is no. Particularly if you are in very technical fields such as information technology or engineering. These fields have exams to take, of which they are not easy to pass. On average, one needs at least 75% to pass them. The more specialized the field is, the higher the expectations.<br><br>As per usual, nothing in this world is ever absolute. What you learn today, may change tomorrow. Pluto has long been regarded as a planet (granted, it's been disputed, but most textbooks put it as a planet, we shall take it as it is), and now Pluto is no longer a planet.<br><br>Since nothing is ever absolute, then it creates problems. I studied this today, I have to study something else tomorrow. But the basic principles still remains. Take for example genetics. No matter how much it changes, no matter what discoveries we make, the four bases will still be ATCG (adenine, thymine, cytosine and guanine). ATCG forms the basis for genes.<br><br>The only way is to learn. Not learn to cope, but to relearn. As long as the basics doesn't change (not that they are absolute), the advanced topics will be built on top of these basics. How things shouldn't be important. More importantly, how you want to deal with it.<br><br>No point having the government to lay out the ground rules and forcing you, neither does changing the entire education system helps. Learning should come from motivation, not cold hard rules. Our government has implemented 6 years of compulsory education to improve literacy of the population, but that doesn't mean that all of them will bother to learn. Rules will be rules, whatever that goes will depend on the person himself/herself.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think that the education system in the sense of primary school and secondary school shouldn't be turned into factories where kids have to master everything that the ministry dictates. I think that the school is a place for one to learn to appreciate things in life, learn how to to learn.<br><br>Whereas in polytechnics where students are more specialized, this is where they are equipped with technical know-how about their field of study so that when they graduate, they are ready for the industry.</div>

If you have read it enough, the ideas will be understood. If you do not read it enough, no matter how creative you are, you will not be able to answer the question.<br><br>In projects, there is more creativity involve but not that much as to i will become a creative person.</div>

As bear said.. not everyone is an engineer. And the funny thing is you can make such statement sounding like you are always right....<br><br>I think there are fields where you hire based or experiences and projects that you have done, e.g Advertising/ art design/modelling/acting/ IT  etc...<br><br>Usually a good portfolio beats qualification anytime. The person who hires based on qualification for these fields are simply inexperienced and naive.<br><br></div>

I've seen companies hiring such people, and seen people with qualifications doing things that endanger the whole company or putting people's lives in danger. Those people with experience but no qualifications do things the proper way. Then there are those who have qualifications who do things the other way round. Manual says one, they do the other way round and can't get things to work, wasting time troubleshooting and sending them for repairs because an electricity surge killed the devices.<br><br>As long as what one studies and what one experiences is partially related, I don't see how they can't jump over to another sector. The biotechnology sector is huge, and is not just limited to biology alone.<br><br>As one goes up higher in education, the lines between the different subjects blur. Maths at primary school level is just Maths, but once they move up to polytechnic levels and study engineering or computers, it's no longer Maths, it's about Science, engineering and logic.</div>
