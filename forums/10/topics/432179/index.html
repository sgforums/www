              <p><strong>Now that Cheongsam-wearing Lim Hwee Hua is practicing her tai-chi outside of Parliament, we have a wider government role in transport.<br></strong></p>
              <p><strong>More rides ahead for commuters</strong></p>
              <p>SINGAPORE - The Government could take the lead in adding greater
                      capacity to the transport system, rather than leaving it solely to the
                      operators. <br><br> Speaking at the start of tunnelling work for
                      Downtown Line 2 (DTL2) at the Beauty World Station, Transport Minister
                      Lui Tuck Yew signalled that there could be a <strong>change in the Government's
                      approach</strong>. <br><br> Said Mr Lui: <strong>"My feel is that ... we probably are
                      adding capacity for trains and buses not ahead of demand, maybe not
                      even in tandem with demand.</strong> If left to the operators alone,<strong> I think
                      they will take a relatively cautious and gradual process."</strong><br><br> With
                      the Government's involvement, "we can inject capacity in a very timely
                      fashion - particularly over the next three to four years - before we
                      see the materialisation of Downtown Lines 2 and 3 and future projects",
                      said Mr Lui. <br><br> Ramping up the capacity for buses, in
                      particular, is high on his to-do list, as Mr Lui noted that rail
                      projects have "very long" gestation periods, given the complexities
                      involved.<br><br> Mr Lui, who took on the portfolio following the
                      unveiling of the new Cabinet less than three weeks ago, pledged that
                      the Government will work more closely with operators to address
                      bottlenecks in the transportation network.<br><br> <strong>Mr Lui said there
                      could be social costs if the capacity of the public transport system is
                      boosted.</strong> <strong>&lt;what does he mean by that?&gt;</strong> A speedy measure to alleviate transportation woes could
                      include empty buses mid-stream on certain routes, said Mr Lui. <br><br> Mr Lui, whose frequent journeys on buses and MRT trains had been caught
                      on camera and uploaded on the Internet, recalled that two Fridays ago,
                      he tried to take a bus during the evening peak hour from the PSA
                      Building.<br><br> A very crowded double-decker went by. The next bus, a single-decker, was also very crowded, and he could not board.<br><br> "I decided ... to go to HarbourFront, took the North-East Line, went to
                      Dhoby Ghaut, took the Circle Line and reached Dakota where I wanted to
                      go to," he said.<br><br> Mr Lui also suggested that more extensive data
                      mining from ez-link cards, so that commuters can know if a bus is full
                      or whether seats are available. <br><br> "As a commuter, I would want
                      to know when the bus is coming ... if I can get onto the bus, and
                      whether I can find a seat. We will work with the operators and find
                      ways to make this information available and then you can make a more
                      informed decision," he said. <br><br> Mr Lui also disclosed that the public transport operators have yet to submit any proposals for an increase in fares. <br><br> The Public Transport Council has said earlier that adjustments, if any,
                      will come into effect at a later date - to coincide with the opening of
                      the last stage of the Circle Line this October.</p>

              <p>Tunnelling
                      work for the Downtown Line 2 (DTL2) of the Mass Rapid Transit system
                      started yesterday at Beauty World Station - another significant
                      milestone in the construction of the underground line, according to the
                      Land Transport Authority (LTA).<br><br> Two tunnel-boring machines will
                      carve out the 1km stretch from the Beauty World Station to the King
                      Albert Park Station as part of the tunnelling process for the 16.6km
                      DTL2. It will take about 18 months for work to be completed, with 19
                      machines being used concurrently at different locations.<br><br> The
                      LTA said the tunnelling will be one of the most challenging phases in
                      the construction of DTL2, due to the varied ground conditions.<br><br> When the line is completed, likely by 2015, it will give commuters
                      greater accessibility to Bukit Timah and the city as well as the rest
                      of the island. With connections to existing rail networks through three
                      interchange stations, DTL2 is expected to improve travel time by up to
                      30 per cent. Saifulbahri Ismail</p>

              What the public want is to bring down the transport fares?   Can the new minister do that?  I would suggest to open the bus service system ie one own by govt and the other run by private companies.  Govt own bus service should subsidised the fares and be non-aircon.  Such services should cover the whole of Singapore.
              The private bus services can charge any fares  they like and run parallel to the govt bus services.   Therefore, members of the public have a choice, to take govt bus service or the private once.  If you can afford than take the private bus services.

              <p>I have a feeling that the so-called add public transport capacity is to take away most of the seats in the buses,so that no matter u are locals or foreigners,young or old,healthy or unhealthy,men or women,handicapped or not,will all be "penalised" to stand throughout the bus journey.Just like what the PAP government did to MRT some yrs ago.</p>

              <p>I have a feeling that the so-called add public transport capacity is to take away most of the seats in the buses,so that no matter u are locals or foreigners,young or old,healthy or unhealthy,men or women,handicapped or not,will all be "penalised" to stand throughout the bus journey.Just like what the PAP government did to MRT some yrs ago.</p>
              <p>Oh well,this is the so-called PAP elites way of solving problems.....without using their fuking brains.</p>

              <p>As for bus, licensed capacity is 80 as like e older single deck. Only thing, in reality it can carry less now.</p>

              <p>I think there's no pt explaining to ppl in SC further actually</p>
              <p>The bus is still 12m, as like the older single deck. But in order to make it stepless and wheelchair friendly, the configuration would do nothing but compromise the no of seats available.</p>
              <p>The older single deck being stepped and flushed with the engine at the rear or middle allows maximum no of seats being installed.</p>
