              <p>Have u consider old man who are not physically well,have u consider pregnant women who are not convenient?Actually,when i saw those working commuters dont give up seats for old man,i dont blame them,coz they are also tired after a long day work.Even if they were youngsters,coz i also feel tired n needed a seat after a long day work.The main culprit is the PAP government who take away too many seats in the buses n MRT.Otherwise,we would have enough seats for normal commuters,old man n pregnant women.</p>
              <p>Besides,many wheelchair ppl travel by taxi coz its more convenient for them.I seldom see wheelchair ppl travelling MRT or buses,so why the hell do the bus company wanna take away so many seats?Pure dumb,like u sir!!!!</p>
              <p>And we are not like other PAP ministers,or LKY,LHL n boot licker GCT who have cars or even chauffers to drive them to work n off work.They are too rich n isolated themselves n hide inside their "Palace" for too long.They no longer able to communicate n understand common Singaporeans anymore.</p>

                  Worse is that infrastructure capacities can't meet the demand, can't allow Singaporeans to lead a comfortable lifestyle. I rather the population to stay at 5 million for the next 30 years but with increased infrastructure capacities.

                  I think Singaporeans should stand up and stand against the increase of population in future. Stop increasing the population if the infrastructures capabilities are unable to give Singaporeans a comfortable lifestyle. 
                  Singapore should also look into building multi-tier roads to cater for more vehicles, just like multi storey HDB flats for housing problems. And build guided bus lanes or BRT solely for public buses for faster, more efficient and flexible operations.
                  No wonder Singaporeans do not feel a sense of home in Singapore anymore because basically they almost own nothing here, no land; HDB flats is no under their own name forever and is only regarded as a lease from HDB. If they can't even own a car, then where is a sense of belongng here then?
                  Moreover, who wants to take public transport everytime when they go out with their family outings? A family car is a better and more conducive environment to foster family relationships than a crowded public transport where they can be seperated from each other in a crowded cabin or can't even talk private things, eat and laugh openly, etc.
                  It is all right to use public transport to work everyday but not for my family gatherings.
