              <p>I agree with the better environment in a car etc. etc. as already said....... but I think that owning a car is a luxury. If you want something comfortable, nice and luxurious, then be prepared to pay for it. It shouldn't be taken for granted.</p>
              <p>So in order to reduce the number of cars on the road, traffic problems, reduce emissions - the government can make owning a car more expensive. At the same time, they should also improve the public transport system (which i think is pretty good already) to ensure access to more areas around the country. That way, the people aren't restricted from visiting places that are normally mainly accessible only by a car.  </p>

              <p>On many occasion when i take buses,the bus drivers will not only drive slowly but will stop at every single bus stop,even when there is no commuters at the bus stop.</p>
              <p>I remember on one occasion,the bus driver stop at an empty bus stop,open the door n wait for awhile,then close it n then continue the journey.I know the bus driver did this just to meet the stupid time schedule on time.There was a few Caucasian teenage gals on the bus too,after seeing all this,they were like "What the fuk"???? on their face.</p>
              <p>Haha,i know how they feel,they must be thinking that the bus driver was seeing "ghost",thats why he stop at an empty bus stop n open the door to let the "ghost" come in.LOL!!!!!</p>
              <p>You know,sometimes,i think its a good thing to let the PAP government bring in so many foreigners.So that when they return to their countries,they can gossip at how stupid Singapore n our PAP government are.(P.S.Although i hold Singapore IC,i no longer consider myself Singaporean.I am a democrats,an elite,i hold IC n stay in here just to earn money only,i have no obligation to this stupid country.)</p>

              <p>We cry foul in crowded and stuffy trains, and i was thinking the trains are now going on strike too. Have we added trains since since 20 years ago? new trains are only coming in end of this year and we commuters have to tolerate the crowdedness as the population boomed. Someone rightly pointed out that the infrastructure is not adequate, and i totally agree.</p>
              <p><br>But how did it come to this state. our 20 yr old trains are running so many more times a day now and i pray the one that i'm taking don't break down every morning. i use to think the train operators are laughing to the bank. but now, i think they and lta/gov(votes related) are worried that one day the whole transport system will just say, " i retire". Then we will really be a world class laughing stock.</p>
              <p>lets see if the new trains coming in will solve capacity problems.</p>
              <p>If the train operators are not releasing enough trains to solve capacity problems and are just saving costs, slap them. but if there are no more trains available, not even for maintenance, and there are still people on the platforms, slap our policy makers.</p>
