              <p><strong>Dear friends and countrymen,</strong><br><br>I am a Singaporean living and
                      working in western Europe. I graduated from the UK in 98 and headed
                      home(SG) to start my career.</p>
              <p>However, by 99 I decided to return to
                      Europe after a year in a country that favour "foreign talents"(FT) at
                      the expense of local boys.</p>
              <p>Most of my friends were having a hard time
                      looking for jobs after graduation, with the economic downturn of the
                      97-99, and an influx of foreigner working for local terms. We homeboys
                      were really at a disadvantage.</p>
              <p>Given the same age group, Local boys
                      have 3 years less work exp. due to NS. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>We also may be recall for
                      reservist activities while FT will never be. From an employers' point
                      of view if I am to employ on local terms the choice is a no-brainer.</strong></span><br><br>Coming
                      to Europe, I got a job doing export sales. Given that I am a Singapore
                      Chinese my language skills (English, Mandarin, Cantonese and Hokkien)
                      made me a "foreign talent" in Europe.</p>
              <p>Now I have also mastered the
                      local language. I am assign to the East Asia market and my dialect was
                      a great help. It allow me to network with business people within these
                      2 dialect very well.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>In Singapore I am just an AhBeng with a degree.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p>But out here I feel appreciated and treated as an equal.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>My wife who is
                      European gets better treatment in Singapore than me.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p>All those talks
                      about rasism in Europe or USA you get in Straits time is only to scare
                      people from venturing out. There maybe rasism in Europe, but nothing is
                      worse than been discriminated in your own country.<br><br>Even though I
                      could have taken up citizenship here 6 years ago, I am still proud to
                      remain Singaporean. I believe that one day there will be real changes
                      and Singaporean can really feel that they truly have a say in their
                      country and have real ownership over it (just like my father shouting
                      Medaka with LKY at the padang all those years ago, feeling proud to be
                      the first generation of Singaporean).<br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br><span style="color: #0000ff;">I am lucky to be able to
                      learn dialects from my parents and refine my Hokkien during NS when I
                      am assign to the Hokkien platoon. I know alot of chinese friends that
                      can hardly speak mandarin or indian friends that can't speak Hindi. </span></strong></span></p>
              <p>Now
                      with both India and China the new Asia Economic power, they regret not
                      learning their dialects as <span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>it was not a cool thing to speak them back
                      in the 70s and 80s. </strong></span></span><br><br>My advise to Singaporean is</p>
              <p>1. start standing up and ask question. It is our country and I believe that everyone should have a say.</p>
              <p>2.
                      Opposing a government or a political party in a country don't make one
                      unpatriotic. The ruling party is only a steward of the country acting
                      for the best interest of the people.</p>
              <p>3. We should be grateful that
                      there are dissidents from Singapore. At least there are some people
                      that love Singapore enough to dare make a differences.<br><br>Sadly our steward has crown themselves King and the people's interest are just a figment of their imagination.<br><br><strong>Ah Beng from Europe</strong></p>

              <p>I always wondered why this was so.</p>
              <p>I never understood why dialect chinese's own language must be suppressed in their own country and have an alien language imposed.</p>
              <p>I know the reason now.</p>
              <p>Those who don't know the history of Singapore and the politics of Singapore in 1950s can never understand why dialects are suppressed and alien language imposed.</p>
              <p>The key to everything lies with lky. It lies with what lky really is.</p>
              <p>But I cannot stay too long on this topic, because if I do, I will start to have evil thoughts again on lky.</p>

              <p>As Govt foreseen China to be the next economy powerhouse, Govt said we must learn Chinese and even higher chinese so that we can communicate better with PRC peoples in near future.</p>
              <p>But when i go China to do business with Chingtao beer company, the Chinese there talk to me in American English, they are learning English and higher English....something is very wrong leh. They even asked me to speak English to them, so that they can learn, but you know my English lah, half past six one....so, learn English or Chinese??? Are we in the right direction??</p>

              You see Singapore is not like any other countries or most democratic countries...TS needs to understand that Singapore govt doesn't even respect the state constitution...what you have in Singapore is a familee run regime much like North Korea the difference is the North Korea being a communist state while Singapore is bordering on fascism. The familee wealth is in billions and not to mention they control Singapore sovereign funds in hundred of billions....and it's not surprising they would want to stay in power for eternity . . .
                                <br><br>
              A very sad situation is happening in Singapore....and they talked about copying themselves into other countries . . .these people are cankerous blight to the region. Do you think they would allow their neighboring countries to adopt just democracy that could further jeopardize their position among their own citizen who would demand the same???  lky's Singapore must go for democracy to grow in South East Asia.

              <p>Interesting to see a self proclaimed ah beng with money from his non-elite parents affording an education in the united kingdom. Interesting to know that our country has no place for him but has place for local grads.</p>
