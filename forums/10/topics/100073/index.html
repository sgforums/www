            <div class='col-md body'>Quoted from a comic character,Anarky and a book Universe<br><br>Lesson 1<br>They lied to us. They told us the evolution of human consciousness was a long,slow affair that began 2 million years ago and is still going on.But it didn't, and its not.Until about 1000 BC,almost all human beings lived unconscious lives.They built cities,traded, even developed language and hieroglyphics. But they were little more than highly intelligent animals guided by strong impressions or "voices" in the right hemisphere of the brain. They weren't deceitful, they knew no guilt, and they weren't responsible for their actions. 3000 years ago, as societies became  increasingly complex, they system began to break down. As civilizations collapsed, consciousness was "invented" as a tool for survival. Consciousness is the ability to think in metaphors and analog models--to introspect. For the first time man could become his own adviser,teacher and guru. His own god. Out of the ruins rose a golden age--from Confucius in China to Socrates in Greece. But within a few hundred years that flowering was choked out by a greedy elite. Thinking is hard and requires effort. But mankind missed the easy life, and yearned for its lost "voices." Politicians, priests and philosophers leapt to fill the gap.<br><br>Lesson 2<br>Shortly after man invented consciousness to survive in the collapsing unconscious world, the golden age of classical greece provided the foundations for all civilization for the next 2000 years. Aristole believed that man is basically good, decent and noble. If left to his own devices he will seek individual happiness within an orderly society. For Aristole, human life and sovereign consciousness were the universe's greatest values. But Plato believed man is a wild and savage beast, incapable of self discipline. To manage him for his own best ends, man needs rulers--kings,governments,priests,presidents. For Plato, human life is worthless, to be sacrificed to "higher" causes and ideals. Which one do you think the world followed?<br><br>Lesson 3<br>In harsh economics terms, there are only two kinds of people in the world. Those who produce goods, services and values-- and those who don't. And before you say what about the old, the young and the the sick-- We look after them, right? That's what makes us human. <strong>Intentional</strong> non-producers are <strong>parasites</strong>. To hide their parasitism, they employ the techniques of deception,coercion and naked force. Parasites can never create. They can only destroy. Today, for the first time in history, the parasites outnumber the producers that support them. They're entering a final feeding frenzy, which will result in the ultinate evil--a totalitarian state.<br><br>Lesson 4<br>Irrationality cripples the conscious mind. For all recorded history, the elites have used that fact to blind, hypnotize and manipulate the common man. They feed him a diet of Lies, Hardship and War while they feast like leeches on the fruit of his labor.<br><br>The Elites have always won. The common man has always lost. Fact or Fiction? You decide!</div>
