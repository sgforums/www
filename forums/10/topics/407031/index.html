              <p>Are you seeing this Government? We agree plus understand their roles here but we are just unhappy. How to Balance the need and our Happiness?</p>
              <p>While most <strong>Singaporeans understand</strong> the need for the government to bring in foreigners to boost the economy, many have concerns about their long-term impact, says a new survey.</p>
              <p>According to a poll of over 2,000 citizens aged between 21 and 64 conducted last year by the Institute of Policy Studies (IPS), two out of three respondents felt that national unity would be compromised by the presence of foreigners, regardless whether they were here to settle down or were transient workers.</p>
              <p>The survey involved face-to-face interviews conducted between February and May last year. This National Orientations of Singapore (NOS) survey has been done roughly every five years since 1993.</p>
              <p>Over 60 per cent of respondents felt “the policy to attract more foreign talent will weaken Singaporeans’ feelings as ‘one nation, one people’”, a significant increase from the 38 per cent of respondents who felt the same way in 1998, when the survey question was last posed.</p>
              <p>Most of those <strong>concerned </strong>about the influx of foreigners were low-income earners making less than S$2,000 a month, and those living in one-, two- or three-room flats.</p>
              <p>Despite this, when asked if the government was right to increase the number of foreign workers to support the Singapore economy, two out of three respondents said “yes”.</p>
              <p>Sociologist Tan Ern Ser, one of the study’s authors, told The Straits Times the contradiction was a result of Singaporeans making a distinction between how they are affected as individuals and a collective.</p>
              <p>“As citizens and employees, we may have a somewhat negative orientation towards having an influx of foreigners, but as investors and consumers, we may be more welcoming of them,” said the associate professor at the National University of Singapore.</p>
              <p>“I reckon Singaporeans would resolve this contradiction by taking the stand that we understand the need for bringing in foreigners, but they must not be allowed to threaten my job, my space, my comfort zone, my sense of security and the Singaporean way of life. Should these threats remain, we would expect some degree of tension to prevail,” he adds.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans want more say in policy-making</p>
              <p>In addition, the IPS poll also reveals that Singaporeans want to have more say and involvement in policy-making compared to 12 years ago.</p>
              <p>But when it came to actually making their views on public policy issues known to the government, just 8 per cent actually did so.</p>
              <p>The survey found over 85 per cent of respondents agreed or strongly agreed that “voting gave citizens the most meaningful way in which to tell the Government how the country should be run.” This was an increase from 72 per cent in 1998.</p>
              <p>Political observer Eugene Tan of Singapore Management University (SMU), told the same paper that the trend pointed to an active citizenry and suggested that Singaporeans increasingly expect to be consulted on major policy matters.</p>
              <p>“It means that the ‘we know more than thou’ approach in policymaking is out of sync with (their) aspirations. Singaporeans want to be ‘talked with’ and not ‘talked to’ by the government,” Mr Tan said.</p>
              <p>National loyalty ‘at healthy level’</p>
              <p>The findings on political participation aside, the survey also found that the level of national loyalty and pride inched up and was at a “healthy and stable” level.</p>
              <p>But the sense of loyalty and pride was considerable weaker among the more educated, higher-income groups, the young and the politically alienated.</p>
              <p>The study’s authors — IPS senior research fellow Gillian Koh was the other — suggested that this was because those who were more highly educated and better off were more likely to be widely travelled, and so more exposed to the cultures of other countries.</p>
              <p><strong>With increasing concerns about foreign workers, national loyalty and a growing number of Singaporeans wanting a greater say in the political process, the IPS survey results are providing an interesting backdrop for the upcoming General Elections.</strong></p>

              <p>Saying unhappy or happy is not the issue here, cos foreigners really do help us in a way to support our aging population and also our diminishing labour force. The key word here is therefore, excessive, is there an excessive influx of foreigners do to other motives beside helping the economy and boosting the population. Motives such as more tax collection from foreigners, more spending and thereby more Gst and fares to collect from and so on.</p>
              <p>Govt therefore have to be true to the citizen, if it is for the real sake of economy and giving citizenship to real potential one just to make up our diminshing population, I think we should be happy about it. But if its for the govt to make more money out of foreigner at the expense of unease among the citizens here, then that will be very sorrow and unhappy</p>
