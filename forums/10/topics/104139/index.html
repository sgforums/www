            <div class='col-md body'>Some possible contributing factors for falling birth rate:<br><br>1. rising cost of living<br>- this includes cost of raising children including education, esp at the tertiary level.<br><br>2. fall in average income, less job security etc.<br><br>3. general uneasiness with regards to our future.<br><br>4. people have no time to look after children(too busy working)<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Perhaps you would like to take a trip into the past and see why birthrate use to be high.<br><br>In the old days, technology is backward, no phones, no internet, no TV, no nothing. The sun sets, there is no light, everyone goes home, there is nothing to do, so . . . . . . .<br><br>In the old days, people gets married whenever they are fertile, though arranged marriage mostly. You have a husband/wife, what do you do? Well, do what a couple is suppose to do of course!<br><br>And to the modern times,<br><br>With good technology, you can work round the clock. Even if you don't work, there is so much entertainment. So, bed time activities reduces<br><br>We are freedom of love now, everyone loves it. But unfortunately, Ying Yuan does not seems to happen to everyone. For some, it even happens so late, that by the time it comes, the ladies are no longer fertile or can only bear one or two babies, unlike the olden times. My grandparents each has 10 childrens!!!<br><br>Also, in the old days, having a family is something natural, everyone will have it. In modern times, people starts to question why they even need to get married and have a family, especially among the well educated.<br><br>So, where is the problem? You decide.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I guess its more because of the higher living costs and different social trends.<br><br>More women nowadays choose to pursue their own career as compared to perhaps 30 years back. They tend to marry late or put off having children as they do not want to be bogged down with staying at home to take care of the kids. Same goes for the men. After uni, its 25 years old. another 3 years of working before getting married? And another 2 or 3 years before deciding to start a family?<br><br>Huge work load, high social aspirations... Of course... a lower birth rate...</div>
