For SG kids, we seem to be sheltering them a lot. Look at the recent fusses about schools. Lets not forget the incident about principal leaving cause tapped book on student's head?<br><br>It is feasible to move out i guess, but who, unless they are truly very independent, or dislike their parents very much so, would want to move out and start a new life ahead, alone?<br><br>Hmm, i think we've always been brought up depending on someone. I for sure, am definately not independent enough to want to move out so quick, and that's speaking from an average chinese family.</div></blockquote>this post reminds me of the kid who never wiped his own arse till he was 13<br><br>anyway about sheltering our kids, i recently visited my old neighbourhood for a game of soccer, and i noticed that the swings are all gone, only left the stands, my first thought was "all broken?"<br>then i remembered what broken swings looked like when i was a kid<br>and i also remember that some dipshi.t parent wrote to the papers to complain about swings being dangerous and that they should be taken off<br>why can't these parents just lock up their kids or something, wouldn't that be safer?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think those who dun wanna have kids are just trying to piss the govt off in a way. All these years of paying for ERPs, COEs, GST, Income Taxes and 'One Party rules all' have made them bitter. High stress levels, poor economy also make them du lan liao.<br><br>By not giving birth to more babies, they wouldn't be providing further tax revenues to oil the MIW's machinery in years to come.</div>
