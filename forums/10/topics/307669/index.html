              <p>Growth Dividends for S'poreans</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;"><span>SINGAPORE: The
              government is to give Growth Dividends to all adult Singaporeans, to be
              paid out in two instalments in April and October this year. <br> <br> This was announced by Finance Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam in his Budget Statement on Friday.
              <br> <br> A lower-income Singaporean living in a three-room HDB flat or smaller,
              will receive a Growth Dividend of $400. This is on top of the $250 in
              GST Credits that he will be getting this year.
              <br> <br>The majority of Singaporeans, who live in other HDB flats and do
              not have high incomes, will receive a Growth Dividend of $300 (on top
              of $200 in GST Credits that he will get this year).
              <br> <br>Older Singaporeans, those aged 60 and above, will get more. Most
              older Singaporeans will receive one and a half times what other
              Singaporeans will receive.
              <br> <br> Those with annual incomes more than $100,000 will receive a Growth Dividend of $100.
              <br> <br>Those who have served and are currently serving national service
              will get an additional $100 of Growth Dividends, to recognise their
              contributions to the nation.
              <br> <br> As before, Singaporeans can donate their Growth Dividends to charity.
              <br> <br> The Growth Dividends will cost the government $865 million this year.

              <p>Just to share a story I recently heard... A story of a female malay security guard with 5 children and no husband. She has to work 12 hrs a day as a security guard for a particular condo just to manage to make ends meet. 8 hrs of work are not sufficient. In addition, she handles the laundry. She has tried CDC, FDS and even Mendaki. The help that CDC and FDS provided was too little (I'm not sure how much though, but she has 5 children). For Mendaki, the only help they could offer is free tuition for her children; but the travel distance, time and fare for her children to go to the Mendaki students is too much. I sincerely admire her for her courage and determination to survive and work for her children to be able to go to school.</p>

              Mendaki. The help that CDC and FDS provided was too little (I'm not
              sure how much though, but she has 5 children). For Mendaki, the
              only help they could offer is free tuition for her children; but
              the travel distance, time and fare for her children to go to the
              Mendaki students is too much. I sincerely admire her for her
              courage and determination to survive and work for her children to
              be able to go to school.</p>

              <p>Must also understand economics and have some common sense too, then can calculate.</p>
              <p>But the question is, are the poor helped enough? Are help really that accessible to them very readily? How about rare but existing cases like the one I mentioned?</p>
              <p>Finally, to everyone who also want to state that not much help is given to the poor, have you ever done anything to help when possible? Even something as little as donation of a dollar a month counts.</p>

              <p>what about next year ? ... and the years after ? .... so they threw a few months worth of GST moolah back at us, does it really help ? .... it's like being robbed of your car in johor and the carjackers leaving you 20 ringgit to take a teksi back to the causeway isn't it ? .... it doesn't change the fact that the goverment will be making money out of the tax raise ... kind of reminds you of the self-granted pay-rise of somebody a little while ago (which was pledged to charity) ... and another self-increment a little while later eh ? .... isn't the long term net effect the same ? ...</p>
              <p>giving a few months' worth of taxes back doesn't change the fact that life got a little harder for everyone, particularly for heartlanders like us ..</p>

              <p>Well, it is their intention to only "lessen the impact of the GST hike and help Singaporeans cope with it."</p>
              <p>They have already stated their intention, which is exactly what you have described. However, at the current moment, the poor do seems to get more benefits.</p>
