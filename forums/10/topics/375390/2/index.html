              <p>Regardless of which plan you choose, CPFLife locks up all your money. The only concern here is whether one would like to receive less now so their loved ones will receive more when they pass on.</p>
              <p>Since CPFLife locks up all your money, there shouldn't be an annuity or non-annuity portion. The interest rate you receive on your CPFLife annuity should be 4% now, and be converted to yield of Singapore Government Securities + 1% after the end of this year. This coincides with the changes in CPF interest rates made to the SMRA (Special, Medisave and Retirement Accounts).</p>

              <p><br>U dun talk rubbish lah,...who said no refunds, CPFlife plans come in 4 plans to choose from ya, three of these plans allow for a contributor to bequeath his savings to his beneficiaries if he dies while still on the CPF Life scheme.</p>
              <p>The Life Plus plan gives the most in monthly payouts but will yield the smallest amount that can be bequeathed to beneficiaries.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, the Life Basic plan gives the least in monthly payouts but provides the most should the contributor die. So dun anyhow talk rubbish ok.</p>

              <p>Govt never ask you to retire at 65yo, they only said if you can work, carry on, and the official retirement age is 62yo ya. Any child who is below the age of 21yo will not be eligible for DPS, a guardian have to be appointed by the CPF holder just incase he passed away at 61yo, whichto me, is very sayang. And when his/her Child reach 21yo, he/she will be able to take over the DPS money kept in CPF whereby during this the Guardian can only use for this child education, medication and any other hardship grant as deem appropriate.</p>

              <p>my advice to forumites here above 55 who intend to sign up for the CPF life plan.....hold on first. Don't be too tempted by the extra bonus of up to $4k if you sign up now. Once u sign the plan, it's a contract for life....there's no opt out unless on medical or citizenship grounds.</p>

              <p>The govt seems to be in a hurry to make singaporeans above 55 to sign up for the plan by giving the extra bonuses. In my view, if they really meant to benefit the citizens, why such gimmicks? Why not give the bonuses to all singaporeans?</p>

              <p>no, it is an option, but of course you dun get the rebate, taxis are different, they are bound by contract, there are lots of causal workers not contributing to CPF, and the govt and NTUC are pestering them like crazy. My Dad told me, CPF in singapore is a like an attachment, a chain tight on your legs, therefore it is up to individual to pay CPF, but I am not saying CPF is no good, for a layman on the street with a family, he should contribute to CPF for the sake of security and long term saving or leasing House.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There are lots of medical insurance that provide better coverage than Medisave, but of course, if i dun contribute, i expect no relief in both personnal and business taxes...so i hv to weight the pros and cons. But for me, i may not be in Singapore for long, will retire in Taiwan, so why should i get attached to CPF, sure they will make problem for me with i wanted to totally withdraw it before moving back to taiwan. A chain on the leg ya</p>

              <p>The government need as many Singaporeans to come onboard their CPF Lifeplan insurance program so that it will reach a critical mass early.</p>
              <p>The CPF Lifeplan is the PAP Government's alternative solution of <strong>NOT</strong> giving a <strong>LUMP SUM</strong> withdrawal to the CPF account holders.</p>
              <p>The CPF Lifeplan is the PAP Government's solution <strong>to delay</strong> and <strong>stretching out</strong> the return of the huge CPF savings due to Singaporeans by paying in small quantums and through the years - hoping that the final return of the smaller remaining balance amounts will be spaced as the life of each CPF account holder terminate at different period.</p>
              <p>If all the old baby-boomers - born between 1947 through 1968 - should retire at about the same time and withdraw their CPF savings at about the same period, the surge of withdrawals will simply bankrupt the CPF.</p>
              <p>This is the logical outcome when the CPF contributions tapered to lesser volumes through the succeeding years, when the success of LKY's Family Planning program begin to kick in and its effects began to be felt twenty years later from 1980s onward.</p>
              <p>By the 1980s, the CPF Time Bomb was already obvious with the Howe Yoon Chong Commission being set up to study the entire CPF system; and by 1984 - his report began the consistent cycles of PAP continuously tinkering with the withdrawal age that was original <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">guaranteed at the retirement age of 55 years</span></strong>.</p>

              <p><br>Are these social issues, or are they issues of the Old in Singapore ?</p>
              <p>These issues could have been solved if the sum of US$100 BILLION was not lost by the irresponsible acts by GIC and Temasek Holdings.</p>
              <p>That US$100 BILLION could have been the Trust Fund to pay for all the premiums that would have been deducted from the account holders to make the CPF Lifeplan become a reality to benefit Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>Even in early 2009, the PAP Government had received the approval from the Elected President to withdraw S$4.5 BILLION - from the Singapore Reserves - to pay all Singapore Employers to protect the jobs in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Who do you think is the beneficiary, when the GLC is the biggest employer in Singapore ?</p>
              <p>Did any Singapore Small and Medium Sized employers received any benefits in any significant sums from this amount of S$4.5 BILLION ?</p>
              <p>Inspite of being paid S$4.5 BILLION withdrawn from the Reserves and paid to the employers, we still hear from the PAP ministers that by year end, Singaporeans should be prepared for another 100,000 to be retrenched.</p>
              <p>Why was that S$4.5 BILLION from the Singapore Reserves not used to kick-off the CPF Lifeplant for Singaporeans ?</p>
              <p>Only a useless ignorant Taiwanese "hum" will continue to spread the PAP propaganda as condition of Singapore Citizenship.</p>

              <p><br>Are these social issues, or are they issues of the Old in Singapore ?</p>
              <p>These issues could have been solved if the sum of US$100 BILLION was not lost by the irresponsible acts by GIC and Temasek Holdings.</p>
              <p>That US$100 BILLION could have been the Trust Fund to pay for all the premiums that would have been deducted from the account holders to make the CPF Lifeplan become a reality to benefit Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>Even in early 2009, the PAP Government had received the approval from the Elected President to withdraw S$4.5 BILLION - from the Singapore Reserves - to pay all Singapore Employers to protect the jobs in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Who do you think is the beneficiary, when the GLC is the biggest employer in Singapore ?</p>
              <p>Did any Singapore Small and Medium Sized employers received any benefits in any significant sums from this amount of S$4.5 BILLION ?</p>
              <p>Inspite of being paid S$4.5 BILLION withdrawn from the Reserves and paid to the employers, we still hear from the PAP ministers that by year end, Singaporeans should be prepared for another 100,000 to be retrenched.</p>
              <p>Why was that S$4.5 BILLION from the Singapore Reserves not used to kick-off the CPF Lifeplant for Singaporeans ?</p>
              <p>Only a useless ignorant Taiwanese "hum" will continue to spread the PAP propaganda as condition of Singapore Citizenship.</p>

              <p><br>what old issue, why alway link our CPF to temasek and all those losses, CPF lifeplan was created long before this crisis took place, i was in SIM doing HR when i am invited for a talk at DBS auditorium, as my frens need company, and i am always the funny and jovious one, they beg for my company, so i tack along, that was in the end of 2007, and my gosh, that then MOM minister Dr Ng, already spend out the blueprint for us to consider. So dun think that this plan got anything to link with any lost ya, and even so, it is not involved in any sense.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Our medical tech is advancing, people are living longer, you need a plan to sustain a longer life, it is not that CPF is unable to fulfil their obligation to you, till now, nobody is deny any full withdrawal when the time arrive, you got trust your pension system, CPF had serve us well thru all these years of prosperity and nation building, and as the world changed, we got to change to adapt, our system cannot remain the same when people are living longer, financial investment are no longer that secure and of course, with advance sex enhance medication, lust is on the increase.</p>
