              <p><br>what old issue, why alway link our CPF to temasek and all those losses, CPF lifeplan was created long before this crisis took place, i was in SIM doing HR when i am invited for a talk at DBS auditorium, as my frens need company, and i am always the funny and jovious one, they beg for my company, so i tack along, that was in the end of 2007, and my gosh, that then MOM minister Dr Ng, already spend out the blueprint for us to consider. So dun think that this plan got anything to link with any lost ya, and even so, it is not involved in any sense.</p>

              <p>If you are a Taiwanese "hum" and have a desire to be a real "Singaporea citizen" you should start familiarising with "old issues" as to what belong to the Citizens.</p>
              <p>If you do not understand what has been clearly written, can you hope to be a Singaporean ?</p>
              <p>Thank God that you are invited NOT to talk at the DBS auditorium, as your ignorance will surely pollute the minds of your young Singaporean friends who must have been unaware of your Taiwanese ignorance.</p>
              <p>Do you think that a small time MOM Minister know anything about what the PM's husband is doing at Temasek ?</p>
              <p>When Dhanabalan can be slapped by LHL - you must be a real dumb "hum" to think that the PM's husband activities must be informed to all the other Ministers.</p>
              <p>From what you have written, you are as lost in your own reply as you are lost inside the "nutshell" that a stupid "hum" has taken over for a home.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Our medical tech is advancing, people are living longer, you need a plan to sustain a longer life, it is not that CPF is unable to fulfil their obligation to you, till now, nobody is deny any full withdrawal when the time arrive, you got trust your pension system, CPF had serve us well thru all these years of prosperity and nation building, and as the world changed, we got to change to adapt, our system cannot remain the same when people are living longer, financial investment are no longer that secure and of course, with advance sex enhance medication, lust is on the increase.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><br>Did the PAP Government tell you all the crap that a dumb "hum" has decided to process and then spread the same in the "bubbles of ignorance" from the useless life form of a "hum" in a "nutshell" ?</p>
              <p>Was that part of the terms and conditions for your application to be a Singapore Citizen ?</p>
              <p>How many hours of your time must be spent to listen to the PAP crap before you are given the Citizenship Certificate - and were you tested for the accuracy in your parrot like interpretation of the crap fed to you ?</p>
              <p>With the amount of crap loaded into the flip-flop brain of a "hum" - it is not a surprise that your attention will wander into a favorite subject of a a horny "hum" - who will move from financial insecurity to sex enhancement that increase the lust.</p>
              <p>Obviously we can accept that you will doubtfully complain it will boost your business.</p>
