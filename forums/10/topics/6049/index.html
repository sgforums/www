            <div class='col-md body'><br><br>Reality and Perception<br><br>Few people have come to a level whereby reality and perception are often regarded as the veracity of an upright hero compared to the mendacious devil on a stage with no concealment. Although this is sure a mean way of categorizing the above proclamation, it does however, place the discrepancies of this two in a much brighter light.<br>"Seeing is believing".<br>How contradicting the statement goes.  Seeing. The sighting of physical existence could and can never be without a tooth which has never failed to contact its gum. On the contrary, the same could not be said for the word Â‘believingÂ’. When someone believes in something, it is so inevitable along the path that he has to shower his imaginary faith on that object. Always under the impression that something will come good some time long enough.<br>Holding a certain view either of the majority or by the self does not necessarily predestinate its mortal presence! It is certainly easy to link these two together in the course of constructing a sentence that it is deceiving to the mind at times.<br>Perception is always in tandem with non-concrete mind sculpture, and often it is just another notion from the brain nerve set to view another material, be it information or just plain straight in the face. It's just like taking a look at a hunk who seemed to have anything and everything in parallelism and everything suggests unblemished returns (perception again). We have not seen the truth yet. The likelihood of this individual surviving our high hopes retains its stealth. To a person who embraces the concept of judgement is always a victim of perception, or even much to remark that the latter conveys the former is no inaccuracy on anybody's part.<br>A judgement is merely comparable to an estimated value of wealth that rides high on imagination until the gold's placed on the weighing pan. Even when that gold statue is weighed and the result being challenged by the naked eye (seeing?), one could not help but think of the gold statue, which might have been vacant in its heart! By melting it to molten form could solve the problem. But it does not rectify the formation of yet again the Great Perception that arises from presuming it is solid gold and even having a value in the first place!<br>Thus is it appropriate to declare that reality actually brings about perception? That would mean the intended definition for "Seeing is believing" that most people assumed is incorrect, or whoever spouted that phrase did not mean it that way in the first place! From the above explanation, "Seeing is believing" could have been taken as the state of perceiving from reality, the before and after phase.<br>Sliding into Reality, it is really, how things are and not just made out to be. The onus of it all is that the facts have to be substantially simplified to be able to dish out a clear picture. Human beings have unceasingly been buying the saucer that comes with the cup. The fact that a cup is a cup emerges silver-worthy. Even with a tablecloth to wipe off any possible imperfection on the glass table seems scanty to the eyes. And that is why a hunt for the saucer evolves, perhaps to ascertain the truth.<br>"This is a cup. This IS definitely A CUP."<br>"NO! You can't call this a cup because it has no handles!"<br>"Yeah rightÂ…Â…..Should I call it a glass then? Or should I name it a mug because it is much wider and taller than what you call a cup?"<br><br>Seriously, my original perception of the above is that a cup is shaped just like the letter "c". And "Cup" just has that scooping feeling, like when you scoop water from a pond with your hands. You cup this and you cup that. Yeah that's how it sounds like. And a clenched fist would appear massive, resembling a mug. You put that massive thing into your mouth and you would go "MmmmmmmÂ…Â…..MmmuuuÂ…Â…Â….uuuuÂ…Â…gggggÂ….MmuhhhhhhhhhÂ…..Mug."<br>Mug. Precisely.<br>Flask. Have you ever heard the sound it makes when hot drinking water is poured out of it?<br>"FfffrrruuurrrrÂ….sssspppppppÂ….Flaaassskkk." Flask.<br>I believe the ones who engineered the dictionary had THAT perceiving outlook when they saw the structure of those liquid containers that they should be termed this way. Well that is MY Perception. Had to be. I saw the cup on the table with my own eyes, it has to be a cup and I have to think about something to convince myself that it's a cup and not a mug, or why it IS a cup and not a mug. Things get a wee bit more complex when it drops deeper into the pit, and it's how you perceive the pit to be.<br>Things are brought into existence with the purview that it should be kept elementary, like books. It's a fact that the printout for your phone bill comes up to a few hundred dollars but itÂ’s how we often discern ourselves that someone else in the family is using the dial more than the other family member. At least thatÂ’s how my mother injects her mind with.<br>Reality is real. Per-cept-ion, with the Â‘ceptÂ’, certainly signifies an evasive aura. It is remarkably simple to explain that real and unreal predicament that it is often forgotten that despite the differences these two phenomenon can synchronize so befittingly. The magnified interest in it holds an unceasing count of pointers that could lead to a debate of the same measure. It could be said that we look at Reality as a stepping stone for us, whereas Perception as an understanding that we might be able to pace ourselves past the boundary and achieve something in life.<br>However, it might account for unjust convictions as well along the way.<br>Just like my boss who had once labeled me as being slothful when I had absolutely nothing on my bloody hands to do.<br><br>So how vast does the two notions go???<br><br>------------------<br>Chromeheart Minds: The Endless Search for Intellectual Freedom</div>
