              <p>I strongly agree.</p>
              <p>In the one year leading up to elections, people are already making alot of noises regarding transport, cost of living, housing and immigration.</p>
              <p>The PAP proceeds to pay lip service, by 'promising' to change and reflect upon their practices, with the PM's pre-election day apology being the climax.</p>
              <p>But post-election, we see them back to their old ways. nothing has changed. Nothing will change.</p>
              <p>1)</p>
              <p>We retrenched people during the recession. We are still in the process of recovery, and using the STI as a guage, we are nowhere near our peak prior to the global recession.</p>
              <p><strong>But: </strong>Since we are supposed to be recovering, with a diminished economy which requires a smaller workforce, <strong>how come we did not see any decrease in our population throughout the years of the recession? </strong></p>
              <p><strong>Instead, we continue seeing an increase of population, especially in the number of work permit workers.</strong></p>
              <p>2)</p>
              <p>The PAP promised to bring down housing prices. Pre-election, post-election, all I have seen are reports showing that housing prices continue to climb, with the greatest rise in the prices of HDB flats.</p>
              <p>3)</p>
              <p>Revamping of our transport infrastructure is long overdue. The opening of the Circle line is necessary, and timely. But it does not fully solve the problem.</p>
              <p>It serves to link up estates previously not included in the mrt network, providing these people with an alternative transport to bus. This only serves to increase our MRT's passenger base, where some people will switch from bus to mrt.</p>
              <p>People who live in the north along the red line, and the east, along the green line, will have little benefits from the opening of the circle line.</p>
              <p>The main issue with our rail transport is overcrowding, and <strong>the difficulty of boarding the train</strong> during peak hours. It is pointless to introduce more rail lines downstream, when overcrowding typically happens in the upstream heartlands. e.g. Jurong East, Yishun.</p>
              <p>Yes, people may get off at Bishan and switch to circle line, thus freeing up some space on the stuffy train. But all that is irrelevant if you cannot even board the train from your estate in yishun.</p>
              <p>What LTA can do, is to encourage public bus operators to <strong>use high capacity</strong> bendy buses or double decker <strong>buses</strong>, instead of the mad rush for the newer handicap-friendly euro V buses, which has a much reduced carrying capacity.</p>
              <p>With buses of decreased capacity, you need to hire more drivers, put out more buses, ramped up frequency. Our buses seem overworked, with increasingly common cases of buses catching fire on the road.</p>
              <p>Secondly, a major cause of traffic jams on road are caused by traffic lights and junctions. It is common to see a long line of vehicles along the exits of expressways, where they are held back by traffic lights which take forever to turn green, and by ceaseless cars who doesn't give way. Also, travelling down a street, we are often amazed by the proximity of traffic lights. Unnecessary stoppage time will decrease the smoothness of traffic flow.</p>
              <p>What we can do, is the <strong>removal of redundant traffic lights.</strong> Since people are too lazy to climb bridges, why not leave the climbing to the vehicles? We can build ramps or tunnels at pedestrain crossings, thus bypassing the need to stop on straight roads.</p>
              <p><strong>assigning of dedicated filter lane.</strong> We usually have a give way line at filter lanes, where we are expected to give way to oncoming  traffic on main road before proceeding. This is responsible for the daily jams we see at major expressway exits like corporation road, changi exit etc.</p>
              <p>Why not open up a dedicated lane for vehicles merging left? Then there will be no need to stop and bring about a backlog of jams. This will also enhance traffic flow.</p>
