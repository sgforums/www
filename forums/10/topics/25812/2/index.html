The genome of all virulent agents such as marburg, ebola, lassa eg has already been deciphered. The difficult thing would be to understand their infection cycle and what each part of the genome is responsible for what and how they interact. The terrifying premise of modern molecular biology is that hybrid and designed BW agents are now a possibility eg lets say u combine the virulence of influenza with the long latent period of HIV. You can have an agent that can spread swiftly without any overt sympton. b) Keeping them safe? Storage of such agents are not overly difficult. the agent in your example anthrax is remarkably resilient and can survive extremely long exposures(we are talking about decades here) without suffering degradation. c)delivery - that is the difficult part of the equation<br><br>but i wouldn't be interested in anthrax anyway... i don't agree with germ warfare... its repulsive and impossible to contain... its too unpredictable to be effectively used... at least nukes u can control the kiloton yield and estimate the damage from ground zero.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Let me introduce you to some recent concept in BW technology. One is called racial profiling. There are fundamental genetic differences between the different races and probes that can be incorperated into viruses and bacteria will be able to spot the differences between the racial group. Think of the implication yourself. Another is the concept of self destruction. Cells have a mechanism called apostasis which is programmed cell death. If you can engineer and modify this mechanism into the agent you want...........<br><br>mother nature on the other hand, can be a quite a bitch if u mess with her...[/b]</blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Then again nothing will change on earth.

            <div class='col-md body'>I believe you are referring to daisy cutter, that is vietnam war era 1st generation technology liao, as shown in the film "outbreak".<br>New generation FAE warhead can be easily integrated with precision guided devices (laser guidance) to a single target. As shown in this link http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/munitions/fae.htm<br>Thus you no need to use really big aerosol cloud of fuel for the job. Fuel price quite expansive lay  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>3rd generation thermobaric warhead is even more powerful and has designated as a fill-gap weapon between extra large conventional HE warhead and a small tactical nuclear warhead  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>BTW, now you can also use rocket, arty, catapault, or even man portable fire to deliver FAE rounds. Main usage is for clearing, countermine and to suck out enemy in deep ground entrenchment and more recently as an NBC countermeasure tools.<br><br>But if you really want to, you can develop one really damn big one airlift by a B52 bomber that can flatten the size of KL city  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by CX:</div><div class="quote_body">only the big ones lah... the small ones are used to cut LZs in jungle... pretty clumsy weapons really... u drop them off the back of a c-130 and it floats down on a parachute... hardly something u use for precision bombing...</div></blockquote></div>
