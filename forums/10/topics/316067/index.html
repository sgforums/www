              <p>Our leaders seem to be only using laws to do all their work in a
              one-sided manner to give them the legitimacy or power to do as they
              like legally so that people cannot challenge them as long as they are
              in power.<br> <br> One wonders if this legalistic way of governing the country will bring
              the people closer and unite them to build a stronger and united country.<br> <br> If legalistic wrangling is the only way leaders can govern the country,
              what kind of laws will be passed next to get people to work together
              fight the enemy and make sacrifices in bad times or recessions.<br> <br> Will people listen to everything the laws or leaders are saying or
              asking like the latest May Day messages of PM or Union Leader Lim Swee
              Say.<br> <br> One wonders how many people in percentage term are keenly waiting for
              leadership and good advice of leaders and truly listening to their
              advice nowadays. <br> <br> If we have leaders only interested in talking about taxing more and
              profiteering more from their leadership how many people will really be
              committed to sacrificing for the country especially after the exposure
              of so many flaws and hypocrisy from NKF to Shin Corp and Mas Selamat.<br> <br> If ministers only talk about their achievements and are still not to
              interested in improving their earning or retirements or medical
              benefits etc must people believe in whatever they are saying any more.<br> <br> It would seem that the ministers only depend on passing more laws to
              give themselves greater power and paying them millions and would only
              talk in monologues.<br> <br> If there is a war or recession will WKS or some other yes-men ministers
              be with us suffering together or will they be listened to when such
              ministers are to call on people to fight the enemy or make yet more
              sacrifices for their own million-dollar success.</p>

              <p>The frequent selective comparison to worse-off situation is by now all too familiar to us ordinary citizens.</p>
              <p>Just scan the newspapers pages and look cursorily at ministers' speeches one could easily confirm tis fact.</p>
              <p>The selective comparison with private few lucky CEOs' pays in order to increase their own pays has already become the key philosophy of the government - money worshipping.</p>
              <p>The selective amnesia to avoid problems or complaints is yet another feature unique to this little red dot. So people's dropping wages and struggling to make ends meet is never or seldom acknowledged or remembered by our leaders.</p>
              <p>Such selective comparison modus operandi today has become the cornerstone of our unique leadership.</p>
              <p>By selecting only the worse to compare with they easily side-track all real issues and problems.</p>
              <p>This is precisely what is at stake in this little red dot. Another way to a void problems or complaints is to characterise legalistic wrangling, hypocrisy as pragmatism to avoid all real problems and issues sidestepping morality and righteous conduct to serve the people's needs and aspirations.</p>
              <p>So by sidestepping all problems and issues with hypocrisy of such nature do are leaders have the real de-facto leadership.quality to lead the country.</p>
