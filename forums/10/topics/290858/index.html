Over in Singapore, the money minded, self centred, tyrannical despots have come out with rules laws to protect their self interests, to serve their hidden agenda to make people of Singapore fear them.   These are bunch of despicable, evil despots who we have to be clear of their motives so as to stand firm for ourselves not to let their scare tactic affect our decision in voting.
