            <div class='col-md body'>this guy was the one who led the army shooting contingent annually (or biannually i dun remember) to compete against the other shooting contingents from sea nations. very hi profile. the camp is at pasir laba. hanky panky and asking for sexual favours yes.<br><br>after him, he was replaced by a melayu CO. racism is a sensitive issue esp. in saf, but it doesn't mean things dun happen.<br><br>there was another particular case where my colleague (a melayu in her 30s) who was the AMMO IC for the day lost a whole box of SPG grenades. altho most of us there suspected she miscount when she drew the ammo from the ammo dump, she insisted she didn't and so searches were conducted and the SIB brought in to investigate. all instructors were not allowed to book out. i was shocked when i was called in to be interviewed by the SIB as a prime suspect, which later on i was told by the melayu's team mates that she told the investigators she suspected i took it as i happen to be at the training area, and that we both were never on good terms. ok fine. i thought it was just a normal procedure that they interviewed all suspects, but turned out more than that. i was the prime suspect and only suspect based on her statement.<br><br>my hubby was in the same unit as me (we were both regulars) and we were both investigated, on the basis that he could be my accomplice. it was very disruptive as we were always notified last minute by OC almost everyday that we had to 'report to SIB camp now'. mentally stressful. but we were both adamant that we weren't going to be the scapegoats for her negligence. things went on like that for a few weeks until they issued us a Search Warrant to search our flat. of course nothing was found and that was the last we saw of them. oh yeah and they didn't issue any search warrant against the melayu woman.<br><br>during the weeks that follow, i was frequently being called to my melayu CO's office to be persuaded to admit and confess i took  the grenades. he said things like .. "your sentence would be lighter." " i can ensure you that your hubby will not be implicated as long as you admit you took it." yeah right. as if i would believe. i requested to see the Chief of Infantry to hear my case, but was repeatedly rejected by him. i said i would write in, and he said then he would charge me for not going through proper channel before the letter could reach him. so by then, i was so disillusioned with the saf that i couldn't be bothered with him and f&amp;7k him and told him he could charge me insubordination too before walking out of his office. months later, the verdict came. the melayu woman was charged for negligence and fined $50, whereas both my hubby and I were reprimanded and henta kaki promotion for the next 2 years. where is the justice? just $50 for a whole box of grenades? with more people like her in the saf, people like osama would be more than happy.<br><br>no justice, no transparency, and you could find yourself being the scapegoats for incompetent asses no matter how hardworking or patriotic you are.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>got lah, in the papers. a small paragraph only. she was my junior batch.<br><br>apparently they were preparing for arms drill and someone heard a gunshot in the office. so they went to look and discovered her lying on the ground in a pool of blood though not yet dead. the round was fired from below her chin and came out from the top of her head. one of the few medics fainted when he saw the sight by the way. anyway heard from my junior, she was a les and her 'partner' was her colleague in the same unit. her partner suggested to break up and then bang! last heard, her partner was posted to sch of medicine.<br><br>don't think they ever know how she got that 5.56.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This reminds me of an incident during my NS days....<br><br>It was platoon level training for my company at Pasir Laba. As the company medic, I was covering safety. My CO was there, watching the training. It was an extremely hot day.... so much so that one platoon commander and three of his men came down with heat exhaustion.<br><br>The platoon medic and I worked feverishly to revive and shoot infusion lines into them. Then, when I ordered evacuation, my CO came up to me and said, 'There will be NO evacuation.'<br><br>I tried to protest. After all, heat exhaustion was a serious matter. But to his mind, those three guys were chao-kenging and did not deserve evacuation. My CO then went up to my Encik and the safety officer and told them to block any evacuation requests by me.<br><br>When my CO was out of earshot, I pleaded with my Encik to allow it. But he said that he was powerless to do overrule my CO. He just told me to do the best I could do.<br><br>And while I was treating the PC, I asked him if he had just recovered from any illness. My CO, overhearing, roared at me:'F**k you, medic! Who cares about that!!?!? You are useless; you don't know how to do your job!!!'<br><br>F**k you, CO. People who just recovered from illness are more prone to heat exhaustion and more likely to go on to heat stroke. That was a piece of info I needed. You don't know what I know.<br><br>Fortunately, all four recovered. I told the safety officer that I would like to lodge a complaint against the CO; he had after all violated the TSR (I'm pretty sure of this) and unnecessarily risked the lives of his men.<br><br>The safety officer told me that if I did that, it would go up the lines to.... CO himself. Not only would he block it, but I would soon find myself in trouble. He advised me to let the matter drop.<br><br>I saved people's lives and I got shit for it. When I want to fling the shit back at the culprit, I'm faced with a cover-up.<br><br>To the CO: up yours, you a**.</div>
