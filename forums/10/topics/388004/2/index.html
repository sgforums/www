              <p>walkover my friend. The PAP put in place a mechanism known as GRC to ensure walkover to help them secure their power in Singapore. That is the real function of GRC.</p>
              <p>To secure power. Power secured, you can extract wealth from people. For example you can decide your own salary. If you have power to decide your own salary, might as well make it highest in the world.</p>

              <p>what depress wage??? i simply dun understand what you people are talking about leh??? I mean even a layman with no education can see that singaporeans are buying and throwing things like no body business, eat good, expensive and exotic foods, travel to holiday every quarter of the year, buy property after porperty, weekends chiong disco, pubs, happy hours etc etc...line up to buy LV, gucci...you got to be kidding ya. If you tell a bangala we are having a depressing wage...he may laugh until admit hospital. Please lah, look around you before you make insensible judgement ya. If you are poor, doesn't mean all are poor, and even if you are really poor, you may be poor within Singaporean only.</p>
              <p>Dun look at those ah ma or ah kong on the street collecting cardboard, plates or washing utensils are poor people ok....if you open their bag, there are few handkerchiefs inside, open each one,,you find a OCBC account bk, DBS account bk, Citibank account bk,...etc etc, i bet they are richer than you ya. Like my ah ma, still go coffee shop help out...what to do, she no work very sian mah. Then when my Dad drove his mercs home, he will pick her up...secretly</p>
              <p>Open your eyes hor, in this world, especially Singaporeans, the rich act poor ok, and the poor like to act rich....very funny hor.</p>
