              <p>A recent editorial published by the respected international newspaper Wall Street Journal claimed that the relentless influx of foreign workers in Singapore has helped to depress the wages of ordinary Singapore workers leading to a lower quality of life. (read article <a href="http://www.temasekreview.com/2010/01/14/wsj-singapores-expat-surge-fuels-economic-fears/"><span style="color: #a91b33;">here</span></a>)</p>
              <p>Due to the ruling party’s myopic immigration policies, the number of foreigners has increased to 36 per cent of Singapore’s population, up from 14 per cent in 1990.</p>
              <p><em>“Between 2005 and 2009, Singapore’s population surged by roughly 150,000 people a year to 5 million—among the fastest rates ever there—with 75% or more of the increase coming from foreigners,”</em> Wall Street Journal reports.</p>
              <p>The influx of cheap foreign labor helps to keep GDP growth impressive since they help to cut business costs and create new demands for good and services in the short run.</p>
              <p>A significant proportion of Singapore ministers’ exorbitant salaries is pegged to Singapore’s annual growth rates – the higher the growth, the more money they bring home.</p>
              <p>Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong earns an estimated $3 million dollars a year, more than 6 times the annual salary of U.S. President Barack Obama. Even a Singapore minister earns more than the most powerful man in the world and Singapore has a land mass of only 0.000073 per cent of the United States.</p>
              <p>Wall Street Journal estimates that “a third or more of Singapore’s 6.8% average annual growth from 2003 to 2008 came from the expansion of its labor force, primarily expatriates, allowing Singapore to post growth more commonly associated with poor developing nations.”</p>
              <p>However their arrival has depressed the wages of blue-collar workers, exacerbating Singapore’s income gap between the rich and the poor. Singapore has the highest income-gap among the 30 most developed countries in the world as measured by the Gini Coefficent, comparable to some third world nations like Kenya, Russia and Tunisia.</p>
              <p>A long-term devastating effect of the mass immigration is that it appears to contribute directly to the decrease in labor productivity as companies continue to depend on cheap imported labor to keep their profit margins instead of innovating to make their businesses more efficient:</p>

              <p>Though Singapore is able to lose billions of dollars of national reserves from investment losses suffered by its two gigantic sovereign wealth funds GIC and Temasek Holdings, Singaporeans receive few social welfare benefits from the ruling party which has won 11 consecutive elections by overwhelming margins since first assuming power in 1959.</p>
              <p>Wall Street Journal recounts the plight of 58 year old Singaporean Lee Ah Lee who makes 850 Singapore dollars a month (about US$600) clearing tables in a cafeteria, saying that the flood of immigrants has made it hard to make ends meet by pushing down blue-collar pay in Singapore.</p>

              <p>This is a class war. And it must be fought.</p>
              <p>Import cheap labour to benefit employers and foreign multinational companies while the wages of the working class is depressed. All the while using state media as a tool to brainwash public to accept their propaganda.</p>
              <p>Cost of consumer goods rises due to increased demand from imported aliens while at the same time the wages of working class is being destroyed.</p>
              <p>Gap between rich and poor is increasing. A small tiny elite benefits due to cheap labour while majority suffers decline of standard of living.</p>
