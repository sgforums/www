            <div class='col-md body'>Depending on how you look at it, Singaporeans could either be sheep or grudging team players.  One key assumption of Singaporean culture is that the nail that sticks out gets hammered down, and a) the hammering gets pretty hard around these here parts and b) Singaporeans favour a comfort zone to playing high-risk-high-gain games.  Driving this assumption is the social process that begins in school (sit down, shut up and do your homework) through working life (sit down, shut up and do your work), in which the collective almost always rules over the individual.<br><br>Is that a bad thing?  Again, it's a matter of perspective.  Had Singaporean culture emphasised the individual over society in the 1960's and 1970's, the economy would probably not have grown as fast as it did, if management was busy trying to gain control of the workers instead of getting down to business.  On the other hand, having outgrown its NIC status, one would imagine that society needs to mature and grow into its current circumstances.<br><br>BTW, iveco, it's Joshua Benjamin Jeyaratnam.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Here are some interest facts about sheep... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Some breeds of sheep exhibit a strong flocking behaviour. This was used as an example to Israelites in the Christian bible to instruct them to obey their shepherd, or master <span style="color: red;">(PAP). </span>Flocking behaviour is advantageous to non-predatory animals <span style="color: red;">(Singaporean); </span>the strongest animals fight their way to the center of the flock which offers them great protection from predators. <span style="color: red;">(Like those living in Tanglin and Nassim Hill)</span><br><br>It can be disadvantageous when food sources <span style="color: red;">(job and money) </span>are limited and sheep are almost as prone to overgrazing a pasture as goats. <span style="color: red;">(in dept) </span><br><br>Sheep flocking behaviour is so prevalent in some English breeds that special names apply to the different roles sheep play in a flock. One calls a sheep that roams furthest away from the others an outlier, <span style="color: red;">(quiters)</span> a term originally used to refer to someone who lives far from where they work. This sheep ventures further away <span style="color: red;">(migration)</span> from the safety of the flock to graze, due to a larger flight zone or a weakness that prevents it from obtaining enough forage <span style="color: red;">(Money/Job) </span><br>when with the herd.<br><br>Another sheep, the bellwether, <span style="color: red;">(the LEEs)</span> leads the others. Traditionally this was a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">castrated</span>  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  Ram (or wether) with a bell hung off a string around its neck. The tendency to act as an outlier, bellwether or to fight for the middle of the flock stays with sheep throughout their adulthood; that is unless they have a scary experience which causes them to increase their flight zone. Sheep can become hefted to one particular pasture so they do not roam far from home <span style="color: red;">(Living in comfort zone)</span><br><br>In George Orwell's satirical novel Animal Farm, sheep are used to represent the ignorant and uneducated masses of revolutionary Russia. The sheep are unable to be taught the subtleties of revolutionary ideology and can only be taught repetitive slogans such as "Four legs good, two legs bad" which they bleat in unison at rallies. This is due to the widespread <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">perception that sheep lack intelligence and also their undoubted herd mentality.</span></strong><br><br></div>

Worse, everybody is busy making ends meet, bogged down with HDB/landed property loan to service for decades, sick old parents to look after with high medical bills, etc, hence, afraid to upset and lose everything. They have us all by our testicles - everything people own sits on state land, or are under government terms. Walk the wrong way, the floor we stand on can disappear.<br><br>Even if we have our own opinions, suggestions, objections, feedback, whatever, we rarely if ever heeded.

LOL...<br><br>Back to the main topic. Singaporeans are like sheep. This sucks. To ask them to even sign a petition abroad and send it to the Singapore High Commission is like asking them to talking to the wall - nobody listens. Why? Even if they are so far away from home, the sheep mentality has instilled them not to "go against" the great government.<br><br>Secondly, I have <strong>very poor impression</strong> of PSC scholars. Despite being the "elites", they refused to sign petitions, or do anything that seems anti-government. <strong>Some even quote that they should take the stand of the government, when you are asking them for their personal opinion.</strong> So much taxpayers' money being invested on their future and they can't afford independent thoughts. Some honest PSC scholars will tell you they don't want to jeopardise their career.<br><br>For instance, I approached a few PSC scholars (in UK in early 2005) to support Amnesty International for their stand against death sentence in Singapore, plus other minor human rights violation in SIngapore. Guess what they said? "Dr Chee Soo Juan is an International Fellow in Amnesty International. It will be suicidal to support Amnesty International. " <strong>OMG!!! I wish my parents are not paying tax to support the education of such "elites".</strong></div>

LOL...<br><br>Back to the main topic. Singaporeans are like sheep. This sucks. To ask them to even sign a petition abroad and send it to the Singapore High Commission is like asking them to talking to the wall - nobody listens. Why? Even if they are so far away from home, the sheep mentality has instilled them not to "go against" the great government.<br><br>Secondly, I have [b]very poor impression</strong> of PSC scholars. Despite being the "elites", they refused to sign petitions, or do anything that seems anti-government. <strong>Some even quote that they should take the stand of the government, when you are asking them for their personal opinion.</strong> So much taxpayers' money being invested on their future and they can't afford independent thoughts. Some honest PSC scholars will tell you they don't want to jeopardise their career.<br><br>For instance, I was approached a few PSC scholars (in UK in early 2005) to support Amnesty International for their stand against death sentence in Singapore, plus other minor human rights violation in SIngapore. Guess what they said? "Dr Chee Soo Juan is an International Fellow in Amnesty International. It will be suicidal to support Amnesty International. " <strong>OMG!!! I wish my parents are not paying tax to support the education of such "elites".</strong>[/b]</blockquote>Our scholars are so bad meh?<br><br>Sure or not?<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br></div>
