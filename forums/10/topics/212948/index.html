Here's more ugliness from China:<br><br>S'PORE ANIMAL LOVERS SAY:<br>Shame on you!<br>Shanghai's animal Olympics<br>Kangaroo boxes with clown<br>Zebra in hurdles race<br>Chimp ignites cauldron<br><br>October 01, 2006<br><br>CLOWN hits kangaroo, and kangaroo hits back. This is no circus act, but a tasteless marsupial-versus-human match which is part of the fourth National Animal Olympics in Shanghai.<br><br>The Olympics, which started on Thursday, was staged at the Shanghai Wild Animal Park in Nanhui district.<br><br>Pictures: AFP, Reuters, Xinhua<br>In the fight, the kangaroo appears to reel backwards after receiving a right hook from its garishly-attired opponent.<br><br>Fortunately, the stunned animal - which was wearing boxing gloves on its front paws - recovered fast enough to sock one right back at its attacker.<br><br>It proceeded to grapple with the clown, who was then forced back towards the ropes by its onslaught.<br><br>Animal rights campaigners are outraged, reported British newspaper Daily Mail. Activists here have also slammed the Animal Olympics.<br><br>Mr Louis Ng, president of the Animal Concerns Research and Education, told The New Paper: 'All this abuse should stop.'<br><br>He found it especially appalling since China is also hosting the Summer Olympics, for humans, in 2008.<br><br>Executive officer for Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA), Ms Deirdre Moss, was equally angry.<br><br>'Training may also have involved cruel methods to coerce the animals into a willingness to perform.'<br><br>The kangaroo is just one of 300 'athletes' taking part in the annual event. Dogs, tigers, bears, horses and zebras among other animals compete in a range of events including hurdles and races.<br><br>According to the Shanghai Daily News, a 10-year-old elephant named Mary had opened the games by carrying the torch to the stadium and passing it to a 3-year-old chimpanzee called Baobao, which then ignited the cauldron.<br><br>The Animal Olympics will end on 30 Nov.<br><br></div>
