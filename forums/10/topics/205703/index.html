In the Gulf oil countries - Qatar, Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Bahrain - when they employ a financial officer, you know, the Arabs employ Singaporeans. I was surprised when I went there - how many Singaporeans are employed by wealthy Gulf Arabs because they are trustworthy, they know the system and they are absolutely reliable."<br><br>Mr Lee added that Singapore has to educate the young to higher standards so that they can move up the value chain and do higher end and more difficult jobs.<br><br>At the same time, the government will continue to invest in new schools to develop talent.<br><br>These are the basics that are needed for Singapore to continually adjust and grow, MM Lee said.<br><br>But Mr Lee warned that the government cannot stop the worldwide trend of lower wage increases for the lower income group, thus the urgency to learn new skills.<br><br>To move ahead and compete, Mr Lee felt that the services sector is the sure sector, which cannot be "migrated so easily" or outsourced.<br><br>He said: "To create this kind of economy, we must have a different kind of Singapore. The Singapore that we had - very orderly, very wholesome, very clean - is not good enough. They want a fun city, buzz - because you now got a new generation of tourists who go to places with excitement. If you want to compete beaches on beaches, forests, lakes, seaside - you lose. You can't beat Thailand, you can't beat Malaysia, you can't beat Indonesia and you can't beat Philippines, but we can become the Paris in Southeast Asia."<br><br>Mr Lee related his recent visit to Clarke Quay, where he saw the place come alive till the early hours of the morning.<br><br>He expressed his hope to see more of such places in Singapore.<br><br>Mr Lee said: "Tourists were there till about 4 to 5 o'clock in the morning, drinking, eating, chatting. The river is there and we've got Crazy Horse, Ministry of Sound, so cars are lining up. But Crazy Horse charges so much, it is half empty and losing money, but we told them, never mind, once the casinos come up, they will get the business."<br><br>This is because tourists, if they are high rollers who gamble hundreds of thousands of dollars in one night, they will go and watch Crazy Horse for entertainment, said Mr Lee.<br><br>"So we must have more of this!" added Mr Lee.<br><br>Looking ahead to the next general election, due by 2011, Mr Lee said voters must use their votes wisely and not to take for granted that the People's Action Party will form the government of the day. - CNA/ir<br><br></span></blockquote><br><span style="color: darkred;">Casinos not good for Singaporeans, Crazy Horse too expensive for us - and more of this kind of higher value services will be provided and all designed for the overseas visitors to spend the tourist dollars for the treasury of Singapore Incorporated.<br><br>Finally, after decades of ignoring the nudging of Singaporean <span style="font-style: italic;">"Night Life Entrepreneurs " </span>, it has taken His own Son to be at the helm for Him to wake up to realise that :<br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>"The Singapore that we had - very orderly, very wholesome, very clean - is not good enough. They want a fun city, buzz - because you now got a new generation of tourists who go to places with excitement. "</strong></span><br><br>Was it only a recent event that tourists will go to places with excitement, places that has a buzz ? Where has Singaporeans been going overseas to enjoy the missing buzz in Singapore ?<br><br>If this is not a view from the cloistered ivory tower, what other confirmation do we need ?<br><br>After four decades of smugness, now our Singaporean Values will need a rethink to accomodate that it is <strong>not good</strong> for Singaporeans to be <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>corrupted by the buzz</strong></span>, but it is alright for us <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>to promote our buzz, to satisfy the corrupting panders of tourists</strong></span>.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>"Do unto others, what we will not do to ourselves"</strong></span> - will have to be a <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>new maxim</strong></span> to be learnt by our subsequent generations.<br><br>With the announced <span style="font-style: italic;">Singaporean talent to be trained for this higher value added entertainment sector</span> - will we see Singaporean Girls being featured in the Crazy Horse show too ?<br><br>Perhaps also a publication of a <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Singaporean Playboy</strong></span> to be sold to foreign visitors only - afterall Indonesia has a highly popular local version of the <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>'fuzzy Bunny Magazine'</strong></span> despite being the largest Muslim population on earth; and HongKong has its local edition, featuring their <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>"local assets"</strong></span> - should we not also promote our own talent too ?<br><br>Afterall, we are into the New Entertainment Bizzness and all, why not release the energy of creativity, and let a "thousand blooms go forth to blossom and sow its seed to multiply further" ?<br><br>For all you know, this may hit 'two birdies with one stroke' - solving a sluggish economy with this new found zest, which will naturally relax Singaporean energy to finally procreate and increase the population numbers too.<br><br></span><br></div>
