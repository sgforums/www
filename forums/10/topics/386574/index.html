              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>OPINION</strong></p>
              <p>2009 is a forgettable year for Singapore as the ruling party introduces more laws and tricks to curtail the political and civil rights of Singapore citizens and to further entrench itself in power for perpetuity.</p>
              <p>In other countries like China, North Korea, Iran and Myanmar, repression takes the form of assassinations, imprisonment and forced labor. In Singapore, it is institutionalized in the system to give it a veneer of legitimacy and respectability such that most Singaporeans are ignorant of its implications.</p>
              <p>The Public Order Act (POA) was rushed through in Parliament and implemented just in time before the APEC Summit in November this year ostensibly to prevent “social unrest” at the international meeting.</p>
              <p>Under the law, a solo protest anywhere in Singapore (except Hong Lim Park) is illegal and the police has overriding powers to ask the protester(s) to “move on” from the scene.</p>
              <p>Freedom of speech and assembly is guaranteed under Article 14 of the Singapore Constitution and it can only be suspended during times when National Security is being threatened.</p>
              <p>It is the innate right of Singaporeans to partake in the political life of their nation which includes expressing their displeasure publicly against the ruling party.</p>
              <p>The law was introduced not so much for the sake of “public order and security”, but to deter opposition members and activists from making use of such “mini-protests” to attract international attention to the PAP’s repressive rule.</p>
              <p>All forms of public dissent are strongly frown upon by the PAP because it will shatter the myth that it is a popular government elected by the people.</p>
              <p>Rocked by a series of mini-bond protests at Hong Lim Park last year, the police has now fitted CCTVs at Hong Lim Park to discourage Singaporeans from participating in the events held there though the Kreta Ayer Police Station is just a stone-throw away.</p>
              <p>In May this year, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong announced a series of “reforms” to further strengthen the PAP’s position ahead of the next general elections.</p>
              <p>Pressurized by rising demands from the ground for more opposition representation in Parliament, PM Lee had increased the number of non-PAP seats to 18 with 9 NCMPs and 9 NMPs.</p>
              <p>The state media is quick to heap praise on him for “liberalizing” the political landscape, but don’t be deceived – it is merely a gimmick to appease Singaporeans and to perpetuate the PAP’s political hegemony.</p>
              <p>Other than to provide new PAP MPs with free training in debating, the token “opposition” representation will not challenge the PAP’s stranglehold on Parliament as it still retains its two-thirds majority.</p>
              <p>The MPs can debate till the cows come home and the PAP will just pass the bills and laws are it sees fit. In short, it is no more than a “Wayang” – full of sound and fury, but nothing of substance.</p>
              <p>Short of helping the opposition, it may work against them in the next general election as voters may be less inclined to vote for an opposition candidate knowing that he/she can still enter parliament as a “best loser” – a NCMP.</p>
              <p>For all their worth, NCMPs and NMPs will never pose a serious threat to the PAP as they are deprived access to crucial grassroots resources privy only to an elected MP which will help them build up the opposition to mount a credible challenge to the PAP in the long run.</p>
              <p>What Singapore truly needs is a genuinely competitive political system and level playing field for all political parties so that the best party to lead the nation can emerge and assume power in a legal and peaceful manner and not a one-party system where one single political party calls the shots and tweak the system to ensure that it wins election after election.</p>
              <p>Without the prospect of ever losing power, no government of the day will bother to sit down and listen attentively to the concerns of the people. Singaporeans can have the best debaters screwing the asses of the PAP ministers in parliament to create some entertainment for them, but at the end of day, what will it achieve with the PAP still firmly in control of every institutions of the state?</p>
              <p>For example, you can have the 18 non-PAP MPs protesting against another impending hike in the ministers’ pay, but when the time comes for the vote, who will be having the last laugh?</p>
              <p>On the other hand, if the PAP is denied its two thirds majority in parliament like Malaysia’s Barisan Nasional, then it will have little choice but to obey the wishes of the people.</p>
              <p>We have a glaring example right at our very doorsteps: When the Barisan Nasional dominated Malaysia before the 2008 elections, it did not care a hoot about the ethnic minorities. Now that it lost its two thirds majority in parliament, it is now singing a different tune altogether out of fear of being booted out of office in the next general election.</p>
              <p>We can have 18, 28 and even 38 NCMPs and NMPs in Parliament, but so long our political system remains closed, uncompetitive and repressive as of now, the PAP can expect to win elections after elections for the next five decades.</p>
              <p>If PM Lee is sincere in liberalizing Singapore’s political landscape, there is really no need for him to increase the number of non-PAP seats in Parliament. All he needs to do is to level the playing field to ensure that a credible alternative party can emerge from the populace to challenge it.</p>
              <p>It is an irony that while Singaporeans are always urged by PAP leaders to stay competitive, they themselves are so afraid of competition.</p>
              <p>Whether a two-party system is suitable for Singapore is for Singaporeans to decide and not the PAP. This country belongs to every Singaporean and not the PAP alone.</p>
              <p>The PAP is nothing more than a political party which must be elected by the people to run the country. If it is not performing up to the expectations of the people, then it should be prepared to be voted out of office.</p>
              <p>Right now, the PAP still thinks it is the only party with the divine right to govern the nation on behalf of the Singaporeans regardless of what they think. This is not a democracy but a tyranny in disguise.</p>
              <p>Ultimately, the future of a nation must be determined by the people themselves and not by a single political party. Until Singaporeans reclaim their rights to toss out unwanted and unpopular governments as and when they wish, the degree of political repression in Singapore will be no different from rogue states elsewhere.</p>

              We just who the hell are we? Take him down? LKY demand to be obeyed and fear like a God. You can keep your religion as long as you obey lky and his wishes. He is a tyrant in Singapore. There's no rule of law but rule of lee in Singapore. If he wanted he could kill anyone in Singapore in broad daylight with hundreds of witnesses without any problem because they all would be too afraid to speak up! LKY is a primitive who thinks everybody else owes him their living.

              But it's true that some parts of the world are not suited with western style democracy...places such the zoo are perfect place for lky to reign. Because that would mean he would be among his kind the animals. That would make the alpha gibbons his opposition but there's nothing to worry as lky is the bigger ape.

              <p>Me and may believe LKY is treating himself like God.   We have one more God in Singapore to worship.   Upon his death, it is possible there will be statue of him and people will go there pray with joss stick to him.   Strike lottery give offering.  </p>
              <p>Those who hate him can go there spit at his statue.</p>

                                Why bother spitting at his statue? most parts of the world wouldn't even know his name much less remember him after he died. He takes none of his money with him when he died and he can kiss this good life of his goodbye for good and descend into nothingness. I'd say good riddance. Hu Jintao is definitely the more well known Chinese for obvious reasons.
