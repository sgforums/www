              <p>it is refer to fuel price in any given time of a year when price at at it highest forwarded then normal..eg now is US$90 per barrel and goes on for 4 months, it went backward to US$80, then after a month it jumped to US$150 for 2 months, then come down to 130 for the rest of the year. So the as per forward fuel price dictation, it takes on the US$150 as it benchmarks to decide on it business cost.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Therefore, the forward fuel price that was calculated to this year was abt US$148 at its highest, if i am not wrong...or more than that...</p>

              <p>Oil peaked in Jun and Jul '08 at above US$ 150 and it is currently on the decline trend for the months Oct - Dec. Don't you think it's ridiculous that our Jun &amp; Jul charges are cheaper than Oct - Dec, shouldn't the electricity price be closer to the Jan - Mar period. 80% of our electricity needs are powered by natural gas from Indonesia.

              <p>The sad thing is, majority of Singaporeans still believe that there is justification for their pegging to crude oil.

              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">It is like this. You can buy fuel for immediate delivery (October) and the seller will quote you a price.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">You can also buy fuel for delivery in December and the seller will quote you a price, the price for delivery in December for the order that is placed in October. That is buying forward.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">You can wait until December then you order your fuel for delivery in December instead of buying forward, buying now for delivery in December.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">The reason you buy in October for delivery in December instead of buying in December for delivery in December is because you took a gamble that if you order in December, the price would have gone up. By the way, buying forward, the price is usually more expensive due to carrying costs, (or warehousing costs to the layman).</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">So you take a gamble, you bet, you tikam tikam and if you bet correctly and the price goes up in December, you make extraordinary profits but if you bet wrongly, no problem, you raise electricity charges by 21% and silliporeans pay for your gambles.</span></span></p>

              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">In the futures market, they are playing with "papers" aka "futures contracts" and even though it is possible to "take" or "make deliveries", that is usually not done (due to a variety of reasons). It is usually "settled" and that is, you sell away the "long" contracts, the "papers", instead of taking delivery and if you hold "short" contracts, the "papers" you "settle" aka "liquidate" aka "sell away your short contracts" instead of delivering the goods.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">When you are in the physical business and that is you buy and sell real goods and commodities like fuel or wheat or rice (say Cold Storage, they buy to stock the supermarkets, they buy the real products and not the papers aka known as futures contracts) you might buy forward and that is known as the "forward market" as opposed to "futures market" (to repeat, in the futures market you trade in papers, futures contracts).</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><br></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">So if NTUC takes a gamble and buy rice forward (in October) for December delivery but Cold Storage did not and the price of rice rises in December (when Cold Storage place the order), then NTUC will just sell at the same price as Cold Storage, the higher price and make extraordinary profits.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">If the price falls in December, then Cold Storage (having placed the order in December) will be able to sell at the lower price (lower as compared to if the price had risen) but NTUC (having paid a higher price because they took the bet in October and buy for December delivery), </span><span style="color: #ff0000; font-weight: bold;">with their political clout can raise prices by 21% and pass the price rise to you the silliporeans.</span></p>

              <p>In advance countries, you can sell the excess electricity you generate (say from solar power) back to the grid (you supply instead of buying) and get paid for it.</p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><br></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">I think maybe if Dr Chee Soon Juan is the Prime Minister, then maybe these kind of just and fair practices will come into effect in Singapore and you can almost be 100% sure that the present regime will abhor such things as the people selling electricity to the power company.</span></span></p>

              <p>suppose today  i buy a commodity 3 months forward at $100 and spot prices are at $95. Next month spot prices drop to $70. It would make sense to you next month that i bought at $100 which is $30 above market prices...fact is i bought it this month already.</p>

              <p>It doesn't make sense to forward-buy fuel at $65 above current
              market prices.  Perhaps they're not buying forwards at all,
              but are instead *anticipating* that high price in the near
              future?  Either way the customers pay the translated price of
              $155 when the actual price is $90 or so.</p>

              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">er... the $90 you are referring to US Nymex crude in US$? The $155 is SGD, USD and for what, Light Sweet or Refined Crude, "Fuel"? You cannot use crude oil, unrefined for fuel. If you want to attck the asspots and their asspolicies, you must do it intelligently and truthfully.</span></span></p>

              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Say you bought forward at a
              high price but because the prices have been dropping so sharply,
              you can average the high price you bought earlier with the lower
              forward prices you buy later.</span></p>

              <p>Ok, we are very unhappy abt this price hike, but apart from ranting and raving in forums, what else can we do? Switch to candles and kinetic energy? Refuse to to pay the hiked-up price and wait for the penalty? Protest on the street and wait to be jailed? When our PM, MP and even opposition party member, pple who r supposed to "represent/help" us, all sit there watching quietly, wat can we do?</p>
              <p>LL work harder to earn more money for them to squeeze lor... =p</p>
              <p>And they call the people who managed to escape from this dictatorial country a quitter...Go figure...</p>
