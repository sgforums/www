Then, he goes up to pump attendant and says:<br>Kneel down or else...<br><span class="large">MAN GOES BERSERK AT SENGKANG PETROL STATION </span><br>By Arul John </strong><br><br><strong>September 01, 2007    </strong><br><br>MAYHEM at Sengkang.<br><br>Petrol pump attendant Vikinesh Muniandy pointing to the junction where the man ran up and down hitting cars.<br>That summed up the scene at a Shell petrol station.<br><br>In one hour, a man scared off passing motorists, pulled windscreen wipers off two cars and even forced a pump attendant to kneel on the ground.<br><br>He even attacked a police car, before being arrested.<br><br>It is not known why he behaved so violently.<br><br>The drama took place on Tuesday morning, near the petrol station on Sengkang East Road.<br><br>Mr Randy Tan, 40, manager of a car servicing and repair centre within the petrol station, said the man used to buy newspapers and other reading materials at the petrol station once or twice a week.<br><br>He said the man, who sports short grey hair, was tall and tanned and wore a dark blue T-shirt and dark blue pants.<br><br>Mr Tan said: 'It was raining heavily. At about 9.30am, I saw the man running to and fro across the road in front of the petrol station.'<br><br>Pictures are video stills taken off a witnessÃ¢Â€Â™ handphone<br>Mr Tan said the man stopped at a pedestrian crossing and shouted at the passing cars.<br><br>HIT CARS WITH HANDS<br><br>'The traffic lights turned red and the cars stopped. There were three cars, one in each lane. The man used his hands to hit the windscreens of the cars in the first and second lanes. He then pulled out their windscreen wipers and used the wipers to do more damage to the cars.<br><br>'I called 999 and saw that some of our customers were driving their cars further into our centre to protect themselves from the man,' he said.<br><br>S-league footballer Muhd Nurizam Azman, 20, who was refuelling his motorcycle at the time, said the man used one of the windshield wipers he had pulled off to damage the windscreen of a white car in the third lane.<br><br>'The driver of the white car reversed and turned his car to get away from the man. The car hit the man slightly and he fell onto the opposite kerb. The car then drove off.'<br><br>Mr Tan said the man, holding a book in one hand and a windscreen wiper in the other, walked into the petrol station and shouted loudly in English and Chinese.<br><br>He said the man used the wiper to dent a green Honda Civic that was entering the petrol station.<br><br>Petrol pump attendant Vikinesh Muniandy, 20, said: 'When they saw what the man was doing, many of the staff ran away to hide in various places. Some of our customers drove off quickly.<br><br>'The man then walked into the station and saw one of the attendants, who had been working only for a few days.<br><br>'He told him in English 'You, kneel down!' and the terrified boy knelt down in the centre of the station.<br><br>'After that, he walked off and the attendant got up. But he was still shaking after the incident.'<br><br>Mr Tan said a police car arrived at the scene but the man hit and damaged its windscreen with the wiper he was still holding.<br><br>A woman in her 20s, who was at the scene when the drama unfolded, said the man even danced in front of the car before damaging it. The woman, who did not want to be named, said the officers asked for reinforcements.<br><br>VERY STRONG<br><br>She said: 'Then he walked towards the entrance of the petrol station and knelt down on the road.'<br><br>The woman said two police cars soon arrived and three police officers went to nab the man.<br><br>She said: 'He was very strong and the officers had to use all their strength to subdue him. The man kept shouting and tried to run away. They handcuffed him outside the servicing centre.'<br><br>A police spokesman said they were informed at 9.30am on Tuesday about a man shouting at cars on Sengkang East Way.<br><br>When the officers arrived at the scene, they saw a man in his early 40s with a windscreen wiper in his hand.<br><br>The spokesman said the man, who lived in the vicinity, was believed to have damaged three cars, and was arrested for vandalism.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>1 Police officers surround the man, who is kneeling on the road<br><br>2 Several officers move in to subdue the man<br><br>3 The man is handcuffed and taken away<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This really shows how Singaporeans are like. No one, not the even the car owners, did a damn thing abt it despite seeing him damaging several cars. Rather several people chose to 'run away' from the incident. Well, I guess this is why the criminals in JB treat us, Singaporeans, as such an easy target. The Bruneis and the Thais never have problem crossing over to shop in Malaysia.<br><br>With this kind of mentality, I wonder if we are at war, how many of us will stay and fight for the country.</div>
