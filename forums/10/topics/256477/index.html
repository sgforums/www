            <div class='col-md body'>I had posted an earlier post "Poor Service at SGH'.<br><br><a href="http://sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=254178" rel="nofollow">http://sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=254178</a><br><br>Well,thanks to them giving me instructions to take medicine properly,i've now got an infection at the wound area that has disabled its healing.The wound is still raw,no skin has come over it,bleeds a little.Stitching did not help at all.I was prescribed the medicine Co-Amoxiclav.And i was told to take it 'With Or After Food'.<br><br>Then yesterday they took out my stitches after 2 weeks.First week i was prescribed Co-Amoxiclav when i had went to A&amp;E on the 11th of may,medication was for a week.They had to told me take if like mentioned 'with or after food'.So i went back for my first appointment on the 18th and doc said wound for some reason had not healed and gave me another week of mc and appointment.That time the doc gave me a new set of antibiotics.<br><br>So yesterday i went back which was on the 25th and had my stitches out,doc could still ask me 'why haven't heal ah?'.I could just stare at him.Then he gave me Co-Amoxiclav again.And instructions were take it with or after food.He said i had to do daily dressing myself.But i went to my family doc today whom my family has been going to for nearly 25 years now.Then i showed him the medicine and when he saw the label that said with or after food he told me 'You wanted to know why the wound never heal right? This medicine supposed to take BEFORE food,at least 1 hour before,not after,you take after it would hardly have any effect at all.No wonder the stitches did not help you'.I was really shocked.<br><br>I came home and went to the net and googled Co-Amoxiclav and came across the website <a href="http://www.patient.co.uk/showdoc/30003152/" rel="nofollow">http://www.patient.co.uk/showdoc/30003152/</a>.Imagine my pain now,wound still raw,so much pain i am in.All thanks to SGH.I wonder how it is for other patients with even more serious infections.<br><br>Below is the pic of my medicine lable.It is abit blurred but can be seen.<br><br><a href="http://i193.photobucket.com/albums/z173/anfieldroad_2007/as.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i193.photobucket.com/albums/z173/anfieldroad_2007/as.jpg</a></div>

It doesn't apply across the board... but I'm not a doctor, I can't say if one doesn't work, doing the opposite will.<br><br>Still eggprata has to see another doctor to check on his wound.

            <div class='col-md body'>honestly, taking augmentin or any other antiobiotics before or after food is not really a big issue. with food, augmentin or (co-amoxiclav) is easier on the stomach with less side effects...<br><br>more likely reasons that wound is not healing?<br>1. antibiotic not working because of bacterial resistance; ie need to change to another type of antibiotics<br>2. insufficient dose.. (taken twice a day, augmentin is actually very low dose.. sometimes u need up to three to 4 tabs /day ) to even make a difference<br><br>3. remnant unresolve wound problems e.g. unremoved stitches, deep seated bad infections that may need to be drained surgically<br><br>4. other poor skin healing factors e.g. genetically poor ability to heal, immune compromised (e.g. on long term steroids, diabetes,  AIDs etc)<br><br>fyi</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi, eggprata, may I ask which specialty and doctor you went to in SGH?  Is the doctor a medical officer, registrar, consultant or senior consultant?<br><br>Not to surprise to hear about your incident.  I ever come across a doctor who labelled the wrong test results and how careless or can't be bothered they are when they do ward duties.<br><br>Please be a great help by posting this incident on other websites as well so that people can be more careful when they visit SGH.   If you wanna go public hospital, don't go SGH, go to Tan tock seng.  TTSH has better service.<br><br>Hope you recover soon!  Good luck!<br></div>
