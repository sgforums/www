            <div class='col-md body'>The TS received an antibiotic that combines two drugs, amoxicillin (a type of penicillin) and clavulanic acid, a beta-lactamase inhibitor. The latter inhibits the breakdown of amoxicillin by some bacteria that are resistant through the production of lactamase, an enzyme that breaks down the antibiotic.<br>This combination is effective against a wide range of bacteria and has been used for more than a decade.<br><br>As for the pharmacokinetics,  amoxicillin has greater oral bioavailability compared to PenV and ampicillin. This is what the FDA says:<br><br>"Approximately 74-92% of a single dose of amoxicillin is absorbed while approximately 60-70% of an oral penicillin V dose and 30-55% of an oral ampicillin dose are absorbed. Peak serum amoxicillin concentrations (Cmax) are reached 1-2 hours after an oral dose of the capsules, film-coated tablets, chewable tablets, or oral suspension <strong>in fasting and non-fasting adults</strong>. Non-linearity in absorption of amoxicillin has been reported when increasing doses of 250mg, 500mg, and 1000mg of amoxicillin were administered to fasting adults. A significant reduction in the percentage of the dose absorbed was observed for the 1000mg dose (5)."<br>(<a href="http://www.fda.gov/cder/drugprepare/amox-anthrax.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.fda.gov/cder/drugprepare/amox-anthrax.htm</a>)<br><br>The clavulanic acid component is shown not to interfere with the absorption of amoxicillin and vice versa. However, oral absorption of clavulanic acid can be highly variable (<a href="http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=14518475" rel="nofollow">http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=14518475</a>).<br><br>The bio-availability of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid combination has been shown to be unaffected by food. Here's an abstract of a study done to address this very question:<br><br>"AugmentinÂ’, the novel antibiotic formulation containing the ÃŸ-lactamase inhibitor, clavulanic acid, and the -lactam antibiotic, amoxycillin, has been the subject of two studies reported here on bioavailability and tolerance.<br><br>Eighteen subjects took part in a two-part crossover study to compare the bioavailability when taken fasting and with food. <strong>The bioavailability was shown to be unimpaired when taken with food</strong>.<br><br>Forty-five healthy subjects took part in a series of crossover studies to compare the tolerance of Â‘AugmentinÂ’ taken fasting and with food. Â‘AugmentinÂ’ was also compared with cephalexin under the same conditions. <strong>The gastro-intestinal side effects reported in these volunteer studies, which are rare in clinical practice, were reduced when Â‘AugmentinÂ’ was taken with food.</strong> "<br><br>(Staniforth DH, Lillystone RJ, Jackson D.  Effect of food on the bioavailability and tolerance of clavulanic acid/amoxycillin combination. Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy (1982) 10, 131-139)<br><br>In other words, this antibiotic combination can be taken either before or after meals. It does not matter to the bioavailability. However, because some people get tummy upset as a side effect of this antibiotic, the recommendation is to take it with food to reduce that side effect.<br><br>There are many reasons why the antibiotic did not work as well as it did. First, the bacteria may not be sensitive to the antibiotic. Perhaps the wound was infected with a bacteria that is not sensitive to this antibiotic or surgical debridement is needed. The medication the TS received sounds like a generic rather than Augmentin (the original 'branded' drug). Depending on where it was manufactured, the formulation and bioavailability may differ.<br><br></div>

Hey, I have been receiving negative feedback about the doctors there.<br><br>Do do cautious when you are approached to take blood.  It happened when my neighbour brought her husband to see the doctor.  Doctor/nurse asked patient to sign the form to take blood, when asked he said it is nothing just sign the form.  My neighbour sensed something wrong and read the form carefully then realised it was a consent form requesting for blood from patients for research.  AFter knowing what it was about, my neighbour was infuriated and told the doctor and nurse off.  Doctor put the blame on the nurse.  My neighbour was very angry that the doctor and nurse were trying to trick her husband into signing the form by not knowingly giving permission for them to take blood from him..  It is plain deception.  She asked the husband not to sign the form (husband is chinese educated, understand very little of English).  See the way they stoop so low to get what they want, scary!!! Be careful people!<br><br>Don't go SGH they provide nasty and bad service!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by oxford mushroom:<br><strong>The TS received an antibiotic that combines two drugs, amoxicillin (a type of penicillin) and clavulanic acid, a beta-lactamase inhibitor. The latter inhibits the breakdown of amoxicillin by some bacteria that are resistant through the production of lactamase, an enzyme that breaks down the antibiotic.<br>This combination is effective against a wide range of bacteria and has been used for more than a decade.<br><br>As for the pharmacokinetics,  amoxicillin has greater oral bioavailability compared to PenV and ampicillin. This is what the FDA says:<br><br>"Approximately 74-92% of a single dose of amoxicillin is absorbed while approximately 60-70% of an oral penicillin V dose and 30-55% of an oral ampicillin dose are absorbed. Peak serum amoxicillin concentrations (Cmax) are reached 1-2 hours after an oral dose of the capsules, film-coated tablets, chewable tablets, or oral suspension [b]in fasting and non-fasting adults</strong>. Non-linearity in absorption of amoxicillin has been reported when increasing doses of 250mg, 500mg, and 1000mg of amoxicillin were administered to fasting adults. A significant reduction in the percentage of the dose absorbed was observed for the 1000mg dose (5)."<br>(<a href="http://www.fda.gov/cder/drugprepare/amox-anthrax.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.fda.gov/cder/drugprepare/amox-anthrax.htm</a>)<br><br>The clavulanic acid component is shown not to interfere with the absorption of amoxicillin and vice versa. However, oral absorption of clavulanic acid can be highly variable (<a href="http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=14518475" rel="nofollow">http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=14518475</a>).<br><br>The bio-availability of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid combination has been shown to be unaffected by food. Here's an abstract of a study done to address this very question:<br><br>"AugmentinÂ’, the novel antibiotic formulation containing the ÃŸ-lactamase inhibitor, clavulanic acid, and the -lactam antibiotic, amoxycillin, has been the subject of two studies reported here on bioavailability and tolerance.<br><br>Eighteen subjects took part in a two-part crossover study to compare the bioavailability when taken fasting and with food. <strong>The bioavailability was shown to be unimpaired when taken with food</strong>.<br><br>Forty-five healthy subjects took part in a series of crossover studies to compare the tolerance of Â‘AugmentinÂ’ taken fasting and with food. Â‘AugmentinÂ’ was also compared with cephalexin under the same conditions. <strong>The gastro-intestinal side effects reported in these volunteer studies, which are rare in clinical practice, were reduced when Â‘AugmentinÂ’ was taken with food.</strong> "<br><br>(Staniforth DH, Lillystone RJ, Jackson D.  Effect of food on the bioavailability and tolerance of clavulanic acid/amoxycillin combination. Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy (1982) 10, 131-139)<br><br>In other words, this antibiotic combination can be taken either before or after meals. It does not matter to the bioavailability. However, because some people get tummy upset as a side effect of this antibiotic, the recommendation is to take it with food to reduce that side effect.<br><br>There are many reasons why the antibiotic did not work as well as it did. First, the bacteria may not be sensitive to the antibiotic. Perhaps the wound was infected with a bacteria that is not sensitive to this antibiotic or surgical debridement is needed. The medication the TS received sounds like a generic rather than Augmentin (the original 'branded' drug). Depending on where it was manufactured, the formulation and bioavailability may differ.<br><br>[/b]</blockquote>Frankly, "jljl" would be more of a doctor than you. Compare his/her reply to yours, you just cut and paste loads of crap to sound intelligent, that's what non-intelligent people need to prove. By putting so much medical jargon into your replies, goes to show how stupid you are. When you go see a doctor, is the doctor going to tell you about bioavailability, cephalexin, clavulanic acid and beta-lactamase.<br><br>Compare with jljl's reply:<br><br>honestly, taking augmentin or any other antiobiotics before or after food is not really a big issue. with food, augmentin or (co-amoxiclav) is easier on the stomach with less side effects...<br><br>more likely reasons that wound is not healing?<br>1. antibiotic not working because of bacterial resistance; ie need to change to another type of antibiotics<br><br>2. insufficient dose.. (taken twice a day, augmentin is actually very low dose.. sometimes u need up to three to 4 tabs /day ) to even make a difference<br><br>3. remnant unresolve wound problems e.g. unremoved stitches, deep seated bad infections that may need to be drained surgically<br><br>4. other poor skin healing factors e.g. genetically poor ability to heal, immune compromised (e.g. on long term steroids, diabetes, AIDs etc)<br><br>fyi<br><br>OM, you are a sad delusional individual, who has high ambition of being a doctor but failed.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Doctors who prescribe medicines actually follow the clinical chart closely. To give a right dosage, patients are monitored closely on hourly basis or daily basis. Antibiotics are meant to fight bad bacteria in the body. If its a viral infection, then probably the antibodies in the body are not enough to fight the fever or any other infections in the body. For dressing purpose, personal hygiene and they way you handle the wound is very important. Cross-infection can occur if you don't handle properly.</div>
