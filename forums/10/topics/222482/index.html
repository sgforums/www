If those students are here on scholarships, are they not better than those who are just making the grades at border line? I seriously doubt so.<br><br>That being said, if you do well enough, you will still make it through the cut. Getting into a school is not an entitlement; just as not every one with good grades deserves a scholarship.<br><br>Even if you do not have a good education, there are still bountiful opportunities to succeed.<br><br>FYI, I was a polytechnic graduate but that did not stop me from earning my degree and making my mark in my career.<br><br>I am glad that I have that opportunity as long as I work hard. In some places, even if you are smart and you work hard, you may not have the opportunity.</div>

Most, no matter how capable and resourceful, will find it hard to stand against the sheer power of the government machinery. Of course, overseas, where the playing field is more level, our government does less well e.g. NTUC's overseas ventures.</div>
