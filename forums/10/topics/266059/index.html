            <div class='col-md body'>i think some of the crack appear because the foundations were not well laid.<br>A parallel is China. Look at them trying to progress and doing everything in the name of progress. Look at the cost to human lives and environment. However the comparison is unfair. China has a bigger base and a longer history and culture to fall back on (hopefully). Singapore didn't have much history or even identity and even less resource. Everyday, there are lesser singapore born singaporeans. I am always shy to tell anyone when in a foreign country, I am from singapore. Especially now with all the nonsense, insult and conflict our govt created with high-than-thou talk of other countries.<br></div>
