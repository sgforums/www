            <div class='col-md body'>Living a life of aplenty... but with nothing much to share...<br>Human misery every generation... the consequence of human immorality... a stain in human history.<br>Why?<br><br>-- The eras of explosives and combustibles:<br>Hath led to soldiers on horseback fighting amongst themselves. Kingdoms behaving like barbarians and conquering each other's territory.<br><br>-- The eras of flight, petroleum and electricity:<br>Arrogance led Hitler to declare WW2, and led US to enter the Vietnam War. The people believed too much in the promises of their governments, only to be betrayed with the horrors and bereavements that only war could bring. Hitler the failure, ultimately committed murder and suicide by cyanide poisoning.<br><br>-- The eras of Technology and petroleum use:<br>Hath led to USA's military arrogance and thus it's premature and unwarranted venture into Iraq (no WMDs found), resulting in untold dismay by the Muslim community with Western 'meddling'.<br><br>-- And now we are faced with an exhaustion of oil resources within the next 50yrs (and probably our resultant regression): shall we reverse history and backdate ourselves with a few more successive wars? ... Yes Humans are one day set to become extinct too!<br><br>And well said are the phrases<br>"All that is necessary for evil to succeed is that the good men do nothing" ~ Edmund Burke.<br><br>"The world is a dangerous place, not because of those who do evil, but because of those who look on and do nothing" ~ Albert Einstein.<br><br>So it is the people's fault that they are being led by Belligerent Barbarians (leaders), and so it is the people's woe that they are treated like the underclass or even like animals.<br><br>Blame it on their poor education, blame it on poverty, and blame it upon the depressed state that all your classmates/ friends are in, best of all, BLAME OURSELVES!<br><br>And SHAME ON YOU: Singaporeans who do just nothin'.<br><br>What is really happening is that GRC is making Singapore elections very 'undemocratic', and Singaporeans are selfishly not doing their 'duty to country' either by voting myopically for their own SELFISH PRIVILEGE to 'priority access' to National funds through the 'constituency upgrading' scheme during national elections.<br>And Taiwanese and HongKongers are being bullied by father China.<br>Why?: do your duty: find out the truth on the internet.<br><br>And a rising trend in Suicides is NOT a good sign either: it is a sign of depression, nonchalance, dismay&gt; and if you simply factored in hatred then wala wala: you are now faced with a suicide terrorist! &gt; Not a good encounter for the faint hearted.<br><br>Point is that: All Singaporeans should be concerned about the state of the world today.<br>Don't say you don't care.<br>Don't say don't know.<br>Don't say PAP knows everything (because they'd already admitted that they don't, and neither is their GRC system of elections democratic)<br>Live your life with pride, live your dreams and do your best, you have the right to contribute what is good and right and to stop moping/ hiding at home.<br>You have the right to "Heal the world, make it a better place, for U and for Me and the entire Human race...." ~ (Michael Jackson).<br>You have the right to contribute.<br>You have the right to live a life of plenty, but don't forget your duty to share.<br><br>So based upon my observation, here are some of my comments:<br>1) The world is becoming more divided, and elitist.<br>Some have access to education, energy and technology, others less and many have none. Those who are already advanced tend to become much more advanced but those who are not will continue to scrape the Earth to live miserably.<br><br>So: We should raise the ceiling of i.e. income taxes to 80% beyond certain amounts e.g. on any income exceeding US$18million/ annum (lower tax brackets prevail for the respective amounts). Raising of inheritance/ cooperate taxes could too be in the making.&gt; so the rich could too contribute to humanity in general: in an obvious, transparent and mandatory manner. (Give them the credit if they wish): and these taxes will somewhat curb the elitist mentality that has so divided our society.<br><br>2) Scrap GRC in Singapore: (it does NOT= democracy). It is like a corrupt 'means test', a means test that benefits only the rich and powerful political parties (queer rite?) It says that you must form groups of 6 (and deposit a large sum of $money) to be able to contest in a constituency (during national elections)&gt; ridiculously undemocratic policy if U ask me.....<br>Such a policy only serves to make PAP MPs lazy and ineffective and stunts our political maturity because (1) MPs become obliged not to upset/ hurry PAP elite ministers for fear of loss opportunity of being 'walkover elected' next round. (Loose pension if one serves only one round).<br><br>So: Dutiful Singaporeans should all explain to their MPs how harmful and corrupt the GRC system really is.<br><br>3) The world is advancing at an incredible pace; Singaporeans must keep up with the pace of change (I do not mean buying the latest Hp). Singaporeans must become more concerned and educated about worldly affairs e.g. terrorism and its causes, poverty (world), global warming, SARS etc. The a/m example on suicide rate shows that such a statistic also has its consequence on suicide terrorism. We live on a small island and mostly we live perched high above the ground, no oil/ electricity and we (and our entire economy) mati kiao kiao liao&gt; (we will all die from hunger, 'homelessness' etc) so fragile Singaporeans, let us unite, so that together our 'little red dot' can brighten up this dark and fearful world.<br><br>So: Singaporeans must stop wallowing in self pity; compared to the terrorists who willingly DIE for their cause, how much effort are we willing to put into our good causes? Are you willing to do your best?<br><br>4) Ok, Iv'e said my lot for today; now's the time to worry if the SG ISD will knock on my door, confiscate my computer and jail me for subversive behaviour.<br><br>But I mean good, so please wish me good luck, you may mail me your comments.<br><br>Disclaimer: I might be crazy and my facts untrue, you really have to discern the truth yourself.<br><br>With Love:<br>From:<br>Your friendly neighbour: The friendly little green Barbarian living next door.<br><br></div>
