              <p><strong>Written by Our Correspondent</strong></p>
              <p>Malaysia’s controversial national education programme conducted by its National Civics Bureau – the Biro Tata Negara or BTN has come under fire again for its racist agenda to promulgate the concept of “Ketuanan Melayu” or Malay superiority.</p>
              <p>The programme is intended to instill nationalistic values and patriotism in university students on public scholarships and civil servants. The BTN is under the charge of the Prime Minister’s Department.</p>
              <p>The Selangor state government controlled by the opposition Pakatan Rakyat coalition has banned its civil servants, employees of state subsidiaries and students at state-owned education institutions from attending any BTN courses.</p>
              <p>Selangor state executive council member Dr Halimah Ali said described BTN programmes as “indoctrination by the Barisan Nasional (BN) government”.</p>
              <p><em>“The courses promote racism and my own children who have attended BTN have been given booklets that encourage hate towards the opposition. The programmes are not positive to young minds, and are a waste of money which could have used to foster real unity,”</em> she said.</p>
              <p>The camp would usually take place during the weekends. Students would have to register early in the morning and the programme would last the whole day.</p>
              <p>Malaysian Insider journalist Asrul Hadi Abdullah Sani wrote that he has learn the “meaning of hate” from the BTN course during which a speaker said that the Chinese community were “the Jews of Asia” and were just itching to take over when Malays were disunited and broken.</p>
              <p>According to Asrul, the speaker also revealed a greater Chinese conspiracy where the Chinese Malaysians were working together with Singapore to topple the Malay government.</p>
              <p><em>“Do you want to become like the Malays in Singapore?” </em>he asked.</p>
              <p>About 15 per cent of Singapore’s population are Malays. Singapore was once part of the Malaysian Federation between the years 1963 to 1965.</p>
              <p>After Singapore separated from Malaysia in August 1965, the Prime Minister of Malaysia, Tunku Abdul Rahman offered Malays in Singapore land in Johor should they want to relocate there. Few took up the offer.</p>
              <p>Over the years, Malaysian leaders such as Tun Dr Mahathir had consistently harped on the “plight” of the ethnic Malays in Chinese-dominated Singapore.</p>
              <p>Surprisingly, though Malays in Malaysia are given special privileges under the government’s affirmative action plan – the New Economic Policy (NEP), few Malays in Singapore have migrated to Malaysia.</p>
              <p>On the contrary, countless of Malaysian Chinese flocked to find work in Singapore with many of them becoming Singapore citizens, leading to a brain drain for Malaysia.</p>
              <p>Malaysia’s Prime Minister Datuk Najib Razak noted that half the number of medical specialists at Singapore’s Mount Elizabeth Hospital are Malaysians during his recent visit to attend the APEC Summit.</p>
              <p>Malaysia’s Chinese now constitutes only 25 per cent of the population, down from 40 per cent in the 1960s.</p>
              <p>Many of Singapore’s first-generation leaders are born in Malaysia such as its former deputy Prime Minister Dr Toh Chin Chye (Taiping, Perak), Finance Minister Goh Keng Swee (Malacca) and Home Affairs Minister Ong Pang Boon (Kuala Lumpur).</p>
              <p>Singapore’s present health minister Mr Khaw Boon Wan was born in Penang. The CEO of Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund Temasek Holdings and the wife of Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong hails from Kuala Lumpur.</p>

              <p>It is very rare that you can find a clean and above board politician.</p>
              <p>Politics / politicians in Asia are generally dirty.</p>
              <p>You can say that of our very own MIW.</p>
              <p>They certainly have one of the MOST DIRTIEST Leader in the world.</p>
              <p>It will be hard to select a winner between HIM and his buddy, Robert Gabriel Mugabe of Zimbabwe.</p>

              <p>No lah, 50 yo where got old, see many older than 50yo coming here to find girls, everyday disturb me, that is why i asked my Dad to sell the house and move to Changi, in Joo Chiat and Geyland many tiko peks and uncles, i wait at bus stop also ask me what is the price???? Damn, spoil my day!!!</p>
              <p>I think from a young person perspective, 50yo is not consider too young and not too old too, middle age, as for 60yo, they should be in their golden age. But no matter what age, as long as they behave gracefully, dress well, talk with wisdoms and understanding, i call them big men. If you look at the caucasian, at 50 yo, they are still very handsome and manly, like Richard Gere, and that old guy, Sean Connery, so manly with a tough man voice that can sink most aunties heart...but our chinese, by 50++, all look haggered.</p>

              <p>For the "Attention Seeking Whore" that is the alter-ego of the Taiwanese "hum" - and with both looking for the attention to clip its "clits" that it will deliberately hang out of its cockle shell - should it be complaining of any men from any age that are willing to approach the filth of the Taiwanese "hum" ?</p>
