            <div class='col-md body'>The Government tried to break our bank accounts by encouraging us to take risks and invest our money.  What happened as a result of that?  Thousands lost their future retirement money in useless investments.  More than 90% LOST MONEY!<br><br>Now that Singaporeans got smarter and investing less, Government is worried.  Singaporeans have too much  cash,  that is  not goood for their plans for us.<br><br>So here comes the casino idea -  this is a sure winner tool to make more Singaporeans  bankrupt.<br><br>Did you notice that Turf club betting centers are quietly creeping into HDB towns?<br><br>I dont make sense?<br><br>Let me  put  it this way - the philosophy of Our Dear Leader is this -<br><br>Singaporeans must mostly remain cashless.<br><br>Why?<br><br>That way, Singaporeans, especially  ordinary  workers, have to work harder and longer hours - to keep up  with the high cost of living which government refuses to bring down.  Prices that went up  never come down, esp PUB.<br><br>The more we work, the more we earned - will  benefit  Government... CPF, income taxes, COEs etc....<br><br>That's why PAP Goovernment dont allow a welfare state.<br><br>And now they are bringing in the foreign workers to drive us to worker harder for less wages!<br><br>Get the big picture now?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi All,<br><br>The solution of this problem is very simple:<br>1. All anti-casino camps, vote for the opposition in the 2007 general election, make your votes count, oust the PAP from it's long grip on power.<br>2. All pro-casino camps, vote gullibly for the PAP and let them build the casino. Maybe then you'll see the effect of the casino.<br><br>Regards<br><br></div>
