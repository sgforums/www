            <div class='col-md body'>What I feel is that, even if the society is really matured and acting responsibly, there is no reason why we need to tempt them to be otherwise right? Its just like this story once about this town who trust everyone in the town because they believe everyone will not steal from one another and so leaves their door open even if they go out. True enough, no one steals from one another for a long time, but one day someone finally strikes. So my point is that, just because we are responsible, the government do not have to be responsible to help us keep our sense of responsibility?<br><br>And thats ASSUMING we are really a responsible and matured society.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Long long ago, a small town managed to be on their own. the village head think 'its better to get the town going ASAP, i should also prevent them from gambling so as to prevent them from losing $ and cause instability'. time goes by, the small town florished and many of the better-well-offs went to neighbouring town to invest their extra $....then the village head thought 'hmmmm, this isn't good, i should tax them abit for everything, dis way it will enable the council to recoup the loss'.<br><br>a few yrs later he realised dat things doesn't work out cos there are still many people who went to neighbouring town to buy things dat are tax-free. again he raised the tax again and again but it doesn't seem to be enough ($ is never enough). then he thought of a casino which is a 100% sure-win business but were afraid of repercussions such that the poor will be poorer. so he only wanted the rich to go in so tat the poor will not get poorer and the rich will of cos bet mroe and the payoff (to the council, not the player) will be higher. this way amount of $ going out of the country will be reduced. he thought of excuses like 'tourist attraction' and other pull-the-wool-over-their-eyes reason. nonetheless, the town's tabloids were all actually under the council's direct control although its indirect as seen from the outside. therefore prior to the casino being built, there will be discussions going on but the end result has been fixed, just waiting for the time to publish them irregardless of wat the poll end up since the real result will only be known to the council.<br><br>as expected, there will be persons who will win alot from the casino on the 1st few days and the tabloids will publish them on the frontpage to encourage the richer ones to try their luck. there will also be people posting in forums saying how easy it is to win $ from the casino.<br><br>* story is fictitious. any resemblence is pure coincidental.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I dun quite understand why many Singaporeans are so against having a Casino. Look around you, you have 4D, Singapore pools for soccer, toto, big sweep and Turf club for horse racing bets. We have legal jackpot machines all over Singapore in sports and social clubs. Its so common to see it in Singapore. Then, we  have our traditional mahjong among friends who also bet(otherwise no kick/fun to play).<br><br>There already are venues to gamble in Casinos outside of Singapore. If you're a hardcore gambler, you will find a way to gamble anyways. Just like a smoker who wants to smoke, raise it to $20, people will still smoke.<br><br>The benefits of having a Casino in Singapore is really Singapore's last trump card to use. You must remember Singapore has NO resources, only people and good geographical location for shipping. With a casino, they want to attract tourist and foreigners to come gamble and maybe live in Singapore for a few weeks. Increase attractions like a BIG TIME theme park. What does this mean? This mean jobs... not just 1000 or 2000, this is prolly 10,000 and almost every sector of the economy does well, the services sector, hotel, restaurants, airport, our poor taxis with no passengers... countless.<br><br>My last point, complain all you want about having the casino. WE ARE GOING TO HAVE IT!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by KumSioJui:</div><div class="quote_body">I think personally casino is good for us.<br><br>For years we concentrated on tourism, our neighbours had natural resources and they concentrated on those.

CFP withdrawal limit is setting higher. this is to ensure older people have enough to spent when they are old. but as far as i know, normally older ppl tends to spent the most time inside casino but they cant spent more time inside turf club betting station wondering what to bet.<br><br>2. promoting family oriented working environment.<br>if the parents go to casino how to spent more time with the family. children wont be allow to enter and parent addicted. causing more problem family.<br><br>3. those who voted in for it are the inmature one. such as drugs. if self control is the key i beg govt to also loosen control on pornograhic and drugs control. afterall after they shake their off eating ecasty they only kill themselves. isnt that self control too? if govt really need revenue, tax those drug dealer and legalise them.  anyway singapore is few govt in asia that legalise prostitution isnt it??<br><br>frankly all those good points such as create jobs, promote tourism, increase revenue for govtwhich he say is true. but whether we need a casino to achieve all the mention few pts deserve us to question ourselves.<br><br></div></blockquote>Personally I dont think Singaporeans need to get so paranoid about having a Casino in Singapore. First and foremost, gambling is not something new in this country. For example 4D, TOTO, Horse Racing, Football betting etc have been around for years, and every weekend it is common to an individual placing thousand of dollars at each race or bet. Do we classified this as "SAFER" form of gambling?<br><br>The purpose of having a casino here should not be seen as trying to promote gambling or making Singapore a gambling hub. Because what our gov is trying to do here is to help Singapore maintain its airhub status. As we all know that in order for us to maintain our existing position, we will need to constantly come out with new attraction to attract air travellers into Singapore and make singapore their preferred transit or stop over point. So far Singapore has been very successful because our government have been pouring billions of dollars into upgrading its airport, transport facilities, shopping and entertainment district etc. But if you have been reading the news, you will realise that countries like Malaysia and Thailand have also invested billions of dollars trying to duplicate what Singapore is doing. It is only a matters of a few years before Bangkok will have it brand new International Airport to rival Singapore. And in term of shopping and entertainment, I am sure it is more exciting and cheaper there.<br><br>I believe the only way for Singapore to stay ahead is to create something BIG and exciting in Singapore. And having a huge amusement, resort cum casino park at sentosa is definitely going to bring excitiment into this tiny island.<br><br>If you have travelled to genting or Las Vegas, you will agree with me that not everybody there is there because of the gambling, and majority are there mainly to enjoy the atmosphere, food and entertainment.<br><br>Some might say that we can still attract visitors without a casino, but have they ask themselves how are they going to get foreign companies to invest billions of dollars in Sentosa if there is no money to be made.<br><br>Will the same people be happy if Singapore government decide to use our tax payer money to build another BIG white elephant in Sentosa. I am sure many will complain like what they did when we build the 600 million dollars Esplanade by marina bay.<br><br>Like it or not, I am quite sure the casino will go ahead. Just wait for the "good" news!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br></div>

There are many in tourism related industries and they have for a number of years not been doing well.<br><br>if are against having a casino like so many who are, mebbe you shud offer some constructive ideas how we can make tourist to spend more and stay here longer instead of critising all the time.<br><br>In fact until today I have yet to hear of anybody giving a viable alternative to having a casino to improve tourism here.</div>
