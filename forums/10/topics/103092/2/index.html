            <div class='col-md body'>now now..lets not be biased or whatever. Lets just allow a independent analyst to list out the advantages and disadvantages of having a Casino in Singapore. Then, the report will be published independently from a independent press. In that way, nobody will complain that our newspapers are biased.

In other words, it means that when a Casino is built on Sentosa for the rich, there will at least be a slight rise in social problems. For those who support the Casino, face it, problems will arise. But wait, is the government going to be ignorant about this problem? Or are they going to look for ways to solve this problem.

I believe what our government is trying to do is for the better good of Singapore. As you can see from some of my posting, I am an anti PAP citizen in Singapore, and it is clear that I am not a pro PAP kind of person. However if you can see good reasons and benefit from PAP policy, I believe it is only right to support it.<br><br>Some forumers have mentioned that having a casino in Singapore will eventually benefit our millionaire MPs. But one have to understand that even without the casino, they will still be a millionaire. Therefore there is no reason why MPs would want to sneak their head out to gain bad publicity for gaining nothing.<br><br>I hope Singaporeans would be able to see things from a wider perspective, because Singapore is going through a major transition and at the same time, we are facing intense competition from our neighbor countries . As long as we do our best to discourage hardcore gambling, majority of the gain from this casino project will be paid by foreigners and not just Singaporeans.<br><br>Ask yourself this question, would you rather have a "perfect" society or to have Singapore going into major recession?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>indeed Singapore's economy might benefit. But will it be a short term or long term benefit? Since the casino is a man-made entertainment,sure, decades to come there will be even newer and more exciting places for millionaires to place their bets. Then, the casino in Sentosa will be forced to renew and upgrade itself. Will this upgrade be viable and cost effective? What about other social problems? Will the government be ignorant to it? If they arent ignorant about it, they will be spending money to address the problem. Since addressing the problem requires money, where does the money come from? Okay lets see it this way. Indeed the casino will earn money. But sooner or later, the money will be channelled into other places like healthcare and other infrastructure to overcome the problems brought about by the casino. As time goes by..the problems will overcome the advantages. What happens next? Casino is closed and oh no. Tourism revenue falls. Oh no. Poor economic performance. oh no. recession. how? who's gonna answer for this?</div>

We benefitted during a time when countries like china, vietnam, cambodia, myanmmar, indonesia even malaysia were considered communist or hermit kingdoms, troubled spots or industrial nations not very keen on tourism. In other words we built our own niche.<br><br>But now these countries have opened up and tourists are finding that there is much more to offer than in singapore. Hong Kong is also in trouble but unlike us they now have a hinterland to fall back upon if their tourism industry fails, what do we have to fall back upon if we fail?<br><br>The reality of the tourism scene is that if singaporeans themselves are unwilling to spend locally but rather fly all the way to thailand, china to shop and enjoy to take advantage cheap bargains what is to stop other savvy tourists in other countries from doing the same.<br><br>Simply put If you have nothing to offer why should tourists find a "reason" to come here to spend?<br><br></div>
