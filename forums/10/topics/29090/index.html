            <div class='col-md body'>News from Mindef site:<br><br><a href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/display.asp?number=1665" rel="nofollow">SINGAPORE NAVY LAYS KEEL FOR FIRST FRIGATE<br></a><br><a href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/images/14nov02_frigate_big.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/images/14nov02_frigate_big.jpg"></a><br>-------------<br><br>Some personal observation:<br><br>1. The design is quite different from La Fayatte, but the principle of stealth design (ie. the superstructure is sloped at about 10 degree) has been applied. However, the design of this Delta frigate is not as "clean" as the original La Fayette and it will definitely produce higher RCS than the La Fayatte.<br><br>2. The frigate is armed with a Oto breda 76mm gun with a new stealth mounting.<br><br>3. The two triple torpedo tubes are fitted in the front just behind the VLS system.<br><br>4. Sixteen tube VLS (Aster 15 missiles) are fitted.<br><br>5. Two masts are present, the first mast on top of the main superstructure will carry some sort of advanced Air/Surface search radar - possible even some 3D phased array given the "flat" surfaces. Second mast most like will carry the navigation radar, radio antennas, and possible some ESM/ECM anntena.  The SATCOMM white radar dome is mounted just behind the second mast.<br><br>6. The top of the helicophter hanger has some sort of mounting, possibly for CIWS type weapon.<br><br>7. Helicopter depicted in the computer generated graphics is either the NH-90 or EH-101 (more like the former given its size).<br><br>8. The main superstructure that contains the wheelhouse and the CIC are much lower than that of the orginal La Fayette design.<br><br>10. The weight quoted is just 300 tons lighter than as the original La Fayatte. I don't see how this Delta frigate will steam much faster than the La Fayattes if the same CODAD engines are used. RSN will have to really look for better and more powerful engines.<br><br>11. The frigates have stabliser fins fitted, as well as the sonar mounted on the middile rather than  at the bow.<br><br>Given the quoted 3200 tons weight, and vast larger size and capabilities, these delta frigates are not going to "simply replace the MGBs". In fact, they are going to be introducing a totally new capability to the RSN, namely being able to, for the first time, engage multiple targets in multiple dimension, eg. engaging SSMs, enemy aircrafts while hunting for an enemy sub. In fact, a whole new doctrine will have to be written to integrate these frigates into the current RSN ORBAT.<br><br>It is more likely that RSN will use the MCVs to replace the role played by the MGBs while La Fayette will replace the MCVs role of being the main fighting ships. In all, RSN will be more all rounded to deal with multi-dimensional navy threats.<br><br>I also reckon that RSN should continue pursing the stealth OPV project that was put aside when they decided on the Delta frigates instead. A modified ST Marine 81m OPV with a combined La Fayette technology and possibly Swedish Visby technology will see the stealth OPV a real potent ships able to deal with any rouge MEKOs.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The prototype of Otobreda's new 127mm/54-cal lightweight (127/54 LW) naval gun with a 'stealth'-optimised turret, mounted on the Italian Navy's Artigliere- (Lupo-) class frigate, Bersagliere, was on display in the Port Zayed element of IDEX.<br><br>Designed for surface warfare and naval gunfire support, with a secondary air-defence role, the new gun weighs 22 tons. This is about 15 tons lighter than the current Compatto design. As a result, it can be mounted on ships from corvette-size upwards.<br><br>According to Massimo Gualco of Otobreda's naval systems division, the weapon has "the highest rate-of-fire of any 5in [127mm] gun" on the market. Although company documentation quotes a maximum rate-of-fire of 40rds/min, 35 rds/min is the accepted normal rate.<br><br>The mount features a revolutionary new loading system with up to four 20-round ready-use feeding magazines, although the prototype has only two at present. These can be reloaded while the mount is in operation - considered an advantage during fire-support missions.<br><br>The whole ammunition feed has been reduced in volume and will fit on board narrow-beam ships. Gualco told JDU that with its compact lay-out, the whole gun system could be 'modularised' for mounting in multirole vessels, such as the Danish STANFLEX concept.<br><br>The gun is able to fire all available standard 127mm (5in) ammunition and would be compatible with the US Extended-Range Guided Munition (ERGM) round. Gualco also noted that a 62-calibre barrel was a future possibility, for use with extended-range ammunition natures.<br><br>This prototype weapon completed its land-based firing trials early last year and was installed and integrated on board the Bersagliere by November 2000. It is now undergoing a one-year operational evaluation with a view to replacing the existing Otobreda 127mm/54 Compatto on certain ships of the Italian Navy.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>More interesting comparison about Singapore's Delta/La Fayette Frigate characteristics....<br><br>1.<br>Length: 110 m, Breadth: 16m, Displacement: 3200 tons, Speed: more than 25 knots, Range: 4000nm.<br><br>La Fayatte:<br>Length, overall: 125 m, Displacement (standard):3,500 tons<br>Speed (CODAD propulsion): 25 kts Range (at 12 kts)<br>9,000 nm.<br>Source: DCN Site <a href="http://www.dcnintl.com/fiches/fich02b.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.dcnintl.com/fiches/fich02b.htm</a><br><br>Saudi's Sawari II La Fayettes have a displacement of 4,500 tons, overall length of 133 metres and a beam of 17 metres.<br><br>source: DCN Site <a href="http://www.dcnintl.com/htdocs/fraset05.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.dcnintl.com/htdocs/fraset05.htm</a><br><br>Taiwanese kang Ding  displaces 3,500t fully loaded, and has dimensions of 125m x 15.4m x 4m. With a maximum speed of 25 knots, it has a range of 7,000 nautical miles at 15 knots.<br>Source: Naval-Technology <a href="http://www.naval-technology.com/projects/fayette/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.naval-technology.com/projects/fayette/index.html</a><br><br>Verdict:<br>1. RSN La Fayette is built slightly shorter (about 15m shorter than standard La Fayette while the Saudi's version is 8m longer).<br><br>2. RSN La Fayette is slightly broader than Taiwanese La Fayette which I believe is built to standard La Fayette size. Yet again, the Saudi's version is 1 m broader.<br><br>3. RSN La Fayette seems to have a lower quoted range, which I nelieve may not necessary be a true figure, just like they initially quote the MCVs only to have "Excess 30 knts" and they ended having 35 knts. A great different. Although RSN version is somewhat shorter by 15m, I think the drop in range could be in the manitude of 1,000 to at most 2,000 mn and NOT 3,000mn as quoted.<br><br>4. RSN La Fayette frigates design has departed from the original "clean and smooth" surface. There are too many "breaklines" for my liking. The original La Fayette are a lot smooth on their side. All weapon systems (apart from the temporary Crotale missile launcher, which was to be replaced by VLS Aster SAM) are hidden inside the superstructure or behind the barrier/boundary/wall - whatever you call that.  In fact, ST Marine's 81 OPV design look more like the son-of-La Fayette than the Delta frigates.<br><br><img src="http://www.stengg.com/AR2001/images/image_stealth1.jpg"><br><br>compare this with the image of the RSN Delta frigate above.... and the original La Fayette...<br><br><img src="http://www.naval-technology.com/projects/lafayette/images/lafayette10.jpg"></div>
