            <div class='col-md body'>This concept is not an "original" idea from me. It is practiced here in Hong Kong. The head of the panel is a retired judge.<br><br>There is a committee or panel to deal with cases of such. It is precisely due to the sensitivity of discrimination practices that we need to set up such a commission. In Singapore's context, the panel will naturally consist of minority representatives and Chinese. Preferrably, these people should have some form of law training. There will be a group of civil servants who will assist in investigations and data collection.<br><br>As I have said, if the company really deal solely with China, then it is a legitimate reason as language ability will become a necessary skill. However, if any Malay or Indian could speak very Fluent Mandarin, I don't see why he or she should be deprived of the job opportunity!<br><br>But believe me, there are employers who are just using language skill on a discrimination basis.
