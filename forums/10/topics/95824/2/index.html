I believe many policies do not work well and therefore need to be changed. I also believe that some policies worked well in the past but may not work well in the future and therefore a second look is needed to see if change needed. In reality there are many policies that must be changed but cannot change because good alternatives not there yet. It is a fact of life that new policies will have some side effects. It is also unavoidable that the implementation process itself will result in pains and discomfort, to say the least.<br><br>But who is to say what will be changed, who decide which new policies to adopt, who will endure the suffering resulting from changes, who stand to benefit the most from these changes?<br><br>Everybody can say what should be changed, give whatever ideas you can come up with. But only singaporean can decide which new policies to adopt! those with no stake in singapore and those who are all ready to flee to their second home in Perth or LA are only welcomed to give yr ideas, but singaporean decide, because singaporean are the ones who will have to endure the discomfort associated with the changes and we may not even be the ones who directly benefit from such changes as, in reality, no policies will benefit everybody in singapore no matter how well it is intended to be. Finally, it will be extremely naive to think that all foreign bodies are independent  and no foreign powers are likely to benefit from changes in singapore, especially changes resulting in instability and chaos.<br><br>Many singaporean are already complaining there PAP depend too much on facts and figures and thus losing their feel for people. Do you think any views or suggestion with facts must be accepted just because you have facts and substantiation?<br><br>Politicians in singapore must know how to manage industries and economics, handle defence and foreign relation, sensitive to race and religions, but most importantly, they must win the heart of the people. Politicians who do not identify with the people and not prepared to walk the talk, have no credibility with the people. Academic debates are meant for classrooms and talks on politics alone remain cheap talks. Nin Beh never study a lot, last time pon-ten too much, cannot debate well, figures to me is 36-24-36. But I know I have the right to say what is good for me. PAP's elitism already sucks, now those who claim anti PAP also think they know and I don't know what is good for me. Need moderator to judge if I (singaporean) am doing the right thing to me (singaporean)? WTF! go fly kites or go sell your books</div>
