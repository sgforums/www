            <div class='col-md body'>Oh please, what Poly a class below JC - Top ten richest people in Singapore all poly graduates. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>To succeed in life you need three things:<br><br>I) Creativity<br><br>II) Luck<br><br>III) Networking<br><br>***<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Creativity is something personal and it's difficult to teach, but with environment, personality and other factors - it can squeeze more of the creative juice out from someone. Academically people are usually the least creative among all because to be academically smart you have to FOLLOW your text. My artistic directors, my shifu and everyone else, I think cannot make it in books, but they are damn fcuking creativity and talented.<br><br>There is no glory in following/copying - there is only honour in creation and conjuring.<br><br>Knowledge is limited, imagination has no boundary. Usually people who are good at hitting their books, are civil minded. They rely everything on rules, order and an organized way of doing, but what if reality doesn't give you that route?<br><br>Luck depends heavily on opportunity, intuition, gut feel and even karma.<br><br>Networking refers to people you can work with to achieve certain career objective. People with higher EQ will have stronger networking power, but higher EQ usually suffer in terms of productivity. (Empathy is good for personal relationship, but not so for work. That's why the sh|t people are usually the higher management)<br><br>***<br><br>In life we can't have everything - people who chase paper, have to sacrifice something else in return. They sacrifice either one or more of the three points above. In the end, if anyone who wants to succeed, it has to have everything above - so the joking piece of paper isn't part of the essential criteria to do damn freaking well in life. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>we only have 1 form of secondary education institute, unlike japan where it's split into 3 years of junior high and another 3 years of high school. does that mean students are getting complacent and not striving for As in their O levels?<br><br>if we were to abolish JCs and put all students into polys, the 1st thing we need to do would be to revamp the poly curriculum, rather than split the schools into 4 faculties, let students have a choice of what subject from which school they would like to pursure during their foundation semesters, and begin specialization later.<br><br>for those unsure of their future, they could pick general subjects like business and marketing, IT, networking, circuitry, electronics, design. once they've found something they like, they could then go on to begin their specializations.<br><br>remove the fixed 3 year routes. go the semestral way, each student is to complete their diploma in a given number of semesters, say 6-10. to attain their diploma, they would need to attain at least a certain number of credits for their major studies, be it business, engineering, IT, research or design.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i've discussed with my brother, both who is and were JC kids and we come to a conclusion that if you want to leave your choices open as well as a better chance at uni, choose JC. If you want at the end of 3yrs a job and a low chance of going local uni, choose Poly.<br><br>the risk is that those who have poor results and go JC ending up with non-Uni entry results either repeat or have to do some private course. This are the people that we have left out. after your O's, you made a decision, poly or jc and as a person you should stick to that decision. Everywhere, there is a majority of polytechnic students who have a subconscious feeling of inferiority hence this forum topic. Let me tell you, its just a feeling, IT AINT REAL. Even so, amongst JC people, there are the real class above the rest , namely the scholars. i believe that  Set your goals right about your education and career and don't be paranoid</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmm. in what way is a poly student a class below jc students? I dun quite get it.<br><br>In terms of getting a job, a poly grad will definitely earn more than a jc student who juz gradguated. And moreover, even if the jc students make it to uni, nowadays, uni students are struggling to find jobs oredi. The job market is not optimistic at all. Moreover, it is possible for the poly student to upgrade her/himself and take up degrees or other diplomas etc to make themselves become more valuable to their company. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
