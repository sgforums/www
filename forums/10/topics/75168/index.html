            <div class='col-md body'>Well it seems like until now, JCs are still quite 'recognised' by Singaporeans than polytechnics. One of the few times polytechnics are publisized is during the annual 'Transport Solutions', organised by LTA and the polys.<br><br>More info: <a href="http://app.lta.gov.sg/corp_press_content.asp?start=989" rel="nofollow">http://app.lta.gov.sg/corp_press_content.asp?start=989</a><br><br>I have friends who get single digit or high double digits that want to go polytechnic. However, that doesnt mean that these guys are not in the top 25% of the cohort? I have seen 3 kinds of people in the O level cohort:<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> The Brainy Ones: Can go JC and poly but die die stay in JC. (These guys should look at the options of going to poly)<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> The Wise Ones: Can go JC and poly but chose to go poly. (These guys make a wise choice i must say.)<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> The Ones that lose out: Cannot go JC but only poly and stil have to fight with The Wise Ones for a space in a poly course. (These guys are kinda left out.. needa create more space for them <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">)<br><br>There're also people who have no choice but go to JC instead of poly because of one thing: they failed maths. Surprisingly, this small group of people still meet the JC criteria of &lt;20 R5 and another requirement of getting into JC is pass in english and D7 in maths/sciences. For poly, its the other way round.<br><br>In short:<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> JC: Must pass English to get in.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Poly: Must pass Maths to get in.<br><br>Maybe the garment should hear out what the polytechnic students are doing/what they have to say. I guess the media is bias to the garment. why? JC/CI are wholly under MOE while polys are not completely under MOE. hence, the JC/CI have more media attention year by year.<br><br>It seems like after Tharman took over the edu portfolio, many good things happen... I hope he can increase the poly grad cohort to 20%  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> Based on the current 10%, on average, about 900 Poly grads make it to Uni each cohort, that's 225 per school which on average its 2 or 3 per class!<br><br>Just my 2 cents <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> No offense to anyone <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I can't blame some people who look down on poly students. Most people i've seen studying in a poly have very poor dicipline, take dressing for example, is it me or are those people dressed like punks? Most who go there enjoy the freedom and the 'adult'- like student lifestyle instead of interest...ask what they want to do in their lifes? Make money. That's all they know.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>anyone remember few days ago a certain MP actually proposed doing away with JCs?<br><br>i actually agree with him.<br><br>you've spent 10-13 years learning general subjects, do you really need to spend another 2 more years doing the same stuff?<br><br>your A levels are useless. go straight into poly and learn something practical. after that, whether or not you go to U is your choice.</div>
