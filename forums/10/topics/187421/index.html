            <div class='col-md body'>I been reading alot about how many really opposing the rule of PAP and this CSJ clown... Singaporeans are not stupid they simply vote for PAP for the fact that PAP is able or at least most qualified at now to ensure Singapore's further prosperity or at least maintain the way it is... If opposition should want to change the government power why not start showing us some SOLID things than just clownish childish act commenting on baseless irrelevant things like NKF. Show the evidences or it looks like they are just brainwashing the public. And to my beliefs NKF has nothing to do with how good the opposition will run this country. Convince us you can do a better job on the office not the complain.<br><br>Till now I see there are few opposition is really up to the job. Singapore is a small and fragile state with a few bad decision could destroy it so therefore Government will still have my vote unless the opposition can prove to do a better job. Can't imagine CSJ group of people on the prime minister seat what will Singapore become?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think you cannot imagine how much pressure the oppositions are under as the game is played quite unfairly (as admitted by our MM).<br><br>With those type of restrictions and not having enough balance in power within the parliament, it's no wonder why the oppositions are doing so quite badly... Were they even really given adequate chances to prove themselves? How many capable ones would be really willing to go into the oppositions to go against such a strong ruling party? And really devote their time while the rest of us just sit back and yak all we want in here, in coffee shops, coffee clubs, pubs...? To risk their status, their own achievements, possibly family and friends for the sake of Singapore's future? Only to be laughed at and being called clown by some of us?<br><br>As much as the ruling party says the oppositions ain't doing a better job... I don't really see how many of us can be doing a better job as an opposition speaking up for the Singaporeans...? I don't see how the current ruling party might be doing such a fantastic job if the table is turned around for them, and they're playing in such an unfair ground....<br><br>I think Singaporeans should really continue to just keep their eyes shut and pretend that nothing's happening...? If you have children... Don't have friends... Don't have relatives.. Or simply don't care about anyone else but yourself.. I think votings and election really shouldn't bother you too much unless you're desperate for food...<br><br>And I also think we really shouldn't be asking the question of "What Singaporean really wants?" anymore... As much as this question may very much sounds odd to me at times today... Have Singaporeans really been given a say in much things? Except for the fact that their gahment is DECIDING for them what's 'good' and what's 'not'...? And that 'shh'... Not question shall be entertained if they're 'sensitive' to us attitude...? With people suffering at the bottom while people enjoying 'fruits' from the TOP?<br><br>Don't ask that question anymore, as it would SOON be MEANINGLESS to DO SO... If they don't care about much a damn now, what makes YOU THINK that they would care any much more in the future when they're even TIGHTER in POWER and CONTROL <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>What we should do is listen to both sides before casting your vote.<br><br>People like Wong Kan Seng who boast that the PAP has 'delivered on all their promises' while the opposition hasn't done a thing, should really learn to look at perspective.<br><br>For one, apart from Chiam and Low, without access to town council funding and other forms of cash, how could the opposition realistically perform anything viable compared to the PAP?<br><br>With the limitless source of cash flow, the PAP should be <span style="color: red;"><strong>EMBARRASSED</strong></span> if they failed to deliver on even a <span style="color: brown;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>SINGLE</strong></span></span> promise<br><br>As it is, we should not forget that even after achieving the 45% mark in Potong Pasir, the PAP have failed to provide the promised upgrading to the residents. The Buangkok white elephant incident is just another example of broken promises.<br><br>So Mr Wong should really review his arrogant outburst. And all of us should review the dollar value of the candidates standing for election, PAP and alternatives.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think the Ruling Party should wake up.<br><br>They keep saying that the opposition candidate are unqualified and untested and they have delivered the promise.<br><br>Please note that the present bunch of ruling party candidates are chosen on the merit of their personal career and paperworks.<br><br>Most of them have not really done any grassroot work and dun really know what the people want after making the "high-class" promises to the press.<br><br>So, most of the ruling candidates that have joined the last election and this election through GRC are all untested.<br><br>No one (secret ?) actually examined why the 25 past candidates have retired from being MPs after serving 1 terms.<br><br>Most of the MPs was unable to handle the duo task of their job and MPs.<br><br>So, have they fulfil their promises made during the last election ???<br><br>Therefore, if given the chance to the opposition candidates, they will have 4 years to prove to Singapore whether they can be relied on or they are plain incompetent.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>from what i see.. is an uneven political playing ground... we have to admit..over the past 40 over years..the PAP has been doing a good job in governing our city state...yet the very problem of the political scene is because of this. Singaporeans are mainly conservative and they usually go for the tried and tested, other than the few opposition like chiam who has been doing a good job too.<br><br>i feel that s'poreans would not be able to face up to the consequences should the PAP collapse fundamentally one fine day...they EXPECT the PAP to be run by capable leaders subsequently PAP standards are no longer subject to public scrutiny in fact even now, it's a mere listing of candidate biodata without any in depth analysis and dissection of their character and actual value of their contributions! this may cause the future generations of PAP leaders to become degenerate fools and puppets and s'poreans would thus be unwillingly committing social suicide by trusting in the PAP too much!<br><br>what voters and new generations of Singaporeans should look for is the exact quality of the candidates... there may be exceptional ones in the ruling party...but i will nt deny the possibility of these good ones in the opposition too! so what i tink is that voters should start taking a more proactive step in politics..nt in a sense of campaigning or steppin up to take the mantle..but to scrutinise and look through every single candidate and ensure the ones we are voting in are the bunch of people who can really make it.. and i applaude the opposition for doing the right thing by fielding professionals and people who haf the potential of doing well. i cannot say that they are the best for the job..but it is a positive step in building up a proper and credible opposition that exists to check the power of the ruling party..<br><br>Singapore is getting more and more mature, and our politics should be goin in the right direction... out should be the days of barisan socialis and name calling.. we are nt taiwanese..we do nt and should never have a part in those shameful behaviour by chee. Chee is a black sheep in the opposition..it is because of him and the likes of him that the opposition cannot present a professional and credible face to the people..if the opposition wants to do well...it first has to deal with Chee and his type and reach out to the people...letting them know...that in the opposition there are people who are sane.. credible and rational, willing to go up and talk and discuss openly in an open debate.. we want a good informed elections to make a choice that deterimines the future in singapore.</div>

Chiam had done a great job to what he is limited with but how about the majority of the opposition? I remember the previous elections even people from VI come into the political scene... I'm not saying people with lower qualification should not be a candidate. But who would you be trusted with your future? Someone of better paper qualification and being in some organisation management or someone who have just a lowly qualification? Many of these new PAP candidates are in the grassroots too. PAP till now have a majority of the "better" candidates in comparision to the combine of all opposition. If the opposition need to be better their recruitment pool should be better. From what I see only two way before a paradigm shift... A better leader to lead the opposition to change the situation or a sudden change in the entire economical stability of the nation... which from what I see is rather not possible. Simply PAP outdone both.<br><br>Talking about fairness... no one gave LKY or Singapore a fair chance in the 60s-80s too... We fight for every inche of ground. Which definitely makes us more cautious in the way we select our leaders for our fragile nation...<br><br>If everyone just think PAP is arrogant and so... well I think they done a great job as to what Singapore is a organised and clean government although I don't agree with every policy it had choose but majority I believe are the best of situation.
