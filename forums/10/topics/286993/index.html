            <div class='col-md body'>It is unfortunate that the Workers' Party Chairman Sylvia Lim feels that Singapore can deal with rule of law issues without support from the international community.<br><br>If that were the case, then why did Mr Chia Thye Poh remain detained without trial for 32 long years?<br><br>Ms Lim says that: "We Singaporeans are quite capable of deciding what kind of country we want."<br><br>By logical extension, did Singaporeans want Mr Chia Thye Poh's three-decade detention? Did Singaporeans want the media to be completely under the thumb of the PAP? Did the people support the manipulation of the electoral process?<br><br>The truth is that Singaporeans, while wanting to decide what kind of country we want for ourselves, have been unable to do so because our rights, including our right to free and fair elections have been crushed by the PAP.<br><br>It is therefore disappointing that as an opposition leader, Ms Lim feels that the election system is acceptable and that the outcome must be respected. We may not be able to do anything to change the election outcome but we do not have to respect it.<br><br>We need to fight to win back these rights and we need to change our political system. In short, we need reform.<br><br>To be very sure, only Singaporeans can effect that change. But let us not fantasize. We also need support from the democratic world as Taiwan, Indonesia, the Philippines, South Africa, Poland, Serbia, Chile, etc. needed it. And as Burma now desperately needs it.<br><br>On this matter, isn't it a trifle hypocritical for us to condemn the regime in Burma and call for democratic change there while in the next breath call on others to stop interfering in our own affairs?<br><br>It is true that the PAP says it doesn't want foreign interference. It is also a lie. What do you call the National Wages Council having American, German and Japanese business representatives sitting on its board deciding the wage levels of Singaporean workers?<br><br>If we shun foreign interference, why did the Singapore Government invite the IBA here. Shouldn't the Government have taken the IBA president to task for saying that Singapore has an "outstanding legal profession and judiciary?"<br><br>The truth is not that the PAP does not want foreigners interfering in our domestic affairs. Comments from foreigners, be they compliments or criticisms, are consider interference. While the PAP welcomes the former, it rejects the latter.<br><br>In a similar vein, Ms Lim accepts the accolades of the legal/judicial system of business groups. What is troubling is that she ignores studied criticisms of legal watchdog organizations such as Lawyers Rights Watch Canada, New York City Bar Association and the International Commission Jurists.<br><br>Does she consider these researched but critical reports "foreign interference" while welcoming the complimentary surveys of organisations cited by Mr Lee Kuan Yew?<br><br>In order for Singaporeans to decide what we really want for our country, we need an election system that is free and fair, a media that is not controlled by the ruling party, and the freedom of speech and peaceful assembly.<br><br>None of these institutions exist in Singapore. Without them the wishes and wants of Singaporeans can be, and are being, manipulated by the PAP to serve its own interests.<br><br>Help for Singaporeans so that they can be empowered to speak up against the suffocating grip of the PAP is not interference. Interference is when a foreign government supports one party over another as the British did with Mr Lee Kuan Yew and his wing in the PAP.<br><br>For the record, the SDP welcomes support for efforts to democratise Singapore. Beyond that we reject attempts to influence the policies of any political party by outsiders.<br><br>It is disappointing that the Chairman of the Workers' Party cannot see this distinction but instead parrots what the PAP so disingenuously advocates.<br><br>Appeasing the PAP so that we can be an acceptable opposition is not to "draw a balance" as Ms Lim claims. It is rather an unfortunate tactic that will be conveniently exploited by the PAP.<br><br>The SDP said it before and we say it again: Singapore's Opposition cannot stand up for the people on bended knees.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>IN A 1995 PARLIAMENTARY debate, Chiam See Tong, founder of the Singapore Democratic Party (SDP), chided the group for not defending Singapore's judiciary against criticisms emanating from the U.S. In response, Chiam's colleagues asked he resign from the party and run as a candidate of the ruling People's Action Party (PAP) instead. Did they defame Chiam by suggesting that he was acting dishonorably? Yes, says a Singapore court. In a Dec. 26 judgment, it ordered SDP secretary-general Chee Soon Juan and 11 other party stalwarts to pay $85,700 in damages to Chiam, who resigned from the SDP last month. In the campaigning for the Jan. 2 general election, the ruling is an embarrassment for the SDP.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The principle of the Rule of law is intended to be a safeguard against arbitrary governance, whether by a totalitarian leader or by mob rule. Since Singapore is a pseudo-democracy with no proper respect for human rights, thereÂ’s no rule of law in Singapore.<br><br>Nevermind what Sylvia said.  A responsible political party will urge the public to turn their enthusiasm and energy toward deepening education in the rule of law and strengthening the system. If the Workers party does not promote democracy and respect human rights, itÂ’s not democractic party.<br><br>Once democracy and human rights are achieved, bills can always be introduced in parliament to have unfair and unjust laws reversed or changed.<br><br>Enough of one party rule.<br></div>

In the meet the ppl session recently in Thomson, Raymond Lim could not even answer properly, The Kranji farm issue, and many more, seem like the Bear does not catch up with the current affair. So if u are contented with what the current situation in Singapore then I dont blame you, you can lead a happy life, government said what, you just obey, there are many ppl like this, why bother so much, we have a roof over our head. Ok talk about the job of MP, how can they serve us? you mean when our corridor is dirty, they will clean for us, we complain the neighbour keep big dog, he will take action, we say we dont have a garden, he will build for us, these minor issues can be solved by the town councilers not MPs, I think we can do away MPs because they cant help and fight for us, it is a waste of money taking $13k a month, malay says 'gaji buta'</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I applaud Sylvia's comments and stance. IMHO, no amount of foreign support / interference will help if the majority of the citizens are not convinced.<br><br>It'll be like a slap on the face of the 66.6%, since they were the ones who voted the ruling party in. I believe alot of them don't need foreigners to tell them what to do.. And since they are the majority, it's up to the alternative parties to convince and convert them, instead of embarrassing them further.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>Burma is a good reference for it's recent blatant human rights violation, and the only foreign intervention it got are more sanctions... making life of its people harder... I certainly don't look forward to that happening to Singapore.</div>
