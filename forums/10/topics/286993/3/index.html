Not that poor but not even average either.<br><br>Your points 1, 2 and 3 are certainly reasonable thoughts.<br><br>Chee has never won any seat on his own since his debut in 1992. And since his animosity with Chiam began, they lost all three seats that they have held since 1991 in the 1997 elections.<br><br>Anyone remembers Chee running after Goh Chok Tong with a loudhailer and shouting, "Where is the money?" That was when many called him a 'siao lang'. Even I, who was so impressed with the rise of SDP in the 1991 elections, was shocked and astonished at this demonstration of impulsiveness.<br><br>Average results of SDP in elections:<br><br>1991 - 48.02% (Highest poll - 69.64%)<br><br>1997 - 33.47% (Highest poll - 38.67%)<br><br>2001 - 20.66% (Highest poll - 20.25%)<br><br>2006 - 23.06% (Highest poll - 22.81%)<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Source: Elections department</span><br><br>SDP's focus is more towards democracy activism. Their speeches in the last election reflect this.<br><br>Contrast this with WP's speeches, which focused more on constructive criticism on domestic issues and providing viable alternatives. <strong>Which one brings about more credibility?</strong><br><br>Perhaps we should conduct a poll here in SGF on whether CSJ is needed by Singaporeans in "the fight for democracy".</div>
