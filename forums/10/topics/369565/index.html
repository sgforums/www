              <p>Australia is described as: .<br><br><br>The only country in the Western world to which large numbers of Nazi collaborators and criminals (at least several hundreds if not several thousands) emigrated after World War II which has hereto failed to take successful legal action against a single one. Australia closed down its Special Investigations Unit on June 30, 1992 at a time when highly important documentation was first becoming available in the former Soviet republics, where most of the crimes carried out by the Nazis living in Australia had been committed. <br><br>The Australian government which passed legislation enabling criminal prosecution in Australia but which failed to achieve a single conviction has refused to switch to denaturalization and/or deportation, methods being used with outstanding success, primarily in the United States, but also in Canada. ( Simon Wiesenthal Centre, Nazi War Criminals Prosecution-Annual Status Report April 2001, 18 April 2001.)<br><br><br>The events that have, more recently, surrounded the case of Konrad Kalejs might suggest that Australia was finally getting tough with Nazi war criminals. But, in the end, I suspect that Mark Aarons is right when he says .<br><br><br>It is too little, too late. The highest probability is that the last Nazi in the world will die peacefully in his bed in Australia. We have done virtually nothing, … I can't escape having to draw the conclusion that neither the Latvian or Australian government have any enthusiasm for it.</p>

              <blockquote><strong>A history of cover-up</strong><br>
              <p>This is the third
              time that Kalejs has been given refuge in Australia after deportation
              overseas. The first instance was in 1994, following his removal from
              the US. After a brief stay, pressure from Jewish groups and anti-Nazi
              activists caused him to flee to Canada, to be deported from there in
              1997. In early 1998, amid protests, Prime Minister Howard personally
              issued a statement defending the government's decision to take no
              action against Kalejs, on the grounds that a Federal Police review of
              his files had failed to produce adequate evidence for a prosecution.</p>
              <p>In
              fact, the only probe into Kalejs and other Nazi war criminals living in
              Australia, conducted by the federal government's Special Investigations
              Unit (SIU), was controversially shut down by the previous Keating Labor
              government in 1992, with the support of Howard's Liberal-National
              Party. At the time it had 57 cases unresolved and had just applied to
              send investigators to Latvia to obtain the testimony needed to
              prosecute another Nazi, Karlis Ozols, one of Kalejs' associates. “The
              government pulled the pin,” commented Robert Greenwood QC, who headed
              the SIU. According to the SIU's official historian, Professor Konrad
              Kwiet, the SIU had gathered “five or six volumes” of material against
              Kalejs.</p>

              <blockquote>
              <p><strong>Are there war criminals in Australia?</strong></p>
              <p>Until a domestic law enforcement agency is given the resources to
              investigate allegations of war criminals living in Australia it is
              impossible to determine with any accuracy how many are living within
              our borders. However, there are good reasons to believe that
              significant numbers are living here. We already know that suspected war
              criminals have slipped through Australian border checks. The 1986
              Menzies Review of Nazi war criminals living in Australia identified
              ‘very substantial gaps’ in Australia’s initial post-WWII war crimes
              screening procedures. The SIU, established in response, conducted 841
              investigations and identified 27 cases where it ‘was satisfied that the
              suspect had committed serious war crimes but was not able to gather
              sufficient evidence for prosecution under the War Crimes Act’. Some
              WWII suspects are still alive today. Officials privately suggest that
              screening has been a problem at other times since WWII.</p>
              <p>In the public mind war criminals seem to be commonly associated with
              greying men from WWII. However, as the Simon Wiesenthal Center – an
              organisation dedicated to pursuing Nazi war criminals – points out,
              Australia is probably now facing its final opportunity to take
              successful legal action against suspected Nazi war criminals.</p>
              <p>Modern war criminals are a far more significant problem for
              Australia. It was reported in 2005 that people who had been denied
              refugee protection on the basis of involvement in war crimes had come
              from Afghanistan, Palestine, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Lebanon, Sierra Leone,
              Bangladesh, Tibet, Nigeria, Chile, Iran, Iraq and India. 15 It is
              likely that Australia is also home to suspected war criminals from the
              countries of the former Yugoslavia, as well as Cambodia, and possibly
              Rwanda and East Timor among others.</p>
              <p>The fact that other countries continue to request the extradition of
              alleged war criminals from Australia – albeit in small numbers – offers
              another reason for suspecting they are living here.</p>
              <p>Another reason for suspecting that a significant number of war
              criminals are living in Australia comes from examining the experience
              of a comparable country – Canada – that has dedicated resources to
              addressing the problem of resident war criminals.</p>
              <p>As Tanya Plibersek stated in a debate in parliament on crimes against humanity:</p>
              <p>‘Mr Deputy Speaker, you can imagine someone walking into a community
              centre who spies across the room someone whom they believe to be
              responsible for the deaths of their family members...I am not saying
              for a moment that an accusation is all that is required, but we at
              least owe it to the victims of these crimes to examine their claims,
              and we owe it to ourselves as a nation to be confident that we are not
              sheltering people here who have committed such crimes.'</p>
