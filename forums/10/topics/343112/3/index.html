              <p>Now potray this in your mind.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You are now 62 years old. For the past 50 years all the people around you have been hating you and are hostile to you for no apparent reason. They abused you whenever they could, insulted and degraded you whenever they wanted to. To them you were not human and were despicable. They betrayed you and cheated on you. You were hurt. Both psychologically and physically.</p>
              <p>You learned soon enough that to prevail in your hostile environment is through strength alone and that requires the application of violence. And so you fought your way in and out. And you built successfully your reputation as a man to be fear of. You get anything you want only through the successful execution of violence(strength). You are now feared and respected(people cannot respect others that they do not fear) because you are a man of violence.</p>
              <p>That man is Israel. Read her history.</p>
              <p>Conflicts make great fighters.</p>
              <p>Just my 2 cents.</p>

              <p>Let's add to that scenario.  During your early years you were herded into a ghetto, just escaping the transfer to the concentration camps with their cannisters of Zyklon B.</p>
              <p>Fast forward to the present day.  You have created ghettos just like the ones you were put through, but instead of gassing your victims with Zyklon B, you use white phosphorous to burn them alive right down to the bone.</p>

              All these only began because of the Arabs' greed of wanting the whole of Middle East to their Islamic people.
              
              All Israel wanted was a place they can call home. How much lands have they acceded to those greedy corrupted Islamic people without putting so much of a fight. And those Arab just kept wanting more and more. Probably until Israel is no more?
              
              When Israel refused to give up anymore of their land the Arabs started to use violence to get what they want. Go take a closer look at the map. Look at how small Israel is in the Middle East.

              precisely why Israel itself was founded upon terrorism and why they've

              <p>The British didn't want to see an Israeli state. They preferred to hand the land to Hashemite Jordan their newly made kingdom. They formed the Arab legion in their occupied territory to support the Jordanian eventual take over.</p>
              <p>The rest of the land were divided among several Arab countries like Eqypt and Syria.</p>
              <p>After the British left the territory the land became a no man's land. Each party fighting to grab a hold of their own territory. The Israelis fought with whatever weapons they could muster which included some home made armor and stolen tanks. The Arab legion was much much better equipped in comparison.</p>
              <p>The Israelis were able to hold on their own and eventually securing some land in the territory which was even smaller than one that exist now.</p>
              <p>The subsequent 1967 war brought substrantial gain in territory for the Israelis. The Israelis gained the west bank, the Gaza city and the old Jerusalem city from Jordanian and Eqyptian forces. Of course there is the Golan heights taken from the Syrian.</p>
              <p>So actually the Palestinians had no land to claim for themselves. The Gaza city, the whole old Jerusalem and the entire west bank were all part of the Israeli gain after the 1967 war.</p>
              <p>To make matter worse the Palestinian cause has been used as a political pawn by the Arab countries and it was the PLO which introduced the world to terrorism.</p>
              <p>I sympathize with the Palestinian people but I think arm struggle should be a thing of the past. They are in no condition to win by arm struggle and it will only make matters worse for the Palestinian people. The only thing that made the Palestinian leaders to continue their arm struggle is their fanatism and hatred towards the Israelis and Israel as a state. This is illogical and will not bring any long term peace solution to the Palestinian people. It's a real pity that two people living in such close proximity could grow so much hatred towards each other.</p>

              <p>How do you feel if i invade your house without your

              <p>The Jews (zionist) can live somewhere else.. maybe some part of

              <p>but why they choose Arab (Middle East) instead?<br> and IF the jews are not happy with the Arab countries, go somewhere
                          else..<br> There are reasons behind it why Hamas wanna attack Israel. etc
                          etc..<br> <br> The fact is, some part of Palestine land invaded by the Jews
                          WITHOUT permission..<br> <br> <br> (PS: sorry if my Eng sucks)</p>

              <p>No need to say sorry Ajen. Your english is fine. And you wrote more graciously than many english educated people.</p>
              <p>The idea that Israel invaded the Palestine is actually rather absurd.</p>
              <p>As far as I know the state of Israel is recognized by the UN while there is no Palestinian state as we speak right now. So how could legally speaking at least that the Israelis invaded the Palestine while in fact there is no such state as the Palestine.</p>
              <p> I wrote that the Arab countries from the very onset of the British departure didn't even want to support the idea of a Palestinian state. Eqypt, Syria and Jordan were all just interested in gaining a foothold in the territory left by the British.</p>
              <p>It was only after they lost the war with the Israelis that they supported the cause of the Palestinian people. So I wrote again that the Palestinian cause has been used as a political pawn by the Arab countries.</p>
              <p>The only way that the Palestinian people could see the founding of their own state(country) is a long term peace with Israel. This will not be able to be brought about by arm struggle be it in the form of guerilla war or acts of terrorism. Like it or not the Israel state is here to stay. Whether the Palestinian state could be brought to existence is up to the leaders of the Palestinian people and the goodwill of fellow Arab countries to end the suffering of the Palestinian people and to give them a bright future and to live in peace side by side with the state of Israel. Many Palestinians worked in Israel before the past intifada(uprisings) but now have lost their jobs and hence their living. Stopping the arm struggle is the only way to reach a long term peace solution and open the way to the founding of the Palestinian state.</p>

              <p>Sorry I have to disagree.</p>
              <p>Children are children.</p>
              <p> I shed a tear when I saw on tv, a small girl who died because of Israeli bombing. She was innocent. She had her full life ahead of her.</p>
              <p>But collateral damage in high density(highly populated) battlefield is inevitable though should be put to a minimum. The weapons no matter how smart their guidance systems are cannot differentiate between civilian target or non-civilian.</p>
              <p>This is further worsen by the fact that the Hamas is employing guerilla warfare in which it mixes itself with the civilian population. hiding in hospitals and schools, caching weapons in mosques and underground facility in the middle of town. The war has gone asymmetric.</p>
