              <div><strong>by Hassane Zerouky – Global Research March 23, 2004 </strong></div>
              <br>Thanks to the Mossad, Israel's "Institute for Intelligence and Special Tasks", the Hamas was allowed to reinforce its presence in the occupied territories. Meanwhile, Arafat's Fatah Movement for National Liberation as well as the Palestinian Left were subjected to the most brutal form of repression and intimidation <br><br>Let us not forget that it was Israel, which in fact created Hamas. According to Zeev Sternell, historian at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, "Israel thought that it was a smart ploy to push the Islamists against the Palestinian Liberation Organisation (PLO)". <br><br>Ahmed Yassin, the spiritual leader of the Islamist movement in Palestine, returning from Cairo in the seventies, established an Islamic charity association. Prime Minister Golda Meir, saw this as a an opportunity to counterbalance the rise of Arafat’s Fatah movement. .According to the Israeli weekly <em>Koteret Rashit</em> (October 1987), "The Islamic associations as well as the university had been supported and encouraged by the Israeli military authority" in charge of the (civilian) administration of the West Bank and Gaza. "They [the Islamic associations and the university] were authorized to receive money payments from abroad." <br><br>The Islamists set up orphanages and health clinics, as well as a network of schools, workshops which created employment for women as well as system of financial aid to the poor. And in 1978, they created an "Islamic University" in Gaza. "The military authority was convinced that these activities would weaken both the PLO and the leftist organizations in Gaza." At the end of 1992, there were six hundred mosques in Gaza. Thanks to Israel’s intelligence agency Mossad (Israel’s Institute for Intelligence and Special Tasks) , the Islamists were allowed to reinforce their presence in the occupied territories. Meanwhile, the members of Fatah (Movement for the National Liberation of Palestine) and the Palestinian Left were subjected to the most brutal form of repression. <br><br>In 1984, Ahmed Yassin was arrested and condemned to twelve years in prison, after the discovery of a hidden arms cache. But one year later, he was set free and resumed his activities. And when the Intifada (‘uprising’) began, in October 1987, which took the Islamists by surprise, Sheik Yassin responded by creating the Hamas (The Islamic Resistance Movement): "God is our beginning, the prophet our model, the Koran our constitution", proclaims article 7 of the charter of the organization. <br><br>Ahmed Yassin was in prison when, the Oslo accords (<em>Declaration of Principles on Interim Self-Government</em>) were signed in September 1993. The Hamas had rejected Oslo outright. But at that time, 70% of Palestinians had condemned the attacks on Israeli civilians. Yassin did everything in his power to undermine the Oslo accords. Even prior to Prime Minister Rabin’s death, he had the support of the Israeli government. The latter was very reluctant to implement the peace agreement. <br><br>The Hamas then launched a carefully timed campaign of attacks against civilians, one day before the meeting between Palestinian and Israeli negotiators, regarding the formal recognition of Israel by the National Palestinian Council. These events were largely instrumental in the formation of a Right wing Israeli government following the May 1996 elections. <br><br>Quite unexpectedly, Prime Minister Netanyahu ordered Sheik Ahmed Yassin to be released from prison ("on humanitarian grounds") where he was serving a life sentence. Meanwhile, Netanyahu, together with President Bill Clinton, was putting pressure on Arafat to control the Hamas. In fact, Netanyahu knew that he could rely, once more, on the Islamists to sabotage the Oslo accords. Worse still: after having expelled Yassin to Jordan, Prime Minister Netanyahu allowed him to return to Gaza, where he was welcomed triumphantly as a hero in October 1997. <br><br>Arafat was helpless in the face of these events. Moreover, because he had supported Saddam Hussein during the1991 Gulf war, (while the Hamas had cautiously abstained from taking sides), the Gulf states decided to cut off their financing of the Palestinian Authority. Meanwhile, between February and April 1998, Sheik Ahmad Yassin was able to raise several hundred million dollars, from those same countries. The the budget of The Hamas was said to be greater than that of the Palestinian Authority. These new sources of funding enabled the Islamists to effectively pursue their various charitable activities. It is estimated that one Palestinian out of three is the recipient of financial aid from the Hamas. And in this regard, Israel has done nothing to curb the inflow of money into the occupied territories. <br><br>The Hamas had built its strength through its various acts of sabotage of the peace process, in a way which was compatible with the interests of the Israeli government. In turn, the latter sought in a number of ways, to prevent the application of the Oslo accords. In other words, Hamas was fulfilling the functions for which it was originally created: to prevent the creation of a Palestinian State. And in this regard, Hamas and Ariel Sharon, see eye to eye; they are exactly on the same wave length. <br><span style="font-size: 12px;"><a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/articles/ZER403A.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ffffff;">www.globalresearch.ca/articles/ZER403A.html</span></span></a> <br></span></div>

              <p>For what reason do you classify it as a "conspiracy theory"? While I dont believe that Hamas was CREATED by Israel, it is certain that Israel supported Hamas in the early 1970s in order to weaken its main political rival, the PLO.</p>
              <p>Didnt you know the Americans supported the Mujahedeen, of whom Bin Laden was a member of, against the Soviets? Then the Mujahedeen turned against the US, supposedly on 9/11. Its the same reasoning; "blowback".</p>
              <p>These two sound outrageous and maybe that's why narrow-minded people can't help but call out "conspiracy theories!" once they hear it <strong>even if they dont have any substantiation for it</strong>. But on examining the evidence, the truth becomes evident.</p>
              <p>By the way, you're simply mixing non-mainstream truths with utter speculation like some guy likes to pull the "elvis is alive" crap. Dont try to lump them together and disregard them.</p>

              <br>Different groups representing Iran's Jewish community on Tuesday gathered in front of the United Nations office in Teheran in order to protest "Israeli war crimes and the slaughter of the innocent people in Gaza Strip," the Iranian IRNA news agency reported. <br><br>The protesters, led by the Jewish representative in Parliament, Siamak Mara-Sedq, carried placards with anti-Israel slogans in both Farsi and Hebrew, the report said. <br><br>"We are here to express our support and sympathy with the Palestinian nation," Rahmatollah Rafi, the chairman of Iran's Jewish community was quoted as saying at the rally. <br><br>Hinting mainly at Egypt and Saudi Arabia, the report said that Rafi went on to criticize "certain Arab governments for their inaction and silence towards Israeli inhuman acts and war crimes in Gaza and the entire Palestinian territories." <br><br>Separately, IRNA reported that in a Tuesday speech to the Iranian parliament Mara-Sedq "expressed shock" over the "savage acts" perpetrated by "the Tel Aviv regime." <br><br>The report said that the Jewish MP "expressed hope that all the peace-loving nations and the true advocates of human rights would thoroughly support the defenseless Palestinian people and make Israel stop the genocide in the region by exerting pressure on Tel Aviv." <br><br>He also reportedly gave voice to the "hatred" the Iranian Jewish Community harbors towards "the Israeli crimes." <br><br>According to the report, Mara-Sedq's remarks elicited a chorus of anti-Israel and anti-US slogans from members of parliament. <br><br>Iranian Jewish leaders are often quoted as having given voice to extreme anti-Israel views, but it is unclear whether these opinions are imposed upon them by the regime. <br><br>Some 25,000 Jews live in Iran. <br><span style="font-size: 12px;"><a href="http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1230456535610&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ffffff;">www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1230456535610&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull</span></span></a></span></div>

              <p>Any conspiracy facts can hide another conspiracy underneath it. Nothing is the absolute fact or truth. How are we to know all the little details that is hidden from us, "truths within truth"?</p>
              <p>All I know is the Hamas irresponsibly fired some rockets at Israel with no regards for CIVILIAN JEWs' lives, nor with any regards for their own palestinian people's lives knowing Israel would retaliate. Maybe palestinian civilians, bearing the brunt of the responsibilties for their imbecile government,deserves some pity. But under various circumstances I have pointed out before, it is inevitable.</p>
              <p>BTW, I have never heard of anyone complaining when US dropped an atomic bomb in Hiroshima and literally flattened the whole city and their CIVILIANS.

              <p>=&gt; <a href="http://www.habluetzel.com/palestinian.htm">The "Palestinian" conflict</a></p>
              <p>you guys got to get this clear.. there was never such a thing as "Palestine"... it is like saying "The Sahara" is a country...</p>
              <p>Palestinians are just a bunch of Arabs which even their "Arab brethern" don't want anything to do with.. note how the Egyptians, Jordanians and others shun them and persecute them in ways the Israelis don't even think about?</p>
              <p>do not ever forget that Yassar Arafat flipped everyone the bird in Camp David after the Israelis and US and everyone else gave them everything they asked for.. and he went back and started the Intifadah after telling his own people a pack of lies..</p>
              <p>in 1970, the PLO themselves said there was no such thing as Palestine and when they get the land, they'll immediately merge with Jordan..</p>
              <p>now.. that makes me wonder why Yasser tried to assassinate the King of Jordan once... which ended up infuriating the king so much he massacred a huge pile of Palestinians and ejected even more from Jordan..</p>
              <p>as for Ham-ass, would you negotiate or give in to someone who has in their manifesto the destruction of Israel?  that being said, i don't think the PLO have removed that item from their own manifesto either...</p>
              <p>hell.. if anything the Israelis are going in with kid-gloves.. turn the whole thing around, Israel would have been steamrolled long ago by the Arabs if they could...</p>
              <p>all that being said, the Israelis lost their high moral ground by being ham-fisted and boorish.. there are other ways to fight this war... non-violence and subterfuge would have served them well... instead of the doctrine of overwhelming force against civilians (even if they were willing human shields for the cowards Ham-ass)</p>
              <p>the long and short of it is that all sides in this conflict have blood on their hands... from the Israelis with their idiotic wars, to Ham-ass and their pathological need to be victims, to the corruption of the PLO and the duplicity of the Arabs...</p>
              <p>everyone can be called a terrorist in this tragedy...</p>

              <p>And I guess it doesn't hurt that most religions and people condemns the Jews wrongly. And not to forget the anti-semetics out there. People always look at things through their tinted glasses.</p>
              <p>And btw, I'm just offended by the post starter. What's with the boycotting idealism? How about skipping your MacDonalds' and stop watching Hollywood movies? LOL</p>
