              <h2><em>A Visit to a Gaza Rocket Factory</em></h2>
              <p class="spAutorenzeile"><em>By <a href="mailto:ulrike_putz@spiegel.de">Ulrike Putz</a> in the Gaza Strip</em></p>
              <p class="spIntrotext"><em><strong>No
              matter what Israel does, the rockets from the Gaza Strip just keep
              coming. Young men like Abdul are the reason why. He studies by day, but
              at night he builds bombs for the Islamic Jihad. He and his fellow
              militants can produce up to 100 per night.</strong></em></p>

              </p>
              <p><em>The young man pulls the door of the taxi closed. He is wet. There is
              a light drizzle in the Gaza Strip. He turns around and greets the
              passengers in the back seat with a quick handshake. "Are you ready?" he
              asks them. "As of this moment, we could be going to paradise at any
              time." The other people in the car don’t respond, and the driver of the
              Mercedes hits the gas. "I should have phoned my wife," he says after a
              while. "She should start to keep an eye out for a new husband."</em></p>

              <p><em><br> It’s a long journey through the pitch-dark night as the taxi heads
              towards the secret rocket factory in the Gaza Strip. Since Abdul* and
              his two friends got in, it has become a life-threatening trip. The
              young men produce rockets for the Islamic Jihad. Day after day, their
              rudimentary bombs land on Israeli villages, fields and kibbutzim.
              Israel responds by using air strikes to kill the Qassam commandos. The
              attacks mostly target cars that carry the militants to their missions
              -- cars like the one we are traveling in this evening. </em></p>
              <p><em>The car is traveling north in the direction of the Israeli border.
              The men make jokes about the virgins that according to Islamic belief
              are awaiting them in paradise: gallows humor. One holds a pistol in the
              face of the stranger: "I just wanted to see if you would be
              frightened." It's now pouring outside, the taxi's windows are so fogged
              that the promised blindfold is no longer necessary. It is impossible to
              tell where the car is; it's just clear that the houses outside are
              looking increasingly poor. Next to dark windows there are posters
              honoring the "martyrs," the Palestinians killed in the struggle with
              Israel. Smoldering campfires that appear between the massive puddles
              light the way.</em></p>

              <p><em><strong>The Fertilizer Comes from Israel</strong></em></p>
              <p><em>The vehicle finally stops at a dirt track. The Islamic Jihad rocket
              factory is housed in a kind of garden shed. The hut measures five
              meters by five meters, metal pipes with small wings lean against the
              wall in the corner: Half finished Qassams. There are several tightly
              packed garbage bags on a shelf. "TNT," says Abdul and produces a chunk.
              The explosive looks like lumpy sugar. A large cauldron is sitting ready
              on a gas cooker while bags with Hebrew writing are piled up high up
              against the wall. "Fertilizer for the rocket fuel," Abdul says and
              grins. "We get it in Israel."</em></p>
              <p><em>Abdul is 22 but, tall and lanky as he is, he could still pass for
              16. He has been making rockets for three and a half years and says he
              has finished hundreds of Qassams. A veteran with a double life: He
              studies geography during the day and makes his contribution to the
              Jihad at night.</em></p>
              <p><em>Qassams are primitive missiles lacking any guidance system. Building
              one is "child's play," Abdul says: One of the team welds the rocket
              casings together from metal pipes, while another fills the warhead with
              up to three kilograms of TNT. Abdul's specialty is the last step: the
              rocket propulsion. He and his mates brew up the fuel out of a mixture
              of glucose, fertilizer and a few other chemicals, which is used to fire
              the rockets at distances of up to nine kilometers. Right at the end, he
              inserts the detonator cap, which makes the missile explode on impact.
              They hide the finished rockets in depots, which the launch commandos
              can then freely avail themselves of. Abdul only fires them himself when
              he has made some tiny improvements to a proven model. "Then I want to
              see how it flies."</em></p>
              <p><em><strong>Up to 100 Rockets a Night</strong></em></p>
              <p><em>The team can make up to 100 rockets per night shift, but today it
              won't be more than 10. Instead of the usual 12, only three of Abdul's
              men have turned up tonight. "The other guys are over in Egypt,
              shopping," he says, adding that the militants are just ordinary people
              who want to experience the open border with the neighboring country.
              Will they be looking for ingredients for building the Qassams?
              "Hardly," the oldest of the group laughs. "They are buying potato
              chips. We have enough raw materials to last for a few years."</em></p>
              <p><em>The presence of smuggling tunnels under the Egyptian border have
              ensured that there is never a lack of supplies. "The TNT comes to us
              from Sudan via Egypt." Other elements arrive by boat across the sea to
              Gaza. "We get some from Eastern Europe." The raw materials for one
              large rocket cost up to €500. The money to finance the operation comes
              the same route as the materials. "The Israeli blockade doesn't affect
              us; it's just intended to plunge the people into misery."</em></p>
              <p><em>Now and then shots can be heard outside and an explosion echoes
              through the night. There is fighting at the nearby border. The
              walkie-talkies in the hut keep them up-to-date on the situation. With a
              hiss, the gas cooker comes to life. A cauldron full of fuel is set on
              it, and one of the men stirs in a lump of golden syrup, while the
              others weigh the fertilizer, which contains nitrate. They explain that
              the nitrate has to be mixed very slowly with the sugar solution. "The
              thing is highly explosive." Abdul admits that many of his friends have
              suffered severe burns or lost fingers. He shrugs his shoulders: "There
              is a local saying in Gaza: He who cooks poison has to also try it."</em></p>
              <p><em><strong>'If It Hits a Child, naturally We are not Happy'</strong></em></p>
              <p><em>The production of the fuel may be delicate, but the really danger
              lies in the Israeli helicopters, Abdul says. "We know that we are easy
              prey." His thumb flashes a nervous Morse code with his flashlight onto
              the floor of the hut. "We are ready to die; that is the price of our
              freedom." He says that the Palestinians are left with no other choice
              but to fight the Israelis with weapons. "Either we resist, or they
              treat us like slaves." He has thought about who is hit by his rockets.
              "If we kill soldiers, then we are more than happy," he says. "If it
              hits a child, then naturally we are not happy."</em></p>

              <p><em><br> The simple fact of the matter is that you can't aim a Qassam, he says.
              "And look at the Israelis. They have F-16s and Apache helicopters and
              can shoot with </em>amazing accuracy. And they still kill our women and
              children." He reflects for a moment. "Children shouldn’t be killed in
              any war in this world," says Abdul, who has no children of his own.</p>
              <p>Then he sends everyone outside. "This is the most dangerous moment.
              Just before the fuel is ready, the whole thing can explode." Over tea
              on the porch Abdul tells of his career as a rocket maker. A few hours
              of theory, then he and his friends did their apprenticeship with an
              experienced rocket builder. He doesn’t want to explicitly say it, but
              it seems as if he also trained abroad. "I was in Syria, Jordan and one
              other country," he says. In Iran? Abdul smiles slightly.</p>

              <p><strong>'My Mother Is Proud of Me'</strong></p>
              <p>The rocket fuel in the cauldron is ready: a thick yellow dough.
              Abdul carries a spoonful outside and put it in the fire on which the
              tea is brewing. A flame darts up, the nitrate-sugar mixture fizzes and
              bubbles as it burns off. It smells like fireworks, Abdul is pleased.
              The mixture is ready and is poured into a plastic tube, where it is to
              cool down. A fuse with a long wire is embedded in the mixture, with
              which the rocket can be ignited later. Once the fuel has set, the
              plastic tube will be cut away and the yellow fuel cylinder will be
              placed in the Qassam casing.</p>
              <p>Now that the first Qassam rocket of the night is practically
              finished, Abdul has become quieter. "Today the clouds are protecting us
              from the Israeli drones."</p>
              <p>The Islamic Jihad widows and orphans fund won't need to be used for
              his bereaved relatives. His mother, who worries so much about him, will
              be glad tomorrow morning when her son wakes up in his bed. "On the one
              hand, she is proud of me," he says. "But, at the end of the day, she is
              still a mother."</p>

              <p><br>So did Hitler. And murdered millions thru his ideology of 'Master Race'. Non-aryans were to be slaves. Children and the weak to be slaughtered.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In the past, our ancestors may had condoned killing of innocents, but NOT this generation or the next.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hamas and their ideology of jewish genocide is only a repetition of history, to complete what the arabs' ally which was Hitler during WWII, failed to finish. IT MUST END!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>After WWII, it heralded the end of colonnialism with the victorious great US President Franklin Roosevelt's inspiring '4 freedom' famous speech.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Colonnised terroritories were given back to those who had lived in those lands and were fit to rule and had majority support.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If the Orang Asli were educated enough, they would had been the owners of an independent Malaysia, and not the Majuhapit descedents.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Israel declared independence from England and was recognised as a State by a majority of free nations in the UN. It had honoured its pledges to the oaths of UN that binds all nations for peace.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But sadly, it continued to be harrassed by the arabs thru numerous attacks and wars, whom used mis-interpretated religion to whip up the masses to wipe out a group of innocent human beings.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Israel and jews had contributed wealth and more critically, intelligence, to our world. It had never wavered in its support of small states that needed help.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Yet when it face multiple missile attacks daily for months by the terrorist religious group Hamas masquerading as a political entity, the world did nothing.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I readily admit i did nothing too, to my bitter regret now, as i watched Hamas' <strong>'emplaced purpose collateral damage'</strong> made up of innocent men, women and children of Gaza, marked for death!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Therefore, if anyone who wishes to protest about the Israeli retaliation so that innocents may live must CALL HAMAS INTO ACCOUNT for the genocide of jews as well as the palestinians!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If we don't, it will only be a clear sign to the terrorist organisations that murder of innocents is still condone in our age, regardless of muslims or espacially non-muslims.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Every protest board that condemns Israel without condemning Hamas is a blank cheque note to Hamas and other terrorist organisations to continue with their ideology - kill jews and infidels-meaning you and me.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Even muslims will not be spared, and must accept death as 'collateral damage' for the sake of their mis-guided and twisted ideology.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>PS:- I am frightened but at the same time saddened by the more extreme muslims in Malaysia and Indonesia protest actions.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Do they truly support the fight against terrorism or had they succumb to the terrrorist's ideology of death to infidels, including innocent men, women and children of the muslim faith to accept being 'collateral dammage' in their politically correct term called 'sacrifice'?</p>

              <h3><em>GRAVEYARD SHIFT FOR ISLAMIC JIHAD</em></h3>
              <h2><em>A Visit to a Gaza Rocket Factory</em></h2>
              <p><em>By <a rel="nofollow" href="mailto:ulrike_putz@spiegel.de">Ulrike Putz</a> in the Gaza Strip</em></p>
              <p><em><strong>No matter what Israel does, the rockets from the Gaza Strip just keep coming. Young men like Abdul are the reason why. He studies by day, but at night he builds bombs for the Islamic Jihad. He and his fellow militants can produce up to 100 per night.</strong></em></p>
              <p><em>The young man pulls the door of the taxi closed. He is wet. There is a light drizzle in the Gaza Strip. He turns around and greets the passengers in the back seat with a quick handshake. "Are you ready?" he asks them. "As of this moment, we could be going to paradise at any time." The other people in the car don’t respond, and the driver of the Mercedes hits the gas. "I should have phoned my wife," he says after a while. "She should start to keep an eye out for a new husband."</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <h4><em>PHOTO GALLERY: BUILDING QASSAM ROCKETS IN GAZA</em></h4>
              <p><em><br></em></p>
              <p><em>Click on a picture to launch the image gallery (9 Photos)</em></p>
              <p><em><br>It’s a long journey through the pitch-dark night as the taxi heads towards the secret rocket factory in the Gaza Strip. Since Abdul* and his two friends got in, it has become a life-threatening trip. The young men produce rockets for the Islamic Jihad. Day after day, their rudimentary bombs land on Israeli villages, fields and kibbutzim. Israel responds by using air strikes to kill the Qassam commandos. The attacks mostly target cars that carry the militants to their missions -- cars like the one we are traveling in this evening.</em></p>
              <p><em>The car is traveling north in the direction of the Israeli border. The men make jokes about the virgins that according to Islamic belief are awaiting them in paradise: gallows humor. One holds a pistol in the face of the stranger: "I just wanted to see if you would be frightened." It's now pouring outside, the taxi's windows are so fogged that the promised blindfold is no longer necessary. It is impossible to tell where the car is; it's just clear that the houses outside are looking increasingly poor. Next to dark windows there are posters honoring the "martyrs," the Palestinians killed in the struggle with Israel. Smoldering campfires that appear between the massive puddles light the way.</em></p>

              <p><em><strong>The Fertilizer Comes from Israel</strong></em></p>
              <p><em>The vehicle finally stops at a dirt track. The Islamic Jihad rocket factory is housed in a kind of garden shed. The hut measures five meters by five meters, metal pipes with small wings lean against the wall in the corner: Half finished Qassams. There are several tightly packed garbage bags on a shelf. "TNT," says Abdul and produces a chunk. The explosive looks like lumpy sugar. A large cauldron is sitting ready on a gas cooker while bags with Hebrew writing are piled up high up against the wall. "Fertilizer for the rocket fuel," Abdul says and grins. "We get it in Israel."</em></p>
              <p><em>Abdul is 22 but, tall and lanky as he is, he could still pass for 16. He has been making rockets for three and a half years and says he has finished hundreds of Qassams. A veteran with a double life: He studies geography during the day and makes his contribution to the Jihad at night.</em></p>
              <p><em>Qassams are primitive missiles lacking any guidance system. Building one is "child's play," Abdul says: One of the team welds the rocket casings together from metal pipes, while another fills the warhead with up to three kilograms of TNT. Abdul's specialty is the last step: the rocket propulsion. He and his mates brew up the fuel out of a mixture of glucose, fertilizer and a few other chemicals, which is used to fire the rockets at distances of up to nine kilometers. Right at the end, he inserts the detonator cap, which makes the missile explode on impact. They hide the finished rockets in depots, which the launch commandos can then freely avail themselves of. Abdul only fires them himself when he has made some tiny improvements to a proven model. "Then I want to see how it flies."</em></p>
              <p><em><strong>Up to 100 Rockets a Night</strong></em></p>
              <p><em>The team can make up to 100 rockets per night shift, but today it won't be more than 10. Instead of the usual 12, only three of Abdul's men have turned up tonight. "The other guys are over in Egypt, shopping," he says, adding that the militants are just ordinary people who want to experience the open border with the neighboring country. Will they be looking for ingredients for building the Qassams? "Hardly," the oldest of the group laughs. "They are buying potato chips. We have enough raw materials to last for a few years."</em></p>
              <p><em>The presence of smuggling tunnels under the Egyptian border have ensured that there is never a lack of supplies. "The TNT comes to us from Sudan via Egypt." Other elements arrive by boat across the sea to Gaza. "We get some from Eastern Europe." The raw materials for one large rocket cost up to €500. The money to finance the operation comes the same route as the materials. "The Israeli blockade doesn't affect us; it's just intended to plunge the people into misery."</em></p>
              <p><em>Now and then shots can be heard outside and an explosion echoes through the night. There is fighting at the nearby border. The walkie-talkies in the hut keep them up-to-date on the situation. With a hiss, the gas cooker comes to life. A cauldron full of fuel is set on it, and one of the men stirs in a lump of golden syrup, while the others weigh the fertilizer, which contains nitrate. They explain that the nitrate has to be mixed very slowly with the sugar solution. "The thing is highly explosive." Abdul admits that many of his friends have suffered severe burns or lost fingers. He shrugs his shoulders: "There is a local saying in Gaza: He who cooks poison has to also try it."</em></p>
              <p><em><strong>'If It Hits a Child, naturally We are not Happy'</strong></em></p>
              <p><em>The production of the fuel may be delicate, but the really danger lies in the Israeli helicopters, Abdul says. "We know that we are easy prey." His thumb flashes a nervous Morse code with his flashlight onto the floor of the hut. "We are ready to die; that is the price of our freedom." He says that the Palestinians are left with no other choice but to fight the Israelis with weapons. "Either we resist, or they treat us like slaves." He has thought about who is hit by his rockets. "If we kill soldiers, then we are more than happy," he says. "If it hits a child, then naturally we are not happy."</em></p>

              <p><em><br>The simple fact of the matter is that you can't aim a Qassam, he says. "And look at the Israelis. They have F-16s and Apache helicopters and can shoot with</em> amazing accuracy. And they still kill our women and children." He reflects for a moment. "Children shouldn’t be killed in any war in this world," says Abdul, who has no children of his own.</p>
              <p>Then he sends everyone outside. "This is the most dangerous moment. Just before the fuel is ready, the whole thing can explode." Over tea on the porch Abdul tells of his career as a rocket maker. A few hours of theory, then he and his friends did their apprenticeship with an experienced rocket builder. He doesn’t want to explicitly say it, but it seems as if he also trained abroad. "I was in Syria, Jordan and one other country," he says. In Iran? Abdul smiles slightly.</p>

              <p>The rocket fuel in the cauldron is ready: a thick yellow dough. Abdul carries a spoonful outside and put it in the fire on which the tea is brewing. A flame darts up, the nitrate-sugar mixture fizzes and bubbles as it burns off. It smells like fireworks, Abdul is pleased. The mixture is ready and is poured into a plastic tube, where it is to cool down. A fuse with a long wire is embedded in the mixture, with which the rocket can be ignited later. Once the fuel has set, the plastic tube will be cut away and the yellow fuel cylinder will be placed in the Qassam casing.</p>
              <p>Now that the first Qassam rocket of the night is practically finished, Abdul has become quieter. "Today the clouds are protecting us from the Israeli drones."</p>
              <p>The Islamic Jihad widows and orphans fund won't need to be used for his bereaved relatives. His mother, who worries so much about him, will be glad tomorrow morning when her son wakes up in his bed. "On the one hand, she is proud of me," he says. "But, at the end of the day, she is still a mother."</p>

              <p>thks bro good post. u mention fertilizer comes <span style="color: #003300;">from Israel, Mozzad is the number 1 agent in the world, how come the don't know that Palestine buy fertilizer for rocket that going to be launch to Israel? </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #003300;">The biggest rocket can reach distances of up to nine kilometers. Wow so powerful Israel launch 1 rocket then spilt to 20 small rocket and attach with chemical lastest news.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #003300;">1 night they can do 100 rocket, So have hamas launch all 1 night rocket to Israel ? It make me thinking how many night do hamas have spent doing the rocket?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #003300;">so bro i have to say this, it hard to believe that someone can let the whole world know about their plan. If u plan of killing someone would u broadcast to the News and tell them who, when or where u going to kill this someone. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #003300;">The lastest incident in singapore is very good example, what the 70 years uncle do?</span></p>

              <p><strong>British MP: Israel exploiting Holocaust</strong><br> <strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong>Jewish lawmaker says gentiles' guilt providing Israeli government with excuse to murder Palestinians</strong></p>
              <p>A British lawmaker declared Thursday that <a href="http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3284752,00.html">Israel</a> was taking advantage of the guilt many non-Jews feel over the Holocaust to ruthlessly press ahead with its <a href="http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3646673,00.html">offensive in Gaza</a>.         <br> Gerald Kaufman, a governing Labour Party legislator, sharply criticized
              Israel in a House of Commons debate on Gaza, arguing that the Jewish
              state has exploited guilt that much of the world feels for having
              ignored the slaughter of millions of Jews during World War II. <br> "The present Israeli government ruthlessly and cynically exploits the
              continuing guilt from Gentiles over the slaughter of Jews in the
              Holocaust as justification for their murder of Palestinians," he said. <br> The offensive started in response to <a href="http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3377113,00.html">Hamas</a> rocket attacks on Israeli cities. Medical officials in Gaza say about
              1,100 Palestinians have been killed since the offensive started. <br> Kaufman, a frequent critic of Israel who was raised as an Orthodox Jew,
              commented on the claim that large numbers of the Palestinian victims
              were militants.</p>
              <p>"I suppose the Jews fighting for their lives in the Warsaw ghetto could have been dismissed as militants," he said.</p>
              <p>Kaufman urged the British government to impose an arms embargo on Israel<br> <br> My grandmother was ill in bed when the Nazis came to her home town. ...
              A German soldier shot her dead in her bed," he said. "My grandmother
              did not die to provide cover for Israeli soldiers murdering Palestinian
              grandmothers in Gaza."</p>
