              Stop talking about the Stern Gang. Because in politics sometimes things you cannot do in broad daylight you have to do it with another way. That is the only way to achieve your aim, or the greater cause.
              
              Whole lot of other countries also has groups of people like these, and I can't be bothered to give examples. So why is  the Stern Gang condemned in this argument?
              
              The Hamas are cowards. You can see from their strategy is to fight amongst civilians. When civilians die all these humanitarian sissy groups will make an outcry, thus also perverting the other normal people's views. This is actually to the HAmas advantage, because as you can see, being a corrupted and fanatical group of losers, they don't really give a shit how many of their civilian people dies. To them, their people ain't worth a cent, as opposed to Israelis.
              
              So the Israelis should just give the Hamas what they want without any regards. Want to save the PAlestine? COuntries of the UN should just agree to the overthrowing of the Hamas and accede this piece of crap land to whoever wants it. I dont' think the Israelis would really care who the land belongs to, as long as they are not aggravated in the future by those Arabs.

              Gedanken, funny how your posts all seem to condemn Israel. The Jews. The way you say everything is like everything the Israelis have done is based on terrorism.
              
              A lot of things happens without us ever knowing the real reason behind it. Especially in politics.
              
              Stop your crap because you are starting to sound like a fanatical Muslim.

              And for your info... please go read all my posts. I have NEVER said the Palestinians are terrorists. I am only condemning the Hamas on their terrorist and cowardly acts.
              
              But I do not agree that Israel are in the wrong, because if the same thing happens to me, I would also retaliate without remorse.
              
              SO many people ask why block off the borders into Israel from the Palestinians. Well, ask why Egypt is doing the same thing too? Would you let a potential terrorist threat (people who keeps deny your existence and swearing to eliminate you) have free access into you country? Ever heard of suicide bombers?
              
              And why block off food and other neccessities into Gaza since 2007? Well would you have allowed the citizens of your potential threat food and neccessities, knowing full well most would probably have been turned over to the Hamas?

              <p>Of course I'm condemning Israel - are you too stupid to recognise the possibility that their hands are not entirely lily-white in this matter?  They're bitching about someone else doing precisely what they themselves have done in the past, and using it as justification to put another population through the hell that they were put through in World War 2 (which, incidentally, is what they seem to think gives them carte blanche to do what they bloody well please these days).  They're a bunch of bloody hypocrites for:</p>
              <p>1) Condemning terrorism when their country was founded on terrorism<br>2) Whining about the Holocaust on one hand and putting the Palestineans through a Holocaust on the other</p>
              <p>Your blindness to these two self-evident truths makes you an ignorant mindless Zionist.</p>
              <p>And don't be ridiculous.  While you ask people to read all of your drivel, you obviously don't take your own advice.  Hell, you're almost Israeli in your hypocrisy. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>How can I sound like a fanatical Muslim when I have not written a single word in support of them?  All I've written about so far is Israel's hypocrisy and the falseness of any of their claims to the moral high ground - I've said nothing in approval of what Hamas or any other Palestineans are doing.</p>

              <p>It was basically a no man's land after the British departure which was fought by the Arab armies and the Israeli resistance like the Haganah, the embrionic of the Israeli army.</p>
              <p>In 1948 after the British departure there was no Palestinian movement.....Eqypt, Syria and Jordan were spoiling to get a foothold in the territory. The Jews who felt that they ahd a right to live in safety fought to have a piece of land to call their own.</p>
              <p>Only after Egypt, Syria and Jordan lost the 1967 war which gain Israel substantial land that  the Palestinian cause came to surface to be used as a political pawn.</p>
              <p>The problems of the Palestinian people could have been solved by a day's oil income of the Arab nations. But it wasn't. And the Palestinian people paid the price for it.</p>

                  <p>Are you retarded or uneducated? The palestinians have all the
                  right in the world to give israel hell. Israel literally stole
                  their country with US support, kicked them all out, and made them
                  suffer for 60 years. </p>
                  <p>If the Malaysian army backed by the UN came to Singapore and say
                  they're "looking for a homeland", beat us up, kick us all out to
                  cram in some offshore island, and left us to starve and suffer for
                  60 years, I'm god damn sure any missiles i get will go flying
                  straight at them.</p>
                  <p>So if i want my singapore back from these invaders, am i
                  "greedy, corrupted and wanting more and more" ?</p>

              <p>They are fighting terrorist that is what they said, when israel steal the palestine land nobody call them terrorist but when palestine fighting for their right they were label as terrorist. how power is the rocket compare to israel rocket,</p>
              <p>Hamas attack rocket to israel ? How can when hamas have only rocket and weapon that can't fight israel weapon. Palestine has seen fighting with israel army by using sling shot with stone. they suffer so long they learn a lesson so i don't believe they attack israel. Israel intention is to weak palestine not as what they say to stop hamas rocket.</p>

              <p>You dont need to give me a history lesson, because i can teach it. pre1948 palestine was a british outpost, inhabited by palestinians with a minority jew population. Post ww2, the jews decided the take the land for themselves with mass migrations to palestine. Stern and Haganah were active to combat two factors, british refusal to cooperate with them, and the palestinians. The british actually limited israeli immigration. It was only with US support due to the jewish lobby in the US domestic political arena that Israel came to be. In this sense the palestinians were subjugated by the Jews with US support. Refer to UN resolution 242 where the land was split between the jews and palestinians dejure. </p>
              <p>Its very very clear that the Jews walked in the took the land right out of palestinian hands. It was not a no man's land. You're talking so much about post48 palestine. For what? The whole thing originated before 1948. By 1948 the jews already had a foothold, and i maintain, had already stolen the land.</p>

The "Mandate for Palestine" is a League of Nations document that laid down the Jewish legal rights in Palestine. The British Mandate, on the other hand, was entrusted by the League of Nations with the responsibility to administrate the area delineated by the "Mandate for Palestine."</p>
              <p>Great Britain [i.e., the Mandatory and Trustee] did turn over its responsibility to the United Nations as of May 14, 1948. However, the legal force of the League of Nations’ "Mandate for Palestine" [i.e., The Trust] was not terminated with the end of the British Mandate. Rather, the Trust was transferred over to the United Nations.</p>

              <p>Its very very clear that the Jews walked in the took the land right out of palestinian hands. It was not a no man's land. You're talking so much about post48 palestine. For what? The whole thing originated before 1948. By 1948 the jews already had a foothold, and i maintain, had already stolen the land.</p>

              <p>Seriously dudes.. why are you guys arguing about history ? About who take over what land or what land don't belong to who ?</p>
              <p>Nobody owns the land we live on..yet humans are fighting over lands that never belonged to us since the beginning of time.</p>
              <p>Yesterday.. I see muslims families shopping peacefully in the shopping malls.. the women with their burqas and the men wearing western clothings with their face full of beard...they were smiling and their kids were running around happily. </p>
              <p>Do you really think they care about HISTORY ?</p>

                          <p>1) Mass jewish immigration after the war end ? Hello read your history !!! Hello the first aliyah began in 1881â€“82 25,000â€“35,000 jews,  second aliyah - 1904 - 1914 40,000 Jews
                              How can you say immigration after the war end when the 1st Aliyah happen before the war !!! After the war then the 3rd and 4th aliyah </p><p>
                              
                          </p><p>    This happen 1st - During World War I, British Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour issued what became known as the Balfour Declaration, which "view[ed] with favour the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people". After that then in the wake of the Jaffa riots in the early days of the Mandate, the British restricted Jewish immigration. Hello - so what they try to stop it later, but I am right that they are the first to start it.
                          </p>    
                          
                          <p>2)UN resolution 242 ? which come 1st, chicken or the egg ? The palestinain lost their land when the arab armies lost their war with isreal - that is refering to the six day war. The end result after the war is the UN resolution 242 - it is the end product of the six day war moron !! - so what wrong with me saying the six-day war cause the palestinain their land when the end result is the UN resolution 242 .    </p>
                      
                      Please read your history more before you insult people with your limit knowledge.
