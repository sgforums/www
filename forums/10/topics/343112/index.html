              <p>Saddam's Iraq has no connection with Bin Laden or Al Qaeda. Even the Pentagon admits that.</p>
              <p>If you're unhappy about political malfeasance in Singapore, just say the government is corrupt. But until the government commits or threatens to commit acts of violence to further their political aims- which is the definition of terrorism, they aren't terrorists. Terrorists can mean both non-state and state (western and non-western as well). Dont forget that.</p>

              <p>WTF why are u calling Israel terrorists?!?</p>
              <p>Hamas are the 1st person to fire rockets into Israel unprovoked and Israel is only retaliating. Do you know the consequences if they don't do so?</p>
              <p>All the Arab countries around Israel who hates this non-Islam country so much just because they are Jews are going to think Israel is ripe for the taking and start attacking, threatening or taking advantage of Israel.</p>
              <p>Everyone is reporting the violence on the civilians living in the Gaza Strip. I mean... come on! Teach me how to attack a place without killing any civilians. The World Congress keeps asking Israel to cease fire only because they are afraid of offending the Arabs who are providing them with OIL. This world is one mightly F-ed up place, man.</p>
              <p>If Malaysia fire a rocket into SIngapore you tell me what you guys are gonna do, huh?</p>
              <p>Say "Thank you very much?" Or return an eye for an eye? Then if Malaysia still insisting on attacking us while telling the others to make us cease fire what do you do?</p>
              <p>800 Palestinians dead are people dead. 80 Jews dead is not deaths?!?! So Jew's lives are worth nothing!?! Jews are good in warfare. They can protect their own people well. Just ask the noob Arab nations who have been trashed by Israel over the years. Just because the corrupted Hamas got lives to throw away means they have humanitarian crisis?!!? What F-ing stupd theory is this???</p>
              <p>Come on short-sighted normal people on the street, wake up and see this world with a clearer picture! Don't just observe this world from what other ignorant people are telling you!</p>

              <p>WTF why are u calling Israel terrorists?!?</p>
              <p>Hamas are the 1st person to fire rockets into Israel unprovoked
              and Israel is only retaliating. Do you know the consequences if
              they don't do so?</p>
              <p>All the Arab countries around Israel who hates this non-Islam
              country so much just because they are Jews are going to think
              Israel is ripe for the taking and start attacking, threatening or
              taking advantage of Israel.</p>
              <p>Everyone is reporting the violence on the civilians living in
              the Gaza Strip. I mean... come on! Teach me how to attack a place
              without killing any civilians. The World Congress keeps asking
              Israel to cease fire only because they are afraid of offending the
              Arabs who are providing them with OIL. This world is one mightly
              F-ed up place, man.</p>
              <p>If Malaysia fire a rocket into SIngapore you tell me what you
              guys are gonna do, huh?</p>
              <p>Say "Thank you very much?" Or return an eye for an eye? Then if
              Malaysia still insisting on attacking us while telling the others
              to make us cease fire what do you do?</p>
              <p>800 Palestinians dead are people dead. 80 Jews dead is not
              deaths?!?! So Jew's lives are worth nothing!?! Jews are good in
              warfare. They can protect their own people well. Just ask the noob
              Arab nations who have been trashed by Israel over the years. Just
              because the corrupted Hamas got lives to throw away means they have
              humanitarian crisis?!!? What F-ing stupd theory is this???</p>
              <p>Come on short-sighted normal people on the street, wake up and
              see this world with a clearer picture! Don't just observe this
              world from what other ignorant people are telling you!</p>

              <p>Firstly, Singapore isn't oppressing the Malaysian people by blockading their ports and restricting the flow of goods into Malaysia.</p>
              <p>Secondly, if present-day Malaysia invades Singapore and Singapore retaliates, it is a war between two modern armies, not a massacre of guerilla fighters, without an air force or navy, against the world's 4th largest military.</p>
              <p>So it seems that one Israeli life is worth 10 Palestinians'....</p>

              <td>PLYMOUTH -- Two men whom police described as Middle Eastern were detained in the township by federal imigration authorities after being found with detailed footage of the Sears Tower in Chicago. Plymouth Police encountered the men after an officer responded to Pizzeria Uno on the 1000 block of West Ridge Pike at 2:40 p.m. Thursday for a report of illegal dumping, according to reports. A manager there advised the police officer that a tractor-trailer was observed backed up to the dumpster at the rear of the restaurant. The manager noticed a freshly dumped pile of furniture adjacent to the dumpster, according to police.
              <p>The manager confronted the vehicle's operator, a Middle Eastern man, police said. The man, who later identified himself as Moshe Elmakias, 30, denied that he did anything and fled the scene, heading west on West Ridge Pike, according to police.</p>
              <p>The manager was able to provide township police with the Florida registration number of the tractor-trailer and said that a sign posted on the side of the vehicle read "Moving Systems Incorporated" and included a phone number, police said.</p>
              <p>The area was searched by township police, and the vehicle was spotted parked on the curb in front of John Kennedy ford on Ridge Pike, Just west of Industrial Way.</p>
              <p>An officer proceeded to make contact with the occupants of the truck by knocking on the cab, according to reports. A Middle Eastern man, later identified as Ron Katar, 23, exited the sleeper area of the cab and said that the operator was across the street as he pointed toward the Don Rosen porsche dealer, reports said.</p>
              <p>Elmakias and a white female, Ayelet Reisler, 23, were approaching the vehicle from the dealership, but the female then began walking in a different direction, acting as if she were not with Elmakias, according to reports.</p>
              <p>Reisler was detained and checked for identification. She had a German passport in her name and medication in a different name, police said. Plymouth Police Sgt. Thomas Longo was notified and responded to the incident.</p>
              <p>Elmakias allegedly admitted to being behind Pizzeria Uno, although he said that he did not dump furniture, he was only turning around. Elmakias said that his destination was New York and that he was also coming from New York. He said he was in Plymouth because he was supposed to make a pickup from a male in the morning and pointed toward the Storage USA facility on Belvoir Road and West Ridge Pike, police said. Elmakias could not, however, provide a name or telephone number of the customer. Township police dispatched a request for a Motor Carrier Safety Assistance Program Inspector.</p>
              <p>Officer Gerald Schwartz of the Whitpain Police Department responded. Schwartz discovered through his investigation that the operator's log had been falsified and put the truck out of service due to violations, police said. In addition, the vehicle reportedly had numerous equipment violations that rendered the truck unsafe.</p>
              <p>Inspection of the tractor-trailer's contents revealed a load three-quarters full containing household items, including furniture and boxes. Among the items in the truck was a Sony video camera.</p>
              <p>Plymouth Police Officer David McCann reviewed the tape found inside the camera. The tape had video footage of Chicago with zoomed-in shots of the Sears Tower, according to police.</p>
              <p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation was notified of the incident and all three subjects were transported to the Plymouth Police station. The subjects were then processed through the National Crime Information center and placed into detention, according to the report.</p>
              <p>FBI Agents James Sweeney and Richard Tofani arrived at the station and proceeded to investigate both the subjects and their belongings with the assistance of Immigration and Naturalization Services. Elmakias and Katar were eventually detained by INS and transported to a federal facility, said police. Reisler was released.</p>
              <p>All evidence collected by Plymouth and Whitpain officers was transferred to federal facilities with the exeption of a VCR. Special Agent Linda Vizi, as spokeswoman for the Philadelphia and FBI, could not be contacted for comment on further investigations.</p>

              <p>Closer to New York, FBI agents and Bergen County Sheriff's Department crime scene technicians spent three hours Thursday night searching the Weehawken headquarters of Urban Moving Systems at 3W 18th St.</p>
              <p>Investigators first became interested in the business after witnesses reported Tuesday that three men seemed to celebrate the World Trade Center explosions in Liberty State Park, then drove away in a company van. 'To the best of my knowledge, my client Urban Moving Systems and Dominik Suter are not targets,' said attorney Jay Hamill of Jersey City. 'This is an informational situation. We're cooperating completely and have objected to nothing they've requested.'</p>
              <p>Agents took pictures inside the company's office Thursday night and seized 13 computer hard drives. They also showed a keen interest in the roof, which had a very clear view of the World Trade Center until Tuesday. A half-dozen agents searched the roof with flashlights and appeared particularly interested in the sight lines from the roof toward downtown Manhattan.</p>
              <p>East Rutherford police stopped an Urban Moving Systems van on Route 3 Tuesday and detained five men inside, at least some of them company employees. The occupants said they were all Israelis. They were being detained because they are in violation of immigration regulations, and all have expressed a desire to leave the country on their own, according to an Immigration and Naturalization Service spokesman. An employee of Urban Moving Systems, who would not give his name, said the majority of his co-workers are Israelis and were joking on the day of the attacks.</p>
              <p>'I was in tears,' the man said. 'These guys were joking and that bothered me. These guys were like, "Now America knows what we go through."</p>
