No large address number plate. No signboard.<br><br>It looked like any other Chinatown shophouse.<br><br>And it took extreme measures to ensure secrecy. For instance, only those who signed up as 'club members' got the password to enter its website. (See report on facing page).<br><br>Despite this, it still attracted around 100 members.<br><br>What was the draw?<br><br>The tagline on its website claimed it was an exclusive members-only 'Gentlemen's Club'.<br><br>The bigger lure was sex with women dressed as air stewardesses, corporate executives, secretaries - even Sailor Moon, the popular Japanese Anime character.<br><br>The name of this so-called club was 'Dreams Come True'.<br><br>But the fantasy world was busted after a reader of The New Paper on Sunday e-mailed us about the joint.<br><br>Most of the customers were believed to be white-collar workers.<br><br>But was it really as exclusive as it claimed? The operators were happy to recruit just about any surfer who frequented online sex websites.<br><br>Based on members' discussions on the website, the women appeared to be foreigners who worked illegally while here on social visit passes.<br><br>We learnt that the first group of people the pimps targeted were active members of a public Internet sex forum. It is known to men who frequently visit prostitutes.<br>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><strong>MEMBERS' 'REVIEWS'</strong><br><br>When they sign up they are allowed to read 'reviews' of the girls by other members. They could also detail their preference for certain costumes.<br><br>Such peer group interaction was another aspect of this underground activity.<br><br>Clients had sex with foreigners who might have sex-related diseases or who might have been tested HIV positive. No one knew and no one asked.<br><br>The added danger was that the unlicensed brothel did not conduct any health checks.<br><br>Each session cost $140.<br><br>With information obtained from the brothel's website, our undercover correspondent was able to find the place. It was a less than five-minute walk from Chinatown MRT station.<br><br>The brothel was on the top floor of a three-storey shophouse, which also houses restaurants, law firms and other offices.<br><br>Open from 11am to 11pm, it was accessible by a flight of stairs.<br><br>Although the brothel claimed to offer massage services, it did not seem to have proper massage rooms.<br><br>Instead, there were about four small cubicles, with mattresses or raised massage beds in them.<br><br>Each cubicle was named after one of the four seasons, and the respective Chinese character for spring, summer, autumn or winter was displayed outside.<br><br>Separated by partitions, the cubicles were dimly-lit.<br><br>During the two-hour late-afternoon police raid, two men were seen leaving the brothel after the police arrived.<br><br>The first to leave was a man in his late 20s.<br><br>Alone, the bespectacled man with short gelled hair wore a dark, long-sleeved shirt and business pants.<br><br>A few minutes later, an older man stepped out.<br><br>He appeared to be in his late 50s and was clad in a polo T-shirt and long pants.<br><br>Then the girls appeared.<br>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><strong>GIRLS ROUNDED UP</strong><br><br>A woman with long straight hair dressed in a white T-shirt and blue knee-length pants was led by a policewoman to an unmarked police van parked by the roadside.<br><br>Three others followed.<br><br>The first two were handcuffed to each other and the last two had their hands cuffed behind their backs.<br><br>One woman was in a white nurse's uniform while the other was dressed as an air stewardess.<br><br>A customer, waiting for his meal at the restaurant next door with his friends said to them: 'Did you see that? There's one still in air stewardess uniform.'<br><br>Police spokesman Lily Lee said: 'Acting on information, a team of CID officers raided the premises known as 'Dream Place' at about 5 pm (on 31 March).<br><br>'Four women, all China nationals on social visit passes and aged between 25 and 32, were arrested for suspected involvement in illicit vice activities.<br><br>'Police are investigating.'<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Sleaze comes to the heartlands<br>Saturday June 24, 10:17 AM</strong><br><br>Two weeks ago, senior supervisor Gary spotted a handwritten poster outside a beauty salon in his Housing Development Board estate.<br><br>It was offering a one-hour massage session for $30.<br><br>"I was feeling tired from work and thought I could do with a massage. It seemed a good deal," said Gary, 38. Instead, the father of four went inside and was offered sex by the mainland Chinese masseuse.<br><br>Of late, scores of such parlours have started sprouting up in heartland estates such as Ang Mo Kio, Bedok and Toa Payoh. It appears that many are clearly in violation of the law.<br><br>A massage establishment does not require a licence if it offers only curative treatment in full view of other customers. Otherwise, it needs a licence to operate and its masseuses have to go for mandatory health screenings.<br><br>The clincher: Such massage parlours are not allowed in areas including HDB estates, or near schools, hospitals and places of worship.<br><br>But a check with the Accounting &amp; Corporate Regulatory Authority showed that in the past 12 months alone, 509 establishments registered themselves to offer massage and foot reflexology services, many of which were in HDB residential areas.<br><br>They presented a harmless front and appeared to offer tui na, or traditional Chinese massage, for as little as $30. Others advertised themselves as places that provided eyebrow plucking, acupuncture and facial cleansing.<br><br>On the face of it, these services would not require a police licence, which would costs $480 a year.<br><br>But inside, not only were customers taken inside private cubicles, they were explicitly offered sexual services.<br><br>Mr Peter Sng, president of the Spa Association Singapore, was surprised to learn that more than 500 establishments had registered themselves over a single year to offer massage-related services.<br><br>"It's incredible that there are so many of them. The association is very concerned with the growing number of massage establishments springing up in the neighbourhoods," said Mr Sng. "We encourage the authorities set up more stringent checks as well as looking into ways to regularise these businesses."<br><br>There should be checks to stop HDB estates from turning into another Joo Chiat, with masseuses prowling void decks and coffeeshops, he added.<br><br>"(The massage parlours) may grow into a cluster. When a cluster is formed, competition is greater and may take on a more visible form as seen in Joo Chiat," he said.<br><br>A Today visit to Ang Mo Kio found nascent clusters already forming.<br><br>At Street 43, there were six massage parlours facing each other in an open-space car park, each with their entrances at the back of the four-storey shophouse block. Customers made their way up the stairs to the second floor, where business is carried out.<br><br>On Street 52, there were five joints within a 50m radius.<br><br>While many of these may be legitimate businesses, at least one parlour at each of the two locations was willing to offer sexual services.<br><br>Last year, six massage parlours had their licences revoked, all for offences committed under the Women's Charter, said police spokeswoman Assistant Superintendent Siow Cheng Cheng.<br><br>But many of these establishments may not even have licences, since licensed massage parlours do not operate in HDB residential areas.<br><br>Last Sunday, a masseuse was killed at one such establishment in Ang Mo Kio Avenue 10.<br><br>Apart from the possibility of violence and health threats Â— only staff from licensed parlours go for health screenings Â— a resident of Yishun Street 22 raised another concern.<br><br>Pointing to an establishment with frosted glass windows, a retiree said: "School children and young kids walk past here all the time. It's not good for them to see all this." - /sh</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The Electric New Paper :<br>Ever seen a karung guni woman dressed like this?<br>One Jurong resident has. He says: She offered me 'extra services'<br>THIS karung guni woman wears perfume, sexy clothes and offers extras - right at your doorstep.<br>29 June 2006 </strong><br><br>THIS karung guni woman wears perfume, sexy clothes and offers extras - right at your doorstep.<br><br>She has been going around HDB flats in Jurong, pretending to buy old items, but that is actually a cover for her to offer massage services.<br><br>HOT PANTS<br><br>She wears heavy make-up and is clad in a pair of hot pants and cleavage-revealing top.<br><br>She holds a horn in one hand to look like a karung guni woman.<br><br>But as soon as a man answers the door, she turns on her charm and offers the extra services, reported Lianhe Wanbao.<br><br>A resident in Jurong, Mr Huang, told the newspaper that about a month ago, a long-haired woman who seemed to be in her 30s came knocking on his door, asking if he had any old newspapers to sell.<br><br>'Not only was she dressed sexily, she was also wearing a lot of perfume. She didn't look like a karung guni person at all,' he told Lianhe Wanbao.<br><br>When he replied that he did not have any newspapers to sell, the woman started asking him questions about his family.<br><br>In no time, she popped the question - do you want me to give you a massage?<br><br>The administrative executive, 40, declined. But she did not back off.<br><br>She kept persuading him, saying that her services were very cheap.<br><br>'But I kept telling her I was not interested. I even told her I had only $20 to $30 on me and couldn't afford a massage,' said Mr Huang.<br><br>He added that from her accent, he could tell she was from China.<br><br>She did not give up and replied: 'Don't say that. I accept loose change too.'<br><br>She even tried to enter the flat.<br><br>At one time, she asked to use the toilet. Then, she asked for some water to drink.<br><br>And all the time, she would be fiddling with her hair seductively and touching his hand, which was on the gate.<br><br>'She kept emphasising that her skills were superb, and that I would definitely be very satisfied,' said Mr Huang.<br><br>'Half in jest, I asked her how satisfied I would be. She replied that whatever I wanted, I would get.'<br><br>He was put off by her tactics. Besides, he also feared for his safety.<br><br>'I don't know who's lying in ambush nearby. What if they barge in as soon as I open the door? It's always good to be cautious,' he reasoned.<br><br>The woman was not deterred by his indifference and continued persuading him.<br><br>In the end, Mr Huang came up with an excuse and said he had an old computer which he wanted to sell and asked if she was interested.<br><br>'I think after that, it finally sank in that I would not succumb to temptation and relent,' he said.<br><br>She told him she would contact him later and left.<br><br>The whole episode lasted about 20 minutes.<br><br>She did not return.<br><br>Mr Huang said it was not the first time that he had come across such 'door-to-door' services.<br><br>It had happened several times when he was at his friends' flats in Chinatown and Boon Keng.<br><br>'They claim to be collecting old newspapers. But they are always hinting at the extra services,' he said.<br><br>Some of them even bend or squat to show more flesh.<br><br>Mr Huang said his family members are worried that prostitution has crept into the residential area. He felt it would not be easy to detect and stamp out such door-to-door services.<br><br>Business must be in full public view<br><br>STRICTER rules for massage parlours kicked in on Monday.<br><br>Unlicensed massage parlours, which are usually run by China women, now have to conduct their businesses in full public view.<br><br>They can no longer have cubicles, curtains, partitions, or even tinted glass windows.<br><br>The employees must be Singaporeans, permanent residents or Malaysians here on work permits. They have to be decently dressed and cannot tout for business.<br><br>Operators must register their businesses with the police by 26 Aug.<br><br>The new rules were introduced because of concerns about the spread of vice in the heartlands.<br><br>And they have already affected the massage business.<br><br>The Straits Times visited a cluster of seven parlours along Ang Mo Kio Avenue 10 on Monday afternoon.<br><br>Of these, five were closed. One of the operators had even removed the signboard.<br><br>Study mamas who used to work in the parlours said they would have to return to China if they could not find other jobs that paid so well.<br><br><a href="http://newpaper.asia1.com.sg/printfriendly/0,4139,109208,00.html?" rel="nofollow">http://newpaper.asia1.com.sg/printfriendly/0,4139,109208,00.html?</a></div>
