The convette has 8 harpoon missiles la, not 2. The missile gun boat has 4 harpoon plus 2/4 gabriel. Don't know if they want to integrate barak on LST. Barak is a battle proven missile killer system and has no problem against exocet or harpoon, not to mention the "bugs", mig or su, unless they can out run a 40g pull vector trust missile.<br><br>Mistral is only a temp solution for the missile gunboat and coastal patrol craft till they are phase out.<br><br>The only problem I see is the "tou-tow" Victory class convette, must fire that joker who recommend that f**kup antenna mast, which cause the ship to roll heavily in bad sea, in other word stability problem. I would suggest the Navy to replace that jokers' tower with a shorter one.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>malaysia's frigates capabilities.........they have 3 frigate under the class of Mark 1 Yarrow-type frigate , which is generally armed with a single 4.5 inch main gun, three 40/70 Bofors guns , MK 10 anti-submarine mortars and the Seacat missile for airdefence and exocet missile for anti surface warfare. The frigates are also upgraded with fire-control system, sonars, anti-missile countermeasures and air surveillance and surface search/navigation radars.<br>Now their convette capacity........ they aqquired the FS 1500 Type corvettes in 1984 , which have a range of 8,000 km at 18 knots and a displacement of 1,800 tonnes. The ships are armed with Exocet surface-to-surface missiles, one 100mm single gun, one 57 mm Bofors gun and four 30 mm Emerlec twin guns and anti-submarine weapons.<br>All the firepower is managed by a computerised fire control system. The corvettes are also equipped with the latest countermeasures like electronic warfare systems, radar and sonars to defend themselves.<br>Their capabillities impressive sia.........<br><br>Look at our navies current capacity......we are currently equid with six missile convette......facing the northers 3 frigate which is bigger in size ,range,and capability. our MCV are armed with a max of 8 harpoon anti surface missile, and 16 barak anti missile and anti aircraft missile....which is capable of countering any 3 generations anti ship missile and rumoured to be able to cripple enermy vessels.......together with that it is armed with six whitehead torps and commanded with advance C3I electronic devices.

Harpoon heads straight for enemy ship en mass...<br>6. malaysian navy reacts by launch seawolf... but because seawolf cannot do multiple fire and multiple intercept... the 2 lekiu frigate can only intercept 2 ASM harpoon at any one time within the 10km range limit of the lekiu frigate...<br>7. each harpoon is given its respective target and approaching for the pop-up...while malaysian ships attempt to use their guns to shoot down the missile..<br>8... malaysian ships gets overwhelmed by en mass harpoon... sunk one after the other...<br>9 the E2C and MPA checks for any surviving RMN ships that survive the first wave...and then guide the followup 2nd wave harpoon to finish off the stragglers...<br>10. final checks for surviving RMN ships... any survival will be dealt with gabriel and torpedo... any RMN ships still afloat by this time are probably badly damaged if not sinking slowly...<br><br>we wont even allow the RMN to use its exocet...<br><br>but assuming that RMN did manage to use its exocet... we will pair up the corvette with the MGB... to deal with the incoming exocet using the BARAK... Barak is capable of multiple intercept and mltiple targeting... thus for RMN to overwhelm RSN with exocet rush will take them all the ships they have..<br><br>BUT prior to defending itself against the exocet.. i expect the RSN to launch all its harpoon and gabriel and let the MPA or E2C do the rest while the ships try to defend itself using the barak and watever ECM and chaff system it got...<br><br>any counter argument???</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hello<br><br>Was reading through the thread and decide to add my views of the issue.<br><br>AD systems<br><br>It has been announced that aster 15 will be installed on the new frigates. This is an acknowledgement by the RSN that an air umbrella is not always present in war and that convoys, expeditions and such will still have to be protected. Moreover situations will arise that demands the ships to operate out of range of the RSAF coverage. Currently the fleet air defence missiles system consists of the Mistral and Barak as stated. True enough that the mistral is rather ineffectual against modern aerial targets but you have to consider the role of the PV and APV. It is highly unlikely that they will be required to operate independently in a high air threat environment. Nonetheless, I am not too enamoured with the mistral capability either. With regards to the Barak, the RSN has confidence in the Barak system. The recent Barak firing in the south china sea (as reported in the ST) is a validation of the Barak capability. The engagement sequence is quite impressive. AD is not just about hard kill. It also involve the use of ECM and ECCM to provide the soft kill option. Given the funding that has been poured into EW by the local military industrial complex, we should not be too surprise to realise that we have execellent EW capabilities.<br>It is true that the large mast contribute to a stability issue but the MCV operations has not been encumbered by it. Rather the mast provides the space to mount all the EW equipment that are most useful. With the introduction of Aster 15 and the associated electronics on the frigates, fleet air defence capability is set for a major upgrade. Current the most important air search radar is probably that of the Endurance class. It would be a good idea if datalinks can be set up between the Endurance and the Victory vessels and the warfare officers on both platform familiarise themselves with the operations. After all in war, the MCV and the LST would be involve inevitably in an escort scenario. Should the Aster 15 come online in the future, the Aster 15 and Barak could possibly be interlinked to form a multi layer air defence umbrella much like the concept the RN tried in the Falkland with the Sea Dart and the Sea Wolf<br></div>

A common tactic that is often employed involves hugging to neutral shipping and hiding among sampans and other shipping. The consequences of hitting a neutral container ship or tanker is grave.

            <div class='col-md body'>it seems that singapore integrated and organise such a way that RSAF covers both the army &amp; navy role in singapore defense widely.For the navy,Fokker 50 high equipped will harpoon there were reports that the electronic device are comparable to the US orion for maybe even better.<br>E2C allows beyond visual range targeting for missiles such as harpoon.Army!we got the Apache which is maintain by RSAF,maverick which can target ships that y i said RSAF is an allrounder in this defense network.<br><br>RSN is warming up,since RMN is on the race track too.RMN is already on the run speeding i guess but singapore jogging on the track waiting RMN to get tried before RSAF a sudden split and take out them(Story of RABBIT AND TORTOISE)<br>RSN , ST ,DSTA is coordinating research to develop singapore version of Firefly UAV-heli to be placed on board the frigates maybe perhaps on board the other vessals<br>Lots of development are on track these days.<br>ANY COMMENTs!!!!!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hello tripwire<br><br>Apologies for not making my point clear. The point is that if a maritime contest is solely between the RSN and thw RMN, then it would be difficult to discern who would be the winner due to the reasons as given. However should the RSAF and the RMAF be included in the comparison, the current superiority of the RSAF should give the SAF the lead in a conflict. Hope this helps to clarify my point of view</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The SAF fights as an integrated whole as many would know. Hence the martime campagn is not just the sole purveiw of the RSN. To make a valid analysis, the strength of the RSAF must be considered. Similarly, an air campaign is not dependent on the strength of the RSAF soley. The army also plays a role such as by securing forward air bases, forward air defence installations and such. Whenever we analyse the possible outcome of a campaign, the totality should be considered rather than having a narrow focus. Hence I use the term SAF rather than RSN. The RSN may not have an advantage alone but the SAF certainly does  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>
