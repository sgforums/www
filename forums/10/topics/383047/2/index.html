              <p>I really don't think it was a bad idea getting people to pick up English as a primary language.  Truth is, there are 4 ethnicities to consider here.  There is a need to get people to communicate and trade using the same language otherwise you'd have four high segmented people groups.  The world was also using English as lingua franca, there was no avoiding it at all.</p>
              <p>There's been lots of studies on language and democracy, and its been accepted that a common language is very important to collective and cohesive political discourse. Otherwise, each people group will only consider and debate in context of their own race and interests.  The issue of a common language hasn't changed even til today.  The EU faces this very problem where there is some 11 languages dispersed among some 370 million people.  </p>
              <p>Speaking English isn't about becoming English.  Its about being able to communicate and trade with the rest of the world.  </p>

              <p>Lets put it this way...  We are all online and sharing views in English right?  It would have been hard to have to share views amongst many different languages if we all type in our own languages. ie, Chinese, Melayu, Hindi/Tamil, and whatever the 'others' languages are.  </p>
              <p>And if we all didn't read English, people would only be able to read blogs from rather organized parties that do translations.  But what about 'independents' like Gopalan Nair etc?  </p>
              <p>Being bilingual isn't a bad thing.  Probably analogous to having both a bike and car license.  The problem was how they tried to get people to learn Chinese.  The system sucked to the core and I can attest to it.  I absolutely hated learning Chinese when I was in primary n secondary school.  The system of learning was just lousy, and the teachers largely didn't care to feedback how bad it was maybe cos they were afraid their CEPs would drop.  </p>

              <p>Back to the topic. Mrs Tan wasn't talking about the system's giving or not giving a person an easy way out. She had a point.<br><br>The Chinese is a very diversed group of people. Besides, Singapore had been under British ruled for 150 years. While many Chinese claim to be third or foruth generation Singaporeans, there are Chinese people out here who had been here generations, maybe more than fourht generation. Chinese language and culture is remote to this group of people.</p>
              <p><em>"Still, she felt that the teaching style could have been less harsh, and the bilingual policy more flexible, to suit various types of students. ‘We definitely wouldn’t have migrated if the situation had been different,"<br><br></em>She nailed the problem on the head. Drilling, memory work, rote learning just to understand our ancient culture (not even modern culture here). AT WHAT PRICE?</p>
