              <p>Can the "zwei-siao-pseudo-Bavarian-Hog" be serious with its own knowledge of language - when its expertise in history is already found to be leaky ?</p>

              <p>Before "Malay" even existed as a language form as we know it today, the Chinese language in its written form had existed in the milleniums since the B.C. periods.</p>

              <p>China's scientific discoveries allowed her reach to be extended into the east and west coast of Africa, to reach the heart of Europe, and was reputed to have started the European Rennaissance.</p>
              <p>If the Chinese language had posed a problem for scientific knowledge to be shared - how did the Europeans adopt the scientific discoveries that was introduced by the Chinese - who was said to have shared the Compass and the World Map as drawn by Admiral Cheng-Ho voyages around the globe - with this being documented by <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.gavinmenzies.net/media.asp">‘Admiral Gavin Menzies’ (*2) </a>?</p>

              <p>For centuries, the Chinese Medical Fraternity practised their Eastern Tradtitional Medicines without the need to write any reviews and analysis to seek any approval from Western Medical Colleges, as the Chinese Medical Fraternity was THE Authority of Chinese Medicine themselves - why will the "zwei-siao-pseudo-Bavarian-HOG" think that the Chinese Medical Fraternity has to do so now ?</p>
              <p>Did the Chinese begin to write their Traditional Art of Healing to seek approval from the Western Medical Fraternity ?</p>
              <p>Or was the translation into English an effort to make the Chinese Traditional Art of Healing more accessible to the Western Medical Practitioners, and have them learn the mystique  powers of accupunture that can allow major surgery to be conducted with anesthesia, and to bring life back to immobilised body of stroke victims ?</p>
              <p>Can the Western Medical Practitioners be the peers of Chinese Traditional Medical Practitioners - when the Western Medicine knows zilch about the Chinese Traditions in medical practices ?</p>

              <p>How did the "zwei-siao-pseudo-Bavarian-HOG" know that Einstein wrote his thesis in English, or was it another wild "zwei-siao" assumption from a "piggy's brain" ?</p>
              <p>Albert Einstein maybe a Jew and born in Germany - was he a German Jew ?</p>
              <p>Or did he not renounced his citizenship and moved to join his parents in Italy, and subsequently grew up in Switzerland where he joined a famous polytechnic in Berne - and to become famous for all the theories that he was reputed to have made with his mathematical genius ?</p>
              <p>Was English the preferred language of education in Switzerland during the 19th Century, or was it not German and French - depending on which part of Switzerland that had the larger Swiss French, Swiss German, and Swiss Italian communities ?</p>

              <p>As a "Turd" from a "Turd" World Country of "Turdistan" - it will see every foreigner as <a rel="nofollow" href="http://dictionary.reverso.net/spanish-english/aturdir">‘ATurdie’ (*1) </a>- as the resident "Turd" has been repeatedly trashed, stunned, and dazed for all the revelations exposed to its wanton "zwei-siao" ways as a "pseudo-Bavarian-zwei-siao-Hog".</p>

I doubt I'd understand proper Teochew if it was spoken to me.<br><br>My knowledge of Japanese - my 'mother tongue' via my mother - is dismal too. In fact, it's non-existent beyond common greetings, which I still often mix up.<br><br>My mother never spoke Japanese to my siblings and me although she and my father communicated in it when they wanted to keep things private. He could speak conversational Japanese.<br><br>Instead, my mother learnt Teochew and some English which was what we spoke at home.<br><br>Whenever I visit Japan now, I feel as if I'm mute. People will talk to me in Japanese and I'll have to gesticulate that, sorry, I may look like you and in fact I'm halfJapanese, but I don't speak the language.<br><br>At home my mother has her TV tuned to the Japanese cable channel NHK the whole day. I can sit in front of the TV and watch a programme with her yet not understand a word that's being said.<br><br>I suppose I would have been proficient in Mandarin and Japanese had they been spoken at home. But they weren't, and the reason I've not been able to pick them up later in life is simply this: lack of interest.<br><br>I have no interest in the Japanese language. Of course, I wouldn't mind being able to speak it. How nice it would be if I woke up one morning and found myself able to chatter away in it. But take lessons in it? No thanks. It'll be too difficult and I've no inclination to put myself through such a strenuous exercise.<br><br>Even the thought of being able to understand my heritage better if I spoke the language is not big enough an incentive for me to want to study it.<br><br>Chinese was a different ball game. Growing up, I needed to understand Chinese for a very practical reason: so that I could get into university.<br><br>The incentive was there, certainly. Unfortunately, the interest wasn't.<br><br>I belong to that group of English-educated Singaporeans whose lives were seared by Mandarin.<br><br>Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew recently acknowledged that Chinese lessons in the old days were pitched at too difficult a level because he believed that it was possible to master two languages equally well.<br><br>The result was that 'successive generations of students paid a heavy price because of my ignorance'. He urged Chinese language teachers to make learning the mother tongue fun for children.<br><br>My reaction upon reading his speech was: 'Oh, MM, why couldn't you have said all this 40 years ago?'<br><br>A more relaxed approach to Chinese as a second language might have saved at least three generations of English-educated Singaporeans with no flair for languages a lot of heartache.<br><br>We might have become better speakers of English (instead of the Singlish that has become the lingua franca) had we poured that energy into perfecting English, which we were already comfortable with.<br><br>We might have had more time to spend on other subjects such as mathematics or history or economics.<br><br>We might, ironically, have been even better speakers of Mandarin. If we hadn't been forced to pass the subject and to attend all those horrible tuition classes, we might not have been so resistant to the subject and might have even liked it.<br><br>A more relaxed policy might have also saved countless families from having to take up mortgages so they could afford to send their children abroad to university. It might have even prevented some families from emigrating.<br><br>Mandarin was the bane of my childhood. My parents couldn't speak it, my grandparents didn't speak it and clearly I was a dunce at it.<br><br>But I had to pass it, and like thousands of others, I struggled to do so.<br><br>I memorised whole essays (xia yu tian, or a rainy day, was one of them) in the hope I could regurgitate it in the exam. I'd throw in a few evergreen phrases (ren shan ren hai, literally mountains and seas of people) to hopefully impress the person marking the paper.<br><br>My textbooks were pockmarked with English words to aid in pronunciation. I went through at least five tutors in 12 years. It was a subject that filled me with hate and dread yet I had to spend the most time on it.<br><br>I got a B3 for my O levels and I think a D7 for my AO levels. It was enough to get into university. Thereafter I promptly forgot everything related to Mandarin.<br><br>The irony was that when I was in my 20s, I lost my antipathy for the language. I became interested in Mandarin music and Chinese pop culture and got myself a tutor.<br><br>Instead of textbooks, we studied the song sheets of singers I liked and articles in Lianhe Zaobao which were related to my work. I enjoyed those lessons.<br><br>I gave them up after a few months because of lack of time. I soon forgot all that I had re-learnt through lack of practice.<br><br>Today, I have positive feelings about Mandarin and wish I could speak it well, but there is no great incentive to learn it.<br><br>To be fair to the Singapore system, it would have been hard to have made the teaching of Chinese 'fun' back in the days I was in school.<br><br>China was a closed, communist country associated with farmers, Mao suits and poverty-stricken relatives who were always writing letters appealing for help.<br><br>Taiwan was associated with big-haired songstresses who had no appeal to young people. Mandarin pop culture wasn't as big a draw as Hong Kong Cantonese pop.<br><br>It's a different world today and there are so many ways a Chinese language teacher can make the teaching of the language interesting. He can use Mandarin movies, music, comics and blogs.<br><br>What's past is past and there's no point regretting the harsh Mandarin policy of the old days.<br><br>There are hardcore Chinese advocates who think MM's move to make the teaching of Chinese more fun might lead to a dilution of the language and a drop in standards.<br><br>To them I say, good for you if you are so blessed with the ability to speak and write another language, and there are plenty of opportunities for your children to learn higher Chinese.<br><br>But spare a thought for linguistic dunces like me. The Chinese policy in schools hasn't changed and you still need a pass grade to enter university. If there are ways to help us get the hang of the language better, why begrudge us that?<br><br>Source: <a href="http://www.asiaone.com/News/Education/Story/A1Story20091130-183188.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #417e15;">http://www.asiaone.com/News/Educatio...30-183188.html</span></span></a></div>

              <p>For centuries, the Chinese Medical Fraternity practised their Eastern Tradtitional Medicines without the need to write any reviews and analysis to seek any approval from Western Medical Colleges, as the Chinese Medical Fraternity was THE Authority of Chinese Medicine themselves - why will the "zwei-siao-pseudo-Bavarian-HOG" think that the Chinese Medical Fraternity has to do so now ?</p>
              <p>Did the Chinese begin to write their Traditional Art of Healing to seek approval from the Western Medical Fraternity ?</p>
              <p>Or was the translation into English an effort to make the Chinese Traditional Art of Healing more accessible to the Western Medical Practitioners, and have them learn the mystique  powers of accupunture that can allow major surgery to be conducted with anesthesia, and to bring life back to immobilised body of stroke victims ?</p>
              <p>Can the Western Medical Practitioners be the peers of Chinese Traditional Medical Practitioners - when the Western Medicine knows zilch about the Chinese Traditions in medical practices ?</p>
              <p>Only the inferior mind of a "Turd" World Citizen from "Turdistan" will behave as it does to become a pseudo-Bavarian HOG, when it is already a "zwei-siao-HOG".</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The pseudo-Bavarian HOG will fail to even realise that the English Language has been evolving to absorb the various words from the languages spoken by the Dutch, the French, Germans, Swedes, and even the Spanish.</p>
              <p>Is there anything remarkable to even speak the Germanic word even when as the pseudo-Bavarian HOG was led by its nose to "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">kindergarten</span></em>" ?</p>
              <p>The pseudo-Bavarian HOG must have been snag when it was "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">abseiling</span></em>" clumsily in the SAF - to be stuck with the label as a "zwei-siao-HOG" for all the "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">angst</span></em>" felt ?</p>
              <p>Did it substitute the use of its precious pork fat and begin to use "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">diesel</span></em>" to give itself the boost to achieve all that is needed for its "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">glitzy</span></em>" performance ?</p>
              <p>Perhaps it is better when it turn itself into a "<span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>hamburger</em></span>" and wash it down with a pint of "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">lager</span></em>", or it could pack everything into a "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">rucksack</span></em>" to feed its "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">rottweiler</span></em>" who will otherwise make the pseudo-Bavarian HOG into a "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">schmuck</span></em>"</p>
              <p>Was the "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">quartz</span></em>" used in daily time keeping a word from the spoken language of the Swiss, or English or German ?</p>
              <p>Is the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.english-trainer.de/pdf/english_language_trainer_loanwords.pdf">‘English Language so poor that a large portion of the language are loan from the German Language’ (*1) </a>- or is it not due to the fact that the peoples of Europe and on the English Isle were in contact throughout the historical periods, which led to the flow of peoples and languages ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Any attempts to translate the stupidity of a determined "zwei-siao-HOG" - will be to confirm its stupendous "zwei-siao" idiocy in its pseudo-Bavarian form.</p>
              <p>Can a "technical phrase of a scientific phase" written in Chinese be understood by a "Turd" from a "Turd" World Country of "Turdistan" - who will attempt to learn enough about the Chinese Language so as to degrade it to a level for a "Turd" to be able to grasp and understand ?</p>
              <p>How did the "zwei-siao-pseudo-Bavarian-HOG" know that Einstein wrote his thesis in English, or was it another wild "zwei-siao" assumption from a "piggy's brain" ?</p>
              <p>Albert Einstein maybe a Jew and born in Germany - was he a German Jew ?</p>
              <p>Or did he not renounced his citizenship and moved to join his parents in Italy, and subsequently grew up in Switzerland where he joined a famous polytechnic in Berne - and to become famous for all the theories that he was reputed to have made with his mathematical genius ?</p>
              <p>Was English the preferred language of education in Switzerland during the 19th Century, or was it not German and French - depending on which part of Switzerland that had the larger Swiss French, Swiss German, and Swiss Italian communities ?</p>
              <p>It is quite obvious that the pseudo-Bavarian Hog had suck too hard on "little Dickie" so as to prevent itself from revealing its "oink" while in the Speaker's Corner, or else it will have to re-write all that it needs to express in its "Turd" language from its country of origin in "Turdistan" - which is a "Turd" world country.</p>
              <p>As a "Turd" from a "Turd" World Country of "Turdistan" - it will see every foreigner as <a rel="nofollow" href="http://dictionary.reverso.net/spanish-english/aturdir">‘ATurdie’ (*1) </a>- as the resident "Turd" has been repeatedly trashed, stunned, and dazed for all the revelations exposed to its wanton "zwei-siao" ways as a "pseudo-Bavarian-zwei-siao-Hog".</p>

              <p>Wednesday, 02 December 2009</p>
              <p><em>Chee Soon Juan</em><br> <br> <img src="http://www.yoursdp.org/images/stories/postersI/emperor.jpg" border="1" alt="" width="220" height="248" align="left">For
              40 years, Singaporeans were forced to practice something that was
              contrary to human nature and nobody said anything about it. I am, of
              course, referring to Mr Lee Kuan Yew's recent confession that his
              bilingual policy was wrong. <br> <br> To be sure the surprise is not
              that Mr Lee was wrong, for the Minister Mentor has been spectacularly
              wrong on many occasions – the most embarrassing being his prediction
              that Singapore was entering a "golden period" just months before the
              economy crashed (see <a href="http://www.yoursdp.org/index.php/perspective/special-feature/1881-holding-lee-kuan-yew-accountable-part-1">here</a>).<br> <br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>What is surprising is that it has taken all this time for the
              Government to realise this error when there was clear evidence, both
              scientifically and politically, to demonstrate the inanity of Mr Lee's
              policy.<br><br> I had written in a book that I co-authored with my
              wife, Dr Huang Chihmei, that the English language is processed very
              differently by the brain compared to Chinese.<br><br> I pointed out
              that while English is based on the alphabet and read phonetically, the
              Chinese language consists of characters which are recognised
              pictorially. These languages are learnt through different neural
              systems, involving different regions of the brain.<br><br> (The book, entitled <em>Effective Parenting for the Asian Family</em>,
              was published in 1995 but its publisher Heinemann Asia inexplicably cut
              short its shelf-life and got rid of the remaining copies.)<br><br> I
              had also pointed out in letters to the Ministry of Education that was
              published in the Straits Times Forum in 1993 as well as in my book <em>Dare To Change</em> that such brain functions are still developing in students. <br><br> Streaming children according to their language ability when these
              neural systems have yet to mature is thus not a smart thing to do.</strong></span> <br> <br> Nearly 20 years later, Mr Lee Kuan Yew cites his daughter's
              neurological knowledge and finally admits that things have gone wrong.<br> <br> Two major concerns arise: First, how many lives have been negatively
              and unalterably affected by this policy? Many parents left Singapore
              because they feared that their children could not cope in school under
              this bilingual policy.<br> <br> How many people had their educational
              advancement curtailed because they were not able to master both
              languages? In economic terms, how much talent have we missed out or
              lost through the brain drain?<br> <br> Second why, through all these
              years, didn't any of the ministers point out to Mr Lee that he was
              wrong? For decades all the ministers seemed to be in perfect agreement.
              <br> <br> Were there no ministers, ministers of state, permanent
              secretaries, etc at the Ministry of Education who detected the faulty
              policy? <br> <br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>This is the tragedy of Singapore. Mr Lee's personal
              experiences and ramblings often become diktat, and pass for
              policy-making processes. And when policy is made, no one dares to
              question it. <br><br> Are ministers paid so highly and intimidated so
              thoroughly that no one thinks of saying anything to Mr Lee when
              policies don't work? Is groupthink so prevalent within the cabinet?<br><br> Tragic as it is, the bilingual policy is not the most egregious as far
              as PAP policies are concerned. Of much greater consequence is Mr Lee's
              Stop-At-Two Policy and the Graduate Mothers Scheme. These were borne
              out of a mixture of the MM's hopelessly poor grasp of what constituted
              hereditary intelligence and his bigotry. <br><br> Women, especially
              those at the lower end of the economic and educational scales, were
              enticed and/or theatened into having their reproductive organs violated
              in order to stop them from procreating during the years when the
              Government was hellbent on keeping families small.<br><br> This helped to retard the national birthrate to the present extent that we, as a people, cannot replace ourselves.   <br><br> Now Mr Lee insists that we need to import foreigners enmasse to make up
              for the shortfall, never mind the social and economic consequences.
              Again no debate, no discussion. </strong></span> <br> <br> Again, all the ministers
              seem to be perfectly in sync with their Mentor. Either that or
              everyone's just waiting for Mr Lee's next confession.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Lee Kuan Yew commited so many mistakes and errors in policy but no one in PAP dared to criticise Lee Kuan Yew.</p>

              <p><strong>By Kor Kian Beng from Straits Times, 27 November 2009</strong></p>
              <p>IN SEPTEMBER 1989, a Singaporean mother, Mrs Pauline Tan, wrote an impassioned letter to The Straits Times, criticising the way the Chinese language was taught in schools here and the impact it had on her nine-year-old son.</p>
              <p>She said her son, then studying in Primary 3 at a Methodist school, was having suicidal thoughts because he hated having to study Chinese every day.</p>
              <p>Wrote Mrs Tan: ‘He was constantly ridiculed and scolded by his Chinese teacher. He felt ashamed and shunned his classmates. He found Chinese boring. It is spelling, dictation, writing, tests and more spelling, dictation, writing and tests.’</p>
              <p>As a result, she and her husband made plans to migrate to Australia. It was to spare her son further misery with the Chinese language, wrote Mrs Tan. The couple also have a younger son, who was aged five then.</p>
              <p>Her letter sparked widespread criticisms, with many readers – especially those from the Chinese-educated community – lambasting her controversial move.</p>
              <p>Many wrote in to express their anger over the Tans’ ‘absurd’ decision, and pointed out that Chinese-educated Singaporeans also had to overcome difficulties with the English language to compete with the English-educated for jobs.</p>
              <p>One reader said: ‘At times, I find some English-educated Chinese Singaporeans too pampered.’</p>
              <p>Some readers showed sympathy, saying the school and parents should have detected the problem earlier and done something to help the boy before he got into serious difficulties with the language.</p>
              <p>For the next 20 years, there was no news about Mrs Tan and her family – until this week when she penned another letter to The Straits Times, which was published on Tuesday.</p>
              <p>It was in response to Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew’s comments last week that the Government had made mistakes with the bilingual policy.</p>
              <p>She wrote: ‘I am comforted that finally someone at this high level of government has come round to see my point of view, which I have voiced for a long time.’</p>
              <p>She was also pleased with Mr Lee’s comments that the policy would be adjusted to suit students of different abilities.</p>
              <p>Speaking to Insight on the phone from Brisbane, Mrs Tan, 60, said the family had obtained Australian permanent residency in 1990 but uprooted for Down Under only two years later.</p>
              <p>That was because the couple wanted their elder son to complete his Primary School Leaving Examination here, and time to wind up the family business. She declined to specify the industry.</p>
              <p>She had also harboured hopes that there might be changes to the education system after the publication of her letter – and after she contacted the Ministry of Education for help. But her elder son told her that the situation had barely improved in his school.</p>
              <p>Mrs Tan acknowledged that the home environment was a key factor in determining a child’s interest towards the learning of any language. The couple were English-educated and spoke mostly English to the boys at home.</p>
              <p>Still, she felt that the teaching style could have been less harsh, and the bilingual policy more flexible, to suit various types of students. ‘We definitely wouldn’t have migrated if the situation had been different,’ she said.</p>
              <p>On the adverse reaction to her 1989 letter, Mrs Tan said that she was unperturbed by it.</p>
              <p>She said: ‘I was just a voice saying the policy was wrong and that we should make changes. I wasn’t trying to make people follow my example.’</p>
              <p>After all, it was not easy in the new land, as the couple encountered challenges like loneliness, she said.</p>
              <p>The couple ran an export business, and later a property consultancy, until they retired two years ago.</p>
              <p>But Mrs Tan said she felt she had made the right decision when she saw her sons enjoying and doing well in school again.</p>
              <p>She declined to name her sons nor let Insight speak to them. The reason is that they are not aware that she had written to the press. She said only her husband knew about the Forum letters.</p>
              <p>Both sons, aged 29 and 25, graduated from Queensland University of Technology and are doing well in life, said Mrs Tan.</p>
              <p>Her elder son is now working as an IT specialist in Brisbane and the younger one is doing his doctorate studies in mathematics at Oxford University.</p>
              <p>She said her elder son still feels bitter over his school experience.</p>
              <p>‘When we returned to Singapore for visits, I would ask him at times if he wanted to visit his primary school. He did not want to go back there at all.’</p>
              <p>Does the family plan to move back some day? Mrs Tan would only say that her sons now feel more Australian than Singaporean, though she still feels ‘deeply Singaporean’.</p>
              <p>‘It’s such a pity that Singapore has lost some talented people as a result of some of its policies,’ she said. – ST</p>
