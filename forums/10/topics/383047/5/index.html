              <p><br>To a typical Sg Uncle I see in geyland and my joo chiat place, Vietnam and China Gals are more prettier than their money.</p>
              <p>Money is pretty at a certain time, i did make a survey on how people look at money at different stages of life.</p>
              <p>I conclude that from 1 to 8 yo, money is just a toy</p>
              <p>then from 9 to 15yo, money is make know as important for exchange of foods, toys, parties and fashions</p>
              <p>then from 16 yo to 21yo, which is my age group, Money is very important, good for disco, fashion, eating, shopping, and for guys, good to have money so as to get a sexy beauti gf.</p>
              <p>then from 22 yo to 50yo, money is damn important, the most important stages, can drink, get gf, go for sex, get foreign gals,  tour, buy luxury goods, show off, spa, massage, cars, house, club, cards etc etc...whatever you can name off.</p>
              <p>then from 51 to 62yo, peoples start to realize their age and begin to save, no more energy left for fun, and even luxury goods is seen as nothing, they care for their health and some care for their looks, they start to spend on health products and checkup, comestic surgery, TCM, etc etc.</p>
              <p>then from 63 to death, for women, most will save their money for childrens, health, old follks gathering and also shopping. As for men, there are two types, one goes back to childrens kind of thinking and spend lavishly on Foreign gals, the mind become as naive as a 8 yo kid who just handle money, cos for them, life is not long anymore, can or cannot also chiong. Another type of men are those die die also must win, full of frustration and anger like my Uncle Atobe style, see anyone also scold, and most these people are thrifty like hell, one cent also count. These peoples most likely will bring their money to the coffin, which unfortunately, they cannot take along, end up their decendents being the most happiest.</p>

              <p>LKY is an anti-communist ?</p>
              <p>This must be a joke ?</p>
              <p>The "anti-communist" in LKY is no more then a sham - as it is a mere excuse that he depend on to label anyone as a Communist, and without any evidence will provide him the opportunity to incarcerate anyone without trial and at his discretion.</p>
              <p>The "anti-communist" image is only a convenient front to hide the Stalinist in LKY, as his methods are no different from Stalin - who was the most successful Communist ever to be in power after the short-lived Lenin.</p>
              <p>The methods used by LKY in dealing with his political opponents are no different from that used by Stalin, and LKY's government and organisation models are little different from the various Communist State Controlled models - where the State rule supreme.</p>
              <p>Ironically, the only Communist that exist in Singapore is the Stalinist Autocrat himself.</p>

              <p><br>why give thanks to my Uncle??? you are quite right, LKY goes to power at the expense of communism, because the objective of both communism and the British Educated ones is to get independency. Given no choice, as communist are good in pulling the masses, LKY joined forced with them, and those communists took him in as a brother, but once LKY took power, he removed them one by one. Therefore, it is not wrong to say that all the while during that time, LKY was an anti-communist hiding in white uniform, a spy, a mole and master of all minds</p>

              <p>How unprofessional of the Chinese teacher in question to ridicule weaker students! He/She should instead devise ways to help them improve and enjoy the lang.</p>

              <p>The parent should act try to speak to the Chinese teacher or even the Principle on this issue, instead of just migrating to avoid the lang.</p>

              <p><span style="font-size: small;"><span><strong> </strong>Mrs Pauline Tan is right to say that home evironment is crucial in teaching a language. Actually, not just about learning a language. We often find lawyers, doctors or even professional soldiers whoes fathers are of the same professions. Did Mrs Tan speak mostly english at home or only english? when they go out dining, did they speak chinese to order their char kway teow? or only english to order big mac? </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: small;">Mrs Tan is also right to say that the Chinese school teachers ought to be responsible for torturing her son, when the student fails to learn, the teacher fails to teach.  It would be interesting to find out if what happened to the rest of the class if they were bent out of shape and scars all over.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: small;">Mrs Tan was definitely right to migrate out of singapore, and choose a good life for her sons. But do her sons now find better chinese school teachers and are able to speak and write chinese? My son is now finding mathematics damned sian, don't know where I should migrate to?</span></span></p>
              <p>There is definitely much to be done to our education system, training for our teachings, and much much more to be done to the decisions makers in MOE, but parents should not think their role is only to provide for their childrens material needs, enrole them in the best schools, and expect the school to teach them the knowledge, mould their fighting spirit, then their children would likely be traumatized, in school or in society, and the parents will also have to do the complaining...hehehehe...can stay downunder, but still typical singaporean.</p>

              <p>Obviously, the Taiwanese "hum" is too self-indulgent with its consumate role as an "Attention Seeking Whore" to be too involved with the details of Singapore Political History, and will simply absorb any political scraps fed to its immigrant mind by the manipulators of history to protect the Singapore Stalinist Autocrat that stayed in power for the last 52 years.</p>
              <p>The Taiwanese "hum" should stay in its Bar and talk politics with the Asian Women who participate in the flesh trade of the resident "Attention Seeking Whore".</p>

              <p><strong>By Kor Kian Beng from Straits Times, 27 November 2009</strong></p>
              <p>IN SEPTEMBER 1989, a Singaporean mother, Mrs Pauline Tan, wrote an impassioned letter to The Straits Times, criticising the way the Chinese language was taught in schools here and the impact it had on her nine-year-old son.</p>
              <p>She said her son, then studying in Primary 3 at a Methodist school, was having suicidal thoughts because he hated having to study Chinese every day.</p>
              <p>Wrote Mrs Tan: ‘He was constantly ridiculed and scolded by his Chinese teacher. He felt ashamed and shunned his classmates. He found Chinese boring. It is spelling, dictation, writing, tests and more spelling, dictation, writing and tests.’</p>
              <p>As a result, she and her husband made plans to migrate to Australia. It was to spare her son further misery with the Chinese language, wrote Mrs Tan. The couple also have a younger son, who was aged five then.</p>
              <p>Her letter sparked widespread criticisms, with many readers – especially those from the Chinese-educated community – lambasting her controversial move.</p>
              <p>Many wrote in to express their anger over the Tans’ ‘absurd’ decision, and pointed out that Chinese-educated Singaporeans also had to overcome difficulties with the English language to compete with the English-educated for jobs.</p>
              <p>One reader said: ‘At times, I find some English-educated Chinese Singaporeans too pampered.’</p>
              <p>Some readers showed sympathy, saying the school and parents should have detected the problem earlier and done something to help the boy before he got into serious difficulties with the language.</p>
              <p>For the next 20 years, there was no news about Mrs Tan and her family – until this week when she penned another letter to The Straits Times, which was published on Tuesday.</p>
              <p>It was in response to Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew’s comments last week that the Government had made mistakes with the bilingual policy.</p>
              <p>She wrote: ‘I am comforted that finally someone at this high level of government has come round to see my point of view, which I have voiced for a long time.’</p>
              <p>She was also pleased with Mr Lee’s comments that the policy would be adjusted to suit students of different abilities.</p>
              <p>Speaking to Insight on the phone from Brisbane, Mrs Tan, 60, said the family had obtained Australian permanent residency in 1990 but uprooted for Down Under only two years later.</p>
              <p>That was because the couple wanted their elder son to complete his Primary School Leaving Examination here, and time to wind up the family business. She declined to specify the industry.</p>
              <p>She had also harboured hopes that there might be changes to the education system after the publication of her letter – and after she contacted the Ministry of Education for help. But her elder son told her that the situation had barely improved in his school.</p>
              <p>Mrs Tan acknowledged that the home environment was a key factor in determining a child’s interest towards the learning of any language. The couple were English-educated and spoke mostly English to the boys at home.</p>
              <p>Still, she felt that the teaching style could have been less harsh, and the bilingual policy more flexible, to suit various types of students. ‘We definitely wouldn’t have migrated if the situation had been different,’ she said.</p>
              <p>On the adverse reaction to her 1989 letter, Mrs Tan said that she was unperturbed by it.</p>
              <p>She said: ‘I was just a voice saying the policy was wrong and that we should make changes. I wasn’t trying to make people follow my example.’</p>
              <p>After all, it was not easy in the new land, as the couple encountered challenges like loneliness, she said.</p>
              <p>The couple ran an export business, and later a property consultancy, until they retired two years ago.</p>
              <p>But Mrs Tan said she felt she had made the right decision when she saw her sons enjoying and doing well in school again.</p>
              <p>She declined to name her sons nor let Insight speak to them. The reason is that they are not aware that she had written to the press. She said only her husband knew about the Forum letters.</p>
              <p>Both sons, aged 29 and 25, graduated from Queensland University of Technology and are doing well in life, said Mrs Tan.</p>
              <p>Her elder son is now working as an IT specialist in Brisbane and the younger one is doing his doctorate studies in mathematics at Oxford University.</p>
              <p>She said her elder son still feels bitter over his school experience.</p>
              <p>‘When we returned to Singapore for visits, I would ask him at times if he wanted to visit his primary school. He did not want to go back there at all.’</p>
              <p>Does the family plan to move back some day? Mrs Tan would only say that her sons now feel more Australian than Singaporean, though she still feels ‘deeply Singaporean’.</p>
              <p>‘It’s such a pity that Singapore has lost some talented people as a result of some of its policies,’ she said. – ST</p>

              <h2>On Learning Chinese</h2>
              <p><span style="color: #777777; font-size: xx-small;">By todayinsingapore</span></p>
              <div class="entry">
              <div class="snap_preview">
              <p>Since the communist proclamation of the People’s Republic in 1949, modern China has wrestled with the problems of mass illiteracy, hampered by a language that has more than 400 dialects in continental China alone.</p>
              <p>A dictionary published in 1959 contained 49,965 characters, while in 1986 a Chinese dictionary listed a staggering 56,000 characters. How can anybody in China learn to recognise 56,000 characters? The simple answer is nobody can. According to Prof. Lu Bisong, President of Beijing New Asia University, one can read non-technical Chinese publications, such as the daily newspaper, if he has a command of about 3,000 characters or around 8,000 words, a word being a construct of several characters. A graduate with a primary degree may know about 8,000 characters, but will be unable to read ancient manuscripts. That kind of specialist knowledge is left to scholars of ancient history and language, who devote a lifetime to the pursuit.</p>
              <p>To achieve its goal of mass literacy the communist government during the 1950s set up a commission of linguists to simplify written Chinese. Hong Kong and Taiwan kept to the old script, which was taught to the baby boomers of Singapore.</p>
              <p>In 1958 the revolutionary government introduced Pinyin, the new Chinese Phonetic Alphabet, to replace the old Wade-Giles system of Roman alphabet transliteration designed to help foreigners to learn Chinese. Pinyin removed the inaccuracies of sound reproduction by Westerners, often considered pidgin by native speakers. With the arrival of the new system in 1958 Soochow became Suzhou and Peking became Beijing. Singaporean names with the Hokkien “Hock” and the Cantonese “Fook” became a generic “Fu”, foreshadowing initiatives that will mandate the demise of dialects, and render grandparents unable to communicate with their grandchildren.</p>
              <p>The teaching of Mandarin in the Ministry of Education (MOE) was also a work in progress. The first born of a friend had to deal with textbooks containing only simplified Chinese characters, rendering the parent practically illiterate since he was of the traditional school. One year later, second daughter had books with Pinyin printed below the Chinese script. Dad felt a bit less impotent. The third child, also one year part, read in Pinyin first, below sighting the first Chinese character. Suffer the little children, while the “experts” dabbled in waters way above their heads.</p>
              <p>From all appearances MOE still hasn’t figured out how to teach the language. Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew blamed it on the MOE officials, “They were basically two groups of people, one English-speaking, the other Chinese-teaching.” He claims that it was wrong to insist on <em>ting xie</em> (dictation) and <em>mo xie</em> (writing down compete passages committed to memory). Never mind what time-honoured educators have to say of its value: “[Dictation] ensures attentive listening; it trains pupils to distinguish sounds; it helps fix concepts of punctuation; it enables pupils to learn to transfer oral sounds to written symbols; it helps to develop aural comprehension; and it assists in self-evaluation.” Lee now wants to emphasize listening and speaking, and dismiss writing. Webster defines literacy as “the ability to read and write”. The writing is on the wall, the future of Singapore will be 50% literacy.</p>

              <p>One should not look at learning the language of one's race as an opening of pathway to a career. Proficiency in English has already provided for that.</p>
              <p>It's about the relationship with one' s identity and culture.</p>
              <p>There's safety in a shared language. It can overcome an identity crisis. Therefore, I learn Mandarin. It's definitely woth the investment.</p>
