              <p><br>firstly, one doesn't write mandarin, but whether i can speak or write chinese is irrelevant to my point to you. that said, let me assure you that i have been to china's every major tier 1/2 cities on business more times than your night-outs crabbing at sembawang park. that i am quite sure. in fact, my (added) proficiency in cantonese and hokkien has helped in my business communications with my business partners where appropriate.</p>
              <p>your original statement in this thread fails logic 101. the conclusion doesn't support the premise you put out.</p>
              <p>i can dissect it out for you to, but decided against it. i reckon you are smart enough to know it already or you are too dumb to understand it anyway. this is especially true given the tonality of your replies. i doubt you will see thru' it anyway even if i `prove it' as you demanded.</p>
              <p>if you noticed or care to re-read my first reply to you, it wasn't meant to be confrontative. i am just making a statement as i have explained in para 2 here.</p>
              <p>it's a shame how you view comments or opinions directed to you as shits here, especially those not to your `liking'. i supposed you are already sitting on a big pile of it, doubly bad when you can only `fart' back in reply.</p>

              <p>If at all, can a group of babarians leave behind their genetic

              <p>This would have resulted in mass rape - occurring day and

              seriously destabilised a conquered China ruled by three
              generations of Great Khans.</p>
              <p>Even with the possibility of latter days inter-provincial
              marriages, it is unlikely that the "barbarian" genes would have
              spread farther south, when it was a rare occurrence
              for marriages to occur between the different dialect
              groups during that period.</p>

              <p>There aren't any pure Chinese in any genetic or cultural sense.
              We're all bastardized mixtures of Northern Barbarians that invade

              <p>This the kind of destructive mentality of the ancient ethnic groupings that weakened the Chinese with its petty infighting that allowed external forces to sweep into the old China and make it look like the "sick man of Asia".</p>
              <p>If the "hot gassed" vulgar aggression is intended to impress anyone, it failed in its theatrics - that is no better then a school kid attempting to win the strongest penis contest, by exagerating its penile strength through sticking a thin wire down the tube -just to win a glass marble.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Uncle, If you want criticise peoples, dun have to use so much silly remarks, isn't it a waste of our talent, if you had any left.</span></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>So is the bottom of your arse pink or red ?</p>
              <p>It does not make a damn difference as long as you end up as a roasted piece of meat with a crispy skin and a good layer of fat below to be followed by lean meat.</p>
              <p>That should be sufficiently good entertainment for anyone compared to your hot gassed aggression that is as worthless as the steam released when the roast is cut.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"> Again I see no talent in this para, no meaning??</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When Chinese High School - (now known as Hwa Chong) - was first founded by philanthropist Tan Kah Kee in 1919 - for the benefit of the migrant Chinese Community - it was the first Chinese School in Southeast Asia to cater to the different Chinese dialect groups.</p>
              <p>Even at that time, Mandarin was considered the official language of Chinese and spoken across all provinces in China, and even if those in the rural areas cannot pronounce any better in their dialectic accents - the written form is the common link..</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">China was rrule by the mongol for nearly a century, and again, by the Manchu for about 2 centuries, are you sure you are totally ethical Chinese??? With my height and good feature, my grandma told me we are Mongol decendents, while i find no root to it, but I had no doubt that I am not pure chinese too. Yap Ah Loy, a Manchu magistrate here was not even Chinese. Chinese Mandarin cannot connect the world, it is still English that command a little more respect, and if you are in China, those young Chinese from rural areas are very hungry to study english. They know that English is the way, and will be more delighted when i spoke my taiwanese english with them. And bear in mind, their teacher are mostly Americans, and their english is America English.</span></p>
              <p>  </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is not wrong that you should be labelled as a "zwei-siao-Hog" - with your pig headed attitude showing off the false aggressive bravado, and the "zwei-siao" belief that the learning of Mandarin is only good for one to die with one's culture.</p>
              <p>Did your "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">Teochew progenitor</span></em>" leave this thought into your small cranium ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Again I see nothing but full of anger on this para, the critiscism a man gives truly shown his anger and frustration with no way out. Finally, remember that LKY is not pure chinese too ya.</span></p>

              <p><br>Once upon a time, China controlled the part of Asia, it was the most powerful kingdom that every landlords, kings and princes have to paid tribute to them. Then it shut it door to outside world due to a stupid Mole by the name of Mao, and within that period, it deterioted tremedously, it set opportunities for the other smaller states to pull up, and Singapore was part of the state that gain from the closure of China and its allies economy. So, now they are back, nothing unusual about it.</p>
              <p>Just imagine that if China did not shut it door during the Mao period, Singapore would not be what it is today, so are taiwan, korea or even Japan. Now China a fully awake, time to plough back what it had lost. And very soon, we will have to kowtow to them again as we did before Mao.</p>

              <p><br>Once upon a time, China controlled the part of Asia, it was the most powerful kingdom that every landlords, kings and princes have to paid tribute to them. Then it shut it door to outside world due to a stupid Mole by the name of Mao, and within that period, it deterioted tremedously, it set opportunities for the other smaller states to pull up, and Singapore was part of the state that gain from the closure of China and its allies economy. So, now they are back, nothing unusual about it.</p>
              <p>Just imagine that if China did not shut it door during the Mao period, Singapore would not be what it is today, so are taiwan, korea or even Japan. Now China a fully awake, time to plough back what it had lost. And very soon, we will have to kowtow to them again as we did before Mao.</p>

              <p><br>To a typical Sg Uncle I see in geyland and my joo chiat place, Vietnam and China Gals are more prettier than their money.</p>
              <p>Money is pretty at a certain time, i did make a survey on how people look at money at different stages of life.</p>
              <p>I conclude that from 1 to 8 yo, money is just a toy</p>
              <p>then from 9 to 15yo, money is make know as important for exchange of foods, toys, parties and fashions</p>
              <p>then from 16 yo to 21yo, which is my age group, Money is very important, good for disco, fashion, eating, shopping, and for guys, good to have money so as to get a sexy beauti gf.</p>
              <p>then from 22 yo to 50yo, money is damn important, the most important stages, can drink, get gf, go for sex, get foreign gals,  tour, buy luxury goods, show off, spa, massage, cars, house, club, cards etc etc...whatever you can name off.</p>
              <p>then from 51 to 62yo, peoples start to realize their age and begin to save, no more energy left for fun, and even luxury goods is seen as nothing, they care for their health and some care for their looks, they start to spend on health products and checkup, comestic surgery, TCM, etc etc.</p>
              <p>then from 63 to death, for women, most will save their money for childrens, health, old follks gathering and also shopping. As for men, there are two types, one goes back to childrens kind of thinking and spend lavishly on Foreign gals, the mind become as naive as a 8 yo kid who just handle money, cos for them, life is not long anymore, can or cannot also chiong. Another type of men are those die die also must win, full of frustration and anger like my Uncle Atobe style, see anyone also scold, and most these people are thrifty like hell, one cent also count. These peoples most likely will bring their money to the coffin, which unfortunately, they cannot take along, end up their decendents being the most happiest.</p>
