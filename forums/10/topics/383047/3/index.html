              <p>My bro n sis studied in Catholic schools, in Chinese,
              Eng n BM , I studied Methodist in Primary n Secondary... So our
              workload is a bit more then the government schools, thats just about
              it. Syllabus in Chinese n BM n sometimes Eng. The only problem is maybe
              adapting in the beginning during the changes.</p>
              <p>Whats wrong with the bi-lingual system ? I am sure there are some good that got out of it.</p>

              <p>@ the topic:Now all the things go wrong,even with this Chinese language education issue,the one that is to blamed is solely Lee Kuan Yew himself,not Mrs Tan.</p>
              <p>1)Let me elaborate,when Singapore get independent in 1965,many of the Singaporeans are uneducated or low educated.They didnt even know how to write n read Chinese language properly,not to mention knowing any English.</p>
              <p>BUT,our dear LKY,who wanted to show off to the whole Singaporeans how good his English is,implement English language to be taught as our first language in school.This skip of process of learning Chinese or other races mother tongue first n put English as our 2nd language,cause a great confusion in our Chinese,Malay n Indian communities.</p>
              <p>The ppl at that time cant even handle their mother tongue well,n they have to learn a totally "alien language"(English) as their 1st language?LOL!!!</p>
              <p>2)Now,after decades of English education,our ppl,especially the young,already get used to English language.And suddenly,"The old man" wanted we Singaporeans to learn back Chinese n do it good in school n impose harsh education system to ensure his policy works,Why?</p>
              <p>Becoz,he want to show to Singaporeans again how good he is at knowing both English n Chinese well.He wanted to show his countrymen n women how "intelligent" he is,LOL again!!!</p>
              <p>P.S:Honestly speaking,to me,English is more easier to learn than Chinese,although the fact that i came from a Chinese speaking family.Those who learn both language before will know.</p>
              <p>3)LKY want his son to learn Russian language,Why?Becoz he can show Singaporeans how clever his son is,can speak 3 to 4 major languages.No,he doesnt care whether his son LHL like to learn Russian or Malay languages or not,he dont care his son happy or not.IT IS ALL ABOUT HIMSELF,LKY!!!!</p>
              <p>4)LKY let his cabinets to decide who shall be the next PM to take over his post,u think its democracy?NO,he is pretending to show to other country leaders how wise n democratic he is.BUT,when GCT decided to hold an election n let Singaporeans to voice out more of their opinions,or to do things in GCT's own way,he get "raped" by LKY n have to be obedient n under control by LKY's manipulation!!!</p>
              <p>So,in the end,its all about LKY himself.He is an attention seeking w-hore,he want all ppl to know how "great" he was,how "wise" he was,how "powerful" he was,it is all about LKY himself.No,he dont care for others....not even his sons or daughter.</p>

              <p>LKY is an anti-communist ?</p>
              <p>This must be a joke ?</p>
              <p>The "anti-communist" in LKY is no more then a sham - as it is a mere excuse that he depend on to label anyone as a Communist, and without any evidence will provide him the opportunity to incarcerate anyone without trial and at his discretion.</p>
              <p>The "anti-communist" image is only a convenient front to hide the Stalinist in LKY, as his methods are no different from Stalin - who was the most successful Communist ever to be in power after the short-lived Lenin.</p>
              <p>The methods used by LKY in dealing with his political opponents are no different from that used by Stalin, and LKY's government and organisation models are little different from the various Communist State Controlled models - where the State rule supreme.</p>
              <p>Ironically, the only Communist that exist in Singapore is the Stalinist Autocrat himself.</p>
