            <div class='col-md body'>The TS mentioned about Town Council staff being high-handed .. yes, I agree .. I remember some time ago I posted in this forums that my town council did not clear my area everyday..  in fact for over a month, but they never failed to deduct conservancy charges in time ...  I protested and refused to pay, they came knocking on my door..  They even got the cheek to say the law is provided that they are empowered to collect the charges which I must pay.  They sent a lawyer letter to me and I lan lan pay up..  mean time the area was still not clean ... in fact now also never see them come sweep the my area for two weeks leow .. how I know I drop a flyer on the pavement and it is still not clear ...<br><br></div>
