I realized in Spore(I stayed here for almost<br><br>twenty year) Sporean liked to live in condominiun no offence to those who can afford it. Condominium once bought had to pay the loan.

It's hard to believe that 90% of Singaporeans live in HDB flats, when you see so many new condominiums sprouting up. I think such ads have an important role in promoting the increasingly materialistic outlook of young Singaporeans, by portraying condominiums and cars as desirable, or even need-to-have, status items.

Our patio reaches to the front yard, they have a whole horizon."<br><br>When the little boy was finishing, his father was speechless.<br><br>His son added, "Thanks, Dad, for showing me how poor we are!"<br><br>Isn't it true that it all depends on the way you look at things?
