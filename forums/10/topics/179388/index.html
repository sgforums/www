The 5Cs (coined by our govt), the deluded goal of 'SWISS STANDARD OF LIVING' (by SM GCT), the noble aim of reaching 1st world status (with a 3rd world administration).<br><br>Even the upgrading carrots at every election and control of COE prices have created a material-first society, the pursuit of a comfortable lifestyle has been warped by our people into the pursuit of material assets.<br><br>The more the merrier.<br><br>The more expensive = perceived 'higher status' in society.<br><br>Instead of earning enough to reside comfortably, we become deranged money-earners and this is certainly not helped by our rising costs of living - groceries, utilities, fuel, property etc etc.<br><br>Our low birth rates can also be linked to this factor as singles find it easier to pursue their careers without the added burden of family. The costs involved in starting a family are significant enough (without being materialistic) to discourage many Singaporeans of this generation to even consider the thought. Is it any wonder fewer and fewer among the better-educated prefer to stay unattached?<br><br>Just like the arrogant and empty boast of reaching <strong>Goal 2010</strong>, our purported <strong>SWISS STANDARD OF LIVING </strong>is fast becoming more of a fantasy.</div>
