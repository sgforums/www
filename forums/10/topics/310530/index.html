              <p><strong>No drivers, so SBS Transit turns to China  <br>By Mindy Tan <br> <br>March 11, 2008</strong>      </p>
              <p><br>FEWER Singaporeans and Malaysians want to drive public buses. <br>  <br>So SBS Transit has hired its first batch of 20 drivers from China.</p>
              <p>The company confirmed that the new bus captains have been sourced from its subsidiary bus company in China, and it is in the process of bringing them in.</p>
              <p>It also said that a two-year attachment has been worked out for these drivers.</p>
              <p>The New Paper checked with the company after reader Paul Antony Fernandez, a security project officer, 42, called us on hearing of the employment of the Chinese drivers.</p>
              <p>He asked: 'Isn't this a total contradiction to our Government policy of providing our people with employment and bringing down the unemployment rate?'</p>
              <p>In an e-mail reply to The New Paper, Ms Tammy Tan, SBS Transit's corporate communications director, said that over the years, the company has found it increasingly difficult to get people to join the profession.</p>
              <p>It does not help that the demand for bus captains is growing as more bus services are rolled out.</p>
              <p>Even the SBS Transit New Bus Captain Scheme, launched in 2005, has lost its shine.</p>
              <p>That year, enhanced salary structures drove a bus driver's basic entry salary up from $936 to $1,200 per month for Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>Bus drivers also became known as bus captains, providing an essential service.</p>
              <p>SBS Transit then announced that it received three times more job applications from Singaporeans in the first month of the scheme's inception, three times more than the previous average of 60 applications a month.</p>
              <p>But now, it seems that foreign workers from China may be the way to go.</p>
              <p>Ms Tan said: 'Thanks to a recent relaxation by the Ministry of Manpower on non-traditional sources of manpower, we are now looking at supplementing our current bus captain pool with those from China.'</p>
              <p>Are Singaporeans apprehensive about driving public buses? Or is a foreigner's willingness to accept lower wages the reason for the switch?</p>
              <p>SBS Transit now has 5,200 bus captains under its wing - 75 per cent of whom are Singaporeans or permanent residents.</p>
              <p>Malaysian drivers make up the remaining 25 per cent. Bus captains earn between $1,600 and $3,500 a month.</p>
              <p>The average gross for most is about $2,300 a month, excluding an annual wage supplement and bonuses.</p>
              <p>The company said that the new Chinese bus captains' salaries have not been decided.</p>
              <p>'We are still in the process of negotiating the terms,' Ms Tan said.</p>
              <p>Mr Fernandez feels that SBS Transit has found the easy way out.</p>
              <p>The concerned commuter spoke to more than 10 bus captains during his frequent rides, and concluded that better work welfare can solve the employment problem.</p>
              <p>Mr Fernandez said: 'Upon hearing their woes, I feel the turnover rate can be reduced and good employers retained if better work welfare is provided.'</p>
              <p>SBS bus captains work six days a week. On average, they clock nine hours a day.</p>
              <p>Ms Tan said that 12 per cent of a work day is spent on breaks in between trips.</p>
              <p>But traffic congestion often deprives drivers of that rest period.</p>
              <p>Mr Fernandez said: 'Bus captains have told me that when they are held up by bad traffic, they return back to base later than scheduled and their rest times are shortened.</p>
              <p>'While at the Toa Payoh bus interchange, I saw a bus captain drive Service 143 into the bus bay, run to the toilet, clocked in and out, and in less than five minutes, he was back in the driver's seat preparing for the next trip.</p>
              <p>'When I boarded the bus, I asked him why he did not take a drink or a meal.</p>
              <p>'He replied, 'No choice, due to adverse traffic conditions'.'</p>
              <p>Bus captains have to begin their next trip fairly quickly to minimise further inconvenience caused to commuters waiting at the bus stops.</p>
              <p>BAD TRAFFIC SHORTENS BREAKS</p>
              <p>SBS Transit acknowledged this problem.</p>
              <p>Ms Tan said: 'In cases of extreme traffic congestion, where buses are caught in a bad jam, bus captains do return to the interchanges very late, thus affecting their trip schedule.'</p>
              <p>She added: 'This is one of the many challenges that we deal with in our bus operations and we appreciate the dedication of our bus captains.'</p>
              <p>SBS Transit said that the Chinese New Year celebrations at Chinatown last month caused a traffic build-up, from Eu Tong Sen Street tailing to North Bridge Road on some days.</p>
              <p>Buses arrived at the interchanges late, some by as much as 45 minutes, it said.</p>
              <p>Mr Fernandez's parting shot: 'Bus captains are also ordinary human beings like all of us, who need ample rest to recharge and be alert and stay healthy while on the road.</p>
              <p>'Please look into this management area first, before looking for other solutions.'<br> <br> </p>

              <p>The problem is that if the authorities do not tackle the problem
                      of cheap foreign labour flooding our country, they will continue to
                      keep the salaries of such jobs low. Singaporeans who are not
                      qualified to have better paying jobs (low academic qualifications
                      etc.) will suffer from this. Not everyone is born to have diplomas
                      or degrees... why are we so agreeable to companies making more
                      money by hiring cheap foreign labour, but so reluctant to empathise
                      with fellow Singaporeans... sigh</p>

              <p>either is too much of pressure or the welfare is suck!</p>
              <p>or.....buses company is working the easier way out...dun even bother to think how to attract ppl, or even making of the excuses to hire china ppl....so that can further lower now the wages...so that the bosses will make even more money....</p>
