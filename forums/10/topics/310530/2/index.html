              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><br><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">FEWER Singaporeans want to go into politics.<br> <br>So PAP has hired its first batch of 20 politicians from China.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The party confirmed that the new Chinese young bloods have been sourced from its subsidiary party in China, and it is in the process of bringing them in.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">It also said that a two-term attachment has been worked out for these politicians.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The Newer Paper checked with the company after reader Pauli Antony Fernandez, a security project officer, 42, called us on hearing of the employment of the Chinese politicians.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">He asked: 'Isn't this a total contradiction to our Government policy of providing our politicians with employment and bringing down the unemployment rate?'</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">In an e-mail reply to The Newer Paper, Ms Timid Tan, PAP's corporate communications director, said that over the years, the party has found it increasingly difficult to get people to join the profession.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">It does not help that the demand for politician is growing as more constituencies are rolled out.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Even the PAP New Politician Orientation Scheme, launched in 2005, has lost its shine.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">That year, enhanced salary structures drove a politician’s basic entry salary up from $10,000 to $12,000 per month for Singaporeans.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Politicians also became known as people leader, providing an essential service.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">PAP then announced that it received three times more job applications from Singaporeans in the first month of the scheme's inception, three times more than the previous average of 60 applications a month. But most did not meet the high entry level standards. They include:</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1.25in; text-indent: -0.25in;  "><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span><span>1.<span style='font: 7pt "Times New Roman";'>      </span></span></span>You must be a Rafflesians, St. Josephians or ACS old boy</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1.25in; text-indent: -0.25in;  "><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span><span>2.<span style='font: 7pt "Times New Roman";'>      </span></span></span>Oxcam preferred, but not critical</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">But now, it seems that FT from China may be the way to go.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Ms Tan said: 'Thanks to a recent relaxation by the Ministry of Manpower on non-traditional sources of manpower, we are now looking at supplementing our current politician pool with those from China.'</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Are Singaporeans apprehensive about Chinese politicians serving the people? Or is a foreigner politician willingness to accept lower wages then their Singaporean peers?</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">PAP now has 5,200 wanna-be politicians under its wing - 100 per cent of whom are Singaporeans. Some were Malaysians but they are quitted Malaysia to be Singaporeans. These Malaysians have been decried by the Malaysia Malaysian Chinese for greed.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The average gross salary for most is about $12,00 a month, excluding an annual wage supplement and bonuses, or other political appointments.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The company said that the new Chinese politician’s salaries have not been decided.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">'We are still in the process of negotiating the terms,' Ms Tan said.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Mr Fernandez feels that PAP has found the easy way out.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The concerned citizen spoke to more than 10 politicians during his Meet the People sessions, and concluded that better work welfare can solve the employment problem.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Mr Fernandez said: 'Upon hearing their woes, I feel the turnover rate can be reduced and good employers retained if better work welfare is provided. Just pay them a lot more!'</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Politicians work six days a week, including officiating opening ceremony and walk about sessions. On average, they clock three hours a day.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Ms Tan said that 52 per cent of a work day is spent on breaks in between work.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">But traffic congestion often deprives politicians of that rest period.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Mr Fernandez said: Politicians have told me that when they are held up by bad traffic, they return back to Parliament House later than scheduled and their rest times are shortened.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">'While at Parliament House, I saw a politician drive his Bentley into the reserved lot, run to the toilet, clocked in and out, and in less than five minutes, he was back in the driver's seat preparing for his next joint. F1 would have been proud.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">'When I met him, I asked him why he did not take a drink or a meal.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">'He replied, 'No choice, due to adverse traffic conditions. And LKY will get mad'.'</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Politicians have to begin their next assignment fairly quickly to minimise further inconvenience caused to electorate, like waiting for their lifts to be fixed.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">BAD TRAFFIC SHORTENS BREAKS</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">PAP acknowledged this problem.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Ms Tan said: 'In cases of extreme traffic congestion, where these 5 litre cars are caught in a bad jam, politicians do return to the Parliament House very late, thus affecting their work commitments.'</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">She added: 'This is one of the many challenges that we deal with in our running of the country and we appreciate the dedication of our politicians.'</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">PAP said that the Chinese New Year celebrations at Chinatown last month caused a traffic build-up, from Eu Tong Sen Street tailing to North Bridge Road on some days.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">MPs arrived at the New Parliament House late, some by as much as 45 minutes, it said.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Mr Fernandez's parting shot: `Politicians are also ordinary human beings like all of us, who need ample rest to recharge and be alert and stay healthy while on service.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">'Please look into this management area first, like doubling their pay before looking for other solutions.'</span></p>

              <p>Obviously the wages they pay are not good enough to attract Singaporeans to be bus drivers.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Shouldn't they have at least increase the wages to attract Singaporeans, instead of maintaining</p>
              <p>the low wages and sourcing for lower wages bus drivers from China.</p>

              <p>While at the same time, not fogetting that this will also increase the Gini Coefficient, because it</p>
              <p>is going to promote more wage discrepancy between the high income and low income.</p>
              <p>Instead of increasing the wages for bus drivers so that they could entice more Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>This way, the lower wage bus drivers will get paid more, thereby decreasing the wage</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>With such issues playing out in our local industry, I have no doubt that the Gini Coefficient will</p>

              <p>according to some people i've met here on the forums, the bus drivers should be proud of their contribution to the society as a whole. The knowledge that they get people around the country should be enough compensation.</p>
              <p>Pay raises will just make them feel dirty and cheap.</p>

              so</strong> <strong><span style="font-weight: normal;">PAP</span> <strong>turns to
              China </strong></strong><br></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>By Mandy Tin<br>  <br> March 11,
              2008</strong>      </span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><br> <span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">FEWER Singaporeans want
              to go into politics.<br>  <br> So PAP has hired its first batch of 20 politicians from
              China.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The party confirmed that the new
              Chinese young bloods have been sourced from its subsidiary party in
              China, and it is in the process of bringing them in.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">It also said that a two-term
              attachment has been worked out for these politicians.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The Newer Paper checked with the
              company after reader Pauli Antony Fernandez, a security project
              officer, 42, called us on hearing of the employment of the Chinese
              politicians.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">He asked: 'Isn't this a total
              contradiction to our Government policy of providing our politicians
              with employment and bringing down the unemployment
              rate?'</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">In an e-mail reply to The Newer
              Paper, Ms Timid Tan, PAP's corporate communications director, said
              that over the years, the party has found it increasingly difficult
              to get people to join the profession.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">It does not help that the demand
              for politician is growing as more constituencies are rolled
              out.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Even the PAP New Politician
              Orientation Scheme, launched in 2005, has lost its
              shine.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">That year, enhanced salary
              structures drove a politician’s basic entry salary up from $10,000
              to $12,000 per month for Singaporeans.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Politicians also became known as
              people leader, providing an essential service.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">PAP then announced that it received
              three times more job applications from Singaporeans in the first
              month of the scheme's inception, three times more than the previous
              average of 60 applications a month. But most did not meet the high
              entry level standards. They include:</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span><span>1.<span>     </span></span></span> You must be
              a Rafflesians, St. Josephians or ACS old boy</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span><span>2.<span>     </span></span></span> Oxcam
              preferred, but not critical</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">But now, it seems that FT from
              China may be the way to go.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Ms Tan said: 'Thanks to a recent
              relaxation by the Ministry of Manpower on non-traditional sources
              of manpower, we are now looking at supplementing our current
              politician pool with those from China.'</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Are Singaporeans apprehensive about
              Chinese politicians serving the people? Or is a foreigner
              politician willingness to accept lower wages then their Singaporean
              peers?</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">PAP now has 5,200 wanna-be
              politicians under its wing - 100 per cent of whom are Singaporeans.
              Some were Malaysians but they are quitted Malaysia to be
              Singaporeans. These Malaysians have been decried by the Malaysia
              Malaysian Chinese for greed.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The average gross salary for most
              is about $12,00 a month, excluding an annual wage supplement and
              bonuses, or other political appointments.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The company said that the new
              Chinese politician’s salaries have not been decided.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">'We are still in the process of
              negotiating the terms,' Ms Tan said.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Mr Fernandez feels that PAP has
              found the easy way out.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The concerned citizen spoke to more
              than 10 politicians during his Meet the People sessions, and
              concluded that better work welfare can solve the employment
              problem.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Mr Fernandez said: 'Upon hearing
              their woes, I feel the turnover rate can be reduced and good
              employers retained if better work welfare is provided. Just pay
              them a lot more!'</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Politicians work six days a week,
              including officiating opening ceremony and walk about sessions. On
              average, they clock three hours a day.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Ms Tan said that 52 per cent of a
              work day is spent on breaks in between work.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">But traffic congestion often
              deprives politicians of that rest period.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Mr Fernandez said: Politicians have
              told me that when they are held up by bad traffic, they return back
              to Parliament House later than scheduled and their rest times are
              shortened.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">'While at Parliament House, I saw a
              politician drive his Bentley into the reserved lot, run to the
              toilet, clocked in and out, and in less than five minutes, he was
              back in the driver's seat preparing for his next joint. F1 would
              have been proud.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">'When I met him, I asked him why he
              did not take a drink or a meal.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">'He replied, 'No choice, due to
              adverse traffic conditions. And LKY will get mad'.'</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Politicians have to begin their
              next assignment fairly quickly to minimise further inconvenience
              caused to electorate, like waiting for their lifts to be
              fixed.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">BAD TRAFFIC SHORTENS
              BREAKS</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">PAP acknowledged this
              problem.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Ms Tan said: 'In cases of extreme
              traffic congestion, where these 5 litre cars are caught in a bad
              jam, politicians do return to the Parliament House very late, thus
              affecting their work commitments.'</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">She added: 'This is one of the many
              challenges that we deal with in our running of the country and we
              appreciate the dedication of our politicians.'</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">PAP said that the Chinese New Year
              celebrations at Chinatown last month caused a traffic build-up,
              from Eu Tong Sen Street tailing to North Bridge Road on some
              days.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">MPs arrived at the New Parliament
              House late, some by as much as 45 minutes, it said.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Mr Fernandez's parting shot:
              `Politicians are also ordinary human beings like all of us, who
              need ample rest to recharge and be alert and stay healthy while on
              service.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">'Please look into this management
              area first, like doubling their pay before looking for other
              solutions.'</span></p>

              <p>no they don't. They talk about increasing price of goods and services instead. Ultimately, the money still comes from you. They can do this easily because the demand for their services is equal to the market demand for this particular service. In addition, demand for public transport are usually very inelastic; they can raise the price and the demand would not change much.</p>

              <p>I'm talking about bus bunching even when there no freak incidents. I've no idea why you would include one-off events when I'm talking about everyday events. In Germany, you will never see bus bunching even if they are scheduled to come at 10 minutes interval. If they are scheduled to come at 10 minutes interval, they will come at 10 minutes interval, even if the bus travels between cities.</p>
