              <p>So you don't see it as a failure in logistics planning when the bus is packed so full that remaining passengers cannot get up?</p>
              <p>So you see being efficient as packing the bus to the fullest like a can of sardines when moving off so that the cost vs revenue ratio is lower, at the expense of consumer comfort?</p>

              <p>Ask yourself this question.</p>
              <p>If you own and control all the transport companies in Singapore.</p>
              <p>What's the best way to make more profits?</p>
              <p>Increase the price of fares or increase efficiency?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you increase efficiency by running more buses in those routes,</p>
              <p>you will run up more expense for the company.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you increase fares, you will get more profits, you can pack</p>
              <p>up buses like sardines, you will make more money.</p>

              <p><br>Do you understand that the employment of China bus drivers</p>
              <p>will increase the income gap between the rich and the poor further?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Let's say Singapore is an economy of 100 citizens.</p>
              <p>Say the economy is fully employed, all 100 citizens have jobs,</p>
              <p>then one day 5 citizens decided to resign from their clerical positions</p>
              <p>and 5 citizens decided to resign from their jobs as "bus captains".</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The 5 bus drivers want to take up clerical positions, the 5 clerical</p>
              <p>officers want to remain in clerical line (just not in their previous company),</p>
              <p>nobody wants to go into bus driving they feel that the pay is too low.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The bus company decides to outsource to China because manpower is cheaper,</p>
              <p>ends up employing 5 bus drivers from China.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Then the 5 clerical positions that was vacant will be competed by 10 citizens.</p>
              <p>Each of the 10 try to price themselves lower than the other so they can</p>
              <p>gain employment.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ultimately, the lower income earners end up with lower pay.</p>
              <p>Therefore increasing the income gap (Gini Coefficient) further.</p>

                                                  <p>Or if your daily net income is around $50 to be a taxi driver,

              again, how come we can so easily empathise with why CEO's and companies need to make millions to survive. but so hard to empathise with the hardships of ordinary uncles and aunties...

              <p>if they have will to think...they will never be a biz man liao...</p>
              <p>take my in law for example, he's been working for translink (SBS) as a driver for 27 yrs. now driving bus 197 from Jurong east to Bedok ( abt 4 hrs through &amp; flow ). need to wake up 3:45am &amp; leave the hse by 4:30am in order to catch the company transport if he's in morning shift.</p>
              <p>due to his age is catching up, physically no longer as good as those young driver. it is quite tough for him to drove for long hr &amp; longer distance. Hence, he did approvch the management, ask for transfer to those shorter distance or those feeder bus. He even dont mind to have a pay cut. but was rejected by the management. ( no reason given ).</p>

              <p>Next thing aft nationalising</p>
              <p>if govt is forced to raise bus fares, ppl go for opposition... mirror image of Malaysia's election</p>
              <p>anyway... ppl like the iron lady Margaret Thatcher were the ones to get rid of nationalised industries and making it to privatised like the buses in London.... ironically, ppl here wants to do the opposite... hoping to tie the govt to as many burden as many as possible <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/thumbs_up.png" alt="thumbs_up.png"></p>

              <p>Nationalising... Simply make profit, profit goes to govt? lose money increase tax rate to keep up the bus service? at the same time, ads revenue make up at least 50% of their revenue.</p>
              <p>Inefficient? most of the times just ppl refuse to move in, making the bus to be delayed and lengthening travelling time... at the same time, the behind bus catches up. Everything blame blame blame, even yourself dun move in causing delays never thought of it. Dun wanna believe? I ever saw buses stucked at 1 bus stop for 5 mins, creating the buses behind unable to move.. Why? cos after the exit there's lots of standing spaces yet no one wants to move in until so long later... waste everyone's time (I can dare to say 6 man hours of time)</p>
              <p>as for welfare... if there's cases like Loyang Ave accident, buses are delayed, passengers saying not 'efficient'... end up driver gotta forgo break to please everyone?</p>
              <p>increase wages? fares then got to go up, when diesel prices have alrdy gone up more than 100%. Dun come and say abt wages, if you want ppl to provide you a service, they've to remain afloat before anything can happens... If you can accept fuel surcharge for SIA, why not here? Dun tell me public tpt, but who's going to bear the cost? taxpayers w/ additional taxes?</p>

              <p>You can look at it this way, if bus services (public) loses money, the money used to offset the loses goes into the cost of providing the service.</p>
              <p>If it is privatised, the profits is the excess of the cost of providing the service.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you consider packing up the buses like sardines as efficient, at the expense of commuters risking servere injury during traffic accidents.</p>
              <p>They could have also increase frequency of buses so that commuters won't be squeezed like sardines, instead of taking a profit maximising approach.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If buses were nationalised, there won't be this rent for premises and corporate taxes, both of these items account for nearly $40 million which goes</p>
              <p>indirectly into the government's coffers.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> Cost recovery (public) or profit motive (private)?</p>
