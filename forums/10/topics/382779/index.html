              <p><strong>Written by Our Correspondent</strong></p>
              <p>National Development Minister  Mah Bow Tan told parliament yesterday that PRs do not add further to the demand of HDB flats.</p>
              <p><span><em>“PRs are not eligible for buying new flats, even in the resale market, quite a lot of them actually rent. They are under-represented as far as purchases are concerned,” </em>he said.</span></p>
              <p><span>Mr Mah did not quote any figures to substantiate his claims. An earlier report by real estate agency ERA revealed that 40 per cent of buyers of resale flats are PRs.</span></p>
              <p><span>The Straits Times reported an Indonesian PR forking out $653,000 for a 4-room flat in Queenstown though he could well afford a condominium.</span></p>
              <p><span>The prices of resale flats have sky-rocketed over the last few months, hittinga record high in June this year.</span></p>
              <p><span>Despite the escalating prices, HDB is adamant that public housing remains affordable in Singapore.</span></p>
              <p><span>In response to mounting complaints from first-time home buyers that they were unable to purchase a flat of their choice, Mr Mah retorted that they were too “fussy”.</span></p>
              <p><span>He reiterated his stance again in parliament that expectations of first-time buyers are too high, </span><span>with many demanding for flats in prime estates or on higher floors.<br><em><br>“I cannot build flats only in the mature estates, only in the city area. I cannot build flats that are only on high floors,” </em>he said.</span></p>
              <p>Mr Mah claimed that HDB will be building between<span> 10,000 and 12,000 new flats per annum over the next five years to meet the housing demand in Singapore. </span></p>
              <p><span>He did not explain why the supply of new flats was not increased between the years 2006 and 2008 when the influx of foreigners is at its peak.<br></span></p>
              <p><span>The number of foreigners working and living in Singapore has increased rapidly over the last few years as part of the government’s policy to boost the nation’s declining birth rates via immigration.</span></p>
              <p><span>Foreigners now made up 36 per cent of the population, up from 14 per cent in 1990. This means that one out of three residents in Singapore is a foreigner.</span></p>
              <p><span>According to the National Population Secretariat, about 90,000 foreigners became PRs last year with another 20,000 taking up Singapore citizenship.</span></p>
              <p><span>Mr Mah did not reveal the exact numbers of PRs and new citizens who bought resale flats as well as new flats. </span></p>
              <p><span>The numbers of PRs who made a profit from the sale of their resale flats after they left Singapore is also unknown.</span></p>
              <p><span>The question on whether there are sufficient HDB flats for first-time buyers was actually fielded by a PAP MP. The three so-called opposition MPs in parliament have remained mute on the issue so far.</span></p>
              <p><span>Singapore’s ruling PAP won only 66.6 per cent of the valid votes in the last elections, but occupied 82 out of 84 seats in parliament.</span></p>
              <p><span>With an absolute majority, they are able to pass bills and legislation unhindered in parliament with little or no debate. </span></p>
              <p><span>Without a sizable opposition presence in parliament to demand detailed answers from Mr Mah, it is unlikely that Singaporeans will ever know the real impact of foreigners on the cost of public housing in Singapore.</span></p>
              <p><span><br></span></p>

              <p>For those PRs who rent out their rooms in their resale flats, the cost of the flat is essentially the initial down payment.</p>

              <p>Example, for a resale flat that costs $400,000, the PR couple buying the flat needs to come with say 20% or the initial $80,000.  The rest of the monthly mortgage payments can be covered by renting out some of the rooms to other PRs or foreigners looking for accomodation.</p>

              <p><strong>Written by Our Correspondent</strong></p>
              <p>National Development Minister  Mah Bow Tan told parliament yesterday that PRs do not add further to the demand of HDB flats.</p>
              <p><span><em>“PRs are not eligible for buying new flats, even in the resale market, quite a lot of them actually rent. They are under-represented as far as purchases are concerned,”</em> he said.</span></p>
              <p><span>Mr Mah did not quote any figures to substantiate his claims. An earlier report by real estate agency ERA revealed that 40 per cent of buyers of resale flats are PRs.</span></p>
              <p><span>The Straits Times reported an Indonesian PR forking out $653,000 for a 4-room flat in Queenstown though he could well afford a condominium.</span></p>
              <p><span>The prices of resale flats have sky-rocketed over the last few months, hittinga record high in June this year.</span></p>
              <p><span>Despite the escalating prices, HDB is adamant that public housing remains affordable in Singapore.</span></p>
              <p><span>In response to mounting complaints from first-time home buyers that they were unable to purchase a flat of their choice, Mr Mah retorted that they were too “fussy”.</span></p>
              <p><span>He reiterated his stance again in parliament that expectations of first-time buyers are too high,</span> <span>with many demanding for flats in prime estates or on higher floors.<br><em><br>“I cannot build flats only in the mature estates, only in the city area. I cannot build flats that are only on high floors,”</em> he said.</span></p>
              <p>Mr Mah claimed that HDB will be building between <span>10,000 and 12,000 new flats per annum over the next five years to meet the housing demand in Singapore.</span></p>
              <p><span>He did not explain why the supply of new flats was not increased between the years 2006 and 2008 when the influx of foreigners is at its peak.<br></span></p>
              <p><span>The number of foreigners working and living in Singapore has increased rapidly over the last few years as part of the government’s policy to boost the nation’s declining birth rates via immigration.</span></p>
              <p><span>Foreigners now made up 36 per cent of the population, up from 14 per cent in 1990. This means that one out of three residents in Singapore is a foreigner.</span></p>
              <p><span>According to the National Population Secretariat, about 90,000 foreigners became PRs last year with another 20,000 taking up Singapore citizenship.</span></p>
              <p><span>Mr Mah did not reveal the exact numbers of PRs and new citizens who bought resale flats as well as new flats.</span></p>
              <p><span>The numbers of PRs who made a profit from the sale of their resale flats after they left Singapore is also unknown.</span></p>
              <p><span>The question on whether there are sufficient HDB flats for first-time buyers was actually fielded by a PAP MP. The three so-called opposition MPs in parliament have remained mute on the issue so far.</span></p>
              <p><span>Singapore’s ruling PAP won only 66.6 per cent of the valid votes in the last elections, but occupied 82 out of 84 seats in parliament.</span></p>
              <p><span>With an absolute majority, they are able to pass bills and legislation unhindered in parliament with little or no debate.</span></p>
              <p><span>Without a sizable opposition presence in parliament to demand detailed answers from Mr Mah, it is unlikely that Singaporeans will ever know the real impact of foreigners on the cost of public housing in Singapore.</span></p>
