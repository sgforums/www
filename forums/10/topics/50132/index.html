            <div class='col-md body'>Lim Peh ka li kong, hor, nowsaday, chewrens should treat old people like shit.<br><br>In other words, must wipe them, lah.<br><br>Young people should be honoured to clean us up!<br><br>Not like my bloody son, who dared to kao peh when I vomited all over myself and his lap top. I only wanted to share with him what I had for lunch, what!<br><br>It's a sad day for society when young people can't appreciate a senior citizen vomiting on their electrical equipment.<br><br>Si noong kia! Now he wants to send me to an old folks home.<br><br>I was tempted to call him a son of a bitch, but then my wife began to scold me, asking me why I insult her when I was angry with him.<br><br>I tell you, ah, women also nowsaday don'ch respect men anymore! Bleddy ungrateful! After all the things we do for them.<br><br>Like allow them to have sex with us, carry our chewrens and cook and clean for us.<br><br>You would think they would appreciate us, but no, they demand all sorts of unreasonable things.<br><br>Like unbinding their feet. Or voting. Or monogamy.<br><br>Anyway, my bleddy son put me in an old folks home - the Little Sisters of the Senile Home for the Aged.<br><br>All the way there, I curse and curse my son, say he treat his father like that, later sure suay one.<br><br>Sure kena extend his reservist, bao his chewrens cannot get into G.E.P. and all sorts of hojjiber things.<br><br>But was he contrite when I confronted him with his unfilial behaviour?<br><br>No, the si gin nah said, "I should show you the same filial behaviour you showed when you decided to chain Grandma in a cage and hose her down."<br><br>Then he added, "Besides, it's Ah Ma's idea."<br><br>Bleddy people nowsaday don'ch understand the fundamental concept underlying Asian values.<br><br>Which is "do as I say, don't do as I do".<br><br>Anyway, when I reach the Little Sisters of the Senile, I began to have a change of heart.<br><br>I thought, maybe there is a very, very small possibility that I am a burden to my chewrens.<br><br>Like when I use their credit card to pay for my monthly pilgrimage and donations to the temple in Patpong.<br><br>Or when I massage my prostate while watching adult VCDs in the living room.<br><br>Or when I blow my nose on their laundry.<br><br>Of course it is very unreasonable of my chewrens to see this as burdensome behaviour. But then, chewrens nowsaday are less understanding.<br><br>So, I thought, maybe it's better that I stay in an old folks home.<br><br>So my son won't have to wipe me up when I lao jio in my pants.<br><br>Instead, maybe it's better that the Little Sisters (some of whom are not so little) wipe me up instead.<br><br>After all they are trained professionals. They certainly look very professional in their tight, tight costumes.<br><br>Especially when they bend over to pick things up.<br><br>Yes, maybe it's for the best that these young nuns are the ones who have to wipe my kukucheow in warm, soapy water whenever I soil myself .<br><br>Lim Peh ka li kong, the suffering I have to endure because of my chewrens' unfilial behaviour.<br><br>-LIM PEH</div>
