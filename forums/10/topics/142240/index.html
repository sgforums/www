            <div class='col-md body'>China has access to more oil and gas. Being a state-owned company, they don't have to be profitable to continue operating.<br><br>This way, China can relax on their imports of oil. Then they can hold the RMB exchange pecked 8.26rmb:1USD.<br><br>The cost of their exports will be artificially low and foreign manufacturers will be asphyxiated to close-down.<br><br>They can increase their foreign exchange reserve by selling the oil/gas reserves Unocal.<br><br>China can gain access to the technology of Unocal.

Besides, it will be geographically cheaper to supply oil to US market from Middle East, Africa and Latin America where EM has oilfields.<br><br>I don't think US will be actually physically taking that much of China's asset. It will be processing more efficiently and definitely more environmentally friendly and safer, compared to current Chinese technology. The majority of the output again will be to sell into Chinese market without having to import and lose the competitive edge which it will due to the high 20-30% import tax. US is only earning trade surplus when it manages to siphon the profits out of China. China is currently having superior trade surplus with US if I'm not wrong.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sooner or later, China will have all the technology secrets US is trying to hide. Many of the high tech agencies in US has Chinese in them. Several of which are getting payments from the Chinese govt for info.<br><br>Engaging the Chinese in dialogue is indeed the only choice as there's no way to prevent it from growing. However with its economic growth, it is also possible it might start flexing its military might. Don't know how much tolerance the central government and the Chinese citizens have. Take Taiwan back by force. Fight Japan off the controversial seas. If US make another wrong move and appear arrogant to the Chinese govt, will they punish USA by supporting North Korea?<br><br>At the one hand US wants to profit from the growth in China but on the other hand, there might be an imbalance of power in Asia. Some of my Chinese colleagues in China was telling me that China should show its millitary might soon to keep US in check. Maybe just idle chit chat but I wonder how prevalent / widespread the feeling and how the people's reactions will influence the central govt's. Only hope that with China opening up, they will also open up their perception of the world outside. Media is still quite biased despite improvements. Will take time, just hope it's in time.<br><br>With take-over of foreign firms by Chinese companies, will the existing business culture prevail or Chinese business culture take over? I know the culture of State enterprises is beyond desire and tons of frustrations because I worked with them before. However, I've not worked with Chinese private companies so I'm not sure.<br><br>Chinese pride is the one that people fear coz sometimes it is beyond reasoning. With 5000yrs of history and culture, the rest of the world are like monkeys. How often have I heard that in China and outside? Americans and Europeans may be very arrogant in the past too but majority of them has far more respect and tolerance for non-nationals than Chinese (especially the youth re the comment by LKY on Chinese young genration).<br><br>I would prefer to have an alternative to trading with China and to see growth in other countries especially in IndoChina, which China is already engaging more aggressively now, and if possible Indonesia and the Philippines if they can haul themselves out from crippling corruption and political instability.</div>
