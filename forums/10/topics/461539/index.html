It was a big day for fans of one of the Founding Fathers of neoliberal/libertarian free-market ideology, and those fans are legion on both sides of the narrow Establishment divide —as Obama’s economy czar Larry Summers <a style="color: red !important;" href="http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2019341_2017103_2016956,00.html">wrote</a> in 2006, “Any honest Democrat will admit that we are all Friedmanites now.”</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 18px; font-size: 18px; line-height: 28px; color: #1a1a1a; font-family: Constantia, 'Lucida Bright', Lucidabright, 'Lucida Serif', Lucida, 'DejaVu Serif', 'Bitstream Vera Serif', 'Liberation Serif', Georgia, serif;">One episode in Milton Friedman’s career not celebrated (or even acknowledged) at last week’s centennial took place in 1946, the same year Friedman began peddling his pro-business “free market economics” ideology.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 18px; font-size: 18px; line-height: 28px; color: #1a1a1a; font-family: Constantia, 'Lucida Bright', Lucidabright, 'Lucida Serif', Lucida, 'DejaVu Serif', 'Bitstream Vera Serif', 'Liberation Serif', Georgia, serif;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">According to Congressional hearings on illegal lobbying activities '46 was the year that Milton Friedman and his U Chicago cohort George Stigler arranged an under-the-table deal with a Washington lobbying executive to pump out covert propaganda for the national real estate lobby in exchange for a hefty payout, the terms of which were never meant to be released to the public.</span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 18px; font-size: 18px; line-height: 28px; color: #1a1a1a; font-family: Constantia, 'Lucida Bright', Lucidabright, 'Lucida Serif', Lucida, 'DejaVu Serif', 'Bitstream Vera Serif', 'Liberation Serif', Georgia, serif;">The arrangement between Friedman and Stigler with the Washington real estate lobbyist was finally revealed during he Buchanan Committee hearings on illegal lobbying activities in 1950. But then it was almost entirely forgotten, including apparently by those celebrating the “Milton Friedman Centennial” last week in Chicago.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 18px; font-size: 18px; line-height: 28px; color: #1a1a1a; font-family: Constantia, 'Lucida Bright', Lucidabright, 'Lucida Serif', Lucida, 'DejaVu Serif', 'Bitstream Vera Serif', 'Liberation Serif', Georgia, serif;">I only came across the revelations about Friedman’s sordid beginnings in the footnotes of an old book on the history of lobbying by former Newsweek book editor <a style="color: red !important;" href="http://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/20/obituaries/karl-schriftgiesser-84-a-former-journalist.html">Karl Schriftgiesser</a>, published in 1951, shortly after the Buchanan Committee hearings ended. The actual details of Milton Friedman’s PR deal are sordid and familiar, with tentacles reaching into our ideologically rotted-out era.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 18px; font-size: 18px; line-height: 28px; color: #1a1a1a; font-family: Constantia, 'Lucida Bright', Lucidabright, 'Lucida Serif', Lucida, 'DejaVu Serif', 'Bitstream Vera Serif', 'Liberation Serif', Georgia, serif;">It starts just after the end of World War Two, when America’s industrial and financial giants, fattened up from war profits, established a new lobbying front group called the Foundation for Economic Education (FEE) that focused on promoting a new pro-business ideology—which it called “libertarianism”— to supplement other business lobbying groups which focused on specific policies and legislation.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 18px; font-size: 18px; line-height: 28px; font-family: Constantia, 'Lucida Bright', Lucidabright, 'Lucida Serif', Lucida, 'DejaVu Serif', 'Bitstream Vera Serif', 'Liberation Serif', Georgia, serif;"><span style="color: #1a1a1a;">The FEE is generally regarded as “the first libertarian think-tank” as</span><em style="color: #1a1a1a;">Reason</em><span style="color: #1a1a1a;">’s Brian Doherty calls it in his book “Radicals For Capitalism: A Freewheeling History of the Modern Libertarian Movement” (2007). </span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">As the Buchanan Committee discovered, the Foundation for Economic Education was the best-funded conservative lobbying outfit ever known up to that time, sponsored by a Who’s Who of US industry in 1946.</span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 18px; font-size: 18px; line-height: 28px; color: #1a1a1a; font-family: Constantia, 'Lucida Bright', Lucidabright, 'Lucida Serif', Lucida, 'DejaVu Serif', 'Bitstream Vera Serif', 'Liberation Serif', Georgia, serif;">A partial list of FEE’s original donors in its first four years includes: The Big Three auto makers GM, Chrysler and Ford; top oil majors including Gulf Oil, Standard Oil, and Sun Oil; major steel producers US Steel, National Steel, Republic Steel; major retailers including Montgomery Ward, Marshall Field and Sears; chemicals majors Monsanto and DuPont; and other Fortune 500 corporations including General Electric, Merrill Lynch, Eli Lilly, BF Goodrich, ConEd, and more.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 18px; font-size: 18px; line-height: 28px; color: #1a1a1a; font-family: Constantia, 'Lucida Bright', Lucidabright, 'Lucida Serif', Lucida, 'DejaVu Serif', 'Bitstream Vera Serif', 'Liberation Serif', Georgia, serif;">The FEE was set up by a longtime US Chamber of Commerce executive named Leonard Read, together with Donaldson Brown, a director in the National Association of Manufacturers lobby group and board member at DuPont and General Motors.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 18px; font-size: 18px; line-height: 28px; color: #1a1a1a; font-family: Constantia, 'Lucida Bright', Lucidabright, 'Lucida Serif', Lucida, 'DejaVu Serif', 'Bitstream Vera Serif', 'Liberation Serif', Georgia, serif;"><em><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">That is how libertarianism started: As an arm of big business lobbying.</span></strong></em></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 18px; font-size: 18px; line-height: 28px; color: #1a1a1a; font-family: Constantia, 'Lucida Bright', Lucidabright, 'Lucida Serif', Lucida, 'DejaVu Serif', 'Bitstream Vera Serif', 'Liberation Serif', Georgia, serif;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Before bringing back Milton Friedman into the picture, this needs to be repeated again: “Libertarianism” was a project of the corporate lobby world, launched as a big business “ideology” in 1946 by The US Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers.</span></strong> The FEE’s board included the future founder of the John Birch Society, Robert Welch; the most powerful figure in the Mormon church at that time, J Reuben Clark, a frothing racist and anti-Semite after whom BYU named its law school; and United Fruit director Herb Cornuelle.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 18px; font-size: 18px; line-height: 28px; font-family: Constantia, 'Lucida Bright', Lucidabright, 'Lucida Serif', Lucida, 'DejaVu Serif', 'Bitstream Vera Serif', 'Liberation Serif', Georgia, serif;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">The purpose of the FEE — and libertarianism, as it was originally created — was to supplement big business lobbying with a pseudo-intellectual, pseudo-economics rationale to back up its policy and legislative attacks on labor and government regulations.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 18px; font-size: 18px; line-height: 28px; color: #1a1a1a; font-family: Constantia, 'Lucida Bright', Lucidabright, 'Lucida Serif', Lucida, 'DejaVu Serif', 'Bitstream Vera Serif', 'Liberation Serif', Georgia, serif;">This background is important in the Milton Friedman story because Friedman is a founder of libertarianism, and because the corrupt lobbying deal he was busted playing a part in was arranged through the Foundation for Economic Education.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 18px; font-size: 18px; line-height: 28px; color: #1a1a1a; font-family: Constantia, 'Lucida Bright', Lucidabright, 'Lucida Serif', Lucida, 'DejaVu Serif', 'Bitstream Vera Serif', 'Liberation Serif', Georgia, serif;">False, whitewashed history is as much a part of the Milton Friedman mythology as it is the libertarian movement’s own airbrushed history about its origins; the 1950 Buchanan Committee hearings expose both as creations of big business lobby groups whose purpose is to deceive and defraud the public and legislators in order to advance the cause of corporate America.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 18px; font-size: 18px; line-height: 28px; color: #1a1a1a; font-family: Constantia, 'Lucida Bright', Lucidabright, 'Lucida Serif', Lucida, 'DejaVu Serif', 'Bitstream Vera Serif', 'Liberation Serif', Georgia, serif;">The story starts like this: In 1946, Herbert Nelson was the chief lobbyist and executive vice president for the National Association of Real Estate Boards, and one of the highest paid lobbyists in the nation. Mr. Nelson’s real estate constituency was unhappy with rent control laws that Truman kept in effect after the war ended. Nelson and his real estate lobby led what investigators discovered was the most formidable and best-funded opposition to President Truman in the post-war years, amassing some $5,000,000 for their lobby efforts—that’s $5mln in 1946 dollars, or roughly $60 million in 2012 dollars.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 18px; font-size: 18px; line-height: 28px; color: #1a1a1a; font-family: Constantia, 'Lucida Bright', Lucidabright, 'Lucida Serif', Lucida, 'DejaVu Serif', 'Bitstream Vera Serif', 'Liberation Serif', Georgia, serif;">So Herbert Nelson contracted out the PR services of the Foundation for Economic Education to concoct propaganda designed to shore up the National Real Estate lobby’s legislative drive — and the propagandists who took on the job were Milton Friedman and his U Chicago cohort, George Stigler.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 18px; font-size: 18px; line-height: 28px; color: #1a1a1a; font-family: Constantia, 'Lucida Bright', Lucidabright, 'Lucida Serif', Lucida, 'DejaVu Serif', 'Bitstream Vera Serif', 'Liberation Serif', Georgia, serif;">To understand the sort of person Herbert Nelson was, here is a letter he wrote in 1949 that Congressional investigators discovered and recorded:</p>
              <blockquote style="padding-top: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 15px; margin: 0px 0px 18px; border-left-width: 5px; border-left-style: solid; border-left-color: #eeeeee; font-size: 18px; line-height: 28px; color: #1a1a1a; font-family: Constantia, 'Lucida Bright', Lucidabright, 'Lucida Serif', Lucida, 'DejaVu Serif', 'Bitstream Vera Serif', 'Liberation Serif', Georgia, serif;">
              <p style="margin-bottom: 18px; font-size: 18px;">"I do not believe in democracy. I think it stinks. I don’t think anybody except direct taxpayers should be allowed to vote. I don’t believe women should be allowed to vote at all. Ever since they started, our public affairs have been in a worse mess than ever."</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 18px; font-size: 18px; line-height: 28px; color: #1a1a1a; font-family: Constantia, 'Lucida Bright', Lucidabright, 'Lucida Serif', Lucida, 'DejaVu Serif', 'Bitstream Vera Serif', 'Liberation Serif', Georgia, serif;">It’s an old libertarian mantra, libertarianism versus democracy, libertarianism versus women’s suffrage; a position most recently repeated by billionaire <a style="color: red !important;" href="http://www.thenation.com/article/166421/ron-paul-wants-abolish-cia-his-largest-donor-builds-toys-it">libertarian Peter Thiel</a> —Ron Paul’s main campaign funder.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 18px; font-size: 18px; line-height: 28px; color: #1a1a1a; font-family: Constantia, 'Lucida Bright', Lucidabright, 'Lucida Serif', Lucida, 'DejaVu Serif', 'Bitstream Vera Serif', 'Liberation Serif', Georgia, serif;">So in 1946, this same Herbert Nelson turned to the Foundation for Economic Education to manufacture some propaganda to <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">help the National Association of Real Estate Boards fight rent control laws.</span></strong> Nelson knew that the founder of the first libertarian think-tank agreed with him on many key points. Such as their contempt and disdain for the American public.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 18px; font-size: 18px; line-height: 28px; color: #1a1a1a; font-family: Constantia, 'Lucida Bright', Lucidabright, 'Lucida Serif', Lucida, 'DejaVu Serif', 'Bitstream Vera Serif', 'Liberation Serif', Georgia, serif;">Leonard Read, the legendary (among libertarians) founder/head of the FEE, argued that the public should not be allowed to know which corporations donated to his libertarian front-group because, he argued, the public could not be trusted to make “sound judgments” with disclosed information:</p>
              <blockquote style="padding-top: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 15px; margin: 0px 0px 18px; border-left-width: 5px; border-left-style: solid; border-left-color: #eeeeee; font-size: 18px; line-height: 28px; color: #1a1a1a; font-family: Constantia, 'Lucida Bright', Lucidabright, 'Lucida Serif', Lucida, 'DejaVu Serif', 'Bitstream Vera Serif', 'Liberation Serif', Georgia, serif;">
              <p style="margin-bottom: 18px; font-size: 18px;">"The public reporting would present a single fact—the amount of a contributor’s donation—to casual readers, persons having only a cursory interest in the matter at issue, persons who would not and perhaps could not possess all the facts.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 18px; font-size: 18px;">These folks of the so-called public thus receive only oversimplifications or half-truths from which only erroneous conclusions are almost certain to be drawn. If there is a public interest in the rightness or wrongness of corporate or personal donations to charitable, religious or education institutions, and I am not at all ready to concede that there is, then that interest should be guarded by some such agency as the Bureau of Internal Revenue, an agency that is in a position to obtain all the facts, not by Mr. John Public who lacks relevant information for the forming of sound judgments...Public reporting of a half-truth is indeed a significant provocation."</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 18px; font-size: 18px; line-height: 28px; color: #1a1a1a; font-family: Constantia, 'Lucida Bright', Lucidabright, 'Lucida Serif', Lucida, 'DejaVu Serif', 'Bitstream Vera Serif', 'Liberation Serif', Georgia, serif;">So in May 1946, Herbert Nelson of the Real Estate lobby, looking for backup in his drive to abolish federal rent control laws, contacted libertarian founder Leonard Read of the FEE with an order for a PR pamphlet “with some such title as ‘The Case against Federal Real Estate Control’,” according to Schriftgiesser’s book <em>The Lobbyists</em>.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 18px; font-size: 18px; line-height: 28px; color: #1a1a1a; font-family: Constantia, 'Lucida Bright', Lucidabright, 'Lucida Serif', Lucida, 'DejaVu Serif', 'Bitstream Vera Serif', 'Liberation Serif', Georgia, serif;">What happened next, I’ll quote from Schriftgiesser:</p>
              <blockquote style="padding-top: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 15px; margin: 0px 0px 18px; border-left-width: 5px; border-left-style: solid; border-left-color: #eeeeee; font-size: 18px; line-height: 28px; color: #1a1a1a; font-family: Constantia, 'Lucida Bright', Lucidabright, 'Lucida Serif', Lucida, 'DejaVu Serif', 'Bitstream Vera Serif', 'Liberation Serif', Georgia, serif;">
              <p style="margin-bottom: 18px; font-size: 18px;">"They were now busily co-operating on the new project which the foundation had engaged Milton Friedman and George J. Stigler to write. It was to be called <em>Roofs and Ceilings</em> and it was to be an outright attack on rent controls.<br>When Nelson received a copy of the manuscript he wrote Read to say, “The pamphlet...is a dandy. <strong>It is just what I wanted</strong>."</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 18px; font-size: 18px; line-height: 28px; color: #1a1a1a; font-family: Constantia, 'Lucida Bright', Lucidabright, 'Lucida Serif', Lucida, 'DejaVu Serif', 'Bitstream Vera Serif', 'Liberation Serif', Georgia, serif;">The National Association of Real Estate Boards was so pleased with Milton Friedman’s made-to-order propaganda that they ordered up 500,000 pamphlets from the FEE, and distributed them throughout the real estate lobby’s vast local network of real estate brokers and agents.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 18px; font-size: 18px; line-height: 28px; color: #1a1a1a; font-family: Constantia, 'Lucida Bright', Lucidabright, 'Lucida Serif', Lucida, 'DejaVu Serif', 'Bitstream Vera Serif', 'Liberation Serif', Georgia, serif;">In libertarianism’s own airbrushed history about itself, the Foundation for Economic Education was a brave, quixotic bastion of libertarian “true believers” doomed to defeat at the all-powerful hands of the liberal Keynsian Leviathan. Here is how Brian Doherty describes the FEE and its chief lobbyist Leonard Read:</p>
              <blockquote style="padding-top: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 15px; margin: 0px 0px 18px; border-left-width: 5px; border-left-style: solid; border-left-color: #eeeeee; font-size: 18px; line-height: 28px; color: #1a1a1a; font-family: Constantia, 'Lucida Bright', Lucidabright, 'Lucida Serif', Lucida, 'DejaVu Serif', 'Bitstream Vera Serif', 'Liberation Serif', Georgia, serif;">
              <p style="margin-bottom: 18px; font-size: 18px;">"[Read] would never explicitly scrape for funds... He never directly asked anyone to give anything, he proudly insisted, and while FEE would sell literature to all comers, it was also free to anyone who asked. His attitude toward money was Zen, sometimes hilariously so. When asked how FEE was doing financially, his favorite reply was, “Just perfectly.”... Read wanted no endowments and frowned on any donation meant to be held in reserve for some future need."</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 18px; font-size: 18px; line-height: 28px; color: #1a1a1a; font-family: Constantia, 'Lucida Bright', Lucidabright, 'Lucida Serif', Lucida, 'DejaVu Serif', 'Bitstream Vera Serif', 'Liberation Serif', Georgia, serif;">And here is what the committee’s own findings reported—findings lost in history:</p>
              <blockquote style="padding-top: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 15px; margin: 0px 0px 18px; border-left-width: 5px; border-left-style: solid; border-left-color: #eeeeee; font-size: 18px; line-height: 28px; color: #1a1a1a; font-family: Constantia, 'Lucida Bright', Lucidabright, 'Lucida Serif', Lucida, 'DejaVu Serif', 'Bitstream Vera Serif', 'Liberation Serif', Georgia, serif;">
              <p style="margin-bottom: 18px; font-size: 18px;">"It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that the Foundation for Economic Education exerts, or at least expects to exert, a considerable influence on national legislative policy....It is equally difficult to imagine that the nation’s largest corporations would subsidize the entire venture if they did not anticipate that it would pay solid, long-range legislative dividends."</p>
              </blockquote>

As the author of The Lobbyists, not knowing who Milton Friedman was at the time, wrote of Friedman’s collaborative effort with Stigler:</p>

Of course, there are no honest Democrats.<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> And there are no honest economists.</span></strong> And these are the people who are framing our politics, the people who have told Greece and Spain they have no choice, and the people who today are making sure that the number one item on Obama’s and Congress’s agenda is cutting Social Security and cutting Medicare and cutting "entitlements" — and the only thing that divides the elites in charge of this mess is “how much of these moochers’ lifelines can we cut?”</p>
