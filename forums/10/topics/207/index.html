You have grudge against that? "We" refering to you in particular i guess have not even bother to check my posts b4 coming down to conclusion that i have never gave any ideas as to what the solutions should be. And please take note as i had said b4, even though there are suggested solutions from a nobody in this countries, do you think the authority will take note? Did they bother to consider abolishing the GST hike plan when you can see so many objections among the populations? Did they bother to survey and ask the pple's opinion in the first place? Check your own status b4 arrowing at your peer. So ultimately, the idea of solutions would be no solutions i guess but to let the national problems escalate to a critical point and became extremely apparent to those who had supported the past policies to understand the need for a big changes in the system so that at least we the citizens are no longer transparent anymore to the authority and can feel comfortably here to treat it a home rather than a hotel.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Of course the bloody GST hike is painful, and nobody likes to pay more taxes. But should the Government abolish it just because the population doesn't like it? Have you considered what are the reasons for the Government increasing the taxes? Sometimes things just have to be done, whether you like it or not. The government has of course anticiopated that an increase in taxes would not go down well with the masses, but on weighing the alternatives, they have decided to press ahead with this tax increase. You've got to respect their decision, after all, they were voted up there by us, and they have done much more studies and researched much more than you could ever do. If this is any consolation, at the very least, any increase in taxes usually goes around and benefits the population, as the money gained is usually spent on public expenditure, and not funneled into corrupt politicians' pockets, like other countries.</div>
