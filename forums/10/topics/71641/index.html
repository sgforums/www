            <div class='col-md body'>WIll giving more maternity leave and more care centers make Singaporeans want to give birth more? We have to weigh the balance, for every action there is an effect.<br><br>More maternity leave will make us less effective and cause more trouble for companies to employ women. Women at interviews are asked are you married, how many kids are you going to have... it will make our women less effective and employable.<br><br>The very obstacle that singaporeans hope back on giving birth is cost. Realize that nowadays, people have to think, I need home at least...  with that gives a person and a couple financial difficulty. This implies, a financial burden to couples, having another mouth to feed is another cost, looking after the child is another social problem let alone another financial burden.<br><br>The benefit of a tax saving of $20k for the second child is geared more of the higher class of the society. IE this tax saving is extended only for 5 years and can only be used to alay tax income.<br><br>The real solution is to tackle cost and at the same time weighing a fine balance. Increasing the subsidy to look after the child and education will help alay the financial burden for a couple.<br><br>My stand is that increasing maternity leave will make women less employable as companies will find it hard to find a replacement during the time of leave.<br><br>Increasing care centres does not alay the costs but increases the cost to run care centres. The solution should be to increase subsidies for child care centres. IE Currently, sending a child to a care centre will cost a couple $600. Sending an infant will cost double. Imagine having 2 childs in a care centre, how much will that cost a couple? This applies to couples who earn a dual income.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>While increasing maternity leave is a good idea, doing just that might fly back in their faces if that is not backed up with refinements in the Employment Act as well as the the government deferring the costs of such a move.<br><br>As have already been pointed out, increasing maternity leave means more pain for employers who lose pregnant staff for longer periods, who might have to pass more work to the other staff, or going to the trouble of hiring and training contract replacements. This might lead employers to be more reluctant to hire married females, or worse female workers as a whole (as far as possible).<br><br>An extension in mandatory maternity leave should be backed up with changes to the employment act to ensure mothers to be are not unfairly dismissed by unscrupulous employers. While difficult to enforce, it would serve as a deterrent to employers from dismissing pregnant staff, as well as a confidence-building measure for working parents to be<br><br>Time for the government to start protecting the workers and working mothers.</div>

I like your breakdown of your expenditure for a primary schooling child, but you forgot to add, child's expenses like food, clothing, toys and medical bills!<br><br>You can easily add another couple of thousand a year.<br><br>Say child's food, breakfast and dinner since lunch is taken in school, thus 2 meals x 5 weekdays + 3 meals x 2 weekends= 16 x $4.5 each meal costing a kids happy meal = $72 per week of meals x 52 weeks in a year = $4032.<br>Lets put it at $4000.<br><br>Now say child's clothing and toys can be put together, say a new set of clothing per month and 1 toy per month= 1 x $20 per set of clothing + 1 x $10 per toy x 12 months = $360<br><br>Now factor in doctor bills, kids get sick quite often, so say once every 3 months the child visits the doctor and needs medicine for the common cold and cough. Avg family doctor bill can be $60 inclusive of medicine x 4 times a year= $240<br><br><span style="color: red;">So adding up all the costs and expenses to raise a primary schooling child with sufficient needs= $2700 + $4032 + $360 + $240 = $7332!!!<br>That works out to be $611 per month!!!<br></span><br><br></div>
