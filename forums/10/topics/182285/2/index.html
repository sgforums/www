Did the judges look at all these.</div></blockquote>In English law, any disobedience or disrespect to the authority or privileges of a legislative body, or interference with the administration of a court of justice constitutes contempt of court. We cannot allow any litigant who is unhappy with the judgment of the court to cast aspersions upon the court, for that would shake the very foundation of civil society.<br><br>Sir Eardley-Wilmot, the Lord Chief Justice of common pleas, is widely regarded to have laid down the law on this issue:<br><br>"To be impartial, and to be universally thought so, are both absolutely necessary for the giving justice, that free, open and uninterrupted current which it has for many ages found all over this kingdom, and which so eminently distinguishes and exalts it above all nations upon the earth. Again, the constitution has provided very apt and proper remedies for correcting and rectifying the involuntary mistakes of judges, and for punishing and removing them for any perversion of justice. But if their authority is to be trampled on by pamphleteers and news-writers, and the people are to be told that the power given to the judges for their protection is prostituted to their destruction, the court may retain its power some little time, but I ant sure it will eventually lose all its authority.<br><br>The object of the discipline enforced by the court by proceedings for contempt of court is not now, if it ever was, to vindicate the personal dignity of the judges or to protect them from insult as individuals, but to vindicate the dignity and authority of the court itself and to prevent acts tending to obstruct the due course of justice..."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sorry to jab in. Rule of law should have been more concisely and accountably defined in court before it can administer justice for the benefit of all citizens.<br><br>If it is defined, in the constitutions or specific acts of parliament on cases of disputes involving contempts of courts and defamations, everyone will benefit including politicians, judges and the government as follows:-<br><br>(1) it will level the unspoken powerful playing field to a more balanced and equitable pro-citizens and pro-democracy mass-participation playing field.<br><br>(2) it will prevent self-centredness in running of the country by anyone at the helm in wanting to have his or her hidden power obeyed in the courts or judges.<br><br>(3) the judges will be able to dispense justices in courts equitably to all irrespective of power but according to accountable and transparent justice and principle recognised by all men.<br><br>(4) the judges do not have to look the other way like in the old NKF defamation suits when they preferred to ignore the whistle blowers' case no matter how strong while influenced by powerful political wishes or policies of the day with patron calling NKF CEO's $600 K salary as peanut etc. We cannot ignore the fact that judges do pay attention to politicians' utterances in public which finally serve as powerful constraints on their decisions. At the earlier time, NKF was riding high and ministers were seen as supporting every thing Durai was doing as Durai was playing to the political agenda of the government namely using the public charity donations and building of larger reserve so as to lessen dependency on use of public fund for kidney treatments.<br><br>(5) politicians will not have to slog it out with one another trying to use the court as weapons in unpleasant civil defamation suits to grapple with one another in perpetual power plays.<br><br>(6) the judges will not need to serve the unspoken wishes of men at the helm which benefit no one except pride or narrow political agenda of the day. Justice should belong to and be accessible to each and every citizen and not dictated by such powerful influences on judges' mind behind the scene. CSJ or JBJ had no choice but to confront the court due to such poweful forces at work behind judges' mind.<br><br>Unspoken powerful political wishes changes according to new situation and new demands e.g. leadership changes and upcoming election so judges also have to read between the line of ministers' speeches so it now know that it is against public conscience to build high reserves while ignoring patient's subsidy or plight and now ruled differently in the new NKF situation so that Durai is now wrong in the NKF/SPH case reversing the previous influences from ministers utterances of the past on the same matter.<br><br>This is how the courts have to contend with - unspoken powerful wishes and policies of the power that be.<br><br>So it is in the interest of good corporate governance and future of the country to adopt rule of law approach to make every party pay due respect to law as it stands and not have to obey wishes of powerful personages in running of the country.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There are 2 types of judges:<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Subordinate Courts Judges (Magistrates, District Court, Coroner's Court, Family Court, Juvenile Court)</span><br>These judges are appointed by the President upon the recommendation of the Chief Justice. They may be promoted within the ranks of the Subordinate Courts (Magistrate -&gt; District Judge -&gt; Senior District Judge) and may be removed at any time, just like any other civil servant.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Supreme Court Justices (High Court, Court of Appeal)</span><br>These people are appointed by the President upon the recommendation of the Prime Minister. They CANNOT be removed from office before their retirement age. In order to remove a sitting Supreme Court Justice, the government will have to pass an Act in Parliament and must fully justify the reasons for the removal to the members of parliament.<br><br>This is as far as i understand.</div>
