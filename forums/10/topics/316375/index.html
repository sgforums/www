              <p>Best example of Singapore's so called FT policy:</p>
              <p>Import FT athletes still cannot capture high ranking tournaments in badminton and table tennis. Unlike Malaysian LOCAL born squash queen WORLD no 1 (2006-2007, 2007-current) Nicol David and <strong>badminton queen Wong Mei Chew who beat ALL OF THE CHINA's A TEAM Top Three IN CHINA 2007.

              <p>Why dont lure these TRULY Top Talents from up North and offer them the super salaries the Ministers command instead. They can be considered as WORLD-Class.</p>

              <p>Actually would be THIRD or Fourth Team. But you dont import a whole lot of them for them NOT to win. Otherwise why bother? Can stick with the local team which I would be happy to support even if they dont win.</p>
              <p>The logical thing that should be done instead was to woo the FT top Coaches instead...but what to do?</p>

              <p>No problem with the FT (SIA Malaysian CEO) that made such contribution - but are they paid as handsomely as the jokers?</p>
              <p>I would like to know what is the current SIA CEO etc Singapore FT CEOs are being paid...In fact if THEY (the <strong>FEW FT,</strong> out of the many, who made the billions) want to replace the jokers I have no problem either. At the very least, you have a track record in the (semi)private sector.</p>
              <p>I am still fundamentally opposed to state capitalism though and majority of PAP's FT policy is as above-mentioned athletes...</p>

              <p>No problem with the FT (SIA Malaysian CEO) that made such

              FT CEOs are being paid...In fact if THEY (the <strong>FEW
              FT,</strong> out of the many, who made the billions) want to
              replace the jokers I have no problem either. At the very least, you
              have a track record in the (semi)private sector.</p>

              <p>Mew Choo is not all conquering. She lacked consistency at the world level. The Chinese are still too strong for her.</p>
              <p>However, being born and groomed in Malaysia, I think she's pretty darn good.</p>
              <p>FT sportsmen is not all that bad. Malaysia also took in some China athletes, but because the money is not as attractive, they are not as good or prominant. Countries like US, France, etc. also have foreigner representing their countries like badminton and table tennis. However, they are not showered with monetary incentives. Singapore's must ranked as one of the very best in terms of rewarding its elite athletes.</p>
              <p>Outside of sailing and bowling, Singapore is over-represented by these so-called FTs. In football, at least half of the 1st 11 is not Singaporean. It is no wonder I don't even watch the national team play on telly, let alone troop down to the stadium. Just like everything else, Singapore tries to buy success, even in sports when LKY effectively killed the Singapore sports soul in the 70's by overemphasizing the `sports for all' culture instead of `sports excellence'. Is it any wonder that Singapore is now trying to catch up of lost grounds since there is economic benefits to be gained?</p>
              <p>You just have to looked at the athletes who left after they have either proven to be successful or otherwise. The much louded brazilian, egmar gonzales, ripped up his singapore passport after his used by dates nears. he realized he cannot milk anymore monies in singapore after his playing days. he's now happily settled back home. for the rest who are less successful, like the much publicised discuss thrower fiasco, those left after they are proven to be dud. the jury is still out there for people like li jiawei. i won't bet against her returning to china with her $millions when she retires. there's nothing in it for her. shanghai is a better shopping paradize to suit her insatiable habit to shop.</p>
              <p>the singapore methods of using money to buy success in sports overwhelmingly cast long shadows over whether these foreign sportsmen do it for the country or for their own pockets. </p>

              <p>"Singapore's must ranked as one of the very best in terms of rewarding its elite athletes."</p>
              <p>Non commercial you mean. "Elite athletes" lol. More importantly other countries dont import as MANY as Singapore.</p>
              <p>"Mew Choo is not all conquering. She lacked consistency at the world level. The Chinese are still too strong for her."</p>
              <p>True but what she had done is truly amazing in 2007. Can you imagine going to China (home crowd advantage) and beating ALL three of their best players (which also be the worlds' top 3)?</p>
              <p>To me, it would be like Singapore Football Team go to England and beat Chelsea, Man U and Arsenal. Unprecedented and nearly impossible. But SHE did it. Its a WORLD class great accomplishment even if it is for 1 tournament.</p>
              <p>Nicol David is more consistent - shes been WORLD number one for some time now (with a break in between).</p>
              <p>I am sorry if I am not politically correct, but I dont consider bowling and snooker "sports". (Something that requires cardiovascular effort is my defintion of a sport) </p>
