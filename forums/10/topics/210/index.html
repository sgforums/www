Giving away Juipter???? That I can't understand. Juipter is a good ship with decent side scan sonar. It can be effectively converted to become a backup minesweeper/mine hunter. Why give up a good ship like that? Does Singapore has too much to be given away just like that? Is there a deeper political motive for such a thingy?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Most of the Indonesian politicians who attack us verbally are usually on their own agenda and do not have the support of the wider public of the government for the matter. These guys are playign up to their own conservative religous segment of the public. Relations on a govermental and militaty level, especially the latter are still extremely close, and I do feel that its much stronger than both countries relationship with our northern neighbour. (There I go stating the obvious again)<br><br>Make no mistake, ABRI is not a force to be tampered with over there, no matter what the politicians say, or would like to believe. If we're in ABRI's good books, our relationship with Indonesia would be sound.

Malaysia only has 26 tanks, and LIGHT ones at that (Stingrays is it?) , as of 2000, and I dont think the numbers has changed any during the past two years. (of course, the situation will change when Malaysia receives her PT-91s) Malaysia does however, have a substantial no. of AFVs, about 1200.</div>
