There were still guys back there, Perino and others! He beat frantically on the shoulders of the APC driver, screaming at him, "ive got guys still out there!" but the MALAY driver had a tanker helmet on and acted like he didn't hear Steele and just kept on driving. The captain got on the command net. Reception was so bad inside the carrier that he could barely hear a respond, but he broadcast his alarm in disjointed phrase: -We got left back on National...The Paki vehicle were gonna follow us home, the foot soldier...but we loaded up..but we had probably fifteen or twenty still had to walk. They took off and left us. We need somebody to get down there and pick them up.<br>-Roger, i understand, Harrell had answered. I thought everybody was loaded.I got about three calls. They were telling me they were loaded. Where are they pn National?<br>-Romeo, this is Juliet. Im sending this blind.I need those soldier picked up on National ASAP!<br>In fact, Perino and the others had been picked up, but not without some trouble. The lieutenent and about six other men, Rangers and some D-boys, were the last ones on the street when what looked like the last vehicles approached. The exhausted soldiers shouted and waved but the MALAYSIAN driver paid him them no mind until one of the D-boys stepped out and leveled a CAR-15 at him. He stopped. They just piled in on top of the other men already jammed inside.<br><br>u call this involvement in real war??<br>acting blur when u suppose to rescue soldier??<br>hai...tsk tsk tsk pathtic gutless piece of shit..<br><br></div></blockquote></div>

Its was only when the fire intensified did they start takin hits.<br><br>In anycase, no doubt, MAF units have been underfire in Mogadishu.  That is rather irrefutable.  Their APCs were there to help evacuate the Rangers and Delta.   AK-47s pinged their vehicles, yes.  Question is, did they retaliate?  Were they direct combatants?  Have they involved themselves in situations where THEY were the enemies?  Communist insurgency?  The soldiers fighting that war are probably dead by now.  Combat Experience? Pui!

            <div class='col-md body'>yah... it will still be coming strong at u if u throw stones at it... and its pretty resistant towards small arms fire =P which really isn't saying much for a light tank...<br><br>so yeah... its crap. Its main gun's too small to be effective, its armour is too light to be survivable and its engine is not very powerful... ever saw one get caught in triple-con wire but that could be cos they use crap machines to train.<br><br>It was a good deterrent 10, 15 years ago, but its just sitting duck and an armoured coffin on tracks by today's standards.</div>

Also need to train the man + reservist, will take them quite some time to become proficient and operational. So wun be so fast.<br><br>Invincible?...nah. Nothing is certain in war...must see the top brass how they utilise the assets. But we will make it a very tough fight for anybody who tries.</div>
