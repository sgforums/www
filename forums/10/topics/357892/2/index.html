              <p>I would like to comment on the future problem I foresee based on an assumption which is the opposition supporter population grows to &gt; 33% but the number of opposition voice remains at 3 out of 84 or reduced to 2 , if one of the 3 no longer will be able to serve.</p>
              <p>When or if this happens, I foresee a problem.</p>
              <p>This problem that i foresee can be understood with commonsense and that is a possible Under-Representation of the Alternative Nationals - those who support the Alternative party.</p>
              <p>As of now, based on commonsense and kindergarten mathematics ,</p>
              <p>Currently, 33% of the electorate is being represented only by a mere 3 voices whereas the 66% are represented by 81 voices, which coincidentally 'at times' may be quite uniform in opinion prolly due to 'great' minds thinking alike   ;)  .</p>
              <p>My question is , is there under-representation? </p>
              <p>Is it the ideal situation for the 33% of the last election?</p>
              <p>What about going forward? Will the Alternative nationals be equitably or well represented?</p>
              <p>This 33% as it now stands are also humans. they a have parents who gave birth to them and they themselves also have real emotions , needs , children and contributed to this nation.</p>
              <p>So, while I foresee a problem, I hope it may never become a problem.</p>
              <p>While singaporeans are not perfect in my opinion, they should have the right to learn about nation building. I hope they not be self-centered and spare a thought for their fellow nationals so as to achieve (or maintain) equality, justice and progress for our nation.</p>

              <p>What I am curious to know has been</p>
              <p>, as i have heard about water desalination, purification, reverse osmosis and other ways to produce water long long ago from the west, is the technology used here imported from ang mores or is it invented by singaporean?</p>
              <p>If it is from the west or elsewhere, then are we not lucky ? could we have gotten water without foreign technology ? Maybe there was innovation but is the base or fundamental principles and technology developed 1st in the west?</p>
              <p>So, with money , anyone can duplicate this water generator?</p>
              <p>aiyoyo, i got so many questions.</p>

              <p>We all know that since the new policy to swell SG population to 4-6 million takes place, our country is starting to flood with all sort of people.<br><br>I respect the idea as to treat all people here equally, as friends or as citizens of Singapore. But i think there are quite a lot of new problems occurring here and there, where our mps or important people who drives and sit high up there may have missed it. The prblem stems from the neglect of locals and not enough is done to preserve their integrity. Local conditions need to be preserved when new external conditions are implemented , invcase these new conditions do not work in the long term future, we have something to fall back on.</p>
              <p>1. Health Issue<br>As we know people from some country do not bathe often, or some NEVER bathe at all. It's a major issue in our country if due to bad hygiene alot of disease can spread much faster and easier. As we know many new and deadly diseases are going around these days like SARS and Swine Flu. it s because people from other genetic backgrpunds come into the country and all of a sudden we have a larger genetic portfolio which can harbour the mutation of Influenza - like viruses</p>
              <p>2. Bicycle Issue<br>It's a deadlock as on our pedestrian walk way to be shared with the bicycles.<br>I am living in Sengkang, and every evening time there will be lots of bicycles rushing down the pedestrian walk way. Maybe it's a trend to ring and speed the bicycle in china? I can see danger to alot of people, especially those old folks and young children. Imagine you are carrying two huge bags of grocery from NTUC, going back home on foot. And the bicycle keep ringing their bells and scold u for not giving way to them, and forced u out of the pedestrian walk way.....</p>
              <p>3. NS issue</p>
              <p>There are already signs that FT are fleeing the country using Singapore passport as a stepping stone to Australia, US and UK. Who will be left to defend the country when the local population birth rate runs out.</p>
              <p>4. Social harmony</p>
              <p>There are already sings that locals and foreigners and not intermingling with one another and keeping to their own groups.</p>

              <p><br>One question, has any Singaporeans or yourself been persecuted by the foreigners?</p>
              <p>If not, why do we condemn the foreigners like we're a bunch of useless mob?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Is it because most Singaporeans realised that they were never truly united with one another in the first place?</p>
              <p>And they are somehow beginning to feel threatened when they see people from other countries uniting with one another when they are in Singapore?</p>
              <p>Plain jealousy or unable to accept the facts?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The truth is, if Singaporeans are unable to tolerate one another and live peacefully in unity, it doesn't really matters at all whether the foreigners are flooding in or not.</p>
              <p>If we were united as Singaporeans, do you think we will care how many foreigners are entering the country?</p>
              <p>I think not. You all are just plain stupid. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>What I am curious to know has been</p>
              <p>, as i have heard about water desalination, purification, reverse osmosis and other ways to produce water long long ago from the west, is the technology used here imported from ang mores or is it invented by singaporean?</p>
              <p>If it is from the west or elsewhere, then are we not lucky ? could we have gotten water without foreign technology ? Maybe there was innovation but is the base or fundamental principles and technology developed 1st in the west?</p>
              <p>So, with money , anyone can duplicate this water generator?</p>
              <p>aiyoyo, i got so many questions.</p>

              <p>SG invention? i think more like perfecting technologies and intergrate them successfully.  </p>
              <p>When you look at invention you have to take a simple empircal observation where are the invention of the 20th century and what kind of social structure did it came from. Is not just invention alone, but able to transfer the knowledge to benefit  the mass.</p>
              <p>Today, whatever you see in SG is a product of speedy learning and apply what we learned. and adapting. SG is simply good at adapting.    </p>
              <p>All the so call progress is simply by "adapting" able to intergrate technology</p>

              <p><br>One question, has any Singaporeans or yourself been persecuted by the foreigners?</p>

              <p>Is it because most Singaporeans realised that they were never truly united with one another in the first place?</p>
              <p>And they are somehow beginning to feel threatened when they see people from other countries uniting with one another when they are in Singapore?</p>
