              <p>We all know that since the new policy to swell SG population to 4-6 million takes place, our country is starting to flood with all sort of people.<br><br>I respect the idea as to treat all people here equally, as friends or as citizens of Singapore. But i think there are quite a lot of new problems occurring here and there, where our mps or important people who drives and sit high up there may have missed it. The prblem stems from the neglect of locals and not enough is done to preserve their integrity. Local conditions need to be preserved when new external conditions are implemented , invcase these new conditions do not work in the long term future, we have something to fall back on.</p>
              <p>1. Health Issue<br>As we know people from some country do not bathe often, or some NEVER bathe at all. It's a major issue in our country if due to bad hygiene alot of disease can spread much faster and easier. As we know many new and deadly diseases are going around these days like SARS and Swine Flu. it s because people from other genetic backgrpunds come into the country and all of a sudden we have a larger genetic portfolio which can harbour the mutation of Influenza - like viruses</p>
              <p>2. Bicycle Issue<br>It's a deadlock as on our pedestrian walk way to be shared with the bicycles.<br>I am living in Sengkang, and every evening time there will be lots of bicycles rushing down the pedestrian walk way. Maybe it's a trend to ring and speed the bicycle in china? I can see danger to alot of people, especially those old folks and young children. Imagine you are carrying two huge bags of grocery from NTUC, going back home on foot. And the bicycle keep ringing their bells and scold u for not giving way to them, and forced u out of the pedestrian walk way.....</p>
              <p>3. NS issue</p>
              <p>There are already signs that FT are fleeing the country using Singapore passport as a stepping stone to Australia, US and UK. Who will be left to defend the country when the local population birth rate runs out.</p>
              <p>4. Social harmony</p>
              <p>There are already sings that locals and foreigners and not intermingling with one another and keeping to their own groups.</p>

              <p>- More locals leaving the land cos foreign talents and quitters are more valued here. The local that contributed are deem as invisible and blamed for all mistakes.</p>
              <p>- More foreign talents coming as the foreign talent have seen a weakness in the poodle system (where mindless scholars are in position with no real job capabilities and eventually getting pension and directorship upon retirement). Where else in the world are fools paid millions and rewarded in retirement for being a incapable and yes man.</p>
              <p>- Drastic drop in all level of public services. It is eventual that the service standard of passing the blame and never doing the actual work (wayang) have improved over the years. If no one dies, then no actions is required as there will be no points scored.</p>
              <p>- More acts of in-subordination in NS. We have already seen cases of students throwing all sorts of stuff at the teachers recently. When they are enrolled in the army, the instructors will expect more discipline issues as these kids are brought up by maid and with parents not caring for them.</p>
              <p>- More vices. We already have a full house of "visitors" working in geylang. With the arrival of the casinos, the vice trade will flourish.</p>
              <p>- More social problems. The HDB flat is getting more and more foreign tenants due to the relaxed control. Due to the different in culture and dis-unitedness of the local, there will be more cases of resident conflicts with the new immigrants. The poodle will have their hands full.</p>
              <p>- More suicide. With the endless pursuits of wealth and greed, the morality of the society will deeply handicapped. All of the people will be more selfish and greedy. Those that have left behind will not be able to handle the phase and cruelty. Coupled with failure, there will be more cases of suicide for people who cannot move ahead.</p>
              <p>Every thing have a price.</p>

              <p>We all know that since the new policy to swell SG population to 4-6 million takes place, our country is starting to flood with all sort of people.<br><br>I respect the idea as to treat all people here equally, as friends or as citizens of Singapore. But i think there are quite a lot of new problems occurring here and there, where our mps or important people who drives and sit high up there may have missed it. The prblem stems from the neglect of locals and not enough is done to preserve their integrity. Local conditions need to be preserved when new external conditions are implemented , invcase these new conditions do not work in the long term future, we have something to fall back on.</p>
              <p>1. Health Issue<br>As we know people from some country do not bathe often, or some NEVER bathe at all. It's a major issue in our country if due to bad hygiene alot of disease can spread much faster and easier. As we know many new and deadly diseases are going around these days like SARS and Swine Flu. it s because people from other genetic backgrpunds come into the country and all of a sudden we have a larger genetic portfolio which can harbour the mutation of Influenza - like viruses</p>
              <p>2. Bicycle Issue<br>It's a deadlock as on our pedestrian walk way to be shared with the bicycles.<br>I am living in Sengkang, and every evening time there will be lots of bicycles rushing down the pedestrian walk way. Maybe it's a trend to ring and speed the bicycle in china? I can see danger to alot of people, especially those old folks and young children. Imagine you are carrying two huge bags of grocery from NTUC, going back home on foot. And the bicycle keep ringing their bells and scold u for not giving way to them, and forced u out of the pedestrian walk way.....</p>
              <p>3. NS issue</p>
              <p>There are already signs that FT are fleeing the country using Singapore passport as a stepping stone to Australia, US and UK. Who will be left to defend the country when the local population birth rate runs out.</p>
              <p>4. Social harmony</p>
              <p>There are already sings that locals and foreigners and not intermingling with one another and keeping to their own groups.</p>

              <p>The Ultimate solutions</p>
              <p>1. Stop them from sleeping with chicken n sow. I am sure that bird flu is from chicken (whether from geyland or migration birds). Pigs are dirty so sleeping with sow will eventually cause swine flu. (whether human stupid or lazy enough to consider as pig)</p>
              <p>2. Licence the bicycles so any1 can make a police report. setup speed trap and heavy fine for speeding. (inline with gahmen policies - make more money)</p>
              <p>3.deport them if they cannot produce results within a time frame. if they used sinagpore as a stepping stone - impose heavy penalty (inline with gahmen policies again - make more money)</p>
              <p>4. inter-marriage with FT to evolve to SFT ( singapore fabian talent)</p>
