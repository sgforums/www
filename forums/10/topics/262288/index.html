            <div class='col-md body'><br>Seriously, I think they have used up people's CPF money and need more time to replace it...<br><br><strong>Withdrawal age of CPF Minimum Sum may be raised to 65<br>Posted: 20 June 2007 1659 hrs </strong><br><br>SINGAPORE: The age when a person is allowed to withdraw the CPF Minimum Sum could be raised from 62 to 65 in the near future.<br><br>This is one suggestion by Minister-in-charge of ageing issues, Mr Lim Boon Heng, who has just returned from a study trip to Japan.<br><br>Under the law, CPF withdrawal is tied to the prevalent retiring age. So if the retiring age is raised, then the CPF drawdown age would be raised as well.<br><br>In May, a tripartite committee studying the issue of employing older workers in an ageing workforce said hiring older workers beyond the age of 62 would become part of Singapore's employment laws within the next five years.<br><br>To cope with an ageing population, Japan and some European countries are already raising the age at which national pensions are paid out to 65 and beyond.<br><br>By 2013, all Japanese will not be able to draw out their national pensions until they are 65.<br><br>Singapore may follow-suit, with its CPF system. That is because the average life expectancy of the elderly is now 82. So Singaporeans need to think about how to stretch their savings.<br><br>Mr Lim said: "I think it is quite reasonable to raise it to 65, if our objective is to raise the employment rate of this group of people, but I think we should do so cautiously.<br><br>"So we should make employment happen. We should not leave people in a situation where they can't get a job and yet the minimum sum drawdown age is raised. So we must first make sure... that the employment rate [is] going up."<br><br>The government is already getting employers and employees to negotiate terms of re-employment, once the worker hits the retirement age at 62.<br><br>Extending this retirement age is not a law yet, as the government first wants to explore what types of issues will crop up and how they can be resolved.<br><br>In Japan, the reemployment law states that the employer is obliged to offer a job to someone who has reached the age of 60 until he is 65.<br><br>But how this is done is open to discussion. For example, employers can pay the worker less, or arrange for another job for the worker.<br><br>And the Japanese government is now thinking of raising the retirement age to beyond 70.<br><br>It has even set a target of 90 per cent employment for those aged 60 to 65 by the year 2030.<br><br>Currently, 52.6 per cent of Japanese in this age group are employed.<br><br>In Singapore, this figure is 41.9 per cent.<br><br>During his study trip, Minister Lim also visited nursing homes and day care centres in Japan.<br><br>Many of the elderly in these centres are subsidised by a long-term care insurance implemented by the state seven years ago.<br><br>But since it kicked in, financial outlay grew from S$45 billion to S$87 billion last year.<br><br>So it is becoming clear to the Japanese that this is unsustainable.<br><br>Mr Lim said such an example showed that the responsibility of caring for the old, should not rest on the state.<br><br>"As the Japanese are realising, it is the family that should look after the old and it is the community that should support the family to look after the old. This is the lowest cost option for any society," said Mr Lim.<br><br>And to help families, Singapore could take a leaf from Japan's example, where there are courses for caregivers, who also have a support network.<br><br>Mr Lim is also against giving state funding to these caregivers.<br><br>In Japan, families cannot claim from the long-term care insurance when they stay home themselves to look after the elderly, but they can claim if they hire external help.<br><br>"This is a choice which people have to make based on their set of values. And the set of values that I would like to maintain and promote is that it is the duty of the family to look after its old.<br><br>"Payment to family members breaks that link and I think it would cheapen the care that the family members give to their old if we equate that with payment," said Mr Lim.<br><br>Also, there is already the Eldershield plan, which allows the individual or his family to decide what to do with the payouts.<br><br>As for singles, Mr Lim said there are provisions made for them, such as the building of studio apartments.<br><br>But as far as possible, he wants to encourage even singles to live in their own homes, and better still with their families. - CNA/yy<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>funny how when gahmen use a example of another country like japan to follow suit in the increase of the withdrawal of the cpf.. is the japan or even korean system similar to s'pore? or has the gahmen forgotten that japan has a fairly large population.. ten times larger than s'pore so they is a justification for their gahmen to be raising the retirement age so that the aging population will not eat too much into the state budget.....but s'pore? i dun understand his justification even if we might not see the increase cpf age withdrawal limit in the near future, but to blabber it out after his trip to japan just shows exactly why he was there and what he has learnt.. aren't they the highest paid ministers oredi and they have to learn from japan whos ministers are paid 1/5 of their salary....makes u wonder just how 'capable' they make themselves out to be with their million dollar salary.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

However, it's important to draw a distinction between such pensions and the conniving CPF locals here are subjected to. For those state pensions mentioned, beneficiaries basically receive a periodical (usually monthly) stipend (through public funding) from the pension-eligible age to the last day of their lives. In essence, if by some elixir you have the means to live till 200 in the UK or the nordic countries, the pension effectively safeguards your living allowance for the rest of your lifetime - <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-style: italic;">all funded by the state</span></span>.<br><br>In this regime's context, however, whatever cash you have in your CPF account when you're 62 (or whatever age this regime eventually determines to be eligible for a local to withdraw his savings from his CPF) is rightfully <strong>yours</strong>. In essence, this regime is paying your monthly stipends with <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-style: italic;">your own money</span></span></strong> till the day <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-style: italic;">your savings</span></span></strong> run out (or your death, depending on which event occurs first). By the same comparison, if you lived till 200 and your savings run out when you turn 100, you're left to fend for yourself for the next century.<br><br>In light of the contrast, I find it laughable the nonsensical scheme run by this regime could even be remotely compared to pensions. After all, if someone were to extort money from you on the pretext of wanting to take care of you and dished out monthly stipends of his loot (which is effectively yours to begin with) in return, you would hardly associate such an act with philantrophy, would you?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If this is the election year, it is doubtful Minister Lim Boon Heng dare to be too smart to propose such further postponement of retirement.<br><br>Postponing from 55 to 62 was as if not bad enough.

How many people can be like him with so many millions not having to worry about getting the long-awaited nesteggs.<br><br>This goes to show that ministers and MPs nowadays have completely lost touch with reality because they are not the party affected by needs and necessity at 55.</div>

By following Japan it benefits them!!!<br><br>Quote:  "Mr Lim said such an example showed that the responsibility of caring for the old, should not rest on the state".   Lim said this because this is what the cold blooded, arrogant LEE HSIEN LOONG has been telling us that he is not making Singapore a welfare state.<br><br>Young people already having problems getting employed, what more about the elderly?  Use your brain, Mr Lim and Lee Hsien Loong, please put your brain to good use and not mere use your brain to think of how to satisfy your own needs and desires only.  WE singaporeans have got enough of nuisance from you.<br><br>As for Mr Lim, you think it is easy to get employed in Singapore.  Please be kind to put yourself in our shoes.  If you people as our gahmen refuse to do things to help us and meet our needs, we don't need you as our govt.  By the way Eldershield is just crap, crap, not of much benefit to the majority.<br><br>Damn downright sickening and selfcentred gahmen and PM we have in Singapore.  They don't they refuse to follow examples of countries looking after the welfare of elderly BECAUSE IT DOES NOT BENEFIT THEM.   IF THE SICKENING ARROGANT TOAD LEE HSIEN LOONG FOLLOWS THE WEST TO TAKE CARE OF THE ELDELY, HE KNOWS MAY BE HE WON'T BE ABLE TO DRAW SUPER HIGH PAY.  So for his selfish motive, he keeps telling us he is not making S'pore a welfare state.<br><br>REally time to kick these selfcentred, arrogant gahmen out!!! Bring in new blood to rule Singapore!!<br><br>SINCE LEE HSIEN LOONG TOOK OVER AS PM, there have been far too many craps from him.  We have enough!!!!
