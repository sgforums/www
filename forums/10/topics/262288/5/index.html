            <div class='col-md body'>Their plans is perfect, They can still be senior ministers after 65 years old and draw more salaries in the future and enjoy life. We have to work with low salaries and pay for the high cost of living and pay more to the CPF for another few years. So they will not need to help us anymore with that useless funds ( with no change in their gross salaries requirement) to get to help the poor or the elderly. So talented and clever.</div>

How they budget their funds to last them through their remaining years is none of the PAPÂ’s business.<br><br>Worse, with the way the political system is what's to stop the PAP from raising the withdrawal age to 70 and beyond?<br><br>Think about it: The elderly are told that they have to continue to work Â– and for less pay, the GST is raised to 7 percent, hospitals and polyclinics raise their charges and now the withdrawal of the CPF savings is further pushed back.<br><br>With a government like this, who needs robbers?<br><br>This continual change of the withdrawal age coupled with the Minimum Sum Scheme, which allows the Government to return the savings to retirees in small monthly instalments, effectively means that Singaporeans will never fully get back their savings.<br><br>This has a pernicious side-effect. Seeing that the Government has no intention of returning their CPF savings, Singaporeans will resort to using whatever funds they have in their Ordinary CPF Accounts to pay for their HDB mortgages.<br><br>In other words, the sizes of their flats they buy will depend on the size of the monthly CPF contributions, not on whether they can afford it.<br><br>As it is Singaporeans are already putting in a worryingly high percentage of their income into housing, not by choice it should be added, compared to people in other countries. This leaves them little or no savings for retirement.<br><br>Of course the Government loves such an arrangement, it further engorges the its already corpulent pockets.<br><br>A recent survey conducted by the AXA Insurance Group revealed that while Singaporeans are the worldÂ’s biggest savers, they have the least amount of funds for retirement. Now we know where all the money is going to.<br><br>With a system as opaque and unaccountable as the one that presently exists, continuing to allow the PAP to retain our CPF savings is a dangerous arrangement. It is, however, one made in authoritarian heaven.<br><br>The people need to fight back.<br><br>Chee Soon Juan<br>Secretary-General<br>Singapore Democratic Party<br></strong></div></blockquote><strong><span style="color: darkred;">It is a shame that all the MPs that were elected into Parliament by Singaporeans - in May 2006 - will not speak the truth as it is.<br><br>In his characteristic way of speaking the truth of the matter as it stands - it is amazing that there are still Singaporeans who believe that CSJ is still a publicity stunt, even when having been bankrupted by the MIW, driven to jail, derided for his amateurish zeal, <span style="font-style: italic;">''fixed up''</span> as a cheat for some S$20 postage and some S$14 taxi fare,  and what more that the MIW is planning for CSJ so as to remove the thorn from the bottom of their pants.<br><br>With JBJ and CSJ in Parliament to back-up LTK and Sylvia Lim, CST can continue drinking coffee with the MIW, or go into deep sleep sitting in Parliament. </span><br><br></strong></div>
