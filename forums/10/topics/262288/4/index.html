Any inconvience caused by such protests are usually minimised because of that.<br><br>Maybe the Singapore government should let up on it's rules with non-violent protests and hear the voices of people for once.

How they budget their funds to last them through their remaining years is none of the PAPÂ’s business.<br><br>Worse, with the way the political system is what's to stop the PAP from raising the withdrawal age to 70 and beyond?<br><br>Think about it: The elderly are told that they have to continue to work Â– and for less pay, the GST is raised to 7 percent, hospitals and polyclinics raise their charges and now the withdrawal of the CPF savings is further pushed back.<br><br>With a government like this, who needs robbers?<br><br>This continual change of the withdrawal age coupled with the Minimum Sum Scheme, which allows the Government to return the savings to retirees in small monthly instalments, effectively means that Singaporeans will never fully get back their savings.<br><br>This has a pernicious side-effect. Seeing that the Government has no intention of returning their CPF savings, Singaporeans will resort to using whatever funds they have in their Ordinary CPF Accounts to pay for their HDB mortgages.<br><br>In other words, the sizes of their flats they buy will depend on the size of the monthly CPF contributions, not on whether they can afford it.<br><br>As it is Singaporeans are already putting in a worryingly high percentage of their income into housing, not by choice it should be added, compared to people in other countries. This leaves them little or no savings for retirement.<br><br>Of course the Government loves such an arrangement, it further engorges the its already corpulent pockets.<br><br>A recent survey conducted by the AXA Insurance Group revealed that while Singaporeans are the worldÂ’s biggest savers, they have the least amount of funds for retirement. Now we know where all the money is going to.<br><br>With a system as opaque and unaccountable as the one that presently exists, continuing to allow the PAP to retain our CPF savings is a dangerous arrangement. It is, however, one made in authoritarian heaven.<br><br>The people need to fight back.<br><br>Chee Soon Juan<br>Secretary-General<br>Singapore Democratic Party<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hello? NTUC support workers? Are you dreaming? Go check wikipedia:<br><br><blockquote>The National Trades Union Congress (NTUC), also known as the Singapore National Trades Union Congress (SNTUC), is the sole national trade union centre in Singapore. As of June 2006, it has 64 Trade Unions and 6 Affiliates.<br><br>NTUC was created in 1961 when the labour movement, which had backed the People's Action Party (PAP) in its successful drive for self-government, split into the pro-PAP NTUC and the leftist Singapore Association of Trade Unions (SATU). The SATU collapsed in 1963 following the government's detention of its leaders during Operation Coldstore, leaving NTUC as the sole trade union centre. Presently, over 98% of union members are in unions affiliated with the NTUC.<br><br>Relations between PAP and NTUC are very close, and have often resulted in members holding office in both organizations at the same time. Ong Teng Cheong, the first directly elected President of Singapore, was both the NTUC secretary general, and the Deputy Prime Minister (from 1985), until his presidential election. Lim Boon Heng, the previous secretary general, is also a Member of Parliament, and the Chairman of the People's Action Party. As of January 5, 2007, Lim Swee Say, the deputy Secretary General, has replaced Lim Boon Heng. [1]</blockquote></div>
