            <div class='col-md body'>I think that the government should not be showing extreme negativity with regards to non-violent protests. Here in Aussie, non violent protests happens commonly and I can really vouch that they are effective at bringing the voices of the people across to higher organisation. These protests are often well organised and pre-empted by the locals. Any inconvience caused by such protests are usually minimised because of that.<br><br>Maybe the Singapore government should let up on it's rules with non-violent protests and hear the voices of people for once.
