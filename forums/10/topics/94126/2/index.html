He is being accused of having foreign links with such organisations as Amnesty International, Parliamentarians for Global Action and Human Rights Watch.'<br><br>Amnesty said letters to President Nathan and Mr Menon should note previous instances of defamation suits and cases against opposition politicians J.B. Jeyaretnam and Tang Liang Hong, and should call for an end 'to the use of libel suits'.<br><br>A High Court hearing was held on Sept 6 to assess damages Dr Chee must pay Mr Goh and Mr Lee. Dr Chee did not attend the hearing.<br><br>But he asked for, and has been given, an opportunity to convince the court as to why he thinks the hearing should be reconvened.<br><br>The court sits tomorrow and will hear arguments from him and the lawyers for Mr Goh and Mr Lee.<br><br>Amnesty was one of 13 foreign groups that Dr Chee had kept informed when he wrote to the courts asking that the hearing be reconvened.<br><br>He is already barred from standing for election for five years, having been fined $4,500 in 2002 for trying to provide unlicensed public entertainment.<br><br>He chose to go to jail rather than pay the fine.<br></div>
