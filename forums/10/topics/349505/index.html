              <h1 class="title">Venezuela Rejects “Interventionist” U.S. State Department Human Rights Report</h1>
              <p>Mérida, February 26th 2009 (Venezuelanalysis.com) - In a statement
              released Thursday, Venezuela's Foreign Relations Ministry said the
              global human rights report released Wednesday by the U.S. State
              Department was <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>"false, interventionist, and of malicious intent," and
              said the report lacks legitimacy because the U.S. government itself has
              a dismal human rights record. </strong></span><br> <br> "The government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, in defense of
              the sovereignty of the Venezuelan people, rejects in the most firm and
              categorical manner the U.S. State Department's report," stated the
              ministry. <br> <br> The lengthy report evaluates civil, political, and worker rights in
              more than 200 countries. It includes allegations against Venezuela that
              "are baseless and constitute an expression of anti-Venezuelan opinions
              of those who... refuse to accept that Venezuela is in charge of its own
              destiny," according to the ministry.    <br> <br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The ministry also questioned the legitimacy of the report, from which
              the U.S.'s own human rights record was omitted. </strong></span>"The Venezuelan
              government finds this recurrent practice of the U.S. bureaucracy to be
              inadmissible," stated the ministry. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>"The state with the darkest record
              of violations and assaults on human dignity in contemporary history
              pretends to set itself up as the judge of other states, without any
              legitimacy or mandate."  </strong></span><br> <br> Such practices "injure the relationship between our states, which
              should be based on respect, equality, and non-intervention in internal
              affairs," the ministry's statement concluded.<br> <br> Speaking before the National Assembly Thursday, Venezuelan Foreign
              Relations Minister Nicolás Maduro called on the U.S. to cease its
              attacks on Venezuela, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>and emphasized the need for a "pluri-polar" world
              in which "no government of the world attempts to impose itself upon
              other states." </strong></span><br> <br> Starting in the weeks before the election of U.S. President Barack
              Obama, Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez has repeatedly expressed his
              desire to renew and improve diplomatic relations with the United
              States. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Relations soured after the U.S. supported a coup against Chávez
              in April 2002, and froze last September after the governments of
              Venezuela and Bolivia denounced the involvement of U.S. officials in
              plots to overthrow their democratically elected governments.</strong></span><br> <br> Several National Assembly deputies also responded to the report. Deputy
              Ángel Rodríguez, president of the Energy and Mining Commission, said
              the report's attacks against Venezuela "are part of the ongoing effort
              of that country [the U.S.] to displace the Bolivarian Government, which
              from the beginning has adopted a policy of full sovereignty over its
              oil."  <br> <br> The president of the foreign affairs commission, Deputy Roy Daza,
              deemed the report "a very bad start for the administration of [U.S.
              President Barack] Obama, because it is a continuation of the policies
              of George W. Bush, which resulted in a political iceberg in world
              affairs."<br> <br> U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton arrived late to the press conference in which she presented the human rights report. <br> <br> The report says that during the previous year, "the [Venezuelan] NGO
              community noted an erosion of both democratic and human rights, with
              potentially severe consequences." <br> <br> Specifically, the report says pro-government media in Venezuela have
              promoted anti-Semitism. It also denounces inhumane prison conditions
              and extra-judicial executions by police officers in some cities, and
              alleges that a series of laws passed by the National Assembly last year
              "reduc[ed] the scope of authority of elected officials and promoted
              centralization of power."<br> <br> Further, the report alleges a lack of press freedom due to a "climate
              of self-censorship" caused by the Venezuelan government's Law on Social
              Responsibility in Radio and Television, and says the government curbed
              freedom of expression in the run-up to this year's referendum on
              whether to abolish term limits on elected offices. <br> <br> Deputy Daza pointed out that the report contradicts statements made by
              U.S. State Department Spokesperson Gordon Duguid, who commented two
              days following the February 15th referendum that "it's my understanding
              that the referendum took place in a fully democratic process."<br> <br> The governments of Bolivia also harshly criticized the U.S.'s report.
              Sacha Llorenti, a spokesperson for the Bolivian government, said the
              report is "politically motivated" and called the report a "crude
              simplification of the national reality."<br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br> Llorentil also demanded that the U.S. government stop harboring former
              Bolivian president Sánchez de Lozada, who is charged with having
              ordered the massacre of political demonstrators in 2003.</strong></span></p>

              <p>I dont think thats the reason why some countries dislike US "human rights reports".</p>
              <p>The reason is because someone likes to self-annoint himself to be above all others, and act like some overlord, and pointing fingers at others.</p>
              <p>It is interesting to note that USA takes the time and energy to compile all the human rights problems in 190 countries and regions of the world.....except.......yes you guess  it.....USA itself.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Haha sounds like nothing more than a tit for tat. But honestly, the Chinese report is a pretty accurate reflection of the state of 'human rights' in the U.S. Guantanamo, Water boarding,racial profiling, etc. doesn't exactly qualify you to be the world's moral advocate, and the same goes for the PRC.But I personally like the pragmatic approach the Obama administration is taking towards China by not over emphasizing on human rights issues, but rather cooperate in areas where the U.S needs China, such as having the Chinese buy up their debt. So there you go, that's what human rights is in realpolitik terms, just a rhetorical device. </p></div>

              <p>USA thinks every countries r like USA who is rich and educated for many years. Different regions have different problems. When USA is poorer in the past, they massacre red indians and have slaves as well. Even now they have guantanamo abuses, attack iraq and torture prisoners. Did they also consider human right in palestine ? I think wat isreal did to them is already damn serious and USA never complain but support them.</p>
