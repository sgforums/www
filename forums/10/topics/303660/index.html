            <div class='col-md body'>I only meant it as a general question. Assuming you can't go anywhere, would you rather have freedom or stability ?

            <div class='col-md body'>Ah I see what you mean. Again, it's late so I may not make much sense.<br><br>Because I don't want my answer to be taken out of context I have to go through a lengthy explanation. You may skip it all and go to the last line if you wish.<br><br>The old democracies that were successful (eg greece) had slave labor. The American style of democracy is the first of it's kind without slave labor.<br><br>How is this relevant?<br><br>The development of the higher cognitive abilities require time and some form of detachment from the material concerns. A slave workforce provides an abundance such that the master can become free from the material concerns. They then become the philosophers, poets, dreamers etc. A kind of master race.<br><br>If the society prospers, there comes a time when the master race will for various reasons desire to create beings in his own image. He then mentors some slaves. These slaves are given the same opportunities as the masters and in time they also develop higher cognitive functions. At this time they either join their masters who welcome them or replace their masters who have rejected them.<br><br>This pattern or some variation thereof you see repeated over and over again in history in the successful civilizations. Can a different model succeed? I don't know.<br><br>The American model is unique in that it tries to achieve a society without masters but even then you'll still find it sliding back to the historical norm for various reasons.<br><br>As with most master races you'll have some that are benign and some that are malicious.<br><br>A society with benign masters will result in result in stability and prosperity, provided there are no other societies with masters warring with them.<br><br>As a slave you have no freedom or rights.<br><br>However just being able to ask that question implies you are in a unique position. We are the slaves that ascended without master mentors.<br><br>Our education and access to information and having time to think has allowed us to ascend cross the divide between master and slave. It has opened our eyes up sufficiently to recognize the divide and see our brethren behind us and the masters before us. We are filled with pity and with ambition that translates to contempt and jealousy.<br><br>A race of masters who truely wish to keep you enslaved will not permit education, they will not permit free time, they will not permit questions and prefer you fill you minds with mysticism and material concerns.<br><br>That has not been the case in Singapore. We pride ourselves on education, we push our citizens to learn more. We may argue that our information is censored but it is still there. We have annual leave, one day or two days off a week. No one forces you to work if you can afford not to. There is no state religion that forces you to accept mysticism. You will notice that while opposition is discouraged, there are strong indications you will be welcomed into the ruling party with better salaries which translates to being able to take extended leave without pay. (edited: I think my view on this is probably skewed because I forgot to mention we are a shopper's paradise.)<br><br>I take all this as signs that we either have benign masters or masters who followed the American model without realizing the consequences.<br><br>My current condition dictates I accept servitude. Preference has little to do with it.</div>
