              <p>While the American girl declared conscription was against his civil rights and the French girl was properly sympathetic, the Singaporean girl said:</p>
              <p>"Why are you complaining? Government never pay you meh?"</p>
              <p>And promptly declared to her traveling companions that all Singaporean men are "complain kings".</p>
              <p>CONFESSION OF AN SPG (SARONG PARTY GUY) is one of the many short stories that can be found in <em>Singapore Sucks!</em> It discusses gender issues, military conscription and foreign affairs *wink-wink*. Here's a passage from the book:</p>
              <p>"While both sexes are brought up to believe in the comfortable illusion that Singapore is really a great place where things work and will keep working if we would all do as we re told, the Singapore Man has the benefit of some real life education as he performs his National Servce. The Real Life School of Hard Knocks and Perpetually Angry NCOs tends to drag you screaming and kicking through the comfortable fog you surround yourself with." </p>
              <p>What do you, the reader, think? Is it fair that only men are conscripted into the army or is the very idea of conscription an unfair one?</p>

              <p>My belief as to the core reason why that is so is because that Singapore is ruled by minority over majority. This is the core issue, the core problem. PAP don't dare to raise this issue. They don't dare at all.</p>
