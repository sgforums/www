And this isn't the first time they've had a 'technical fault'. One would think that SMRT should have a recovery plan to combat such flaws to prevent repeat occurence.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

"World Class"....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><strong>Disruptions: SMRT explains </strong><br><br>Even as SMRT sought to explain in detail Monday's seven-hour train disruption, commuters encountered a minor glitch late last night. Train services on the North-South line were delayed when a defective train was forced to offload passengers at Raffles MRT Station at about 11.10pm.<br>.<br>It then proceeded slowly to Newton station, in turn causing following trains to slowdown. SMRT said there was no halt to service and trains were back up to speed within 30 minutes.<br>.<br>In a statement yesterday, the train operator said Monday's disruption between Pasir Ris and Tanah Merah MRT stations was caused by an accident between a locomotive and a maintenance vehicle. It said recovery of the vehicle Â– known as a rail-grinding vehicle Â– was slow as officers did not want to damage the tracks.<br>.<br>It added that more than 400 staff were activated as early as 4.40am to assist commuters and resume service. It deployed 70 buses because this was the maximum number possible without disrupting regular services islandwide, to ferry passengers from Pasir Ris, Tampines and Simei stations to Tanah Merah. But the buses were slow in transferring these commuters because of heavy traffic on the roads.<br>.<br>Responding to grouses from the public that they were kept in the dark about the situation, SMRT said regular updates were sent to radio and television stations from as early as 5.10am, and subsequently at half- to one-hour intervals. These were in addition to SMRT's normal travel information channels.<br>.<br>SMRT said it recognises there is room for service improvement and would take all feedback into consideration when refining its plans.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Why complain abt price hike?<br>As the economy grows so does the living costs. Happens in every city.<br>Be happy that Singapore's transport costs to GDP per capita is one of the lowest.<br><br>The world is never perfect.<br><br>And the price hike, according to LTA, is to maintain a percentage profit margin in accordance to other transport companies. Duno whether u can believe it or not though.<br><br>The trains are only cramped because u consider it cramped. There's very little body contact because we dun like it.<br>There's a limit to how frequent a train comes as well. I feel sorry for train operators in their already tiresome schedules.</div>
