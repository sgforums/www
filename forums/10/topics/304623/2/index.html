Where is the timeliness? It is a known fact that everyone had a problem of boarding trains during peak hours. Some might even have to wait for 1-2 trains at interchange stations, such as Jurong East on the way to City.<br><br>the frequency is an issue, yet officials attempt to cover it up with statistics and figures. However, there is an issue.<br><br>from the annual report, passenger trips have increased 11% from 2002 - 389.7m to 434.9m. However, car kilometres operated dropped from 81.4m to 77.1m. SMRTC has been aggressively cutting costs by cramming as much as people into each train and reducing frequencies since 2004, to maximise shareholder value. Thus, what is observed is simply increasing ridership, yet the supply of trains remained the same, and even dropped.<br><br>on the buses side, this what SMRT had to say:<br><br>service schedules were refined to optimise operating costs. This included school holiday<br>schedules to match changes in student travel patterns, split-shift duties for services with distinctively high demand during peak hours, and parking of split-shift buses at interchanges to reduce off-service mileage.<br><br>this is not innovative. It is only innovative if the group had taken care of the operating fundamentals of the bus subsidiary. In the past 3-4 years, SMRT Buses has only introduced a handful of services for the transport hubs under its charge. In contrast, SBS Transit has overwhelming introduced too many services and initiatives that SMRTB is unable to match. While ridership has increased with additional services and demands on existing routes, SMRTB has not purchased any new buses so far.<br><br>the latest service failure showed its vulnerability. SMRTB came up with 40 buses, probably handpicked from a variety of services. It had to call for help from SBST to provide another 30 buses. This is unexpected from a multi-modal operator. It should have additional vehicles to cope with reasonable scaled emergencies. As only 4 stations were affected, this is considered to be reasonable for SMRT to handle by itself.<br><br></div>

However, car kilometres operated dropped from 81.4m to 77.1m. SMRTC has been aggressively cutting costs by cramming as much as people into each train and reducing frequencies since 2004, to maximise shareholder value.<br><br>You can download SMRTÂ’s annual report here.<br><br>I have excerpted the relevant table from the 2007 annual report:<br>SMRTÂ’s cost-cutting<br><br>This shows that the more crowded trains arenÂ’t just an illusion of grumpy commuters.

Total car kilometres had dropped, but by only about 5%, so overall their profits rose.<br><br>All this makes their following self-praise rather nauseating:<br>patting yourself on the back<br><br>You know that someone is lying through his teeth when he uses the phrase Â‘quantum leapÂ’.<br></div>

Stating the obvious does not add substance....duh <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>And no, the 3rd track was a suggestion, not a godsend. Ministers are free to decide upon their final course of action. There are probably other solutions that don't require such a high capital investment. The real question is whether Raymond lim has an inking about how to solve this very REAL problem.<br><br>Yes, i did mention intercity, but how does that constrict our minds from expanding on possibilities? Must it be a strictly one to one comparison? So what if intercity trains run on larger axels, require wider tracks etc etc, The gist lies in the concept - with a 3rd track, there are more options. Servicing this supplementary track should fall back on similar applications already in practice.<br><br>Building 3rd track is therefore NOT insurance; it's process improvement. A privatised company would definitely find creative ways to keep their customers happy, rather than sit in board rooms and collect fat pay checks, even if it didn't include building a 3rd track. Not to mention the VERY HEALTHY profits (not sales but operating profits) SMRT has been raking in year in and year out.<br><br>What has SMRT done? Their last significant improvement was to upgrade the existing trains to the new Jap imports, offering more spacious standing space. Since then,  the only noteworthy addition is more CCTVs since people started committing suicide on their tracks, and then only for their own benefit. And this only came because an internal inquiry determined that their existing CCTVs did not record but merely displayed real time footage for observation.<br><br>Cheaper, better, faster is definitely not one of their hallmarks.</div>
