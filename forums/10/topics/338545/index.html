              <p>The rule of the sea was to render help to anyone in distress.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, this single incident do not wipe out the records of atrocity that the Japanese Military was responsible for when they swept across the Korean Peninsular, into Manchuria, China and Southeast Asia.</p>
              <p>The millions of innocent civilians that they executed deliberately remains inexcusable.</p>
              <p>The Rape of Nanking has been well documented - when women of all ages were bound on chairs for whole battalions of Japanese troops lined up to share the bounty; and civilian men were beheaded by Japanese Military Officers as a sport to determine who can score the most "head count".</p>
              <p>To rub salt into the wounds of war, successive Japanese Government has refused to cleanse their conscience by admitting to these atrocities against Asians, and have even denied that such atrocities exist, with school text books deliberately slanted in details to avoid any accuracy in historical facts.</p>
              <p>This brazen refusal to this day clearly shows that the militants in Japanese society remains hidden in the Japanese political heirachy that is controlling the present day successive governments.</p>
              <p>If Germany has come to terms with the past war crimes committed by the previous generation of the 1940s, and have recognised the horrors perpetrated towards the Jews, the Polish and the migrant Gypsies - why does the Japanese find it impossible in their National Psychic to come to terms with reality ?</p>
              <p>This reference video clearly shows an attempt an regaining national pride and dignity for themselves, even as they have yet to come to terms with the victims of their atrocities commited against their fellow Asians.</p>

              <p>Please come and stay here in Japan for just one year and see for yourself.I am a naturalised Japanese citizen and I can tell you the culture is such that everything is good on the outside but deep inside the emotional IQ of most native Japanese is low when it comes to communication and respect for other fellow asians.</p>

              <p>There are two set of practice here.One is Japanese to Japanese and the other is how the Japanese treats the 'gaijin' (foreigner).For example,you could find it hard to rent a house or apartment  just cuz you're a gaijin.When you witness a crime and make a police report,the evidence might not hold ground cuz youre a gaijin.When you divorce your Japanese wife /husband the child would automatically go your spouse and there is no such thing as join custody or visits cuz youre a gaijin.I could give you 1000 example on this nationality issue but I am no longer a gaijin although treated like one.One thing that is alarming is the high suicide rate here and perhaps it is because of a lack of a strong religion.</p>

              <p>I would think that the high suicide rate is due to emotional attachment. old man starved to death after his wife die.</p>

              <p>That may not apply to youth suicides.</p>
              <p>Old man suicided himself after wife's death may be due to isolation from his relatives, friends, children, neighbours etc.</p>
              <p>Another way of saying destruction of community.</p>
              <p>He had only one wife for emotional support.</p>
              <p>If he had support from more people, he might not had suicided himself.</p>
