We thrive on competition, and we excel <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> But that's of course not to the extent of giving ourselves a bad name. If you wanna rush to the store giving out freebies, sure! but I seriously don't see the need to queue overnight or fight with the other "queuees" over some freebie.<br><br>Campaigns... effective to a certain extent. The Kindness Movement brought about the yellow guidelines in MRT stations [underground ones] and nowadays more people are following it and standing at the side, letting the people come out from the train before entering. Maybe it's not so effective cos some Singaporeans are passive [I must admit sometimes I'm one of those] and they can't be bothered about this kind of things...?</div>

That certainly doesn't justify name-calling in the 1st place when one seeks to survive. That goes to other stressed up urbanites in HK, Tokyo, Shanghai or NY.<br><br>In fact, if you wanna take issue with local education system, you'd better take a look at the sort of pressure-cocked, kiasee-kiasu environemnt of Beijing University, Taipei U and Japanese education system. Singapore's pale in comparision in areana of competition and super kiasuness.</span><br></div>
