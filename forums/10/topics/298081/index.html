            <div class='col-md body'>Actually, how do you define if action is being taken or not. It is not a case whereby if the offender or accused is arrested on the spot then is action considered taken. Now, if subsequently investigation was carried out against the accused, it is considered "action taken"? I would think so. the current empowerment to law enforcers under Sec 323 Penal Code is that it is a non-seizable offence. There have been too many replies by the police regarding such cases. In the case mentioned here, the marine is going to kena by both USMC and Police. Even if not, there is always the option of magistrate complain. Or if you wish to hire a lawyer, civil suit. Can we say there are no avenue of redress? I wouldnt think so.<br>Anyway, I''m new to this forum. Hi, guys, to the older forumers.</div>
