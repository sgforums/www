France is another european country where legions of former french colonial citizens have emigrated in search of a better life.<br><br>Yet it seems the level of racial tolerance in France far exceeds those in UK. Having visiting France several time in the course of my work, i have interacted with both 'white french', 'french africans' and 'french algerian '. I must say that on the surface and under it, there is little or no discrimination in terms of skin colour and race.<br><br>Even after the banning of the tudong in 2005 by the French education ministry, apart from the initial outcry, there was no hardline extremist response by staunch muslims in the country, though the French government lobbied the idea of placing restrictions on the number of immigrants into the country, plans which were partly accelerated by the massive fire breakout in the slums of downtown France in 2006.<br><br>It seems that despite what others claim of the french, speaking a 'snob' common language has helped with the integration process, not to mention the 'welfare' state France is known for.<br><br>Ultimately, the bastion of hotbed activity is measured by the level of acceptance by the local community, as well as the govt's stand. Outright banning of immigrations will not solve the problem in the long run. It may in fact foster xenophobic behaviour among the british for future generations. </strong></blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">The French are more liberal in their politics than the British with their <span style="font-style: italic;">''stiff upper lipped''</span> social structures, rules and functions of office.<br><br>While the French can be as bureaucratic as the British, the French politics take on a more democratic form - perhaps due to their experience with their French Revolution against the French Royals, and compared to the Royalist minded British that remain stuck in their structured Classes.<br><br>The French easy acceptance of alien races forming closed knit communities within the French diaspora is largely creditted to this typical characteristic of a <span style="font-style: italic;">''French Open Society''</span> - a product from the French Revolution.<br><br>The fact that there was no further outcry after the passage of legislations banning the <span style="font-style: italic;">''Tudong''</span> from French Public Life, can be attributed to the French Muslim Community having assimilated into the French way of Life, and are prepared to give up on an issue that is <span style="font-style: italic;">''NOT Fundamental to Islam''</span> - as proven by the Turkish experience.<br><br>The <span style="font-style: italic;">''Tudong''</span> issue is nothing more than an insistence by some Muslims to give their Community a higher political profile - making a political statement through their womenfolks on a daily basis that they are here to stay.<br><br>Almost like thumbing their nose against all that is seen to be offensive by others, and purposefully making themselve different from others.<br><br>The French way has to be congratulated.<br></span><br></div>
