it was a shocking revelation that most these mosques are led by imams who are not even locally born in the UK.<br><br>Most of the Imams preaching in UK mosques were employed from the traditional Islamic countries with training found to date back to <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Medievial Times</strong></span>, and without any training or knowledge about <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>'Life in a Plural Society'</strong></span>, nor even about <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>''Life in the 21st Century''</strong></span>, nor the understanding of social problems of Life in UK.<br><br>Worst still, the survey found that the majority of the Imam were preaching in Arabic and the Urdhu tongue of the mainly Pakistani communities in UK, and unable to even communicate with the younger Muslims born and raised entirely in UK and unfamiliar with their own ethnic tongue.<br><br>How could such religious leaders guide their flock in the controversies that already exist in normal life ?<br><br>How will such a community ever possibly assimilate into Main Stream UK life, as is happening in Singapore, where the government has forcibly moved a minimum standard of politically acceptable behaviour from the Imams preaching in Singapore Mosques ?<br><br>The lack of political supervision and any political agenda by the UK Government is typical of the British democratic approach, and has resulted in the UK Muslim community to grow as <span style="font-style: italic;">''A Nation WITHIN A Nation''</span>.<br><br>If a Community refused to recognise its place in the 21st Century, and will not accept to see progress in its main political motivation - which is its Religion - how can any Community assimilate into and find its own place in the 21st Century Global Community ?<br><br>Is it any wonder that radicalism takes root amongst the Younger Muslims in UK ?<br><br>With the Relgious Leadership imbued in the values of Medievial Times, is it not surprising that <span style="font-style: italic;">''Neutral Communities''</span> across the globe has found Islamic Values to be an anomaly to 21st Century global values of Human Rights, Women's Rights, Individual Rights, Political Freedom, Equality, Social Progress through Science, Knowledge and Justice ?<br><br>What is the purpose of your posts except an attempt to justify the unjustifiable actions taken by some to seek their version and narrow interpretation of justice, law and order ? </span><br><br></div>

it is the Western Countries that are making efforts to support their domestic Muslim faithfuls by providing ''21st Century Training of Imams'' that are revelant to the needs of their Communities in this MODERN AGE ?<br><br>In Holland, a master plan has been created for Dutch universities to train the imams who preach in the country's 436 mosques. </blockquote>MM,,i am confused,here i am talking about representation in the goverment while you are talking about...mideval teaching of imams?<br><br>In Islam to be an Imam is simple,you just need to learn the Qurna and Sunnah,that is all.<br>the quran remain the same for 1400 years and the Sunnah has been compiled 100 years after the Propehts Muhammad saw death.<br><br>They remain available for one and all to read and learn.<br><br>And in China the Chinese have their own taught Imams,Singapore Imam mostly comes from Al Azhar university.Or some even from other arabs coutnries.<br><br>And in Islam there is no such thing as moderate or extremist,if you are a muslim then you are a muslim.<br>The laws of Islam cannot be changed to suit mankind but rahter for mankind to suit it.<br>We have many laws that makes us unhappy but it is the right thing to do.<br>An exaple.Islam is the only religion that command a man to marry only one wife and if one can afford to maximum 4.<br>And the stipulation in the world fair mean,what ever one wife has,another should aslo have.<br>An eg,if one were to have a bungalow,the other has the right to one,a diamond ring and so on..<br>Homosexuality is to be condemned in islam.<br><br><blockquote>Does consuming of each other's community dishes indicate ''integration'' or simply a ''gastronomic adventurism'' ?<br><br>Social integration is more than gastronomic, and will require an acceptance of social and political values of the host country.<br><br>Can Imams re-interprete traditional Islamic teachings and abandon its 'Medievial Values', to accomodate the 21st Century Values from this modern Global Community ? </blockquote>food is also play a part of integration,it is na ice breaker if you will.<br>take singalish,would we have it if we dont talk to each toehr,we assimilate and integrate.<br><br>And the laws of Islam does not change to suit man.<br>Allah sent Islam for a guindace for men,not for its amendment.<br>Our creators knows us best.<br><br><blockquote>Your statement do not reflect the Muslim migrants accepting the environments of the Host Country, but EXPECT the HOST Country to accept the ancient medievial values and traditions of the Muslim migrants.<br></blockquote>No i do not expect anyone to conform to their host coutnry if they are an immigrant.<br>Would a Chinese forget his heritage and culture just becasue he is ABC(American Born Chinese)..no<br>Is there no chinatown in every US township?<br>Is not Mandarin or any other oreintal language used in such palces?<br><br>can yu tell me of one law that you would consider midieval?Or many if you can,we can discuss it..<br><br><blockquote>No need to go that far, Singapore alone has shown our Muslim brethens to out-perform the other ethnic communities, despite being in the group being in need of most economical and social help.<br><br>Are you ready for living in the 21st Century ? </blockquote>Muslim brethren outperfrom other ethnic communities?<br>cna you provide some detail casue it is a bit vague.<br><br>And i am living in the 21st cettury,and Islam is for all of time till the end.<br>inshallah<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Salaam,<br><br><blockquote>Are you being confused in understanding what has been posted ?<br><br>If you do not expect any migrant to conform to their host country then why should your be a migrant ?<br><br>I will welcome you into my house, and share the food with you, but I will expect you to respect my house rules, as much as I will respect your customs. However, DO NOT expect me or my family to accept your rules and customs being imposed on me.<br><br>If you cannot assimilate into my environment, please return to where you come from.<br><br>If I am a Hindu, or a Budhist, or a Chrisian - and as a migrant to your Islamic Country, can I demand that I will not conform to your social, cultural, religious, economic and political practices of your Islamic society ? Can I demand that Hindu Law, Christian Law or Budhist Law be specially applied to myself and my community that is living in your Islamic Country ?<br><br>Can the Syriah Law - based on values from a Medievial Period of the History of Manking - be compatible with the Laws of any country in this 21st Century ?</blockquote>i think i already answered you,do the Chinese in every wesrn antion abandon thir reliogn and accept the host country faith?<br><br>Is there no Chinatown in every City?LOL<br><br>Also when you say that people who cant integrate into their soviety,they should then leave..Well my IC say i am a Malay and so is not Singapura a Malay land?<br>Are you a Maly and have you integraed into Malays custom and rituals?<br><br>It is like saying that Australian adn Americna should return to the UK for they never conformed to the natives of that land.LOL<br><br>guess we should expect mass immigration soon..<br>LOL<br><br>And under Islam,we do not force conversion,and the laws of your reliogn is binding to you,we do not enforce it.<br>But if you are a foreigner in a muslim land,then by your own ideas,they should "submit" to the will of the lands,is that not right?<br><br>the Shariah laws are compatible wiht the 21 century,i would be more than happy to answer your doubts,but cna you make a new thread for that...shukran..<br></div>
