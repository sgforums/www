How many Muslim friends attend your wedding/birthdays? Do you insist on having Chinese workers when a working knowledge of Chinese is not critical?<br><br>The government is right to ban Salman Rushdie's book and the Danish cartoons. Such so-called artforms have no place in a multiracial and multi-religious society. They only serve to breed radicals. Whilst the UK chose to honour the author who has written a blasphemous work, we should not allow such literature to enter our shores. We must not repeat the mistakes of the liberal leftists in the UK.<br><br>At the same time, the government must be tough on extremist groups, using all the powers afforded by the ISA, the intelligence provided by the people and religious groups to root out such radicals. The UK government is not even allowed to use phone tap evidence at the moment. No wonder they have big problems with intelligence. We must learn from the UK's errors. The common people will support greater government intrusion into their lives to ensure their security. If we have to keep undesirable elements in prison or on an offshore island for the rest of their lives, so be it!<br><br>Religious leaders must work harder with the government, community leaders and heads of other religions. There should be more teaching of Islam and difficult passages in the Koran must be confronted by experts, not hidden way till they are discovered by extremists who apply their own warped interpretation. Perhaps all schools should be taught the basic tenets of Islam and all Muslims be required by law to attend an Islamic course of some sort, drawn up and taught by true islamic experts. There should be greater space for interaction in the mosques. More programmes may be open to non-muslims, to foster greater understanding and allow dialogue about the practice of their faith.<br><br></div>
