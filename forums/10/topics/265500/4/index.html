May I know what religion is the rule of law in Singapore? Taoist, Christianity, Buddhist, Islam, Hindu, Judaism, Jainism, etc?<br><br>Rule of law might have something to do with religion in ancient times, where religion and governance is related, like the monarchies of England where church and King form close nexus.<br><br>During the cultural revolution in China, where religion is persecuted because it opposes the Marxist-Lennist and Maoist ideology. In such a case, does your logic on the rule of law being dependant on religion still apply?<br><br>The rule of law in a country is dependant on the political progress of the nation, obviously if one country chooses to remain monarchy, where the rule of law resides with the King and the King using the instrument of religion to enforce civil obedience. Then the punishment meted out should be according to the laws of that religion. In some countries, archaic inhumane forms of punishments are still being performed (e.g. stoning, drowning, burning, horses ripping apart bodies from limb to limb, etc).<br><br>Between Saddam and Bush, there is a difference between Genocide and War. I do not justify the war wage by US on Iraq is right, but it seemed like the only way the other half of the population could be liberated and protected from further persecutions.</div>

Or Is It More?<br><br>A state-of-the-art research study published in October 12, 2006 issue of The Lancet (the most prestigious British medical journal) concluded that -- as of a year ago -- 600,000 Iraqis had died violently due to the war in Iraq. That is, the Iraqi death rate for the first 39 months of the war was just about 15,000 per month.<br><br>Reputable researchers have accepted the Lancet study's results as valid with virtually no dissent. Juan Cole, the most visible American Middle East scholar, summarized it in a particularly vivid comment: "the US misadventure in Iraq is responsible [in a little over three years] for setting off the killing of twice as many civilians as Saddam managed to polish off in 25 years."<br><br>The results are nevertheless staggering for those of us who read the American press: for the deaths that the victims families knew for sure who the perpetrator was, U.S. forces (or their "Coalition of the Willing" allies) were responsible for 56%. That is, we can be very confident that the Coalition had killed at least 180,000 Iraqis by the middle of 2006. Moreover, we have every reason to believe that the U.S. is responsible for its pro rata share (or more) of the unattributed deaths. That means that the U.S. and its allies may well have killed upwards of 330,000 Iraqis by the middle of 2006.<br></blockquote><a href="http://www.alternet.org/waroniraq/56124/" rel="nofollow">http://www.alternet.org/waroniraq/56124/</a><br><br>So in this war a good summation by an Iraqi bloggr,when a US soldier dies his name is written and his land grieves.<br>When an Iraqis dies by US  hands,he is an insurgent or collateral damage,nameless,fatherless,moherless and alone.<br><br>So when you point your finger at otehr you got 3 fingers pointd back at you,,</div>

Juan Cole, the most visible American Middle East scholar, summarized it in a particularly vivid comment: "the US misadventure in Iraq is responsible [in a little over three years] for setting off the killing of twice as many civilians as Saddam managed to polish off in 25 years."<br><br>The results are nevertheless staggering for those of us who read the American press: for the deaths that the victims families knew for sure who the perpetrator was, U.S. forces (or their "Coalition of the Willing" allies) were responsible for 56%. That is, we can be very confident that the Coalition had killed at least 180,000 Iraqis by the middle of 2006. Moreover, we have every reason to believe that the U.S. is responsible for its pro rata share (or more) of the unattributed deaths. That means that the U.S. and its allies may well have killed upwards of 330,000 Iraqis by the middle of 2006.<br></span><br><br><a href="http://www.alternet.org/waroniraq/56124/" rel="nofollow">http://www.alternet.org/waroniraq/56124/</a><br></div><div class="quote_body">----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>So in this war a good summation by an Iraqi bloggr,when a US soldier dies his name is written and his land grieves.<br>When an Iraqis dies by US  hands,he is an insurgent or collateral damage,nameless,fatherless,moherless and alone.<br><br>So when you point your finger at otehr you got 3 fingers pointd back at you,,<br></div></blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">How do you identify the body parts of an Iraqi killed by another Muslim who decide to indiscriminately set off a bomb in a public place filled with hundreds of innocent Iraqi Muslims going about their daily affair ?<br><br>Are the Americans to be blamed ?<br><br>When the Iraqi or foreign Arab insurgents decide to unscrupulously use Iraqi civilians as human shield to attack the US Military, what would you do to defend yourself if you are in uniform ?<br><br>The referenced piece - <span style="font-style: italic;">'The Lancet'</span> maybe right or it maybe wrong - but is it objective in its intention ?<br><br>It reported that 600,000 Iraqis died in the three years since Operation Iraqi Freedom toppled Saddam Hussein.<br><br>Did the Report mentioned that during <span style="font-style: italic;">''<a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/nr_comment/taheri200312141439.asp" rel="nofollow">Saddam Hussein's 35 year criminal rule</a>, he had led Iraq into four foreign wars, two civil wars, and countless smaller conflicts in which some 1.5 million people died - including Iranians and Kuwaitis.

if you know your history.<br><br>The violence used against the natives of these countries were subsequently revealed, and even from within their present day societies, there are social amendments made and sincere efforts are pushed to help the natives of these countries.<br><br>You have purposefully twisted events from two centuries ago to justify the terrorist actions of the Muslim Communities to push for a larger space for themselves in foreign countries that they have migrated into.<br><br>USA is a melting pot of different races or ethnicities - from the different countries in UK, Europe, Asia, Africa, Russia, South America.<br><br>Every nationality began as a minority, and soon their numbers grew.<br><br>No single ethnic group from these diverse group of people - in the US melting pot - has ever demanded that their ethnic group should be given the right to enforce their own religious laws to their own community, which shall be supreme over the US Constitution.<br><br>It is sheer absurdity for the Muslim community to demand such political space in every country that they have migrated to.<br><br>If the Muslim community desire to be governed by the Islamic Shariah Laws on their lives, why do the Muslim community even bother to migrate into UK, USA, Europe, and all other more progressive countries that have no Muslim Communities before ?<br><br>We are now in the 21st Century, a Century for Human Rights, Equality for Man and Woman, non-segregation, non-discrimination, Equal Opportunity to every Sex, and Freedom from Autocracy.</blockquote>Again,you agree wiht my point that the natives of the US,Australia and South Africa were oppresed and subjugates as the invaders become more and more.<br><br>Also,i did not twist hisotry for my word were,THUOUT history..so it applies thru out all of man recorded history.I said those 3 coutnries as an example.<br><br>Also the coutries are making restitution but again it does not disprove the facts that the natives were oppreses in their own land.<br><br>And since we have already aggred that THRUOUT history when ever a race becomes MORE they will seek their onw way.<br>Thus i find that your argument NOT to expect the Muslim to NOT want their own religon and culture is a double standard.<br><br>Migration happen all over the world and it can aslo be asked why to many non muslim moveto Dubai or the UAE,Or Saudi Arabia?<br><br>The reasoning is simple,to seek a better life aint it.<br><br>Also we can see the trend is also changing in the Arab states as more and more foreigner come into their land to live there.<br>So if we were to go by your argument,these non muslim should not expect anythng but follow Islamic laws....is that right?<br><br><blockquote>If you think that you have been able to find me contradicting myself - have a good laugh, otherwise your attempt at LOL is no more then attempting to cover your own weak position by simply making a hollow statement without even daring to show how the contradiction has appeared.<br><br>Are you now advocating that we return to the 19th Century practices of violent subjugation now that your Muslim numbers have grown - even when such past mistakes are no longer condoned ?<br><br>Are you justifying the present day Jihadist Terrorist actions to push for more political space simply due to your numbers reaching a critical mass ?<br><br>Should we not be surprised that we are seeing the younger Muslims from UK being linked to terrorists activities ?<br><br>Those Chinese and Indians who have migrated into the four corners of the World, have quietly assimilated into their respective host countries, and practise their own religions in quiet contemplation and modest behaviors.<br><br>Even the Communist Chinese Government Leadership has made public announcements for Overseas Chinese to respect the laws of the host countries, and be examplary in their conduct that do not tarnish the reputation of their Ethnicity.<br><br>Why should any host country treat Islam and Muslim in more special ways than it would to other ethnic groups coming from every countries in the World ?</blockquote>Again,mm i can see what your have posted but do you even read what you have written?<br><br>First off,you have already accepted that THRUOUT hisotry as a minority become a majority they will seek RIGHTS.<br><br>As you yourself have said that the Chinese and Indian have gone thru out the 4 corners of the world ,but they do not change who they are.<br>They still follow their own reliogna nd even create entire communities where they are a majority.<br>Eg Chinatown..<br><br>So i am sorry if my LOL offended you,but it was just too funny..<br><br>And did i justify the action of the radicals? If so can you prove it?<br>thanks..<br><br></div>

you have twisted events in the 18th Century human colonisation of weaker humans to suit your imagined 21st Century Islamic Power, and hence - the Right to Dominate and Islamise the World.<br><br>There is nothing to prevent you from your line of thoughts -

including Christianity, Budhism, Hinduism, Judaism and others - have evolved and blossomed in new Scientific knowledge and industry, and over the last three centuries all humans in 21st Century societies have abandoned colonisation of others.<br><br>Why are you still advocating 18th Century values of the strong subjugating the weak, and justifying Islam's Right to struggle for its own place in every World communities that have accomodated its existence and will even want to dominate it ?<br><br>I had asked you another question in my last post -
