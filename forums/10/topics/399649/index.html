              <p>BRIC = Brazil , Russia, India , China (New Rising Power, New Emerging Market)</p>
              <p>Brazil, Russia (including Africa, Australia and Arab States) are known as "Resource Rich Countries" that work hand in hand with India &amp; China</p>
              <p>India and China are the World Factory, with the 1)Biggest Consumers Market and 2)Biggest Supply Of Cheap Labor underdevopled countries with hunger and drive (NOTE: North Korea is a very raw countries with full of opportunites if she choose to reform her market system with western captialist practise)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This is where Mentor Lee Kuan Yuan arugment lies:</p>
              <p>China is based on Business-Relationship-Connection (more inferior)</p>
              <p>Singapore is based on Merit-ocracy-System (our is better)</p>
              <p>Note: South Korea is based on Guan-Xi (family connection)</p>
              <p>Note: Japan is also based on Guan-Xi (family connection)</p>
              <p>You know to close a deal in Japan, you need to go thru many dfifferent levels, different Departments, with different connection</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What I learned from Connection the practise od "Guan Xi"</p>
              <p>1) Knowing the people 2) Knowing the introduction &amp; engagement</p>
              <p>3) Knowing your source is accurate, the Middle Man are comestic make-up. (note: you still need a degree, you still need to meet the basic requirement, pass the basic interview, hieght, weight phyiscal test to be a police, army, navy officer)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In the end of the day, South Korea and Japan 2nd Biggest Economy, Taiwan all had produce flying results. There is no doubt in my mind, even China choose to stay on course (without adopting Merit-ocracy) they will overtake Japan as the world 2nd biggest economy in the world rival the top spot United States   </p>

              <p>China has "position herself" very well, Brazil will supply China with her endless demand for minerals resources</p>
              <p>China has very invested in many African states, most of African infarstructure from seaports, highway, public schools, Govt. Project all paid up by the courtesty of China. It is no wonder African people love China Chinese. Of course Africa continous to provide The World Factory with endless supply of afforad-able minerals resources</p>
              <p>It is no secret, Australia is booming due to her biggest customer China, Australia was spare from the finanical crisis</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You had to salute China "brightest brains" of making business strategic overseas friends. This is very smart moves of Mr Hu adminstration. I see China next business move is towards Arabs States, unlike United States is heavy burdened domestic politics of a closed ally with Isreal. China had this golden opportunity at the right time at the right business enivorment    </p>

              <p>Lee Kuan Yew's simple minded explanation for why london is financial centre:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As for Shanghai's goal of matching international financial cities like New York or London, Mr Lee said the Chinese financial hub will need to adapt some more, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">such as enhancing the use of English. </span></strong></p>
              <p>"In order for Shanghai to be an international financial centre, the city needs a big pool of talented people who can speak English. This is not only for the financial centre, it's also for lawyers, accountants and (other) professionals." </p>
              <p><a href="http://news.asiaone.com/News/the+Straits+Times/Story/A1Story20100503-213726.html">http://news.asiaone.com/News/the+Straits+Times/Story/A1Story20100503-213726.html</a></p>
              <p>Just master english according to the anglophile Lee Kuan Yew. He just can't stop licking britian's ass.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Bill Clinton 's professor explanation for why london is financial centre:</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: 19px;">
              </span></p><p>This third stage of capitalism is of such overwhelming significance in the history of the twentieth century, and its ramifications and influences have been so subterranean and even occult, that we may be excused if we devote considerate attention to its organization and methods. Essentially what it did was to take the old disorganized and localized methods of handling money and credit and organize them into an integrated system, on an international basis, which worked with incredible and well-oiled facility for many decades. The center of that system was in London, with major offshoots in New York and Paris, and it has left, as its greatest achievement, an integrated banking system and a heavily capitalized—if now largely obsolescent—framework of heavy industry, reflected in railroads, steel mills, coal mines, and electrical utilities.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">     This system had its center in London for four chief reasons.</span></strong></p>
              <p>First was the great volume of savings in England, resting on England's early successes in commercial and industrial capitalism.</p>
              <p>Second was England's oligarchic social structure (especially as reflected in its concentrated landownership and limited access to educational opportunities) which provided a very inequitable distribution of incomes with large surpluses coming to the control of a small, energetic upper class.</p>
              <p>Third was the fact that this upper class was aristocratic but not noble, and thus, based on traditions rather than birth, was quite willing to recruit both money and ability from lower levels of society and even from outside the country, welcoming American heiresses and central-European Jews to its ranks, almost as willingly as it welcomed monied, able, and conformist recruits from the lower classes of Englishmen, whose disabilities from educational deprivation, provincialism, and Nonconformist (that is non-Anglican) religious background generally excluded them from the privileged aristocracy.</p>
              <p>Fourth (and by no means last) in significance was the skill in financial manipulation, especially on the international scene, which the small group of merchant bankers of London had acquired in the period of commercial and industrial capitalism and which lay ready for use when the need for financial capitalist innovation became urgent.</p>

              <p>There a new book out on this topic too.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h1 class="parseasinTitle" style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 1.7em; font-weight: normal; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><span id="btAsinTitle">The Dragon's Gift: The Real Story of China in Africa </span></h1>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Is China a rogue donor, as some media pundits suggest? Or is China helping the developing world pave a pathway out of poverty, as the Chinese claim? In the last few years, China's aid program has leapt out of the shadows. Media reports about huge aid packages, support for pariah regimes, regiments of Chinese labor, and the ruthless exploitation of workers and natural resources in some of the poorest countries in the world sparked fierce debates.</span></p>
              <div><span style="line-height: 16px; font-size: small;">These debates, however, took place with very few hard facts. China's tradition of secrecy about its aid fueled rumors and speculation, making it difficult to gauge the risks and opportunities provided by China's growing embrace.</span></div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div><span style="line-height: 16px; font-size: small;">This well-timed book, by one of the world's leading experts, provides the first comprehensive account of China's aid and economic cooperation overseas. Deborah Brautigam tackles the myths and realities, explaining what the Chinese are doing, how they do it, how much aid they give, and how it all fits into their "going global" strategy. Drawing on three decades of experience in China and Africa, and hundreds of interviews in Africa, China, Europe and the US, Brautigam shines new light on a topic of great interest.</span></div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div><span id="btAsinTitle"><span style="font-size: small;">China has ended poverty for hundreds of millions of its own citizens. Will Chinese engagement benefit Africa? Using hard data and a series of vivid stories ranging across agriculture, industry, natural resources, and governance, Brautigam's fascinating book provides an answer. It is essential reading for anyone concerned with China's rise, and what it might mean for the challenge of ending poverty in Africa.</span></span></div>

              <p>That is human rights?</p>
              <p>Anyway that Lee Kuan Yew is just an anglo dog. His brain still stuck in 1920s,30s colonial era.</p>
              <p>He also likes to make up fairytales about his own life.</p>
              <p>A true disgrace.</p>

              <p>Well, I say let give China a chance to prove herself. Only time will tell, China is one country that had not started a war against anyone the only exception is Vietnam a short war to punish them for their action in attacking Cambodia</p>
              <p>Clearly, the Western Countries had failed to lift up Africa poverty.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Shanghai can be the next finiancal hub</p>
              <p>Menote Lee Kuan Yew touch on the ability to speak English is a strange one. Has he forgetten most Singaporean are chinese from Ann Hui Fujian and Guan Dong. Why can't China Chinese pick up the skills of English, how did he arrived to that conculsion is amazing</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>China had huge savings in commercial dealing and huge industrial manufacturering base, China hold United States biggest T-bills</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>China hot propery makert for landownership and heavy investment in educational building up R&amp;D tomorrow technology. China is building up 1) buidling up a HUGE middle income family (good for domestic trade) helping local firms 2)narrow down the lower income family 3)allow the rich and wealthy to stay, inviting others to come, we know rich people expanded their business operation, inreturn more hired workers and pay more taxes to maintance the country infarstructure</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>All the business activity form the creation of many China Banks like Agricuylture Banks, Bank Of Shanghai, Bank Of China...to name a few. Will further surge the buiness activity skywards will free available of hot money to support Business Expansion, R&amp;D and innovation and jump start new business for new business venture</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Yes, Shabghai had the basic fundmentals to become a finanical hub of asia and this will lead to the need to create a Shanghai Legal Hub for asia, for patents and business disputes since most of the business activities are taking action right here in China</p>
