              <p>Rubbish lah.</p>
              <p>Or you confuse USA with DPRK?</p>
              <p>USA wants to invade here, invade there, that is true.</p>

              <p>So I came back to see him a few weeks later, and by that 
                          					time we were bombing in Afghanistan. I said, “Are we still 
                          					going to war with Iraq?” And he said, “Oh, it’s worse than 
                          					that.” He reached over on his desk. He picked up a piece of 
                          					paper. And he said, “I just got this down from upstairs” -- 
                          					meaning the Secretary of Defense’s office -- “today.” And he 
                          					said, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>“This is a memo that describes how we’re going to take 
                          					out seven countries in five years, starting with Iraq, and

                          					off, Iran.”</strong></span> I said, “Is it classified?” He said, “Yes, sir.” 
                          					I said, “Well, don’t show it to me.” And I saw him a year or 
                          					so ago, and I said, “You remember that?” He said, “Sir, I 
                          					didn’t show you that memo! I didn’t show it to you!”</p>
              <p><strong>AMY GOODMAN: </strong>I’m sorry. What did you say his name 
                          					was?</p>
              <p><strong>GEN. WESLEY CLARK: </strong>I’m not going to give you his

              <p><strong>AMY GOODMAN: </strong>So, go through the countries again.</p>
              <p><strong>GEN. WESLEY CLARK: </strong>Well, starting with <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Iraq, then 
                          					Syria and Lebanon, then Libya, then Somalia and Sudan, and

              <p>Lucky got North Korea go and give USA headache.</p>
              <p>Otherwise USA go attack more countries, kill more people.</p>
              <p>Lucky that North Korea raised the tensions on korean peninsula during 2002-2008, otherwise, Bush and his neocon freaks would had attacked more countries.</p>
              <p>Nice job Kim Jong Il.</p>
              <p>You raised the tensions with USA, make war threats, divert their attention, foil their evil plots to attack Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Iran.</p>
              <p>If you diam diam keep quiet, after Iraq, USA would had gone war crazy and attack more states.</p>
              <p>Lucky got you to wake them up.</p>
              <p>Hmm...I go attack Syria, Iran, this Kim Jong Il attack South how?</p>
              <p>I got enough troops fight Syria and North Korea or not?</p>
              <p>Damn this bastard Kim Jong Il.</p>

               1. Those are copyrighted material, or at least written by someone else and he has no right to use it without the author's permission. This is wrong. Providing a link is ok, but copy and paste whole sections is not.
               2. More critically, it shows Uncle Chia is fully incapable of his own critical thinking and need to use other's writing to support his thesis. A few words here and there is normal, but whole sections?
                                
               This does not bode well for our society and individuals. It doesnt matter if one's language used is not up to par, for this forum is not a literary heaven anyway, but what is more vital is his communication to his fellow citizens.
              Plaguarising and copying will not help him improve himself, but will only hinder his further development as a concern citizen.
                                
               In the end, it is his choice, the freedom to learn or to continue in ignorance.
                                
                                
              &lt;...Uncle Chia is fully incapable of his own critical thinking and need to use other's writing to support his thesis.&gt;
                                
              wow, what a skewed unkind judgement! 
                                
              If Chia is fully incapable of his own critical thinking, do you think he is able to select the appropriate articles to support his view points?
                                
              And if you don't know the meaning of plagiarizing then pls don't accuse others of it. 
                                
              Plagiarize means to take ideas, writings, etc, of others and pass them off as one's own. Chia has always provided the sources and links of the articles he pasted and never claimed ownership of these articles. He, therefore, doesn't plagiarize. 
                                
              I don't think Chia chooses to remain ignorant. He reads fairly widely as seen from the articles he pasted in this forum, and mind you some of these are rather lengthy which not many of us here have the will power to read.
                                
              Sometimes Chia's fault, and some forummers' for that matter, is not telling us what he/they thinks/think of those articles. But I would take it as lack of training in that aspect. With more time and practice in public discussion we all should be able to articulate our views better.
                                
              There is no need to seek the authors' permission nor is there anything wrong to quote copyrighted writings for discussions so long as one provides the sources of these writings and is not making profits out of these articles.

              <p>You see the end results, but have no intention of seeing the blood and bodies piled up. You envy the West, but disregard what they did to the rest of the World to build their great monuments of Freedom and Liberty.</p>
              <p>Worst of all, you blame the rest of the World for not being able to climb up the ladder when they are being continously kicked down as they climb.     </p>
              <p>What resources have we abused? Natural resources are still being sold to the West for them to consume isn't it? If the countries refused they are hit with economic sanctions and military blockades or simply ignored by the world.</p>
              <p>Don't Saudi Arabia have a worse record with women's right than Iran? Have the West done anything to them?</p>
              <p>So now it is now the fault of the rest of the World that we did not sought to make colonies of other countries to exploit? That we did not bring in diseases and fire arms to wipe out the indigenous population?</p>
              <p>How hilarious. Perhaps you are correct, we Asians are just not as vicious as the West and fully deserved to be subjugated by them. We should all bleach our skin white and dye our hair blond,  speak proper English and forget our worthless and weak heritage. For the Western Way is the Only Way!</p>

              <p>Good Kim Jong Il.</p>
              <p>Very good.</p>
              <p>A lot of states are afraid of the USA, but you Kim Jong Il USA is secretly afraid of you. But they can't do anything about it.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">For one year, from September of 1989
                                to September of 1990, I served in a high level intelligence unit
                                in South Korea called CSCT #1, or Combat Support Coordination
                                Team #1. Its mission was to act as a liaison unit between the
                                US 8th Army and the South Korean 1st Army. What I learned while
                                there, from both classified and private sources, helps illustrate
                                why a war with Iraq is clearly not about the threat of Saddam
                                Hussein and weapons of mass destruction.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Before I was sent to my unit<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> I received
                                a classified briefing at Ft. Huachuca</strong></span>, Arizona that was attended
                                by all US Army personnel who had received similar orders. Everyone
                                there was informed of how grave the situation was in South Korea.
                                Riots, tear gas, and low level combat were all possible. We were
                                advised by one speaker to hope and pray that we didn't receive
                                orders for the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) because, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>on average,
                                about eight American soldiers were killed there every year by
                                North Korean forces by sniper fire or in small skirmishes.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Eight soldiers a year might sound like
                                a low number. But the important thing to note is that this information,
                                at least to my knowledge, has never been made public before.
                                <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The majority of soldiers who were killed by North Korean forces
                                were almost assuredly never recognized for their ultimate sacrifice. </strong></span> In other words, there could be approximately 400 families out
                                there, and perhaps more, who were never told that their son or
                                daughter was killed in combat. Most likely, they were told that
                                they were swept away in a flooded river or died by accident when
                                a grenade or some other weapon malfunctioned.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Multiple incidents, some publicly known
                                and others never before revealed, validate the eight soldiers
                                a year estimate.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">In 1968, for example, one US sailor from
                                the captured USS Pueblo died (and may have been killed) while
                                in custody of the North Koreans. In 1976 two soldiers were brutally
                                killed with axes when they attempted to remove a tree that was
                                obstructing the vision of UN soldiers on the DMZ. In another
                                incident in 1984, one South Korean and three North Korean soldiers
                                were killed in a gun battle when a Soviet translator attempted
                                to defect by crossing the DMZ into South Korea. All three of
                                these incidents, among numerous others, are widely known, including
                                the axe murders which were captured on film by the US Army.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Far more astonishing are the events about
                                which the public was never told. These incidents are particularly
                                revealing as to how much effort the US has put into avoiding
                                going to full scale war since 1953.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">For example, it's estimated that North
                                Korea has dug approximately 20 tunnels under the DMZ into South
                                Korea. These are invasion routes, two for every North Korean
                                combat infantry division along the border. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>In the late winter
                                of 1990, the same year that Iraq invaded Kuwait, one of these
                                tunnels was discovered by the US Army. </strong></span>This was the fourth such
                                tunnel that had been found since the beginning of the 1953 ceasefire.
                                The official story offered by the US military at the time was
                                that only a few bomb sniffing dogs were killed by mines.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">However, a soldier I knew who served
                                in the unit which went down into the tunnel told me a far different
                                story.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> According to this man, US and South Korean forces were
                                confronted by an entire North Korean company under the DMZ on
                                the South Korean side.</strong></span> What ensued was a firefight which resulted
                                in the deaths of more than 50 North Koreans as well as a half
                                dozen or so American soldiers. That same year, approximately
                                two months after this skirmish, it was announced that North Korea
                                was finally releasing the remains of several soldiers who had
                                been killed during the Korean War. According to my source, the
                                North Koreans did this in exchange for the bodies of all the
                                men who were killed in the invasion tunnel months earlier.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Another incident was recently revealed
                                to me at an anti-war presentation I was giving where I met a
                                man who served in the US Army in the early 1960s and was stationed
                                in South Korea on the DMZ. According to this man, one of his
                                buddies was killed by sniper fire while he was driving his Jeep.
                                The man's parents were told that he died when his vehicle overturned
                                on a slippery road. The casket, as is likely common in deaths
                                such as this, was sent home sealed according to my source.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">These public and hidden events fit into
                                a long history of hostility between North Korea and the United
                                States. Despite what the White House has stated, under both Republican
                                and Democratic presidents, North Korea has always been militarily
                                a far greater threat than Iraq. They have had more soldiers under
                                arms, have been committed to using those soldiers in combat against
                                South Korean and US soldiers for the past 50 years, and have
                                been controlled by an extreme and brutal isolationist, Stalinist-style
                                Communist regime that is responsible for hundreds of thousands
                                of civilian deaths. If we added up the numbers, the North Korean
                                government is responsible for far more deaths than Saddam Hussein.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">There has been much controversy about
                                the recent admission by North Korea that they have nuclear weapons.
                                However, in 1989 and 1990 US Army Intelligence believed that
                                they already had developed such weapons. Around mid-1990 I also
                                read an official ranking of military powers across the globe.
                                At that time President Bush Sr. stated that Iraq had the "fourth
                                largest" force in the world. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>However, <span style="color: #ff0000;">classified US Army
                                analysis</span> indicated that <span style="color: #ff0000;">Iraq wasn't even in the top ten in terms
                                of strength</span> - but <span style="color: #ff0000;">North Korea was.</span> </strong></span>The Army had concluded even
                                then, when Iraq had a far stronger military than it does now,
                                that North Korea was a more powerful enemy. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>In other words, North
                                Korea is, and has been for many years, the threat that the US
                                government has been making Iraq out to be.</strong></span> Furthermore, while
                                Saddam Hussein was our ally in the Middle East for many years,
                                North Korea has always been our enemy - an enemy that's been
                                killing our soldiers and threatening invasion of South Korea
                                for 50 years...</span></p>

It’s just gone… no stupid person, enemy out there would be so silly as to come at us with a minimum-energy trajectory. Give me a break.

              fight to the bitter end and finish the war, I know not how else to
              convince those guys still dancing and sipping coffee placidly in
              South Korea and Japan!</p>
