              <p><br>The superpowers are good in using other people lifes and places for war, eg, vietnam, middle east, etc etc, Korea is no exception, it can be a time to flex their muscles, but a war in Asia will be detrimental to the whole asia economy and security, China and India got to know the impact of it could send them back to ancient economy again, Russian may take the opportunity to recover it lost states in Europe leading to trouble europe, and the Americans may face an internal strike and riot against their sons going for foreign war again leading to the president getting kill. And worst of all, oil price will surge, jobs lost, money value lowered and most probably, i hv to sell myself on the street when all my gals are send back by order</p>

              <p>2. More critically, it shows Uncle Chia is fully incapable of
              his own critical thinking and need to use other's writing to
              support his thesis. A few words here and there is normal, but whole
              sections?</p>
              <p>This does not bode well for our society and individuals. It
              doesnt matter if one's language used is not up to par, for
              this forum is not a literary heaven anyway, but what is more vital
              is his communication to his fellow citizens. Plaguarising and
              copying will not help him improve himself, but will only hinder his
