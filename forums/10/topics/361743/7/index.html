              <p> </p>
              <p>The shocking rumor surfaced a few years back: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>A warhead from a North
                  Korean ballistic missile had been found in the Alaskan tundra.</strong></span></p>
              <p>It made a few headlines before the U.S. Missile Defense Agency dismissed the story as a complete fabrication....</p>
              <p>As for a missile reaching Alaska?</p>
              <p>The story about the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>warhead being found in Alaska first emerged in a report published by the South Korean National Assembly.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Kim Hak-won, an assemblyman who was the lead author of the report, said
                  he had heard about the purported Alaskan discovery from Taro Nakayama,
                  a former Japanese foreign minister.</p>
              <p>Contacted recently,<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> both
                  men said they stood by the story. Nakayama said in an e-mail that he
                  had heard about it from a State Department official he met during a
                  trip to Washington a few months after North Korea's 1998 missile launch.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Kim said the Alaskan report showed that "clearly we have underestimated North Korea's missile capabilities."</p>
              <p>Rick Lehner, a spokesman for the U.S. Missile Defense Agency, said the story had been investigated and discounted.</p>
              <p>"I don't know how close it came to Alaska," he said, "but it was very far away."</p>

              <p>``According to a U.S. document, the last piece of a missile warhead
                  fired by North Korea was found in Alaska,’’ former Japanese foreign minister
                  Taro Nakayama was quoted as saying in the report. ``Washington, as well
                  as Tokyo, has so far underrated Pyongyang’s missile capabilities.’’</p>

              denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, but the U.S., instead of
              seeking a substantial removal of nuclear threats, has steadily
              increased the level of pressure upon the DPRK and it has eventually
              brought even the six-party talks to collapse in wanton violation of the
              principles of respect for the sovereignty and sovereign equality, the
              underlying spirits of the September 19 Joint Statement, over the DPRK's
              launch of satellite, the universally recognized right of each state,
              the statement noted, and said:</p>
              <p>At present,
              some countries were shocked at the news of the DPRK's second nuclear
              test. But an exceptional act has its exceptional reason.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The recent nuclear test conducted by the DPRK is the 2054th one on the earth.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The five permanent members of the UNSC have conducted 99.99 percent of all the nuclear tests.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Those countries have posed the biggest nuclear threats to the world.
              But they took issue with our first nuclear test, which was conducted in
              October 2006 as a self-defensive measure to cope with increased nuclear
              threats by the U.S., terming it a "threat to the international peace"
              and adopted the sanctions resolution against the DPRK. This is exactly
              the UNSC Resolution 1718.</p>
              <p>This resolution
              fabricated by the hypocrites has immediately invited a total rejection
              by the DPRK and we still do not recognize such resolution.</p>
              <p>The UNSC with such a record produced the "presidential statement" on
              April 14 putting in question only the satellite launched by the DPRK
              for the peaceful purpose and put into force the sanctions under its
              Resolution 1718 on April 24 only to cause an unbearable insult to the
              dignity of our people and gravely infringe upon the sovereignty of the
              DPRK.</p>
              <p>The DPRK is neither a signatory to the
              Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty nor to the Missile Technology Control
              Regime or MTCR. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Such being the case, it has a right to conduct as many
              nuclear tests or missile launches as it wants in the event that the
              supreme interests of the state are infringed upon. Such self-defensive
              measures do not run counter to any other international law.</strong></span></p>
              <p>The UNSC has committed such unprecedented crime as the wanton
              infringement upon the right of a sovereign state to explore outer space
              for peaceful purposes and, instead of repenting of it, it is proactive
              in its outcry to cover up its crime. Under these circumstances, the
              DPRK, at this point, would like to draw a clear line of confrontation
              which will help clearly state who is to blame for the future
              unpredictable development of the situation.</p>
              <p>First, the UNSC is involved in its high-handed act which will never be
              tolerated and it is the part of the self-defensive measures of the DPRK
              to respond to this with its own nuclear test which we had already made
              public to the world. There is a limit to our patience.</p>
              <p>It is none other than the U.S. and other forces courting the U.S. favor
              who should be held entirely responsible for driving the situation to
              such a pass as they took the DPRK's peaceful satellite launch to the UN
              to launch a condemnation campaign.</p>
              <p>It is
              what they said to the DPRK that a satellite launch belongs to an
              independent right of a sovereign state. But, after our actual satellite
              launch, they took sides with the U.S. in its move to condemn the DPRK.</p>
              <p>Those countries remained silent when the large scale nuclear war
              exercises such as Key Resolve and Foal Eagle joint military exercises
              took place in the depth of the Korean peninsula. But, When the DPRK was
              compelled to conduct a nuclear test as a self-defensive measure, they
              are united in their voice, condemning it as "a threat to the regional
              peace and stability".</p>
              <p>It means that they do
              not like the DPRK to possess what they had already put in place. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>In the
              final analysis, they mean small countries should obey big countries. </strong></span>The DPRK, though small in its territory and population, has
              self-confidence and grit that it is a politically and militarily strong
              country.</p>
              <p>Second, we solemnly demanded that
              the UNSC make an apology for its crime of having seriously encroached
              upon the sovereignty of a sovereign state in gross violation of the
              Space Treaty and that it withdraw all its previously-crafted, unfair
              resolutions and decisions. Such a demand still remains in force.</p>
              <p>As long as the Permanent Five alone invested with veto power and
              nuclear weapons have the mandate to identify what constitutes a "threat
              to international peace and security", the UNSC is not supposed to bring
              their own acts of intimidation into question indefinitely.</p>
              <p>As long as the UNSC fails to respond to the DPRK's just demand, the
              DPRK will not recognize any resolution and decision of the UNSC in the
              future, too.</p>
              <p>Third, if the UNSC will make
              further provocative actions, this will inevitably lead to the DPRK's
              approach towards adopting stronger self-defensive counter-measures.</p>
              <p>The end of the Cold War worldwide works only between big powers, but a Cold War still persists on the Korean Peninsula.</p>
              <p>The UNSC-crafted UN Command itself is a signatory to the Korean Armistice Agreement.</p>
              <p>Any hostile act by the UNSC immediately means the abrogation of the Armistice Agreement.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> The world will soon find out how the army and people of the DPRK will
              stand up against the high-handed and get-it-alone approach of the UNSC
              in defending its dignity and sovereignty.</strong></span></p>
              <p>The U.S. is keen on using a catchphrase "Carrot and stick."</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> It would be better for the "Donkey" of the U.S. Democratic Party to lick the carrot. </strong></span></p>

              <h3><strong>Statement of fm spokesman blasts UNSC's discussion of Korean nuclear issue</strong></h3>
              <p>Pyongyang, April 6 2003(KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry
              of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea issued the following
              statement today: The United States forced the UN Security Council to
              call a meeting on April 9 to discuss the DPRK's withdrawal from the
              NPT.</p>
              <p>As pointed out in the Jan. 10 statement of the DPRK government, its withdrawal from the NPT has already taken effect.</p>
              <p>The U.S. and some countries insist on a "legal argument" that the
              DPRK's withdrawal takes effect after April 10 but a scrutiny into the
              minutes of the UNSC meeting held in June 1993 would tell that such
              assertions are meaningless.</p>
              <p>The DPRK has so far made every possible effort to ensure stability and peace in the Korean Peninsula and the region.</p>
              <p>The projected discussion of the DPRK's issue at the UNSC meeting in
              spite of this is undisguised pressure on the DPRK and a grave
              provocative act intended to scuttle all its efforts for dialogue and
              aggravate the situation on the Korean Peninsula.</p>
              <p>The UNSC's handling of the nuclear issue on the peninsula itself is precisely a prelude to war.</p>
              <p>The UNSC's discussion of the Iraqi issue was misused by the U.S. as an excuse for war.</p>
              <p>The U.S. intends to force the DPRK to disarm itself.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The Iraqi war shows that to allow disarming through inspection does not help avert a war but rather sparks it. </strong></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Neither international public opinion nor the UN Charter could prevent the U.S. from mounting an attack on Iraq. </strong></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>This suggests that even the signing of a non-aggression treaty with the U.S. would not help avert a war. </strong></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Only the physical deterrent force, tremendous military deterrent force
              powerful enough to decisively beat back an attack supported by any
              ultra-modern weapons, can avert a war and protect the security of the
              country and the nation. </strong></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>This is a lesson drawn from the Iraqi war. </strong></span></span></p>
              <p>The U.S is seriously mistaken if it thinks that the DPRK will accept
              the demand for disarming <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>while watching one of the three countries the
              U.S. listed as part of an "axis of evil" already subject to the
              barbarous military attack. </strong></span></span></p>
              <p>The DPRK will not recognize any resolution to be adopted at the UNSC
              meeting to be called by the U.S. which launched the war defying the UN.</p>
              <p>If the UNSC is abused for the U.S. hostile policy to stifle the DPRK,
              it will not bear any responsibility for the failure of all the efforts
              for dialogue and the extremely tense situation but will have no other
              option but to beef up the deterrent force for war by mobilizing all the
              potentials.</p>

              <h3>1. North Korea Can Engage the US in Total War </h3>
              <p>North Korea is one of the few nations that can engage in a total war with the
                      United States. The US war planners recognize this fact. For example, on March 7,
                      2000, Gen. Thomas A Schwartz, the US commander in Korea at the time, testified at a US
                      congressional hearing that "North Korea is the country most likely to
                      involve the United States in a large-scale war."</p>
              <p>North Korea, which can and is willing to face up to the sole military superpower of the world,
                      cannot be called a weak nation. Nevertheless, Western press and analysts distort
                      the truth and depict North Korea as an "impoverished" nation, starving
                      and on the brink of imminent collapse. </p>
              <p>An impoverished, starving nation
                      cannot face down a military superpower.  Today few nations have military
                      assets strong enough to challenge the US military. Russia, though weakened by
                      the collapse of the Soviet Union, has enough assets to face up to the US. 
                      China, somewhat weaker than Russia, too, has strong military that can challenge
                      the US. However, both Russia and China lack the political will to face down the
                      US...</p>

              <p>Some say the rest of the world should unite and pressurize nutcase kim ( I call him a nutcase but certainly didnt say he is stupid ) to abandon his nuclear programme and weapons. But who is actually pressurizing who now?</p>
              <p>"The <strong>world will soon witness</strong> how our army and people stand up against oppression and despotism by the UNSC and uphold their dignity and independence."</p>
              <p>Don't say nutcase Kim didn't warn the world. The ICBMs will be ready in 2 weeks time. The world has D - 14 days to react. The countdown for the murder of millions has begun.</p>

              <p>As mentioned, there is NO way China and Russia will allow asians to own and stockpile nukes. When a dangerous failed state such as N.Korea start owning nukes, every other asian will clamour to own nukes for their own protection, right down to some polynesian islands.</p>
              <p>Nukes are not that complex to build or purchase. Even a pacific island nation selling coconuts as its sole economy can purchase a few and train their people to handle the maintenance and push the button. </p>
              <p>When that happens, China and Russia will face multiple threats if 'bushfire' wars starts in their backyard, easily within rocket range. Nukes need no army, just deliver a payload and the victim country will go down on their knees, no matter how advance or how huge their armies are.</p>
              <p>The smaller a nation is, the more desperate they become, nukes will be the ultimate solution of salvation. </p>
              <p>USA can easily just say " To hell with it! Go arm yourselves. Go blow yourselves up. We are living on the other side of the world. And we have much more advance capabilities to shoot down nukes. Kill each other then, if this how the human race wants it be. We dont deserve the gift of life and might as well snuff each other out!"</p>
              <p>But they did not. Not out of guilt being the first to introduce atomic bombs. Germany too was developing and close to building one before it lost the war. Things would have been different.</p>
              <p>Many will have different opinions why they did not. Pride, economic aims, noble lofty idealism of their forefathers, etc. However, the critical issue remains - Nukes are terrifying and horrifying solutions to solve problems, and must be prevented from proliferating. Failing which, we then have no right to talk about civilisation, but to revert back to the jungles, for us and our next generations, as a way of life.</p>
              <p>Nutcase Kim must go. Wiping him,his general staff and hardcore politburo members out of the equation is the only solution to the problem. Starving N.Koreans, innocent S.Koreans and japanese do not deserve to suffer or die for the ambitions of a few.</p>

              <p>When you go to ROK, and if you actually ask the common folk about their view towards the North, many will tell you that Kim Jong Il is surely testing the patience of the UN as a whole. But many will also tell you that they do not wish for war on the Korean peninsula anymore. To be honest, they couldn't care less with the North and their antics... Local issues bother more to them(e.g. the recent death of ex-Pres Noh Moo Hyun)... They would rather keep the status quo and just put forth a policy of appeasing and ignoring the North(though under this current administration of Lee Myung Bak the stand is a little different from his predeccessors)</p>
