              <p>The time for bargaining of food and aid is already long past. There are independent reports of canabilism being practiced in North Korea.</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.agonist.org/archives/003388.html">http://www.agonist.org/archives/003388.html</a></p>
              <p>This report was in 2003, during world boom years. Now is 2009 and everyone everywhere on this planet is suffering. How more worse will it be in N.Korea who had successive bad harvests, poor management of resources today?</p>
              <p>China had been a major exporter of food to N.Korea. But even China themselves are suffering today, and exports would have been dwindled. N.Korea had not been taught to 'fish', but were given 'fish'. Now with 'fish' supply out or low, the country is dire straits.</p>
              <p>Combined with sanctions from China and Russia, which will have to take place because both nations will not allow Japan or any other asian states to aquire nukes to challenge their arms superiority, they will have to support the international community to deny N.Korea nukes or the capability to build more. A nuke arms race is the last thing China and Russia wants in their sphere of influence.</p>
              <p>Nutcase Kim is aware of the issues, more aware than anyone else. His back is against the wall, and has nothing. When a man has nothing more to lose, he can lose nothing more, thus his finger will toy with the button more than he ever had in the past.</p>
              <p>This is no longer an excercise to gain aid, which nutcase kim knows it is non-existant in our crisis world, nor will believe he will get any. Desperate, destruction aka gottermerang Hitler style is the way he will go now.</p>
              <p>Better his people and soon to be hungry soldiers die fighting his opponents than turning their anger against him and challenge his diminishing power and rule.</p>
              <p>With war, it would mean lesser mouths to feed when peace is declared, and he is still in control of nuke bombs when he emerges out from his nuke proof shelter.</p>

              <p>Nkorea would prefer to keep S.korea clean and pristine if the nuke demo work on hated Japan, and the world gives in yet again to them, then occupy rich S.Korea who would go down on the knees and kiss the path walked by the nutcase Kim, or so as he wished and presumed.</p>
              <p>Whatever the outcome, nutcase Kim has got nothing to lose, hidden in his nuke shelter.</p>
