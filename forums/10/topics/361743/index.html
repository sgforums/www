              <p>I wish u r accurate in your comments but it's more complex than that.</p>
              <p>Being nuke positive is to keep up with the Joneses &amp; it all boils down to one thing - military might.</p>
              <p>Whether it's for defence, deterrence or mad (mutual assured destruction) or a combo, the issue of nuclearization will always be argued, quarrelled &amp; threatened.</p>
              <p>Logically one can ask this question: "why u can have it &amp; I cant?".</p>
              <p>Militarily the answer is: "You cant because we dont want too many to have nukes"</p>
              <p>Logically: "Is that equitable? - a more sensible thing is all should not have it at all".</p>
              <p>For ordinary folks like many of us, we should tell all these f..xx.kkbas..taks:  "Please dont play play with humanity!"</p>

              <p>And what do nuclear power states do when they go to war? Application of nukes, not just one, to cause destruction on a massive scale.

              <p>A country can exist even with famine - but what is the quality of life for the citizens when the politics of the country takes precedence over the people's well-being ?</p>
              <p>Yes, with or without "the World Community coming to the aid of the North Koreans" - they will doggedly and blindly support their Leader who has been promoted to pop star status by their propaganda machinery.</p>
              <p>If the humanitarian sense of the World Community did not intervene during the harsh periods in the early 1990s, and again in early 2001 - the North Korean political system would have imploded, as their traditional allies in China and Russia have both already adopted the market economic system.</p>

              <p>Words had been officially stated and stands made. All it takes is just one more search and the whole thing goes BOOM!</p>
              <p>Another Perry of Japan or gulf of tonkin incident awaiting to happen? You think US is gonna back down and be threatened or bullied by this nuthead, stop their searches and let nuke material be further supplied to make more bombs?</p>
              <p>Either nutcase Kim fires first or US will simply just drop a few nukes to end their nuclear capabilities. Furthermore, what do you think the N korean spies/commando sleeper cells in S Korea will do when war is re-activated? Sleeping will be the last thing that they do.</p>

              <p>Backing down is one thing.</p>
              <p>But the crux of the whole excercise is to get aid. N.Korea, just like every nation is Earth, is most definately hurting from the present crisis. Hunger, poverty and starvation may be worse.</p>
              <p>In the past, US can afford to be generous, but NOT anymore. They have their own people to feed. So who can afford to feed the N.Koreans? China? with problems of their own?</p>
              <p>Perhaps the rich middle east? Doubt so, their mentality would rather N. Korea get its nukes so that they too will get some, hell if the koreans starve. Other treasury rich nations such as Asean members? No way will any of us support using our own wealth to feed foreigners! We have our own mouths to feed.</p>
              <p>So what is N. Korea is suppose to do? Best course of action - rob S.Korea to feed its people or let war kill off millions of hungry mouths for better utilisation of its resources.</p>

              <h1>Alleged Kim Jong Il's Candid Talk Caught on Tape</h1>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Wolgan Chosun: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>This is a transcript of Kim
                          Jong Il's conversation with Huh Jong Man and Suh Man Sul</strong></span>, two top leaders of the
                          General Association of the Koreans Resident in Japan (Chongryon), a pro-North
                          organization. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">The conversation took place in the evening of April 25, 1998 at
                          Kim Jong Il's villa.  </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>We obtained this document from a Japanese
                          intelligence agency concerned with North Korea. </strong></span>On the surface, Kim
                          is critical of the United States, Japan, and South Korea and praises the
                          socialist system of North Korea, but deep in his heart, he is envious of
                          capitalism and wants to learn from it. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> Kim is candid about the
                          difficulties in North Korea and unintentionally points out some of the
                          weaknesses of the North Korean system. </strong></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Some of the highlights of Kim's
                          conversation are: </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Kim Dae Jung is unusually mean-spirited. 
                          Kim Young Sam is a dirt-bag.  Kim Ja Jung is the evilest of all South Korean
                          capitalists.  We need superior seeds for our crops.  Bring here
                          Japanese factories when they are closed down.  The United States is our
                          mortal enemy and at the same time, our teacher.  We sent in the army to
                          save the Hwanghae Steel Mills from the thieves who ran it.  I admire
                          the capitalist legal systems. The law exams in Japan and South Korea are
                          exemplary.  </span></p>

                          crisis.</span></h3>
              <p><img src="http://www.kimsoft.com/2003/0301_104.jpg" border="2" alt="" width="350" height="289" align="left"> I
                          would like to discuss various issues concerning Chongryon with you comrades on
                          this occasion.  First, I would like to briefly touch upon the current
                          situation and the world economy.   Today on the international area, we
                          see sharp conflicts between socialism and imperialism, self-determination forces
                          and domination forces. </p>
              <p><em>Photo:  Kim Jong Il in a jovial mood. </em></p>
              <p>The imperialists and reactionaries are in the way of the struggle of
                          progressive people to be free of foreign domination.  They are hell-bent on
                          maintaining and expanding their hegemony. </p>
              <p>The Yankee devils act as if they have the solution for the current financial
                          crisis in Asia, but what they really want is domination of Asia.  And, they
                          are succeeding.  More and more Asian nations are falling in the US
                          camp.  Comrade Huh Jong Man said that the Japanese economy has been down
                          for so long that it would be difficult for it to bounce back.  Well, it appears
                          that the Yankee devils will pocket the Japanese economy.</p>
              <p>Hashimoto became Japanese prime minister at the worst time possible.  I hear his
                          approval rating has dropped to 35%   Has the high-speed train tracks,
                          damaged in the earthquake, been fixed?  They claim that they have recovered
                          from the earthquake, but I believe people's livelihood and personal wealth will
                          feel the finch for some time to come in a major way.  </p>
              <p>What is the ratio of hydro-electric power to thermal electric power
                          generation in Japan?  There are more than 30 nuclear power stations in
                          Japan and so nuclear power generation is greater than hydro or thermal power
                          generation. There are many rivers and water sources  in Japan and the
                          Japanese don't know what a drought is.  Japan has many tall mountains with
                          high volumes of water, and it would be easy for Japan to build dams. The Japanese government
                          owns power companies but I hear private companies are now allowed to generate and
                          sell electricity at will. </p>
              <p>How is bbazzinko (Japanese slot machines) business? It is controlled
                          by the police, and it is nearly impossible
                          to get a permit to start a new shop. Because of the slow economy, I
                          would think people
                          would spend
                          less money at slot machines.  According to Japanese devils, slot
                          machines take
                          in over three hundred billion yen annually.  This is about 250
                          billion in US dollars.  This is a big business. About 70% of the slot
                          machine workers are Koreans and about 33% of the Koreans belong to
                          Chongryon. 
                          Thus, this is the primary business of Chongryon.   </p>
              <p>What is the business tax rate in Japan?  It is about 50% and even the bonuses paid to employees are taxed.  The individual
                          employees bear the brunt of this
                          heavy tax. It is natural then that many businesses and tax payers
                          cheat and avoid paying taxes.  Due to the poor economy in Japan today, all sorts of
                          crimes are being committed.  High school kids kill their teachers with a
                          sword, and so on.  Crime waves are rampant and the people fear for their life for the
                          first time in Japan.    </p>

                          through Japanese product catalogues, I have noticed that they allow monthly
                          installment payments. How long have they been using this method of
                          payments?  Even shoddy products are being sold on a payment plan.  It
                          appears that the payment plan is due to slow sales.    <br>   <br> <em>Photo: Left to right, Huh Jong Man, Jung Tae Wha, and Suh Man Sul, on the
                          occasion of Jung's visit to Tokyo on August 23, 2000.<br>  </em><br>Our
                          socialist system is people-centered and we say that we serve the
                          people, but the truth of the matter is that our economic system is not
                          quite like that.  In a capitalist society, customers are catered to and
                          their pockets are picked clean in every possible way.  </p>
              <p>The socialist system is ice-cold and indifferent  to the
                          customers/consumers.   In our country, our store workers take the attitude
                          that they don't care of the customers buy anything or not. Instead of servicing
                          the customers and trying to sell something, they would rather that patrons did
                          not show up so that they won't have to do anything.  </p>
              <p>In a capitalist nation, service is everything.  When our people visit
                          Japan, they are courted everywhere with "Welcome, welcome, please come
                          in".  Japanese eateries have managers who supervise the servers, and
                          any service boy in trouble with a patron is severely reprimanded or
                          punished.  In our country, our servers are never fired for poor
                          service.  On the contrary, the patrons are expected to pay and bow to the
                          servers for the privilege.  It should be that those who receive money should thank the
                          givers, 
                          but alas, here in this country, it is just the opposite.</p>
              <p>Capitalism has been around over one hundred years now and it tries all sorts
                          of things to stay alive.  As I have told Secretary Kim Ki Nam earlier,
                          there are many things that we must do some research on.   The Japanese
                          devils are not creative.  They are good at copying other people's creations
                          and then modifying them.   Our Leader Kim Il Sung said that the
                          Japanese devils have no creation of their own.  Every product they have,
                          they have borrowed or stolen from other people.  </p>
              <h3>Kim Ja Jung is the evilest capitalist in South Korea.  </h3>
              <p>  <img style="margin-bottom: 10px; margin-right: 10px;" src="http://www.kimsoft.com/2003/0301_107.jpg" border="2" alt="" width="300" height="280" align="left"><br>   The real ruler of South Korea is the United States government.
                          Today, South Korea is in a turmoil, politically and economically.  Seoul
                          officials are trying to restore economic stability but I doubt they will make
                          it.  </p>
              <p>Kim Dae Jung is caught between a rock and a hard place. He has problems with
                          the National Intelligence Agency, Cheju-do, the broadcast service sector,  and
                          so on.  He is desperately trying to find his way out.  He is not going
                          to fix the economy. I have been reading up on the news from South Korea and see
                          that the South Korean devils are screaming in pain deep in a financial bankruptcy.   </p>
              <p><em>Photo: Kim Ja Joong, the former chairman of the Daewoo Group was fingered
                          by Kim Jong Il as the most evil capitalist of South Korea.</em></p>
              <p>The South Korean devils prospered for about ten years starting in 1988 but
                          now they are broke and dirt poor.  I hear they are writing to their
                          Chongryon relatives for money to tide them over.  The South Korean devils
                          fear that their defense industries may go kaput and are pouring money to shore
                          them up. It may be for this reason that their defense industries are still
                          robust. </p>
              <p>Among the capitalists of South Korea, Kim Ja Joong is the most evil. The
                          Daewoo Group is the worst.  Daewoo has monopoly on defense
                          contracts.  Kim Ja Joong is a trickster, sly as a fox.  He has no
                          ethics.  The third-generation capitalists are fairly honest bunch, but this
                          Kim fellow is a leech sucking up to whoever in power and lines up his pocket.
                          Much of his money has been squirreled away in foreign banks and his fortune is
                          less affected by South Korea's economy.  Kim has government contracts on
                          building submarines and other defense projects and so, he is not affected by the
                          economic crisis.</p>
              <h4>Kim Dae Jung's bad temper is unusual, Kim Young Sam, whe refused to attend

                          his presidential election campaign.  Kim Dae Jung is a nasty person and he
                          is not going to forgive NIA so easily. </p>

                          many peasant-like attributes and humble in some ways but he can be quite

              <p> Kim Young Sam is a filthy dirt-bag.  One thing I feel sorry for
                          him is that he surrounded himself with bad advisors.   When Leader Kim
                          Il Sung passed away, Kim Young Sam could not attend the funeral because of his advisors. 
                          I hear Kim himself regrets having had bad helpers.  </p>
              <p>When Leader Kim Il Sung died, I discussed with Secretary Kim Yong Soon what
                          to do if Kim Young Sam wanted to attend the funeral, and made a detailed plan to
                          receive him. But he did not come, and we were very upset with him.  If he
                          had any wisdom, he would have come to the funeral.  If he had come, he
                          might have taken over North Korea and become president of a united Korea. 
                          What an idiot!</p>
              <p>The primary objective of the United States in Asia is to box in China. 
                          The Yankee devils yak about US-China friendship or alliance, but their long-term
                          intent is to stop China from becoming a superpower, and all of their activities
                          in Asia are geared to their ultimate goal.  Clinton's popularity rose after
                          the Tienanmen Massacre.  Clinton is doing well in the White House. 
                          Jack Kennedy tried to make a name for himself but he was rubbed out before he had the
                          chance.  This Clinton fellow is only 52, but he got elected to the White
                          House twice. He is quite a guy. </p>
              <p>We have many South Koreans working on construction projects at Kumho. 
                          They are lazy and the work is progressing at a snail's pace.  At the rate
                          they have been working, their great-grand children will be working on the
                          projects.  These South Korean devils are the proverbial hired hands whose
                          job it is to drag their feet as long as they can.  Japanese companies in
                          the United States are all failing - except Sony, which supplies parts to the US
                          defense contractors.  The United States awards defense contracts to Japan's
                          Sony, Germany's Benz, and Swiss companies. </p>
              <h3>When we get our oil production going, we won't need to work the farms. </h3>
              <p>We have untapped oil fields and once we develop our oil fields, our economy
                          will change dramatically. Once we get the oil flowing, we won't need to work our
                          farms.  We will sell our oil to the Japanese devils and buy their rice. Our
                          oil will be like a nuclear weapon for us.  </p>
              <p>Taiwan is unaffected by the current economic freeze.  Taiwan's foreign
                          currency reserve is the largest in the world.  Deng Shiaping told Leader Kim
                          Il Sung that  there were four unsinkable carriers: South Korea, Singapore,
                          Malaysia, and Taiwan.  Of these, Taiwan is still floating. All others have
                          sunk.  Hong Kong is no exception.  Some of our people thought that we
                          might benefit from Hong Kong, but Hong Kong is in no shape to help anyone. </p>
              <p>To be honest, we like the current financial meltdown in Asia.  
                          Some of our people in charge of our economy had harbored some illusions
                          about
                          emulating the capitalist economy of Asia, but now the current crisis
                          made them realize how wise Leader Kim Il Sung's policy of self-reliance
                          is.  It was a
                          rude awakening to these people.</p>
              <p>KEDO allotted South Korea a large fraction of the light-water reactor
                          construction costs. With the economic crisis in South Korea, KEDO is saying that
                          we should accept thermal electric power stations instead of the nuclear
                          reactors as promised. KEDO says it can deliver thermal power stations right away
                          - a nonsense.  We don't have enough coal to fire up our existing thermal
                          power stations and building additional thermal power stations would be
                          lunacy.  What KEDO wants is to delay the reactor project as long as
                          possible to bring us down. </p>
              <p>The Yankee devils has been going slow building the reactors and at the
                          current rate, we won't see the reactors completed in our generation.  The
                          Yankee devils had agreed to build the reactors on paper but the reactors won't
                          be finished anytime soon for one excuse after another.  We have the right
                          to break the Agreed Framework if the rectors are not inished on time.  The
                          Yankee devils are under pressure and we will deal with them sternly.  </p>
              <p>In our life, we don't get an unbroken string of misfortunes and we get lucky
                          now and then.  I would like to tell you comrades about a heart-breaking
                          story. </p>
              <h3>We must get Western-style steel mills at all costs </h3>
              <p>  <img style="margin-bottom: 10px;" src="http://www.kimsoft.com/2003/0301_110.jpg" border="2" alt="" width="580" height="235" align="left"><br>  In late 1960, Great Leader Kim Il Sung had our people negotiate a
                          contract with an Austrian company for a complete steel mill.  The
                          price tag was ten million pounds, about ten million US dollars.  Lee Ju Yun,
                          vice premier at the time, told the Leader that we had no money to pay for the
                          mill.   What could the Leader do without money? No money, no Austrian
                          steel mill.</p>
              <p><em>Photo: the Kim Chaik Steel Mill.</em></p>
              <p>Vice Premier Lee proposed to the Leader that we should negotiate with the
                          Soviet Union for a steel mill. That is how we got the Kim Chaik Steel
                          Mill.  The Soviets, too, dragged their feet and the mill was not completed
                          until 1970.  We have the furnaces working now but we don't have cold steel
                          rolling machines installed.  If you look at the trams in Pyongyang, you
                          will see how rough their outer bodies are.  </p>
              <p>The Austrian devils got angry and demanded compensation when we had to cancel
                          our contract because we did not have the money.  When we did not respond to
                          their demand, they sold the steel mill to South Korea at a discounted
                          price.  The South Korean devils got a steel mill at a bargain price and
                          began to make weapons to fight against us   If we had tightened our
                          belt a little tighter and bought the Austrian steel mill, we could have avoided
                          all the tribulations we had to endure with the Soviet mill. Our people in charge
                          of trade were so incompetent in those days that our nation could not afford even
                          ten million dollars. </p>
              <h3>Send us high-yield seeds </h3>
              <p>Chongryon must provide assistance in our socialist construction and economy.
                          Chongryon must contribute to our agricultural development.  What we need
                          the most in our agricultural sector are higher-yield seeds. We need to bring in
                          new seeds across-board.  Many nations of the world harvest large crops with
                          better seeds.  </p>
              <p>Suh Kwan Hee (Chosun Editor: Suh was executed for failing North Korea's
                          farms.  He was accused of being an American spy.) failed to introduce
                          higher-yield seeds and distributed non-existent fertilizers to our farms. 
                          This traitor ensured that our farms failed to produce enough food for our
                          people. </p>
              <p>Our people in Yang-gang Province obtained potato seeds from a foreign nation.
                          With the new potato seeds, they claim we can produce 40-50 tons of potatoes per
                          100 acres.  If this is the case, Yang-gang will be covered deep in
                          potatoes.  There must be high-yield seeds in use by the Japanese farmers
                          and Chongryon ought to send some to us.  In particular, we need better
                          seeds for vegetables and fruits from Chongryon.  Most of the seeds used in
                          Japan are also suitable for Korea, weather and soil wise.  I hear vegetable
                          yields are much higher in Japan than in our country.  One thing you should
                          bear in mind is that we are short on fertilizers and we need vegetables seeds
                          that do not require a great deal of fertilizers. </p>
              <p>We want to renovate our animal husbandry and produce more meat for our
                          people. We are introducing better livestock - cows, pigs, chickens, ducks, and
                          other animals - from other nations. We have the know-how to raise these animals.
                          What we are lacking now is the feed. We have a stock of cows that grow to 700 kg
                          within six months from birth.  We would like Chongryon to send us better animal
                          stocks from Japan. </p>
              <p>To be honest, Chongryon has been sending us things that are of little use to
                          us.  You are throwing away money. What we need from you are advanced
                          technology and better seeds.  It seems the leaders of Chongryon are not
                          well acquainted with the situation here.  What Chongryon needs is a Mun Ik
                          Jum movement. Moon Ik Jum is the patriot who smuggled cotton seeds from China
                          and planted them all across Korea.  All overseas Koreans, not just
                          Chongryon, should become Mun Ik Jum and bring foreign technology and goods to
                          Korea. </p>
              <p>Today, scientific technology is advancing rapidly in China. Our compatriots
                          in China can easily copy these advances to our nation, but they are not doing
                          that.  One thing Chongryon has done well is the establishment of micro-organic fertilizer
                          plants. This is the kind of thing we need.  We
                          don't need your symbolic flags any more.  We have no more rooms for
                          them.  Microbe production technology, yeasts, and facilities from Japan
                          will help not only our agriculture but also our industries, medical sector,
                          environmental protection, and many others.  By the fall of this year,
                          Chongryn has sent us 115 microbe fertilizer plants.  These plants should
                          produce fertilizers for 100 to 150 million acres (one jongbo = 99 acres). 
                          We cannot rely on chemical fertilizers alone and we must use more microbe
                          fertilizers.    </p>
              <p>In operating microbe fertilizer plants, our most pressing problem is the
                          shortage of molasses. I hear that Chongryon people have found a way to reduce molasses
                          usage from 80% to 20%.  This should solve our molasses shortage.  With
                          microbe fertilizers, rice crop yields would jump to about 12 tons per 100 acre.
                          That would really help us.  </p>
              <p>We have been using weed killers extensively. Consequently, birds and microbes
                          have all but gone away from our farms.  We need to refresh our soil with
                          new microbes.  If we have to, we ought to import additional microbe
                          fertilizers from Japan and South Korea.  We must stop relying in chemical
                          fertilizers alone. </p>
              <h3>Bring here machines from the Japanese factories that go kaput.</h3>
              <p>It would be nice if Chongryon would send us surplus goods and used
                          machines.  These can be bought dirt cheap in Japan and sold to us. 
                          Tile manufacturing plants and rolling facilities would come handy.  The
                          Japanese economy is down and it should be easy to acquire and send these
                          here.  Chongryn can really help us here. </p>
              <p>Of course, we can obtain these through normal trades. But how can we save our
                          face and ask the Japanese devils for cheap used merchandise?  Our trading
                          people are reluctant to negotiate such deals, and Chongryun should step in and
                          help us out here.  </p>
              <p>At present, economy is down in nations like Japan, and many small to medium
                          companies of good products are going bankrupt.  Chongryun could buy up at
                          bargain prices the machines and goods from bankrupt companies in Japan and ship
                          them here.  We will pay Chongryon, of course.  One thing we must avoid
                          is to buy only parts of a factory and try to fill the missing parts with things
                          made here.  We want complete working factories ready to go even if we had
                          to pay extra.  Getting parts of factory in order to save some money ends up
                          costing us more money. </p>
              <p>There have been many instances of our trade workers having bought incomplete
                          factories.  Most of the imported factories that are not doing well are
                          those partial plants that our trade workers bought trying to save a few bucks.
                          Those plants that we bought in toto are all working fine.</p>
              <h3>I cannot bear seeing people shivering in cold </h3>
              <p>During my 1983 visit to China, Hua Kuofeng and I visited the Bosan Thermal
                          Power Station.  It was imported from another country.  China is
                          technologically advanced enough to build its own power plants, but it decided to
                          buy the plant abroad.  I asked Hua why?  He said that China could have
                          built the station but the foreign plant was better.  In contrast, our
                          people reason differently.  Their idea is to buy only those parts that we
                          cannot make and the rest we build here.  This kind of attitude has led to
                          many costly failures.  </p>
              <p>Look at the Pyongyang Thermal Power Plant, which we bought from the Soviets.
                          They had switched over to heavy oil thermal production and gave us their
                          obsolete coal burning power plant. We are paying dearly for our mistakes. 
                          The power plant stop working often and the people of Pyongyang are
                          freezing.  I cannot bear watching them suffer like that.  I have made
                          my mind that once we start producing our own oil, we will shut down the obsolete
                          coal power stations and replace them with heavy oil power stations.  </p>
              <p>Even if we started producing oil now, we have no oil storage facilities or
                          oil refineries and so, we want to use our crude oil to generate
                          power.  </p>
              <p>The Soviets refused to help us with any degree of honesty because we refused
                          to join the Soviet block economic coop and also, we were not subservient to
                          them.  They helped us when we were nice to them and refused to help when we
                          did not agree with them.  The Soviets gave nuclear power stations to Cuba
                          and other socialist nations except us and Albania.  Our Leader Kim Il Sung
                          began to implement his self-reliance at the time and could not accept the Soviet
                          domination.  Consequently, we have lost many opportunities. </p>
              <p>If we had known that the mighty Soviet Union would fall apart so suddenly, we
                          would have bought a nuclear power station from the Soviets even if we had to
                          crawl before them. But we did not.  After the fall of the Soviet Union, the
                          Russians are starting to work with us.</p>
              <h3>The United States is our military's "mortal enemy" but our trade
                          workers' "teacher"</h3>
              <p>Japan depends on the United States for computer technology. Awhile ago, the
                          Japanese prime minister visited the United States and asked for the circuit
                          design of the latest computer, but he was turned down. The United States doesn't
                          mind sharing old technology but it keeps its latest technology to itself. 
                          Japan may be manufacturing fancy computers now but their computers are not on
                          the cutting edge of computer technology, and they will remain so.  </p>
              <p>Now South Korea is trying to get Japan to share its computer technology, even
                          though it is not up-to-date. Japan, of course, refuses to share its computer
                          design with South Korea.  Today, South Korea brags about its computers on
                          TV commercials but the South Korean computers don't even come close to American
                          computers.  We have to butter up to the Americans and get the best they
                          have.  </p>
              <p>Our People's Army regards the United States its sworn enemy but our people
                          engaged in trades address the Americans with much respect.   This is
                          called the principle of 'hard inside, soft outside'.</p>
              <p>Chongryon should bring us factories to process our raw materials. 
                          In  the 1960s, Chongryon workers brought us many factories in a patriotic
                          movement. But all these factories have shut down. The reason is that these
                          factories were not for processing raw materials we have here. These factories
                          required raw materials that had to be imported from Japan and other
                          countries.   The Chongryon workers were good-intentioned but they did
                          not understand the situation here and kept on sending factories that could not work
                          here.  It was a waste of money and time.</p>
              <p>Comrade Lee Jin Gyu tried to keep the factories going by importing raw
                          materials from Japan but it was of no use.  To be honest, our nation is so
                          isolated from the rest of the world and communication with outside world is not
                          smooth. Therefore, Chongryon workers should look for factories that match our
                          needs and that can be reassembled and expanded with ease. </p>
              <p>As I mentioned earlier, Chongryun workers should buy up factories from
                          bankrupt companies in South Korea and resell them to us.   </p>
              <p>I have read on a Japanese magazine that Japanese scientists have come up with
                          drugs that kill off flies from fields and mountains. Please find out where these
                          drugs are being made. </p>
              <h3>We need more Pungsan dogs from South Korea</h3>
              <p>Chongryon has a soccer team.  Do you have a basketball team?  You
                          could select some promising athletes to be trained here.  Basketball
                          players must be tall and young in age.  If you would send us three or so
                          tall young men, it would be nice.  I hear an American basketball team wants
                          to come here for a friendly game. The team would come here mid-August. It would
                          have about 60 people including 20 athletes. </p>
              <p>We have two basic breeds of dogs: Pungsan and Jindo.  Do they sell
                          Punsan and Jindo dogs in Japan?  Pungsan is in Yanggang but it has come to
                          the end of progeny and we must find a breeding stock of Pungsan dogs. We don't
                          want our own native dogs to die out.  We must make sure that Pungsan and Jindo
                          dogs prosper and propagate.  Our people are quite indifferent to the future
                          of our dogs.  That is wrong. These dogs belong to Korea and we must
                          preserve them.   </p>
              <p>If there are no Pungsan and Jindo dogs for sale in Japan, then you must
                          acquire them in South Korea and introduce them to Japan.  I hear South Korea
                          has Pungsan dogs.   Someone told me about a fight between a Pungsan
                          and a Jindo. He said Pungsan was the winner.  </p>
              <p>Our people don't know how to save money for rainy days. The Japanese are good
                          at saving.  They are also very frugal probably because they live on
                          islands. They are good at making a living, too.  We encourage arts and
                          sports. In order to maintain our revolutionary optimism, we need the whole
                          nation active in arts and sports. Arts and sports are open to all in our
                          country.   </p>
              <p>During the February festivities, the Kumgang Art Troupe came, and recently, I
                          heard that local music groups came here to perform.  Next time they come
                          here, I would like to attend their shows.  The last time I watched a
                          Chongryun show was about two years ago. </p>
              <h3>Suh Kwan Hee, the former Party secretary for agricultures, became a traitor
                          in 1950</h3>
              <p>Next, I would like to tell you about some realities here.  Comrade Huh
                          Jong Man told me that Chongryung could not serve the nation adequately because
                          the Chonryong leaders were not well informed of the situation here. He is quite
                          right.  The Chongryon leaders live in a hostile nation and read news papers
                          that are hostile to us. Therefore, they don't know what is going on here.</p>
              <p>The hostile news reporters pick up a story and embellish it with fancy lies
                          to sell newspapers. About 80% of what they publish are lies.  It may be
                          that our news organs are not working effectively but the Japanese devils and the
                          South Korean puppets are spreading false rumors of military coup in our nation.</p>
              <p>I must let you know the truth about Suh Kwan Hee, who had sabotaged our
                          agriculture, and the incident at the Hwanghae Steel Mill.  I must tell you
                          that Suh was an enemy spy.  Under the cover of Juche research, Hwang Jang
                          Yup was actively sabotaging us  in the political arena and Suh Kwang Hee was
                          wrecking our farms under the cover of a Party secretary.  </p>
              <p>Suh was a long-time Party member and did everything he could to ruin our
                          agriculture.  For a long time, Suh refused to send a farm delegation to
                          Japan using one excuse after another because he feared that they might receive
                          better seeds from Chongryun.  Better seeds would have worked counter his
                          plan to starve us slowly.  </p>
              <p>Suh became a traitor in 1950.  He would hardly do anything at the Party
                          meetings for discussing farm problems.  Even when he was the Party
                          secretary for agriculture, he had precious little to say about farming.  He
                          was a filthy traitor loyal to his masters to the very end. </p>
              <h3>The 6th Army Corps 'coup' is a lie and the army take-over of the Hwanghae
                          Steel Mill is true</h3>
              <p>You have most likely read or heard about the so-called coup attempt of the
                          6th Army Corps in the North Hamgyong Province on Japanese news papers, magazines
                          and radios. It was a baseless lie. There was no such attempt. What really
                          happened was that we found some defects in the political indoctrination program
                          of the Corp and had to remove some officers after self-criticism meetings. 
                          Contrary to the published reports, neither the Corps commander nor the political
                          commissar was executed. </p>
              <p>The joint chief-of-staff, who was the Corps commander in question, is here
                          today.  After the so-called coup attempt, he was promoted to the joint
                          chief-of-staff.  Now the enemy propagandists claim that the political
                          commissar was behind the coup and that it was he who was executed.  The
                          truth of the matter is that the commissar was relieved because of his stomach
                          cancer.  </p>
              <p>I will tell you what really happened at the Hwanghae Steel Mill.  The
                          incident at the Mill was first reported by some Koreans resident in China. 
                          We spent three years mourning the death of our Leader Kim Il Sung and
                          coincidentally, were hit with  natural disasters. We found ourselves in a
                          dire situation and could not provide enough electric power to the Hwanghae Steel
                          Mill.  </p>
              <p>The Mill had to stop operation. Some bad elements of our society in cahoots
                          with the Mill management began to dismantle the Mill and sell its machines as
                          scrap metals to Chinese merchants.  By the time we got wind of what was
                          going on, more than half of the mill had been stripped away.  For nearly a
                          year, the thieves took over the Mill and stole people's properties at will. They
                          bought out Party leaders and security officers, and consequently, no one had
                          informed us about their thievery.  </p>
              <p>Everybody was in the take at the Mill and we had to send in an army to retake
                          the Mill. The army surrounded the Mill and arrested the thieves.  The army
                          recovered people's properties from the thieves. Some of our trading people were
                          involved in this massive fleecing of the Mill.  </p>
              <p>The enemy reporters claimed that an army unit mutinied and took over the
                          Mill. A Taiwan new organ went so far as to claim that the coup was led by the
                          joint chief-of-staff.  Mun Myong Ja (a Korean-American reporter) heard
                          about the army 'coup' and rushed here to find out the truth.  Miss Mun
                          found that no such event had occurred.  </p>
              <p>The enemy news organs seem to track every move made by the joint
                          chief-of-staff. If he is not seen in public for several days, they wonder what
                          he is up to.  You comrades have families and know that family life goes
                          through many events. Our joint chief-of-staff, too, has a family to take care
                          of.    The basic problem is that the Japanese and South Korean
                          bastards have dark shady motives and assume that we have dark shady motives,
                          too.  They see the events here through their colored glasses.  Those
                          people from hostile nations who visit us are shocked when they see the real
                          truth here. </p>
              <p>Currently we are poor and our life is hard, but you won't see any people on
                          Earth that is as united as we are.  You Chonryun people hear and read the
                          hostile news stories every day and so, it will be good for young Chongryun workers
                          to visit here and refresh their faith in us.  We have a Chongryung cadre
                          training school at the foot of Mt. Yongak and young Chongryun leaders should
                          spend sometime there learning our Party doctrines. </p>
              <h3>We purposely cut back the rations in Pyongyang</h3>
              <p>We continue to ask the World Red Cross for food assistance, because we are in
                          fact short of food; but the main reason is that our seeds have degraded thanks to
                          Suh Kwang Hee's treachery. Our production has declined steadily because of the
                          bad seeds.  We are replacing them with better seeds but it will take about
                          three years to fully recover. We need food aids to tide us over during this
                          transition period. </p>
              <p>You may have received letters from your relatives living here about the food
                          shortage. The situation is not as bad as it may appear. We make sure that
                          the Army has enough to eat and the farmers and government workers get less
                          food.  The residents of Pyongyang receive many benefits from the government
                          and they live better than the people in the rest of the country. For this
                          reason, we cut back rations to the Pyongyang residents and at the same time, upped
                          rations for the rest of the people.  Ignorant of this, some people panicked
                          and wrote you that our nation had only week's supply of food left, and so
                          on.  </p>
              <p>Last year, the whole army was mobilized to grow food.  The main finding
                          of the army is that the seeds must be replaced, and we have began to bring in
                          better seeds.  But it will take about 2-3 years at the least to replace the
                          old seeds with the new. Until then, our food shortage will persist.  </p>
              <p>We have been on a forced march for several years now and we are finding a
                          number of structural problems.  Had we held a Party Congress or the Supreme
                          People's Council before the end of the three-year mourning period after Leader
                          Kim Il Sung's death, we would be facing food shortages for ten years or
                          more.  The lesson learned is that you need to know who is who.  Today,
                          all of the senior leaders are old revolutionaries who had worked with Leader Kim
                          Il Sung.  We have to ensure that they stay on for a long time to come.</p>
              <h3>Sad stories made up for foreign aids</h3>
              <p>Our enemies report almost daily so many millions have starved to death and so
                          forth, and do all they can to defame and demonize us.  You comrades are
                          here to witness the truth and report what you have seen here when you are back
                          in Japan.   That is why I took you along on my onsite guidance trip to
                          the armament factory in a remote village.  I wanted you to see how the
                          factory workers lived and how they differed from the residents of
                          Pyongyang.  I wanted you to see if there were people dying on the roadsides
                          from hunger.<br>  <br> As you have seen from your auto trip, there were no starving people on the
                          roadsides and the factory workers are healthier than the people in
                          Pyongyang.  I hope that you saw the might of our nation and the optimism of
                          our workers. We have to study how best to let you know of the true situations of
                          our nation.  As I have said earlier, our situation is not as grave as our
                          enemies would have you believe. <br>  <br> To be frank with you, we want to right our economy by educating our people
                          better.  Previously, only our foreign service people cried for help but now
                          all people do so.  Thus, all of us tell foreigners about this shortage or
                          that shortage, and take them to the worst place for them to see.  In the
                          past, foreign visitors were taken to the best show places and people were taught
                          to say that they were living well.  But now faced with the economic
                          isolation forced on us by our enemy, we need foreign aids and present sad
                          pictures to foreign visitors.  </p>
              <p>It is true that the shortage of electricity is indeed acute here. We had
                          ample electricity when Leader Kim Il Sung was alive.  You may wonder why is
                          it that we are short of electric power now?   The reason is
                          simple.  We had natural floods several years in a row, which was
                          unprecedented in our history, and our coal mines got flooded.  We could not
                          dig enough coals to keep our thermal power plants going.   That is why
                          we are short of electricity and our people are suffering. Our economy is
                          suffering for lack of electric power because our coal mines are flooded.</p>
              <h3>Our nation is the cleanest in the world</h3>
              <p>Our country has an excellent political system and beautiful rivers and
                          mountains. The South Korean devils are dying to lay their hands on our
                          rivers.  Ironically, our people are so used to our rivers and mountains
                          that they don't appreciate what they have.  Someday they will learn that
                          water is more precious than heavy oil. </p>
              <p>We have students from China attending our schools.  The Chinese students
                          are impressed by how clean Pyongyang and the adjacent towns are compared to
                          places in China.   The Chinese students say that China used to be
                          clean until about ten years ago when industrial reforms and fast expansion began
                          to pollute the environment and destroy scenic places.  The Chinese people
                          are belatedly trying to reverse the trend. </p>
              <p>We are not isolationists but we want to keep the status quo. We don't want
                          hordes of tourists to come here and spread AID and pollute our land.  Some
                          Chongryon traders came here via Beijing.  They say Beijing is no place to
                          live.  I don't think there is any country that is as unpolluted as our
                          nation is.  Our people don't appreciate it but people from other nations
                          who come here appreciate what we have here. Once we get on own feet and start
                          harvesting enough rice for our people, we would have nothing we would want from
                          other nations.</p>
              <h3>We admire the capitalist legal system </h3>
              <p>In a capitalist nation, people abide by the law from cradle to grave. All
                          persons must obey the law and the law is enforced universally.  Our people
                          have incorrect understanding of how our laws should work.  In a socialist
                          country, Party organs, government officials, and social groups are keen on
                          political indoctrination but little attention is paid to the laws of the
                          land.   Revisionists utilize this weakness and weaken socialist
                          systems by over-emphasizing laws and ignoring political indoctrination. 
                          Gorbachov brought down the Soviet Union using this tactic.  Today, the
                          Chinese leaders are on the same path. </p>
              <p>As you comrades know so well, having lived in a capitalist nation for so
                          long, people in a capitalist society must obey the law no matter where they
                          live.  Chongryon, too, must obey the Japanese laws, otherwise the Japanese
                          police will crack down.  Civil laws are stronger than Party rules but we
                          have no civil laws here.  Some people in our country claim to be socialists
                          but they commit criminal acts.  This is a glaring weakness of our system.</p>
              <p>In a capitalist nation, police go around wielding clubs and give the
                          impression that people fear the police. The truth is that it is the prosecutors
                          that people fear the most.  Our people don't know which is which, they
                          don't know who has more authority.  This is one of the shortcomings of a
                          socialist nation. </p>
              <p>It is important that Chongryon study the Japanese laws and take advantage of
                          them.  At the same time, Chongryon must embrace fellow Koreans of all
                          social strata and new generations of Koreans, and educate them
                          effectively.  I hear that our cruiseship Mangyong 92 has to cater to
                          Japanese businessmen and bribe the police with large sums of money in order to
                          get anything loaded.  In our country, a few hundred dollars are enough to
                          bribe some security officers.  This shows in a way how bad our judicial
                          system is in comparison to that of a capitalist nation.</p>
              <p>In our nation today, people are at the center of the society and enjoy free
                          creative living. But we must make our nation into a nation governed by laws.
                          Today, Party cadres and security officers operate outside the law without
                          exception. Party members are citizens of our Republic and they too must obey the
                          laws.     </p>
              <p>In a capitalist nation, money talks and everything involves money.  We
                          don't want this aspect of a capitalist system. But one thing we admire in a
                          capitalist system is the law, which all citizens obey and and which maintains
                          the social  order.  Recently, some Western devils came to China on
                          joint ventures.  After a few months in China, they left complaining that
                          the Chinese laws changed so often that it was impossible to do business in
                          China.  In China, there are layers of legal entities that pass laws: thus,
                          the Beijing city government passes a law, a few days later, the Chinese joint
                          venture partners make changes in the agreement, and on top of these, the central
                          government in Beijing issues a new law.  The laws are then revamped within
                          a year.  A Swiss textile company was so exasperated with the Chinese laws,
                          it abandoned its investments in China and left in disgust.  The Swiss
                          partner asked our ambassador to China - :"What's so great about
                          socialism?"</p>
              <p>In a capitalist nation, even the prime minister and the president are
                          prosecuted if they break the law.  We must study how to strengthen our
                          legal system.  Japanese police fear the prosecutors. Who do the prosecutors
                          fear? Do they fear the police?  You said that the police will go after any
                          prosecutor who breaks the law. Few prosecutors have been arrested in
                          Japan.  The main reason is the strict selection process of a prosecutor.
                          Law graduates take tough exams to become lawyers, judges or prosecutors. Thus
                          only the best get to become prosecutors or judges.</p>
              <h3>People who know nothing get top jobs and order people around</h3>
              <p>Any graduate of middle school can become a cop but one must pass an exam to
                          become a prosecutor. Therefore, cops and prosecutors are miles apart in
                          qualifications. In our nation, any college graduate can become a prosecutor, if
                          the college so wishes.   Because of this, prosecutors in our nation
                          carry no special authority.  In a capitalist nation, prosecutors are sworn
                          to uphold the law and defend the nation. Tanaka Kakuei, a former Japanese prime
                          minister, was arrested by a prosecutor.   </p>
              <p>Law graduates must pass a special exam in order to become prosecutors, and
                          only the best qualified people should become prosecutors.  Currently,
                          prosecutors are appointed just like other jobs and they stay chummy with their
                          former classmates.  It is tough to wield any authority for prosecutors in
                          this kind of system.  Today, college graduates are assigned to Party
                          offices and government ministries although they have little to no work
                          experience.  We must institute a qualification exam system.  </p>
              <p>In our foreign ministry, workers are classed 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and so on. 
                          But other ministries have no such ranks. In organs like the Foreign Economic
                          Cooperation, anyone who knows Kim Guk Tae can join his outfit.  We need to
                          change this and require specific knowledge of foreign trades of all workers of
                          the Cooperation.  There ought to be qualifying exams and only those who
                          pass them should work there.  I hear the Chinese are implementing this kind
                          of exams.</p>
              <p>If you look at the workers in our economy sector, you see many greenhorns
                          sitting at the top telling seasoned workers what to do. The people under them
                          are not happy about taking orders from people who have no idea what they are
                          doing.  Once I had the son of Kim Man Jung, who was in charge of Chongryon
                          business in the Iwade Prefecture, placed with the Foreign Economic
                          Cooperation.  I thought that since he had lived in Japan for so long, he
                          would know something about foreign trades. But he didn't. He knew nothing about
                          foreign trades. </p>
              <p>For the time being, until we train our own people, we must bring in overseas
                          Koreans with expertise in foreign trades and give them responsible jobs. 
                          In China, one of Deng Shioping's great feats was to send 2000 or so students
                          abroad annually to study and upon their return, they were given important
                          jobs.  In achieving economy reforms, Deng realized that China did not have
                          enough trained people to pull it off, and he had to have people trained by
                          foreign experts.</p>
              <p>We have people at the top who don't have even the vaguest idea on how to get
                          our economy moving.  All they are able to think about is how much pay they
                          are getting.  Such is our sad situation and we must change it fast. Many of
                          our workers have poor or no concepts of money.  They are completely in the
                          dark on making profits.  They know about meeting production quota but they
                          have no idea how to sell the products and make profits.</p>
              <p>As I mentioned earlier there are several things we must learn from capitalist
                          nations. First of all, we must learn to abide by the law; secondly, we must
                          learn to use the best products ourselves and sell inferior products abroad - we
                          do just the opposite, we sell our best products and keep inferior
                          ones.   </p>
              <p>In Japan, export goods are inferior to the goods consumed in Japan. This is
                          true of cigarettes and other merchandises.  I had a Sony recorder of the
                          best quality bought in France and another Sony of the same type in Japan. The
                          one bought in Japan was much superior to the one bought in France.  </p>
              <p>American computers made in the United States work better and last
                          longer.  But the Macintosh sold to foreign customers are assembled in
                          Ireland and other nations and they are of poor quality and break down
                          often.  For a year or two, we thought the machines had no difference and
                          bought them from Ireland. Later we bought some machines from the United States
                          and found that they were different.  Even the keyboards were different.</p>
              <p>We suck on our fingers to kill our hunger pain and sell the best of our local
                          products. As if this were not enough, we sell our sands, water, and other
                          natural resources.  Some people tell me that in the future water will
                          become the most important commodity.  You can live without crude oil but we
                          cannot live without water.  I would like to tell people that our water
                          resources are more valuable than our oil reserves.</p>
