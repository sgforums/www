              <p>Actually, they need Obama to sign a Presidential Finding to authorize a hit on the mad Kim. Assassination as foreign policy is banned under the Executive Order 12333 unless the President waive it off. Trouble is Obama is more on dialogue than going through the dirty route.</p>

              <p>Well, The US will never adopt the same policy for every single threat in the world today. Like Israel for example, they need Hamas and Hezbollah as a focus of fear so that they could justify their actions like expanding their settlements in the West Bank. Imagine if the Hezbollah and Hamas are removed from the equation, they have no justification for their occupation of Golan Heights or an excuse for destabilizing the Palestinian Authority rule by destroying totally the infrastructure for the Palestinians to create a separate state. Every rocket attack by Hamas is met by unequal force of destruction by the Israelis. Want a peaceful Middle East? Remove Hamas and Hezbollah by covert means and push a secular and more peaceful leader to put the peace process back on track. Engage Iran in diplomacy and covertly push for mainstream Mullahs to be in power, like Khatami.</p>
              <p>AL-Qaeda and Usama Bin Laden?  i dont believe the mightiest superpower in the world today cannot be able to track this elusive tall man with a kidney problem. They need him to be around so that they can push the element of fear in the civilians so they would not vote against any draconian laws they push, like the Patriot Act. A new-age bogey man.</p>
              <p>North Korea? They could have finished the job during the Korean War in 50s, But when MacArthur the General who was the commander of the campaign push for an all out aggressive defeat of the North, he was villified and removed from command and instead a truce is signed keeping the Korean Peninsula is the constant fear of all out war. Communism was the bogeyman in 40s-90s like how terrorism is during this era.</p>

              <p>N.Korea is a failed state. Regardless if it a communist or democratic state, it is the people who determined their leaders. If communism works, and the people are well fed, then it is their right to deny democracy and no one other nation should interfere in that country.</p>
              <p>But eversince 1953, communism had failed that country and kept the masses impoverised and starving for decades. Yet the people had failed to overthrow their political leaders. Repressional scare tactics are not an excuse, for no matter how mighty the political leaders are, how militarily equipped they are, they are still only a minority and can be overwelhmed.</p>
              <p>That the people do not, then they must share in the responsibility that their leaders had undertaken, and that is to destroy S.Korea with their nukes as well as releasing radio-active dust into our wind driven atmosphere, contaminating fellow asian states.</p>
              <p>The nutcase Kim and his elites will be <span style="text-decoration: underline;">hiding underground</span> should an military response be meted out by its surrounding nations in an act of defence to N.Korean belligerance. He does not mind the millions dead, even his soldiers, for it would mean lesser mouths to feed and be responsible for, when another armistic is declared. He and his elites will survive.</p>
              <p>But many of the ordinary N.Koreans will be dead. Therefore it behooves the people, including the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">soon to go hungry soldiers</span>,  to rise up now to overthrow the political masters. No one else can help them now except themselves.</p>
              <p>Once the shooting begins, there will be no mercy from the outside world and will be meet with corresponding responses. Victims' families, relatives and friends will demand of it or they will topple their own political leaders.</p>
              <p>Either way, the ordinary N.Koreans will lose their lives, but if they overthrow their inept political leaders now, more need not die in an outright act of war nutcase Kim is leading them into.</p>
              <p>There is no other way to stop Kim and his active spies already in S.Korea. The flashpoint of no return will happen anytime. Only the ordinary people can stop this madness.</p>
              <p>Online pettitions, leaflets, radio communications, etc must <span style="text-decoration: underline;">immediately </span>be broadcasted to the N.Korean people, or it will the greatest tragedy that will happen to humanity after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. This time is for real. </p>

              <h4>War Crisis in the 1960s</h4>
              <p>On December 2, 1967, USS Pueblo manned by Capt. Lloyd M. Bucher, six
              officers and 75 enlisted men of the US Navy and two civilians left the
              US naval base at Sasebo (Japan) on a spy mission. 50 days later at
              13:45 hours, North Korea dispatched 4 P4 patrol boats and 2 MiG
              fighters to capture the American spy ship. One American sailor was
              killed during the capture.</p>
              <p>Kim Jong Il personally directed this operation. Park In Ho, a
              People's Hero, participated in the operation as a marine and recalls:
              "We asked them for their nationality but they turned a search light on
              us and came toward us. They probably thought that no one would dare to
              mess with the Americans. They were mistaken. Our 7-men marine unit
              boarded the ship and captured all 80 of them in no time at all".</p>
              <p>This was the first time an American warship was captured
              intact by the enemy in its 106-year history. The national security
              advisers met at the White House in rage. They considered the Pueblo
              capture a war provocation and wanted nuclear retaliation. According to
              then Secretary of Defense Clark Clifford, some hot heads wanted to drop
              nuclear bombs on Pyongyang. However, the cool heads prevailed.
              President Lyndon B. Johnson determined that America was in no position
              to engage in two wars - one in Vietnam and another in Korea.</p>
              <p>Johnson's first move was to ask the Soviet Union to press North Korea
              to release Pueblo and her crew. Accordingly, the Soviets asked North
              Korea to comply with the US demand. But Kim Jong Il rebuffed the Soviet
              pressure and retorted that: "We will punish anyone who violates our
              territory in accordance with our law. They came on their own will but
              they will not be allowed to leave at will."</p>
              <p>Kim Il Sung recalled: "Comrade Kim Jong Il told me that he will
              not release the captured Americans unless they signed a surrender
              document. We will keep Pueblo as a war trophy even after they sign the
              document. Pueblo will some day be made into a museum so that our future
              generations will remember our deeds."</p>
              <p>The Americans were enraged and debated the following plans of action:</p>
              <ol type="a">
              <li>We will let North Korea know that we have mean ways to retaliate. </li>
              <li>We will impose air surveillance up to 80 km north of the DMZ. </li>
              <li>We will continue naval intelligence using the spy ship Banner. </li>
              <li>We will salvage the secret assets dumped into the sea by the Pueblo crew. </li>
              <li>We will close off Wonsan by seeding 83 mines. </li>
              <li>We will capture North Korean warships. </li>
              <li>We will bomb the North Korean naval base at Mun-pyong-ri. </li>
              <li>We will attack the KPA 6th Division HQ located 10 km north of the DMZ. </li>
              <li>We will blockade North Korea. </li>
              </ol>
              <p>The United States dispatched three carrier battle groups to Korea
              and deployed strategic bombers for nuclear attacks on North Korea. USS
              Enterprise accompanied by 16 destroyers and battleships operated in
              waters 50 miles south of Ullung-do. In addition, the United States had
              372 war planes ready to attack North Korea. For the first time since
              the Cuban crisis, a Presidential executive order was issued to mobilize
              15,000 air reservists.</p>
              <p>North Korea at the time was armed with conventional weapons
              only, but it refused to back down. On the contrary, it went on the
              offensive. At 21:00 hours of April 14th, 1968, North Korean troops
              attacked American and South Korean troops at Dae Sung-dong south of
              Panmunjom. They killed two Americans, two South Koreans and wounded
              several. From 1967 to 1969, four such attacks occurred killing 11
              Americans.</p>
              <p>It was the United States that blinked first. US Army Gen.
              Gilbert H. Woodward was forced to sign a surrender document on behalf
              of the United States Government and accepted 82 POWs and one corpse at
              a Panmumjom ceremony. This was December 23, 1968. Some 30 years from
              this day, the USS Pueblo is still in North Korea.¦</p>
              <p>In December 1998, Kim Jong Il had Pueblo moved from Wonsan to
              Dae-dong-gang, where another American warship Gen. Sherman was sunk in
              September 1866. Pueblo is moored at the site of the sinking as a
              witness to the continued aggression of the United States.</p>
              <p>On April 15, 1969, an American EC-121 spy plane took off from an air
              base at Azuki (Japan). The plane carried 30 US Navy officers and
              enlisted men and one US marine. It flew along the east coast of North
              Korea on a spy mission. The plane lost radar contacts near Chung-jin at
              about 14:00 hours. About one hour and 55 min later, Radio Pyongyang
              announced that the Korean People's Army shot down the spy plane with a
              ground-to-air missile. The plane went down with its crew into the depth
              of the East Sea. Kim Jong Il commanded this operation.</p>
              <p>Richard Nixon accused Lyndon Johnson of mishandling the Pueblo affair,
              but soon after his inauguration, Nixon was unexpectedly handed the
              EC-121 incident. Nixon dispatched two carrier battle groups to Korea
              and stationed F-4 fighter-bombers on South Korean bases.</p>
              <p>As in the case of Pueblo, North Korea refused to be intimated
              by the American show of force and went on its own show of force. On
              August 17, barely 4 months after the spy plane incident, the North
              Korean Army shot down an American helicopter (OH-23) near
              Hangang. Three of the crewmen were wounded and captured alive. On
              December 3, 1969, the United States signed a letter of apology for the
              release of the crew.</p>
              <h4>(c) War Crisis of the 1970's</h4>
              <p>In June 1976, the United
              Stated began Team Spirit military exercises aimed at waging nuclear war
              on North Korea. On August 18th, less than two months after the exercise
              began, three American officers, 7 enlisted men and 5 Korean workers
              appeared at the Bridge of No Return. They claimed that a large poplar
              tree near the bridge got in the way of an American observation post and
              proceeded to chop down the tree. Earlier on August 6th, they tried to
              cut down the tree but North Korean soldiers chased them away. A North
              Korean officer told the group to stop cutting the tree, but the
              American officers refused to obey and started a quarrel.</p>
              <p>Kim Jong Il ordered that the Americans should be taught a lesson. He
              also told the troops not to harm the South Korean workers. The North
              Korean officer took off his wrist watch and knocked down an American
              officer in charge with one blow, whereupon, another American officer
              grabbed an axe from a Korean worker and threw it at the North Korean
              officer. The North Korean caught the axe in the air and axed the
              American to death. An American captain and a lieutenant were killed and
              eight Americans were injured.</p>
              <p>It is interesting to note that the whole event was video-taped
              by the Americans from an observation post. Another point to note is
              that even though an American quick reaction force unit stood nearly,
              the order to counter-attack never came. The US released only the part
              of the video that showed the North Korean officer axing the Americans
              and hid the scenes leading to it from the public. The world opinion
              sympathized with the Americans and the North Koreans were shown to be
              barbaric savages. The Non-Aligned Nations Conference at Colombo voted
              down North Korea's demand for US troop withdrawal and confederal union
              of Korea on the same day.</p>
              <p>The US Commander in Korea, Gen. Richard Stilwell, was vacationing in
              Japan at the time and upon hearing the news of the axe killings, he
              rushed back to Korea in the back seat of a fighter plane. The United
              States again dispatched a carrier battle group and strategic bombers to
              Korea on account of a poplar tree under the code name Operation Paul
              Bunyan. The Americans moved tactical nukes to the DMZ area in plain
              view of the North Koreans. B52 bombers loaded with nuclear bombs left
              Okinawa and flew toward Pyongyang. They would make sharp u-turns upon
              reaching the skies over the DMZ. Kim Jong Il was not impressed and
              laughed at the American moves.</p>
              <p>On August 21, about 7 O'clock in the morning, a company of US army
              engineers escorted by US and South Korean special forces units arrived
              at the poplar tree. 20 troop carrying helicopters protected by 7 armed
              helicopters hovered above. The North Koreans fired at the command
              helicopter carrying the American commander (Gen. Brady), which
              crash-landed. Later that day, an emergency meeting was held at
              Panmunjum and North Korea handed a memo from the North Korean Supreme
              Commander to the UN Commander.</p>
              <p>The United States contracted the Science Applications, Inc. (SAI) to
              research nuclear war on North Korea. According to the SAI report, the
              United States must destroy with nuclear weapons at least 30% of North
              Korea's tanks, artillery and other equipment, 40% of the troops and 50%
              of its communication systems. The report went on to say that at least
              30 nuclear bombs must be fired from 15 km from Seoul.</p>
              <p>From 1960 to 1970, the United States was engaged in Vietnam and
              had no resources to fight another war in Korea. But 1970 heralded the
              end of the Vietnam War and the United States
              ratched up its nuclear threats on North Korea. US helicopters ferried
              nuclear weapons from storage locations some 35 to 50 miles south of the
              DMZ. In 1975, the United States, fearing North Korean attacks on its
              nukes at the DMZ, relocated them to rear areas.</p>
              <p>In June 1975, US Secretary of Defense James Schlesinger said
              that in case of a North Korean attack, the United States would mount
              nuclear attacks or drastically increase its ground troops. Gen. James
              Hollingsworth stated that the US had a '9-day war plan', according to
              which North Korea would be defeated in a few days in a violent clash
              with 700-800 air sorties.</p>
              <p>On the occasion of Park Jung Hee's assassination on October 26,
              1979, the United States dispatched a carrier battle group to the waters
              of Chejudo and on November 14th, it dropped 11 life-size dummy nuclear
              bombs in a practice run.</p>
              <h4>(d) War Crisis of the 1980s</h4>
              <p>The Reagan's hard line
              administration made the Korean situation worse. The United States
              practiced its deep strike and air-land battle doctrine in Korea. The
              United States expanded combat troops to 191,700, of which 118,000 were
              Koreans and 73,700 were Americans.</p>
              <p>What did North Korea do to counter the US threats?</p>
              <p>First, in 1983, North Korea moved its strike forces stationed at north of Pyongyang and Wonsan to the front areas.</p>
              <p>Second, North Korea conducted three joint naval exercises with the
              Soviet navy from 1986 to 1989. The Soviet Union was leaning toward
              detente with America at the time and these joint exercises were
              ineffectual.</p>
              <p>Third, North Korea proposed a 3-party peace conference of North, South
              and the United States. North Korea for the first time was willing to
              negotiate with South Korea, but the United States turned down this
              proposal.</p>

              <h6 class="dateline">March 4, 2003</h6>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Four North Korean fighter jets intercepted </strong></span>an unarmed United States
              Air Force spy plane on a surveillance mission over the Sea of Japan on
              Saturday,<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> and came within 50 feet of the American aircraft</strong></span>, military
              officials said today.</p>
              <p>The <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>fighters shadowed the spy plane,
              an RC-135S Cobra Ball, for 22 minutes in</strong></span> international airspace about
              150 miles off the North Korean coast, said Lt. Cmdr. Jeff Davis, a
              Pentagon spokesman. No shots were fired, officials said...</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/04/world/north-korea-mig-s-intercept-us-jet-on-spying-mission.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/04/world/north-korea</a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In contrast, North Korea has not only the military power but also the political
              will to wage total war against the United States. North Korea has made it clear
              that it will strike all US targets with all means, if the US
              mounted military attacks on North Korea. </p>
              <p>That<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> North Korea's threat is no
              bluff can be seen from the aggressive actions taken by North Korea </strong></span>since the
              Korean War armistice, most recent of which is North Korea's attempt to capture
              an American spy plane.</p>
              <p>In the morning of<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> March 1, 2003, an American RC-132S spy
              plane, <em>Cobra Ball,</em>  took off from a US airbase in Okinawa</strong></span>, and cruised along the East coast of North Korea collecting electronic signals. The
              US intelligence suspected that North Korea was about to test a long-range
              missile and the plane was there to monitor the suspected missile launch. </p>
              <p>When the US plane reached a point about 193 km from the coast of North Korea,
              two MiG-29 and two MiG-21 fighter planes showed up unexpectedly. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The North Korean planes approached
              within 16 m and signaled the US plane to follow them. </strong></span> The US pilot refused
              to follow the command and left the scene posthaste. The US plane was tailed by
              the hostiles for about 22 min but let the US spy plane go.  There are two key points to be
              observed here.</p>
              <p>First, the hostile planes waited for the US plane at the Uhrang airbase,
              located about 200 km from the point of air encounter.  They knew that the
              US plane was coming.  The North Korean planes flew 200 km to intercept the
              US plane. Did the US plane see them coming?  <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>If it did, why no
              evasive action?  </strong></span>After intercepting the US plane, the hostile planes dogged
              it for 22 min.  Why no American planes for the rescue?  The US crew
              must have informed the base of the danger they were in, but no action was taken
              by the base.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>  If Kim Jong Il had given the command, the MiGs would have
              shot down the US plane and returned to their base before the US could have
              scrambled war planes. </strong></span></p>
              <p>Second, North Korea intercepted an American spy plane flying 200 km from its
              coast.  According to the international norm, a nation's territorial air
              space extends 19 km from its coast line.  The US is the exception and
              claims air space of 370 km from its coast line; any foreign airplane violating
              this extended air space is challenged or shot down by the US military.</p>
              <h3>2. North Korea's Massive Retaliation Strategy</h3>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>North Korea's war plan in case of an US attack is total war</strong></span>, not the
              'low-intensity limited warfare' or 'regional conflict' talked about among the
              Western analysts. North Korea will mount a total war if attacked by the US.
              There are three aspects to this war plan...</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>The mass-circulation daily in Seoul, The Choson Ilbo, reported on May
                      23 (early edition) that the Rodong-1 ballistic missile test-fired by

              <p>Mark Kirk tells his story on this missile test in 1993:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>WASHINGTON (AP) -- When the subject is whether the United States needs a missile defense system,<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> Rep. Mark Kirk harks back to a haunting night in the Pentagon's intelligence center.</strong></span><br><br>As a Naval Reserve lieutenant commander, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Kirk was the sole Navy man on duty when North Korea unexpectedly launched a test missile in 1993.</strong></span><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br>``Suddenly an alarm went off,'' </strong></span>Kirk, R-Ill., said recently of that sweat-soaked night. A dozen terrifying minutes passed before officials concluded the missile was not a threat.<br><br>Kirk was horrified that only two options were available in case of a real attack -- to let a U.S. city be destroyed and millions of Americans be killed with no response, or to retaliate and kill millions of foreigners as well.<br><br>Like Kirk, other lawmakers and administration officials, holding fast to the idea that experience is a great teacher, often cite their backgrounds and trips to far-flung lands to bolster their views on missile defense.<br><br>In Kirk's case, since that night in the Pentagon, he has advocated a third option: knocking the incoming missile out of the sky...</p>

              <p><br>There is no doubt for the need to see the other side of the coin. It should be the way for a healthy debate to be conducted.</p>
              <p>But the way Uncle Chia has been doing is not the way to do it, because:-</p>
              <p>1. Those are copyrighted material, or at least written by someone else and he has no right to use it without the author's permission. This is wrong. Providing a link is ok, but copy and paste whole sections is not.</p>
              <p>2. More critically, it shows Uncle Chia is fully incapable of his own critical thinking and need to use other's writing to support his thesis. A few words here and there is normal, but whole sections?</p>
              <p>This does not bode well for our society and individuals. It doesnt matter if one's language used is not up to par, for this forum is not a literary heaven anyway, but what is more vital is his communication to his fellow citizens. Plaguarising and copying will not help him improve himself, but will only hinder his further development as a concern citizen.</p>
              <p>In the end, it is his choice, the freedom to learn or to continue in ignorance.</p>
