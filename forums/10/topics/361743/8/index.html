              <p>If that is the case, dont you think from the logical point of view, all nuclear weapons should be destroyed &amp; banned forever for the sake of mankind. (Please read my 1st post on this issue dated 28.05.09).</p>

              <p>I fully agree with you that ALL nukes should be destroyed and banned forever for the sake of mankind.</p>
              <p>But how can the superpowers even begin to talk about nuke disarmament when planet Earth's mother son two bit dictators are secretly building up their nuke arsenals? The superpowers tried a few times with the SALT talks, and there was hope when Yeltsin administered Russia, but not now, with greater proliferation.</p>
              <p>There are some who believe that every nation should own nukes, then if each knows each other has them, then they will not use them, for it would mean MAD ( Mutually Aided Destruction)</p>
              <p>But this is a fallacy, for humans are not perfect, let alone leaders of nations as nutcase Kim had proven. He is willing to sacrifice his starving people in a nuke provocation to protect his rule (misrule). He only needs to hide under well built shelters and when the bomb drops, millions die. When the dust is settled, he walks out a free man, to postuer and sue for peace with the balance of his nukes.</p>
              <p>How many more leaders of the tripe that are similar with nutcase Kim? Many more, I assure you, from 3 world impoverish states, impoverished only because of their corruption, mismanagement and anti-humanity ideologies.</p>
              <p>I am no greenpeace peacenik or tree hugger. I believe military deterrence will protect peace, but nukes are too far a terrifying and awesome force to be held in hands of humanity, no matter how lofty in idealism a leader is.</p>
              <p>Thus we MUST prevent nuke proliferation today, starting with nutcase kim. Realistically, I may not live long enough to see planet Earth nuke free, but in time with patience and advancement of science, the horror of nukes will be removed and rendered obsolute, such as space based weapons or lasers.</p>

              <div class="articleSubTitle"><br></div>
              <div class="articleSubTitle"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia,palatino;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><em>What
                  do you think about Israel's assault on the Gaza Strip? What might be
                  done in order to achieve a peaceful solution to the conflict between
                  Israel and Palestine?</em><br><br>The US-Israeli attack on Gaza was a
                  savage and brutal war crime. The term US- Israeli is accurate. Israel
                  relied on US weapons, in violation of US, as well as international,
                  law, and the US provided crucial diplomatic and ideological support. </span></span><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia,palatino;">The
                  diplomatic support included blocking UN efforts to bring the conflict
                  to an end. The ideological support included overwhelming votes in
                  Congress supporting the aggression, and almost universal agreement that
                  it was justified, even if, perhaps, disproportionate.<br><br>In fact,
                  the attack was completely without justification. The way this issue is
                  framed -- by President Obama and virtually everyone else -- is that
                  Israel had a right to defend itself against Hamas rockets. But that is
                  not the issue at all.<br><br>The issue is whether Israel had a right to
                  defend itself by force against rockets. It is universally agreed that
                  force can be used only when peaceful means are exhausted. No one
                  believes that the Nazis had the right to use force in defence against
                  the terror of the partisans.<br><br>In this case peaceful means had not
                  even been tried. A narrow choice would have been for Israel to accept a
                  ceasefire, which in fact it has never done. To take only the most
                  recent case, a ceasefire was declared in June 2008. Israel did not
                  adhere to it: it maintained the harsh siege, which is an act of war,
                  even preventing the UN humanitarian mission UNRWA from replenishing its
                  stores, "so when the ceasefire broke down, we ran out of food for the
                  750,000 who depend on us," UNRWA Director John Ging reported.
                  Nevertheless, Hamas scrupulously observed the ceasefire. Israeli
                  government spokesman Mark Regev conceded that Hamas had not fired a
                  single rocket until after Israel invaded the Gaza Strip on 4 November,
                  under the cover of the US elections, and killed six Palestinians.
                  Israel rejected additional ceasefire proposals from Hamas virtually
                  until the day of the attack.<br><br>More broadly, Israel could have
                  ceased its criminal activities in the other part of Palestine, the West
                  Bank. Until they do that they cannot object to resistance. Within the
                  West Bank resistance is impossible. In fact, the US-run Palestinian
                  military forces were able to suppress even expression of support for
                  Palestinians being slaughtered in Gaza, and they are greatly praised
                  for that achievement by leading Democratic liberals close to the Obama
                  administration, like Senator John Kerry, chair of the Senate Foreign
                  Relations Committee.</span></span></div>
              <div class="articleSubTitle"><br></div>
              <div class="articleSubTitle"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia,palatino;">Virtually
                  everything Israel does in the occupied territories is criminal, and the
                  Israeli government knows it. Immediately after the 1967 war Israel was
                  informed by its highest legal authorities that the Geneva Conventions
                  apply to the occupied territories, so that any transfer of population
                  there is illegal. Defence Minister Moshe Dayan conceded that settlement
                  violated international law, but added that "there is nothing new in
                  that, so we will continue." The Security Council has repeatedly
                  condemned these actions, including those now taking place in Jerusalem.
                  In 2004 the World Court reaffirmed that the Geneva Conventions apply.
                  The US Justice Department agreed, in a separate declaration. The
                  criminality extends to most of what Israel does in the occupied
                  territories, always with firm US military, diplomatic, economic and
                  ideological support.<br><br>In brief, Israel had ample opportunity to
                  employ peaceful means, so that there was no justification whatsoever
                  for the US- Israeli attack.<br><br>As for what should be done, that is
                  very clear. For 35 years there has been a very broad international
                  consensus on a political settlement: a two-state settlement on the
                  internationally recognised borders, perhaps with "minor and mutual
                  modifications", in the words of official US policy pre-1971, before the
                  US broke with world opinion on this matter. Since that time the US has
                  blocked the consensus, and still does, including Barack Obama. There
                  has been one break in this rejectionist stand. After the Camp David
                  negotiations broke down in 2000, President Clinton recognised that no
                  Palestinians could accept the US-Israeli terms, and proposed his
                  "parameters": somewhat vague, but more forthcoming. He then stated that
                  both sides had accepted the parameters, and both had expressed
                  reservations. The two sides met in Taba, Egypt in January 2001, and
                  came very close to an agreement. In their final press conference, they
                  said that with a little more time they might have resolved all of the
                  issues. The negotiations were called off prematurely by Israeli Prime
                  Minister Ehud Barak, and never officially resumed. Much has changed
                  since 2001 but the essentials remain: if a US president were willing to
                  accept a diplomatic settlement, it could be achieved. The international
                  consensus is by no means perfect, but it would be a great improvement
                  over the current situation, and could be a stage towards something
                  better for both Jews and Palestinians.<br><br><em>In a recent interview
                  published in Znet you made an extraordinary comment on the current
                  financial crisis and capitalism, arguing that "capitalism can't end
                  because it never started". Why has neo-liberalism resulted, especially
                  in the US and some EU countries, with state intervention in the
                  economy? And what risks now face developing countries like Turkey?</em></span></span></div>
              <div class="articleSubTitle"><br></div>
              <div class="articleSubTitle"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia,palatino;">First
                  we have to dismantle illusions about state intervention in the economy.
                  In the US, as in other advanced economies, the economy relies very
                  heavily on the dynamic state sector for innovation, development,
                  procurement, bail outs, and many other methods. Take what we are now
                  using: computers and the Internet. They were developed largely in the
                  state sector, for decades, before they became a source of private
                  profit in the market. That is not an exception, it is the norm. What is
                  novel in the present crisis is the scale of state intervention, in
                  particular to subsidise the financial institutions, although such
                  intervention is also familiar from the past. One basic principle of
                  what is called capitalism is that the public pays the costs and takes
                  the risks while profit is privatised.<br><br>It is true that the very
                  shallow intellectual foundations of the neo-liberal era have collapsed,
                  in particular, the mythical efficient market hypothesis -- the belief
                  that by some miracle markets will take care of problems that arise. Of
                  course, the principle was never adopted by the rich for themselves.
                  Ronald Reagan has been anointed the high priest of free markets. In the
                  real world, he was by far the most protectionist US president in
                  post-war US history, called upon the Pentagon to instruct backward US
                  management in advanced Japanese-style production techniques, and in
                  other ways acted to ensure the wealth and power of the private sector.
                  Obama is doing the same. Simon Johnson, former chief economist of the
                  IMF, is quite right when he criticises the Obama administration for
                  following the dictates of Wall Street, acting to ensure that the
                  institutions that created the crisis remain intact. Obama's chief
                  advisers include those who share primary responsibility for the crisis,
                  as the business press and others have observed. More independent
                  voices, including Nobel Laureates in economics, have been excluded.<br><br>Though
                  the crisis broke out in the US it quickly became global. The US will
                  not emerge unscathed, but it may well be strengthened relative to its
                  major competitors, the European Union and Japan. China and India are a
                  separate matter.<br><br><em>What do you think about the election of Obama? Will US policies change radically?</em><br><br>My
                  own expectation, based on Obama's record and his campaign, was that he
                  would be a familiar centrist Democrat who would draw back from the most
                  extreme Bush policies and try to remedy the serious damage that Bush
                  did to US standing in the world, in part by a change of rhetoric, in
                  part by some small gestures. That is a fair summary of what has
                  happened so far.<br><br><em>A few weeks ago you joined those
                  intellectuals criticising Human Rights Watch's report on Venezuela,
                  saying it "does not meet even the most minimal standards of
                  scholarship, impartiality, accuracy, or credibility". What do you see
                  as the future of human rights?</em><br><br>The authors of the report
                  were leading Latin American scholars. I agreed with its basic thrust
                  and signed. There has been a vigorous debate online between HRW and the
                  authors since. I think the essential criticism is accurate. Human
                  rights organisations have generally played a very beneficial role: with
                  regard to Turkey, for example, where the HRW representative, Jonathan
                  Sugden, carried out extremely important and honourable work, I was able
                  to appreciate this on the scene (he has since been expelled). But there
                  are occasions when they have been much too influenced by pressures
                  coming from funders and the great powers, particularly the US.<br><br>I
                  do not see what question one can raise about human rights as a concept:
                  it should be among our highest goals to struggle for the realisation of
                  human rights.<br><br><em>You are a prominent philosopher, well known as
                  a father of modern linguistics, on the one hand, and a leading
                  political and public figure widely known for your views on world
                  politics on the other. How do you view the responsibilities of
                  intellectuals? Is being dissident enough?</em></span></span></div>

              <div class="articleSubTitle"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia,palatino;">The
                  term intellectual is used generally to refer to people with privilege
                  and access to resources who engage in commentary on human affairs. It
                  does not necessarily correlate with insight or understanding. In
                  general, privilege confers responsibility: in particular,
                  responsibility to seek the truth and to meet ethical standards. History
                  reveals that, by and large, intellectuals have been servants of power,
                  radically violating these responsibilities. There are always
                  independent minds that confront the crimes of the powerful and seek to
                  support the victims. They are usually punished in one or another way,
                  depending on the nature of the society. That pattern goes back to the
                  earliest historical records, and persists with rare exceptions, as is
                  easily shown. Contemporary Turkey is one of the striking exceptions. In
                  Turkey leading writers, artists, journalists, academics, publishers and
                  others have taken an unusually strong and courageous stand against the
                  crimes of state and in support of the victims, and many have suffered
                  severely for their honesty. And they have gone far beyond being
                  dissident: they have engaged in courageous and honourable civil
                  disobedience. It was a great privilege for me to be able to take part
                  briefly in some of their activities. But this is rare. I will not run
                  through my personal activities in the US and elsewhere in the past 40
                  years, but they go far beyond dissidence. Much more significant is the
                  fact that the same is true, often far more so, for a great many people
                  who remain unknown but who deserve most of the credit for progress
                  towards justice and peace over the years.<br><br><em>You have argued
                  that consent in the status quo is a media product. How do you reconcile
                  your criticism of the media with your presence within it?</em><br><br>The
                  role of the media in manufacturing consent is very well documented. The
                  phrase, incidentally, is not mine. It is taken from the essays on
                  democracy by Walter Lippmann, the leading American public intellectual
                  of the 20th century, a Wilson- Roosevelt progressive. Lippmann
                  described the "manufacture of consent" as an innovation in the "art of
                  democracy". He recommended these methods. They should be used, he
                  wrote, to control the "ignorant and meddlesome outsiders" -- the
                  general population -- whose "function" in a democracy is to be
                  "spectators", not "participants" in making and implementing decisions.
                  That is a standard theme among elite intellectuals from widely varying
                  sociopolitical systems.<br><br>Like other dissidents I have virtually no access to mainstream media in the US or the West generally.</span></span></div>

              <p>The above was your response to mine:-</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">"Nutcase Kim must go. Wiping him,his general staff and hardcore politburo members out of the equation is the only solution to the problem. Starving N.Koreans, innocent S.Koreans and japanese do not deserve to suffer or die for the ambitions of a few."</span></p>
              <p>Crazy?</p>
              <p>In a section of the order labeled "Restrictions on Intelligence Activities," Ford outlawed political assassination: Section 5(g), entitled "Prohibition on Assassination," states: "No employee of the United States Government shall engage in, or conspire to engage in, political assassination."</p>
              <p>This is a good law and prevents interference with foriegn leaders. If there are no such laws, or only paid lip service, many dictators would have been wiped out but at the same time, it could lead to <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">abuses</span></span> such as leaders who disagree with american policies and aims being wiped out as well.</p>
              <p>Thus such laws must be upheld and protected at all costs.</p>
              <p>But weighted against the death of millions, can such a law be useful and even valid? Can any leader who have such laws in their constitution turn a blind eye to what may be the greatest tragedy to happen on Earth after Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and the perpetrators walk freely?</p>
              <p>There is a loophole within the law. Like any law that is broken by man, that man must be held responsible and face up to the consequences, such as being tried for the crime and hang if found guilty.</p>
              <p>If the US President is afraid to take that responsibility, prefering to maintain clean hands and let millions die whom he had sworn to protect, then destroy the Kim gang and let another take the blame.</p>
              <p>Only US has the best capability and technology avaliable to destroy them, while many others don't.</p>
              <p>But MORE CRITICALLY, in case anyone had failed to notice, it is NO longer a crime to wipe out Kim and gang.</p>
              <p> Do remember that they had withdrawn from the armistice of 1953, meaning technically - NORTH KOREA IS  NOW AT WAR WITH US AND S.KOREA. Any deaths are acts of war. Wiping out Kim and gang is only to prevent more bloodshed. This is something all can comprehend. </p>
              <p> The latest press reports claims no significant troop movements, but the truth is, the significant troop movements ARE ALREADY ENTRENCHED in their positions and special forces team in-place in South Korea for the past 50 years!</p>
              <p>US and South Korea best not be like Neville Chamberlin, asleep or like the Poles sipping coffee, thinking nothing of any threat when Hitler's Panzers crash through the borders of Poland, or worse still, like our ex colonial masters who were dancing in Raffles Hotel when Jap bombs were dropping around them, secure in the belief Spore is an 'impregnable fortress'.</p>

              <p><br>Heath: I think the Soviet Union has a lot of troubles. They are
                      facing domestic economic difficulties and agricultural predicament, and
                      there are also differences within the leadership, over questions of

                      the Soviet Union is busy with its own affairs and unable to deal with
                      Europe, the Middle East, South Asia, China and the Pacific. I think it
                      will lose.<br><br>Heath: However, its military strength is continually
                      augmented. Although the Soviet Union has encountered troubles at many
                      places in the world, its strength is continuing to grow. Therefore, we

                      War II came as the biggest disaster throughout world history. It taught
                      the current generation and those to come their biggest lesson, said Mr.

                      between countries on certain patterns."<br><br>As the President turned to the Ribbentrop-Molotov pact, he made an emphatic remark:<br><br>"We

                      Hitler's Germany, and eventually bring the Baltic countries' annexation.<br><br>"What
                      can I say on that score? We ought to regard it all in its historical
                      context. I dare ask you to get back to the developments of September
                      1938, when notorious agreements were signed in Munich between nazi
                      Germany and West European countries. They came down into history, later
                      on, and are often referred to as 'the Munich plot'."<br><br>The agreements exposed Czechoslovakia to nazi Germany to be devoured.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"> Western partners, in a way, showed Hitler where he ought to turn to

                      wants the Communist Party to get into office. I don’t like their
                      Communist party, just like I don’t like your Communist party. I like
                      you, but not your Communist party. (Laughter)<br><br>In the West you always historically had a policy, for example, in both World Wars you always <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">began by pushing Germany to fight against Russia.</span></span><br><br>Dr.
                      Kissinger: But it is not our policy to push Russia to fight against
                      China, because the danger to us of a war in China is as great as a war
                      in Europe.<br><br>Chairman Mao: (Before Dr. Kissinger’s remarks are
                      translated, he makes remarks in Chinese and counts on his fingers. Miss
                      Tang then translates Dr. Kissinger’s remarks and after that Chairman
                      Mao’s remarks.)<br><br>What I wanted to say is whether or not you are
                      now pushing West Germany to make peace with Russia and then push Russia
                      eastward. I suspect the whole of the West has such an idea, that is to
                      push Russia eastward, mainly against us and also Japan. Also probably
                      towards you, in the Pacific Ocean and the Indian Ocean.<br><br>Dr.
                      Kissinger: We did not favor this policy. We preferred the German
                      opposition party which did not pursue this policy. (Chairman Mao,

                      between Chou En-lai, Premier of China and Dr. Henry A. Kissinger,
                      Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs:<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">PM Chou: Originally Western Europe had hoped that Germany would go eastwards.</span></span><br><br>Dr. Kissinger: Western Europe.<br><br>PM Chou: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">At Munich.</span></span><br><br>Dr. Kissinger: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Yes, at Munich.</span></span> Western Europe had very superficial leaders. They didn’t have the
                      courage to pursue any policy towards a conclusion. Once they had done
                      Munich it made no sense to fight for Poland. But that is a different
                      issue. And I don’t blame Stalin, because from his point of view he
                      gained himself the essential time.<br><br>PM Chou: But there was one weak point, that they were not sufficiently prepared.<br><br>Dr. Kissinger: That is right.<br><br>PM
                      Chou: They did make preparations but they were not entirely sufficient.
                      And in Zhukov’s memoirs he also touched upon this. Have you read this?<br><br>Dr. Kissinger: Yes. And they deployed their forces too far forward.<br><br>PM Chou: Also scattered in three directions.<br><br>Dr.
                      Kissinger: So, but the basic point that I want to make is not to debate
                      history but to say the lessons of both wars are that once a big war
                      starts its consequences are unpredictable, and a country which
                      encourages a big war in the hope that it can calculate its consequences
                      is likely to produce a disaster for itself. The Germans had made very
                      careful plans in World War I, and they had exercised them for 30 years,
                      but when the war . . .<br><br>PM Chou: You mean after the Pact of Berlin?<br><br>Dr. Kissinger: World War I—1914—the Schlieffen Plan.<br><br>PM Chou: You mean after the Treaty of Berlin.<br><br>Dr.
                      Kissinger: Oh, after 1878, yes, that’s right. But they had exercised
                      the Schlieffen Plan every year after 1893, for 21 years, and they had
                      calculated everything except the psychological strain on a commander
                      under battle conditions. So they thought they were starting a 6-months
                      war and they wound up with a 4-year war. Not one European leader in
                      1914, if he had known what the world would look like in 1918, would
                      have gone to war. And nor would Hitler in 1939. Let us apply it to the
                      current situation, these observations. If one analyzes the problem of
                      pushing the Soviet Union toward the East, or maybe you trying to push
                      it towards the West . . .<br><br><a class="postlink" href="http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/100320.pdf">http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/100320.pdf</a><br><a class="postlink" href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ho/frus/nixon/xviii/">http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ho/frus/nixon/xviii/</a><br><br><br>Beijing, October 20, 1975, 4:15–6:35 p.m.<br><br>Talks between Teng Hsiao-p’ing, Vice Premier of the State Council, People’s Republic of China and Henry Kissinger<br><br><br>Secretary Kissinger: What things?<br><br>Vice Premier Teng: Well, problems of various descriptions [mentioned] earlier.<br><br>By

                      I understand, the Doctor once said that in actuality the Soviet Union
                      has gone beyond the Rhineland. This shows that the Doctor has made a
                      study of it. After the Germans entered into the Rhineland you may
                      recall what was the attitude of the British and French, and what was
                      the policy pursued by Chamberlain and Daladier. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">They pursued a policy of appeasement towards Hitler, and shortly after that the Munich agreement was concluded.</span></span><br><br>In pursuing such policies the purpose of Chamberlain and Daladier was obvious.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"> They wanted to direct the peril Eastward, and their first aim was to appease Hitler so that he would not take rash actions. </span></span>Their second aim was <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">to direct the peril toward the East. </span></span>The
                      stark historical realities have brought out the failure of the policies
                      carried out by Chamberlain and Daladier. Their policies have gone to
                      the opposite of their wishes. They neither got international peace and
                      stability nor achieved their purpose of directing the peril of Hitler

              <p>...Severely weakened by the Great Depression and in no position to make
                  military threats, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Chamberlain and Daladier hoped to push Hitler's
                  ambitions eastward.</strong></span> </span>The one unifying belief all four leaders shared was
                  their <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>fanatical hatred of the Soviet Union </strong></span>and anything remotely
                  related to International Communism.</p>
              <p>A strong and well-armed Nazi regime
                  in Central Europe, they believed, was a necessary buffer to Soviet
                  power. And with their own domestic economic crises and their labor
                  unions going communist, France and England focused their attention not
                  on the threat of fascism <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>but on the growing influence of the Soviet
                  Union.</strong></span> (Their positions on the Spanish Civil War bear this fact out.)</p>
              <p>France and<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> England hoped Germany would spark a shooting war with the
                  Soviet Union and then <span style="color: #ff0000;">they could sit back and watch the fascists and
                  communists tear each other apart.</span></strong></span> It didn't work out that way...</p>

              <p>..."The declassified intelligence documents reflect the political
              processes which took place before and after the Munich Agreement of
              September 30, 1938, which is also called the 'Munich conspiracy,'"
              Ivanov explained.</p>
              <p>These documents were kept in the archives as top secret for 70 years.
              They show that the Soviet political leadership was informed about the
              preparations for the meeting of Neville Chamberlain and Eduard
              Daladier, on the one hand, and Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini, on
              the other, and predict its potential military and political
              consequences for Europe. The papers show what unprecedented pressure
              Britain and France brought to bear on Czechoslovakia, demanding that it
              ceded Sudeten to Germany.</p>
              <p>"Moscow was receiving secret reports to the effect that the British and
              French ambassadors in Prague were persuading the Czechoslovak president
              to give over the Sudeten region to the Germans. Moreover, Prague was
              offered to cancel mutual assistance pacts with other countries," Ivanov
              said...</p>
              <p>..."As early as November 1938, diplomatic missions of a number of
              countries reported to their departments that <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Britain and France would
              not prevent Germany's eastward expansion</strong></span>," Ivanov said...</p>
              <p>The documents received after the Munich conspiracy are particularly
              valuable. They analyze the post-Munich situation in Europe and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>clearly
              show that <span style="color: #ff0000;">Britain was trying to draw Germany and the Soviet Union into
              active hostilities</span></strong></span>," Sotskov emphasized in an interview with RIA
              Novosti...</p>
              <p>Later, on November 25, Grippenberg reported his <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>conversation with a
              British government member who assured him that Britain and France would
              not interfere in Germany's eastward expansion. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">"<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Britain's position is as follows: let's wait until Germany and the
              U.S.S.R. get involved in a big conflict,</strong></span></span>" the document reads.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>...The well-known historian, veteran of the Soviet intelligence, retired
              Major General Lev Sotskov, who was dealing with examination and
              analysis of the archive documents<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> points out that Great Britain which
              did not hamper the German expansion eastward deliberately<span style="color: #ff0000;"> tried to
              involve Germany and the USSR in a military confrontation.</span></strong></span><span style="color: #ff0000;"> </span>Also, France
              adhered to such position according to the declassified documents. <br><br>The
              Munich agreement, on the basis of which Germany occupied the Sudet
              region, according to definition, could not prevent the war; it is more
              likely that this treacherous and perfidious action <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>opened the gates for
              Hitler to the East.</strong></span> In March, 1939 Germany occupied the remaining part
              of Czechoslovakia and on September 1st of the same year the German
              troops attacked Poland. Thus the Second –World massacre started...</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>...A key factor in Britain and France's attitude towards Hitler <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>was
              a desire to steer his ambitions eastwards and into war with Russia. I</strong><strong>n that way, it was hoped, the two perils could eliminate each other. </strong></span></span></p>
              <p>Stanley
              Baldwin, who preceded Chamberlain, was fairly frank. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>In 1936, he told
              Tory MPs alarmed about Hitler, that it would not 'break his heart' if
              the tensions in Europe led to 'the Nazis fighting the Bolshies'. </strong></span></span></p>
