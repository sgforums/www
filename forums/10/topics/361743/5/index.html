              <p>Not a problem with me. Maybe I shouldnt care too much and just remain silent. Everyone should just don't bother and let each one kill and destroy each other. It's not us they are killing anyway. Let them all die. Let them rule. We are isolated. We are safe. Nothing can hurt us. We are protected. We can afford not to care.</p>
              <p>Sounds like a good philosophy to me. Only if my conscience will allow it. Only if i can look straight into the eye of a victim and their children, and recite such philosophy.....</p>

              <p>South Koreans can't even be bothered with DPRKs antics.</p>

              <h1 class="heading">South Koreans are now almost blasé about nuclear blasts and missiles</h1>
              <p><span class="byline">Andrew Salmon in Seoul </span></p>
              <p>Despite the rhetorical barrage from the North it was business as
              usual in Seoul, the South Korean capital, yesterday. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>South Koreans have
              grown almost blasé after decades of bellicosity from their communist
              neighbour, and there was no sign of a human exodus, panic buying or
              angry demonstrations.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Analysts and policymakers are deeply concerned not just at the
              dimensions of Pyongyang’s provocations — a nuclear test, missile tests
              and a virtual declaration of war — but also at their unprecedented
              speed: all have occurred in the past three days. “Should North Korea
              provoke us we will counteract sternly,” the South’s Joint Chiefs of
              Staff said in a statement. President Lee Myung Bak urged a calm
              response.</p>
              <p>South Korean television alternated tributes to the country’s last
              President, Roh Moo Hyun, who committed suicide on Saturday, with
              footage of naval clashes that took place on the maritime border between
              the Koreas in the Yellow Sea in 1999 and 2002.</p>
              <p>A handful of South Korean sailors and perhaps a few dozen from the
              North died in the skirmishes, and many analysts expect the North’s next
              provocation to be of the same kind</p>
              <p>However, with Seoul’s ten million people having lived for decades
              within range of an estimated 300 North Korean artillery barrels dug in
              30 miles north of the city, most people seemed able to separate
              rhetoric from reality; the leading stock index fell only 0.7 per cent.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>“We are not worried,” said Ahn Hae Kyun, a vice-president at Daewoo
              Securities, drinking with staff at a pub. “We have been living for over
              50 years under the same conditions.”</strong></span></p>
              <p>“North Koreans are the same blood as us,” added his colleague, Chris
              Jung. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>“They are showing their power to foreigners — not us.”</strong></span></p>

              <p>I find it <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>very odd that the mainstream continues to regard North Korea

              <p>I agree with above view completely.</p>
              <p>I have studied the moves of North Korea since Oct 2002 and it is quite clear that they timed their moves to USA political activities.</p>

              <p>I will give one example to show how North Korea timed their moves with great effect against USA political activity.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In the morning of<span style="color: #ff0000;"> </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">March 1, 2003</span>, an American
                                          RC-132S spy plane, <em>Cobra Ball,</em>  took off from a US
                                          airbase in Okinawa</strong></span>, and cruised along the East
                                          coast of North Korea collecting electronic signals. The US
                                          intelligence suspected that North Korea was about to test a
                                          long-range missile and the plane was there to monitor the suspected
                                          missile launch. </p>
              <p>When the US plane reached a point about 193 km from the coast of
                                          North Korea, two MiG-29 and two MiG-21 fighter planes showed up
                                          unexpectedly. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The
                                          North Korean planes approached within 16 m and signaled the US
                                          plane to follow them. </strong></span> The US pilot refused to
                                          follow the command and left the scene posthaste. The US plane was
                                          tailed by the hostiles for about 22 min but let the US spy plane
                                          go.  There are two key points to be observed here.</p>
              <p>First, the hostile planes waited for the US plane at the Uhrang
                                          airbase, located about 200 km from the point of air
                                          encounter.  They knew that the US plane was coming.  The

              <p>The above writer asked good questions.</p>
              <p>Why didn't USA send some jet fighters to confront the North Korean planes?</p>
              <p>The reason is because Bush didn't want to risk a confrontation with North Korea.</p>
              <p>This is because he was going to launch an attack against Iraq in two week's time and didn't want to risk something with Kim Jong Il in March 2003.</p>
              <p>This was an extremely calculated move by Kim Jong Il, when he chose to provoke the USA on March 1 2003.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This is indeed Bush's view according to below source:</p>

              <p>...Washington's
              softer approach followed weeks of rising tension over Pyongyang's
              nuclear ambitions that has distracted the United States as it
              contemplates using military force to disarm Iraq -- part of what Bush
              has termed an "axis of evil" along with North Korea and Iran.<br> <br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>A senior U.S. official said the Bush administration's primary concern was trying to <span style="color: #ff0000;">keep the nuclear crisis with Pyongyang at bay</span> </strong></span>while it <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>prepares for war with Baghdad...</strong></span></span></p>

              <p>The idealogy is simple, North korea is the gambling table for both China, Russia and the American and maybe some small stake holder like Japan and taiwan. Everyone hold a their ace cards and waiting for show hands. North Korea will do the calling, test nuclear or disarm nuclear, China or Russian will give the instruction depend on various factor including economy, social system, politics arena, trading, and all other world events and problems. America will wait and see the offer and the faces around before calling the decision. If the Commies said,</p>

              <p>we want a free trade of commodities in your country</p>
              <p>or we need US Fed to lower it interest rate, or we want our students to have a grip on your system or we want an exchange of political prisoners, or we need funds to helps america business in the country etc etc...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Then it up to USA to make a decision in return for disarmament of nuclear and peace return.</p>
