              <p>Some say the rest of the world should unite and pressurize nutcase kim ( I call him a nutcase but certainly didnt say he is stupid ) to abandon his nuclear programme and weapons. But who is actually pressurizing who now?</p>
              <p>"The <strong>world will soon witness</strong> how our army and people stand up against oppression and despotism by the UNSC and uphold their dignity and independence."</p>
              <p>Don't say nutcase Kim didn't warn the world. The ICBMs will be ready in 2 weeks time. The world has D - 14 days to react. The countdown for the murder of millions has begun.</p>

              <p>Isnt it obvious that this is the BEST time to provoke USA, or make gains now while the US armed abilities are tied down elswhere?</p>
              <p>BUT nutcase Kim made a miscalculation in his judgement. Never ever doubt the abilities of the 680,000 South Korean soldiers as well as the Kamikazi lovin Japanese soldiers who are peeing in their pants every second that passes as the missiles are prepared for launch.</p>
              <p>Besides, it doesnt take much to deal with nutcase Kim and a few of his high hat nutheads. All it needs is US satellite tech - imagery as well as scientific data for events confirmation, to assist the courageous S.Koreans and Japs.</p>
              <p>Addeum: China is equally tied up. With more than a trillion dollars in US bonds, 1.3 billion hungry mouths to feed, no signs of the chinese being self supporting consumers, they may scream and shout, but in the end will keep their soldiers to the borders, if the communist party seeks legitimacy for its rule.</p>
              <p>China can still produce food for its people if peace is allowed, unlike nutcase Kim who cant with his famine stricken country and needs to rob rich S. Korea now and maintain his supremacy. </p>
              <p>With the big powers tied down, the way is clear for smaller states to prevent the proliferation of terrifying and awesome nukes. Failing which, Asian civilians will forever live under the spectre of nuclear wars as every asian country will own one, including power mad dictatorships.</p>

              <p>To be honest, ROK doesn't even want to get its hands tied down by DPRK... It is a free market economy and it would rather focus on getting its economy back on track and ignoring the North's rants. It is purely out of the big things that the North does that is why the South is giving them aid. If they didn't have nuclear missles, do you think ROK would give a F, besides them being the same people split over the border by a line that only makes sense on a map, and that they needed food?</p>

              <p>Asians are much more diversified than the westerners, much longer history than the western civilization. In fact, 3 out of 4 ancient civilization began in Asia. Therefore it is not surprising that Asians fought among themselves in history. and there is historical baggage that is difficult to get rid off, as in the case between China and Japan, Japan and Korea, Israel and the arabs...</p>
              <p>not all Asians have the same blood.</p>

              <p>I don't know much how the american tried to "rectify", after reducing the population of 23 millions to 2 millions. that is another discussion.</p>
              <p>on family ties, I look at it from another angle. Asians families look at supporting each others, even if you were married. American families believe that when you are married, you are independent and I don't have to support you anymore. They still respect their parents as parents...nothing to do with being "unfillial".</p>
