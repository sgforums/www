            <div class='col-md body'><span style="font-style: italic;">This article in BT is more comprehensive than the one in ST today. I copied it from SammyboyÂ’s coffeeshop. But the article is a bit Â‘corruptedÂ’ because the poster inserted a few comments.</span><br>___________________________________<br><br>Published September 8, 2007<br><br>Ngiam: It's dangerous to hothouse S'pore's best<br>He notes value of having different sets of mentors<br><br>By MATTHEW PHAN<br><br>(SINGAPORE) Singapore's best and brightest should be trained in a diversity of ways so that they are able to meet the world's challenges, Ngiam Tong Dow, a prominent former civil servant and currently chairman of Surbana Corporation, said at a dialogue yesterday.<br><br>Mr Ngiam: Effective civil servants should be doers and not just thinkers<br>Scholars should be allowed to work in both the public and private sectors, and the top primary school students should be sent to 10 to 15 different schools, rather than just Raffles Institution and Raffles Girls School, he said at a lunch lecture organised by the Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry.<br><br>'It is dangerous to hothouse our best. Yes, we should have meritocracy and help the best, but there should be different sets of mentors because we will face different kinds of problems,' he said.<br><br>Mr Ngiam - who became Singapore's youngest-ever permanent secretary at the age of 35 in 1972, served in various ministries, including finance, trade and industry, communications, as well as in the Prime Minister's Office - said he had discussed the talent issue with then-prime minister Lee Kuan Yew years ago.<br>But the latter maintained that the public sector could not afford to lose its talent, recalled Mr Ngiam.<br><br>'Intellectually, Minister Mentor could not accept my argument. I don't know why. I would have thought we should really spread the scholars out.'<br><br>Mr Ngiam also emphasised that effective civil servants should be 'doers' and not just 'thinkers'.<br><br>Comparing India to China, he said the Indians had more brainpower and were better abstract thinkers, but the Chinese are ahead because they are 'not just thinkers but also doers'.<br><br>The Chinese concept of being both a scholar and a warrior is good, said Mr Ngiam. 'If you do and don't think, it's not good; nor if you think and don't do - you have to do both.'<br><br>But 'the civil service in Singapore is also becoming more thinking than doing', he said. 'Every time there is a problem, we call in a consultant. I get fed up with that.'<br>=&gt; And he forgot to add that the best paid ministers enjoy pushing away problems to wayang committees!<br><br>Mr Ngiam also said Singapore should be more inclusive of both the elite and the apparently less talented. 'What is most important to me is that every individual counts. God has given each one of us a talent. There is no such thing as a completely stupid person.'<br><br>Citizenship is only a legal concept (Then serve NS for fcuk?), and nationhood goes beyond the idea of a country, he said. Singapore should welcome former citizens who emigrated years ago to pursue their goals.<br><br>'We should not reject you, even if you are a Singaporean who has left many years ago, we should not call him a quitter,' he said. 'The terms 'stayers' and 'quitters' should be banned from the political vocabulary of Singapore. We are all Singaporeans.'<br>=&gt; Wooden: Ouch! How dare you slap me, you eunuch!<br><br>He said Singapore should consider allowing dual citizenship for individuals who demonstrate the right spirit, but acknowledged 'the political leadership will have to think about this carefully because of national service'.<br>=&gt; Is this not the unofficial policy already to prevent Sporns from withdrawing their CPF savings?<br></div>
