We are an industrialised nation in a developing region.  So if the same study can be done for the region... this will be more interesting.<br>2.   no comments<br>3.   no comments</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I am actually know bits of utilities, unfortunately, there will be not turned back for the power generation as mostly had switched to gas. (which is cleaner and better combustion). For your information, gas price is normally linked to oil prices unless the contract written in another way.<br><br>With the World urging for more energy, the oil price is likely to be up/up all the way. Some countries in Europe had turned back to coal as the fuel to produce electric energy. Before oil and gas were used, coal was the main commodities used for power and piped gas. Coal was once condemned as dirty, but returned to be useful when price of oil~gas had rocketed to the sky.<br><br>I would not be recommending that Singapore should change their Power Plant and gas making plants to use coal again. This will incur more capital cost to purchase new plants and equipments. The investment may not be recoverable.<br><br>It is unlikely for oil price to drop. Hence, We can only expect to see higher electricity and gas charges in the future. I don't have the figures of the tariffs with me, but if you use the revised price, you may be able to predicted what with the future price, we are going to pay for each unit of energy consumed by us.<br><br></div>
