            <div class='col-md body'>This is simply amazing; our gov can put up with all the vices &amp; crimes by foreigners, and yet do not see the need to filter their influx.<br><br>======================================================<br>No more hiding in bushes for Geylang's brazen peddlers-now every passerby is a target<br>By Kor Kian Beng &amp; Zaihan Mohamed Yusof<br><br>October 25, 2006<br><br>YOU would think they had nothing to lose.<br>Despite increased enforcement, illegal cigarette peddlers are boldly hitting the streets.<br><br>To them, anybody is a potential customer.<br><br>Last November, The New Paper reported how peddlers would secretly sell contraband cigarettes at a small park in Lorong 14, Geylang.<br><br>Then, they would do business only with familiar faces and kept their wares hidden in rubbish bins.<br><br>These pictures show peddlers operating openly in Lorong 14, Geylang.--Picture: Zaihan Mohamed Yusof<br><br>Last week, The New Paper staked out the area on four days for several hours each time.<br><br>Holding a few packs in their outstretched hands, about 20 peddlers would accost a potential customer.<br><br>When we approached one peddler, he asked: 'Marlboro? Texas 5? Very cheap. $5.<br><br>'One carton also cheap, only $45.'<br><br>In coffeeshops, a pack of Marlboro Red costs around $11, while a carton of 10 packs sells for around $110.<br><br>When asked whether business was good, he looked puzzled and scurried away to approach another passer-by.<br><br>The peddlers often leave the cigarette packs in plastic bags on the pavement.<br><br>Some peddlers also have a 'drive-through' service.<br><br>Customers would drive up as they stood by the roadside and hand over money in exchange for cigarettes - without a word being said and with the buyers staying in their vehicles and driving off just as quickly.<br><br>To attract these customers, many peddlers stand along the busy Geylang Road during rush-hour.<br><br>The buyers are mostly middle-aged men, but we also saw a couple of teenagers on bicycles.<br><br>Scenes like this show how Geylang has become the hottest place for contraband cigarettes after the authorities clamped down on peddlers at Yew Tee Industrial Estate.<br><br>Since the TNP report last November, the Customs has stepped up efforts against the peddlers in Geylang. (See report on facing page.)<br><br>The authorities also made the park more open by trimming the trees and removing some stone benches.<br><br>But from our observation, the number of peddlers has actually increased.<br><br>Apart from contraband cigarettes, there is another group selling cough mixture near the park.<br><br>MORE FOREIGNERS INVOLVED<br><br>A former peddler, 27, who is now a bouncer, told The New Paper this is because the syndicates are using more foreigners as peddlers.<br><br>First, there is a ready and willing pool of them - many them are workers, overstayers, social pass holders and illegals - living in Geylang.<br><br>Second, they are lured by the quick profit.<br><br>A pedler holding his wares in a plastic bag<br><br>The former peddler said he used to earn around $2,000 a week.<br><br>Also, these peddlers are opening new markets among the foreign workers for the syndicates, he added.<br><br>And it's not just contraband cigarettes being sold there.<br><br>A smaller group of men, operating just outside a coffeeshop near the park, could be seen selling cough mixture.<br><br>A man, who appeared to be a foreigner, bought a bottle from them, drank the mixture immediately and threw the bottle on the ground - all in one swift movement and in broad daylight.<br><br>The New Paper had reported in March on these cough mixture peddlers operating in Geylang.<br><br>DRUNKEN FIGHTS<br><br>Nearby residents who spoke to The New Paper simply shook their heads when asked about the illicit activities.<br><br>All declined to be named, fearing reprisals.<br><br>One resident, who gave his name as Mr Tan, said gambling also goes on at the park.<br><br>Mr Tan, who is in his 60s and has been living near Lorong 14 for six years, said: 'These people never rest. You can see them there from 7am and they will be there till late into the night. When they are drunk, fights break out. We are concerned about our safety.'<br><br>One woman, who runs a shop nearby, said such scenes are not uncommon at Geylang. She said: 'Of course, these things must be stopped. But how do you stop them?'<br><br>Similarly, another resident said: 'What's the point of calling the police? Every other day the authorities raid the place. But the next moment, these people are back again.'<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>More raids, arrests<br><br>CUSTOMS has stepped up its operations in Geylang this year.<br><br>Customs officers have arrested and charged in court 80 illegal peddlers since January, a Customs spokesman said.<br><br>Another 131 people were caught and fined for buying contraband cigarettes from these peddlers.<br><br>So far this year, 75,900 packets of contraband cigarettes have been seized in the area.<br><br>With regards to the current situation in Geylang, the spokesman said: 'We will step up our enforcement efforts at Geylang. We have organised many raids there, and will continue to do so.'<br><br>With more foreigners being involved in peddling, Customs has been conducting joint operations with other agencies, including the Ministry of Manpower.<br><br>All peddlers arrested will be charged in court, the spokesman said. Buyers can face a minimum fine of $200 for each packet of contraband cigarettes.<br><br>Foreign workers convicted will have their work permits revoked and be repatriated.<br><br>The spokesman said Customs has also increased publicity and education efforts targeted at foreign workers.<br><br>For example, flyers and posters (some in 12 languages) have been distributed to advise foreign workers against buying or selling duty-unpaid cigarettes.<br><br>These efforts have resulted in a 10 per cent spike in the tip-offs to Customs intelligence officers.<br><br>Anyone with information on duty evasion activities can contact Customs at 1800-233-0000 or e-mail customs_intelligence@customs.gov.sg<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hello.. singapore is doing fine and in fact we are living alot better than others in the world. i wonder what is wrong with u guys saying this and that about teh government and doing nothing to help. if goverment does nothing to help locals then i guess u wont be having ur jobs and food and clean water. if u think that u can do better than the leaders , then join the parlimant, we need more human resources .. not just people who complains and complains. if the goevrnment is realy that bad then we will not be a developed conuntry in 40 years. no offence, but seriously , rather than complaining , help to make this country a better place. i agree that there is certainly room for improvement but by saying that the government did nothing to help locals seemed too bias.</div>

People do not all get high pay either...lots of people living on the equivalent of S$3k a month, but have to spend 800GBP (about S$2400) a month renting a studio flat.</div>
