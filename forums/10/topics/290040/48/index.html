They are likely to respond with insults or violence too.<br><br>There's a word for this phenomena, "blowback". It's describes consequences to a logical action that is not rational.<br><br>For example, a company boss decides that to become more profitable, he'll cut the number of staff to lower operating costs. This is logical and his profits increase.<br><br>However the remaining staff feel their jobs are threatened and spend their time trying to make each other look bad so that others will be laid off if or when the next round of layoff come about. There is a loss of productivity. Some may feel that they are next so they lose interest in their jobs and stop working as hard. Still others feel the company does not care for them so they find other jobs and leave. Still others believe this shows the company is not doing well, so they leave, taking clients with them. In time the company finds itself in real trouble.<br><br>This is what's known as "blowback".<br><br>Edited for grammer.<br></div></blockquote>You Ron Paul suppoter?</div>
