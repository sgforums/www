            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>That is your problem; nobody was discussing celibacy in this topic.<br><br>Anyway, celibacy is a choice and has nothing to do with darwinian. </blockquote>Com'on, strangely a lot of people support celibracy and strangely tis same group of people view homosexual as a basket case and condemned them. Tis is not the real reason for imposing stupid rules on gays ba. Double standard isn't it ? Choice or not, it doesn't matter because the outcome is the same. It is against darwanian.<br><br><blockquote>Like I said, it is better you not discuss this at all, 'cos you conflate all the definitions of 'natural' together.<br><br>He is right of course. The nature role of a male sex organ is indeed to be used on a female sex organ. Are you to disagree on this? </blockquote>All tis while, people r talking about the same type of natural until u come along and messed things up and blame it on people  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> Now u admit anti gay people do use the "natural" argument isn't it ?<br><br>On male sexual organ used on a female sex organ, it is indeed natural. However people r using the mouth to be used ont he spot where people urine and tat is even more unnatural. However nobody seemed to mind tis. Why mind homosexual ?<br><br><blockquote>I never say govt heck care religious people. But you claim that religious people have such power on the govt, and this you have to prove. </blockquote>They have succeed in stoppping 377A from dissappearing isn't it  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><blockquote>I see the govt as being pragmatic. So to raise GST is pragmatism. To have IR is pragmatism. To have seemingly the same stand as religious people on the issue on homosexuality is also pragmatism. </blockquote>True. The consequences of removing 377A gets the wrath of religious people and they get unpopular. It sure is pragmatic<br><br><blockquote>I disagree. The public does not view oral sex between man/woman in the same light as oral sex between man and man. To use their wording, no broader consensus yet. So how can govt eliminate everything together? </blockquote>Same light ? Nope. Acknowledge such people exists ? Yes. U know even straight people go to changi village to find guys. The majority do not have to view them as same light, they just have to view tat such people exists and let them do watever they want in private<br><br><blockquote>Huh .. you were the one who came out with the medicine .. not me.<br><br>I said liao .. my definition of darwinian is rather encompassing. Nature, society etc. If you cannot agree with my definition and choose to see darwinian in its unadultered form in nature, then I think we have nothing to discuss. </blockquote>Another double standard isn't it ? U view reproduction as unadultered form from nature while u view diesease as modified and able to follow society. Wow man, u really love to double standard and being unfair isn't it ?<br><br><blockquote>Well, homosexual is indeed a helpless basket case 'cos I wonder what is their mechanism to pass down their genes . What's wrong with that? </blockquote>If everything is perfect, then animals won't be homosexual<br><br><blockquote>Celibacy is a choice. Indeed celibates recognize their ability to pass down their genes, hence they live a more prudent lifestyle, like not mixing with woman.</blockquote>ANd they r still basket cases and cannot reproduce like homosexual isn't it ?</div>

Tis is because u r not qualified to tell us tat there is no such thing as homosexual when all the psychotrists, doctors, medical researchers and educated people know homosexual exists. U can even ask the pope and he know there r homosexual in the world. But u don't. And u cannot produce any evidence except telling us wat u think. Wat u think is insignificant because it may not (in tis case cannot) be the truth.</div>
