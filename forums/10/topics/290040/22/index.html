Was our law and constitution mocked because of that?</blockquote>Why force the law to exists then ? 377 hasn't been actively enforced till recent times as well. And our laws and constitution r really mocked by people from other countries<br><br><blockquote>Fact is, our government is willing to bear the "mockery" of having a non enforced law. Even if the govt does not love gays, can anyone say the govt is all out to get them, like we are going all out to tekan drug traffickers, sex offenders, murderers etc.? </blockquote>Sure, the gov is not out to get them. But forcing a law, which is against human basic right, double standard between sexes, a mockery of the legal system and the promote discrimination of a group of people is already cause of concern<br><br><blockquote>So when we are arguing for the repeal, are we doing it for gays or the govt?</blockquote>Ehh... doing for your religion ?<br><br><blockquote>if one day the majority wants 377A to be repealed, does that make them right?</blockquote>The majority is not always right.<br><br><blockquote>then why can't PRP be right all along?</blockquote>He can be right if he show the necessary logic and evidence.

Your stand only. I don't think icemoon is stupid enough to come out with a one line statement claiming there is no such things as homosexual. I can show u many examples and study tat prove homosexual exists in tis world. Can u prove to me homosexual does not exists ?<br><br><blockquote>For geys,when they can't have hetero sex,they go for homosex.</blockquote><blockquote>Sex is heterosexual by nature.Your son love another man.Can u tell him find a woman to love?Is it to say your son doesn't love any woman in this world?Probaly he hasn't tried hard enuf to find one! </blockquote>There is a gross mistaken concept by PRP. He assume gays r socially inept people in society and cannot find a girl who like them and have to resort to homosexual. The second mistaken concept is tat gays have no taste or preference and will take anybody, no matter how lousy or how socially inept tat person is as a partner.<br><br>Truth is, a lot of homosexual r more charming than normal guys and women like them more for their sensitivity. And a lot of lesbians r actually very pretty and a lot of guys will do anything to chase them. But they prefer someone of their own sex.<br><br><blockquote>The one who pokes from behind feel shiok.Probably the one who is poked doesn't feel shiok</blockquote>If they like it, wat has it got to do with u  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> Even straight people go for anal themselves sometimes.</div>

The reason why gov want the law to be kept is mainly to appease the religious people and keep singapore from being divisive<br><br><blockquote>2.Parliament keep the law to show that sexual value it want to keep.Sex is meant to be heterosexual. </blockquote>As said, it is being pragmatic and just want to be popular. Sex is meant for heterosexual is a point which u think.<br><br><blockquote>3.With this law,pro-gey ppl cannot advocate such lifestlye openly because otherwise it would be telling ppl to commit a crime. </blockquote>If u have problems of gays advocating their lifestyles, u can enforce other laws such as amend 377a to be legal in private but not public or a mass media law preventing people from speaking again religion and homosexual as well. Why 377A ?<br><br><blockquote>As I said before,the above arguments are simple &amp; mostly general knowldges.Easy for pro-homo ppl to rebut them.But for ppl who don't accept homo,they think it is reasonable. </blockquote>Why don't u give a counter argument for the comments  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> If it is easy to rebut your points, it means your points r not concrete.<br><br>For anti gay people, they think it is reasonable.

And the majority of western countries think homo is acceptable.<br><br><blockquote>A columist of ST,who is a medical doctor,wrote an article and conluded there was no conculsive evidence to show homo is born. </blockquote>Then benefit of the doubt should be given since there is no evidence to show homo is not born<br><br><blockquote>I showed u evidences the so called homo are not really homo. </blockquote>Com'on... u never show a single evidence. U only tell me wat u think. And wat u think can be wrong<br><br><blockquote>All the above opinions u don't believe.U only beleive what u want to believe.Are u objective in your arguments? </blockquote>R u objective in your argument ? U never answer any person reply and u force people to answer your reply. U r not sincere in your argument and u just want to see things from your side of the fence.</div>
