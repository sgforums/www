He prove it not by himself doing experiments, but by citing works and research from other people. Thus far, he cannot make an absolute statement regarding homosexual not being inborn.<br><br><blockquote>I've explained why homo sex is wrong</blockquote>List every single point and word u have mentioned on why u think homosexual is wrong.

U cannot prove it wrong as well. And there r more studies showing homosexual is not a illness. Since we cannot say for certain, then why condemn them ?

Some marry in the sea, some drink all day, some go for traditional churches and some even have mass orgy. It has nothing to do with u.<br><br>Third, normal people have wedding dress in gowns and suits. They dress in gowns and suit. Wat do u expect them to wear then ?
