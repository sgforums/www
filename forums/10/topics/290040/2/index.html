Discrimination.<br>Existing law states that it is the policy of the state to afford<br>equal rights and opportunities to all persons in the public or<br>private elementary and secondary schools and postsecondary<br>educational institutions of the state regardless of their sex, ethnic<br>group identification, race, national origin, religion, or mental or<br>physical disability and prohibits a person from being subjected to<br>discrimination on those bases.<br>Existing law prohibits a teacher from giving instruction, and a<br>school district from sponsoring any activity, that reflects adversely<br>upon persons because of their race, sex, color, creed, handicap,<br>national origin, or ancestry.<br>Existing law prohibits the State Board of Education and the<br>governing board of a school district from adopting for use in the<br>public schools any instructional materials that reflect adversely<br>upon persons because of their race, sex, color, creed, handicap,<br>national origin, or ancestry.<br>This bill would revise the list of prohibited bases of<br>discrimination and the kinds of prohibited instruction, activities,<br>and instructional materials and instead, would refer to disability,<br>gender, nationality, race or ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation,<br>or any other characteristic contained in the definition of hate<br>crimes that is contained in the Penal Code. The bill would define<br>disability, gender, nationality, race or ethnicity, religion, and<br>sexual orientation for this purpose.<br>Vote: majority. Appropriation: no. Fiscal committee: no.<br>State-mandated local program: no.</blockquote>As far as I can tell, it prohibits instructional discrimination. It's just one more item in a long list of items that instructional materials are supposed to comply with.<br><br>California is a pretty liberal state and sometimes I do think they go a bit too far. But I don't find this anti-discrimination law any more strange than the other laws they pass.<br><br>I think a lot of the criticisms are straw man attacks. Sure, there are many ways of interpreting a law, but I don't think referencing mothers and fathers is discriminatory against homosexuals and I doubt anyone is really advocating that "Mum and Dad" are be replaced with Parents. If you take that logic, no textbook can reference an able bodied person because it would be discriminatory against the disabled. I think it's more likely that this is just an absurd example conjured up to attack the law.<br><br>The bathroom this is definitely fake. Boys will still go to the boys room, girls will go to the girls room regardless of sexual orientation.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by faroukalhadad:</div><div class="quote_body">like i said, im not imposing my specific religion. ALL religions have specified that homosexuality is not natural.<br><br>it is a mental ilness much like pedophilia, necrophilia. so when a person is necrophilic, do we blame nature also? should he not be forgiven for his sexual preference because he is "made that way"<br><br>yes animals have gay sex<br><br>but animals kill each other too<br><br>so do we not stop man from killing each other cos its "natural"?<br><br>tell me do you really want to live in a world where there are no norms between a man and a woman?<br><br>where a man can enter the changing room / toilet of women if he so wishes?<br><br>a world where our kids are being taught that it is ok for a man to have sex with another man?</div></blockquote>I fail to see where boys and girls are forced to use the same changing room?<br><br>You claim that is happening but what school has actually implemented this policy?<br><br>Where does it say in the law that boys and girls have to use the same bathroom. I think the only case where this would happen might be for a transgender child. Do you want a child who is biologically male but dresses as a female to use the boy's toilet? I think it makes more sense for the child to go to the female toilet. I'm sure a transgendered male who dresses as a male would still go to a male toilet.<br><br>I don't see what's wrong with teaching tolerance and allowing consenting adults to live their lives as they wish.  Again, the principle here for me is "do no harm".<br><br>The principle behind pedophilia being able is that a child is unable to give consent so we have laws to protect children from harm. Necrophilia is the same way. A dead body cannot give consent and we still feel some kind of emotional attachment to the body. The laws are there to protect the living.<br><br>Of course you could argue that seeing homosexuals kiss in public would cause you emotional distress but where do you stop? It's not that you can create laws to limit behavior for the public good, but you should apply them fairly. You should ban all kissing in public for example, not just ban homosexual couples from kissing in public.<br><br>But what happens in the privacy of a person's home is no one else's business as long as no harm is done. You know, some people enjoy having women defecate in their mouths. That totally grosses me out. In fact, just thinking about it makes me want to puke. But hey, do whatever you want as long as you don't make me watch it. *gag*<br><br>But you raise a good point. I wonder why god made necrophiliacs? And why did God make people who like having women defecate in their mouths?<br><br></div>

Â“SB 777 will result in reverse discrimination against students with religious and traditional family values,Â” said Meredith Tourney, legislative liaison for Capitol Resource Institute. Â“These students have lost their voice as the direct result of Gov. SchwarzeneggerÂ’s unbelievable decision. The terms Â‘momÂ’ and Â‘dadÂ’ or Â‘husbandÂ’ and Â‘wifeÂ’ could promote discrimination against homosexuals if a same-sex couple is not also featured.<br><br>Â“Parents want the assurance that when their children go to school they will learn the fundamentals of reading, writing and arithmetic Â—not social indoctrination regarding alternative sexual lifestyles. Now that SB777 is law, schools will in fact become indoctrination centers for sexual experimentation,Â” she said.<br><br>Â“We are shocked and appalled that the governor has blatantly attacked traditional family values in California,Â” said Karen England, executive director of Capitol Resource Institute.<br><br>Source: http://www.americanfreepress.net/htm...rzenegger.html<br></div>
