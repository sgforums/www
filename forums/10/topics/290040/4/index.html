His 'research' flies in the face of much more research that shows evidence that homosexual tendencies are biological.<br><br>He has also been found to be intellectually dishonest.<br><br>"In 1985, the American Sociological Association (ASA) adopted a resolution which asserted that "Dr. Paul Cameron has consistently misinterpreted and misrepresented sociological research on sexuality, homosexuality, and lesbianism" and noted that "Dr. Paul Cameron has repeatedly campaigned for the abrogation of the civil rights of lesbians and gay men, substantiating his call on the basis of his distorted interpretation of this research."7 The resolution formally charged an ASA committee with the task of "critically evaluating and publicly responding to the work of Dr. Paul Cameron.""<br><br>And,<br><br>"Cameron's credibility was also questioned outside of academia. In his written opinion in Baker v. Wade (1985), Judge Buchmeyer of the U.S. District Court of Dallas referred to "Cameron's sworn statement that 'homosexuals abuse children at a proportionately greater incident than do heterosexuals,'" and concluded that "Dr. Paul Cameron...has himself made misrepresentations to this Court" and that "There has been no fraud or misrepresentations except by Dr. Cameron""<br><br>Finally,<br><br>""That's only the beginning. In a 1981 debate, Cameron claimed a 4-year-old boy had been sexually mutilated in a Lincoln, Neb., mall rest room as part of a "homosexual act" Â— but police in Lincoln said no such crime had occurred.<br><br>"He told the 1985 Conservative Political Action Committee conference that "extermination of homosexuals" might be needed in the next three to four years. He has advocated tattooing AIDS patients in the face, and banishment to a former leper colony for any patient who resisted. He has called for gay bars to be closed and gays to be registered with the government."<br><br>[Note that he claims that the 'extermination' quote was lifted out of context - standard fare. Said that it was only a 'suggestion']"<br><br>Wow... he's not just a bigot. He's a dangerous, extremist bigot.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Farouk, or whatever you wanna be called.<br><br>Are you a homophobic? Cos you display very classic signs of a homophobic.<br><br>I have my phobia too. Phobia of various religions trying to dictate our way of life. I don't have a name for that yet.<br><br>What you are experiencing is a very extreme dislike for homosexual activites. You think about these homosexual individuals, mostly male I can see, going down on each other, and you think about it every now and then, and it overwelms your mind, therefore I can understand your rantings in this forum.<br><br>I don't know why your activities seem to bring you to close proximities with these people that you dislike. I have been an avid swimmer myself, I know avid swimmers. They do not talk about these things to me. You're the first.<br><br>On the note that life discontinues because of homosexual activities: think about this, the current population explosion is causing serious environmental problems on our tiny planet. I think homosexuality is actually a natural numbers controlling mechanism. Don't worry, I believe you are spared the fate, as long as you don't think about men going down on each other so often. Concentrate on your strokes in the pool please. You do go there to swim, not frolick in the water with your buddies, right?<br><br>On your move to rally the various religions to actively discourage homosexual activites: firstly, there are too many problems existing between various religions, problems that get people killed and families torn apart. I think priority should be accorded to resolving these problems, let not the joys of your fellow brothers be a distraction in your quest for world peace. Remember: the enemy of your enemy is your friend as long as the enemy exists.<br><br>I've been to California. Have you?<br><br>And er.....you really think any serious religious leaders will talk in sgforums? You've got to be kidding.<br><br>Lastly, I think the gay community has plenty of creative folk who actively contributes to our country's economy and culture, who spends their time constructively instead of acting like little children banding together to single out a kid that seems different from the rest just so that they can have some fun together.<br><br>Disgusting.

While employed at various institutions including the University of Nebraska he conducted research on passive smoking and several other topics, but he is best known today for his controversial research on homosexuality. After a successful 1982 campaign against a gay rights proposal in Lincoln, Nebraska, he established the Institute for the Scientific Investigation of Sexuality, now known as the Family Research Institute (FRI).

All I'm saying is that this is a new social ill tht we should address also.<br><br>Yes I would catgorise it as a social ill.<br><br>Granted, you refuse to accept my reasons of moral collapse, family values, traditional values as my reason for considering it a social ill.<br><br>But what about the tangible ones?<br><br>Do you not consider the rise of sexually transmitted diseases tangible? Yes hetrosexual activity does spread AIDS, but do a google on the disease and you will see that homosexuals are of MORE at risk in contracting and spreading it.<br><br>Do you not consider the harassment of homosexuals tangible?<br><br>Maybe you are not the swimming kind.

            <div class='col-md body'>If homosexuals can lobby for government to change the laws in their favour, so can people lobby otherwise. Whats the argument here sia. Its not that I hate homosexuals or what, but wah lau, u lobby for something in your favour then people object, you call them names, call them bigots. Like that not fair leh. You must accept that people will object one mah since you all decide to publicly lobby for your rights. The law was there for a purpose in the first place. How can you expect everyone in this world to accept everything just because of "This is the modern world so dun be so old fashion can" kind of arguments.<br><br>But for those who are lobbying against homosexuals, you all also must think lah. Homosexuals have their rights. I am a christian and I am against homosexuality and all my homo frens know it. But I dun think that should stop me from going out with them, chilling out with them, treating them as equals in work and in leisure. So if you are objecting because you think they are a bunch of faggots, more likely you are the maggot here lah.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
