Should we, as a sovereign nation, not have a say in the running of our country?<br><br>As a pragmatic nation, we should know better. If there is no fairness and equality, the govt should know better than pandering to the likes and dislikes of the religious extremists who are in the minority anway.</div>

After all, you have a choice whether to have sex with a clean woman or a dirty woman.</div>
