U think they r good drinks but to an avid tea drinker or coffee drinker, they feel the other drink is sh!tty and is not good. One man need is another one poison.

I say they do it because they like to do it. Is watching movie or TV good ? Is eating oily and fatty stuff with high cholestrol good ? It is not good too because it waste your time doing other more productive work while the oily food made u have many obesity related diesease. But people still do it because they like it.
