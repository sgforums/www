Different peope have different ideas. Don't force your ideas on others. </span><br><br>Why the discrimination ? why don't u lobby a law banning all premarital sex, or banning all prostitute, or making adultery jailable as well since they all caused problem ?</div>

Or others peoples findings. These are accepted as inconclusive.<br><br>Why is homosexuality not a perversion?<br>Sexual intercourse is a liason between male and female. That is the basis for sexuality. This developed into courtship, intimacies, romance, foreplay. And the basis is male/female relationship . Any deviation is a perversion, even when it is harmless.<br>Homosexuality, the second syllably denotes sex, and it deviates from the basic male/female liason to a same gender liason. Is is a hybrid? No conclusive proof.<br>IMO, homosexuality is buddy or sistership that went too far. A man can have a bossum buddy, and live with him, nothing wrong with that. But to screw his arse, kiss him, and the like, and marry him! that's the perversion.<br>Being buddies is not. Same with sistership. Just don't cross the line.<br>Homosexuality is a perversion, whether you accept it or not.<br>The question should really be whether it should  be an excepted perversion or not.<br><br>In my boyhood kampong, there were two men living together, whom I thought were brothers at that time. We did'nt think anything about them, were friends with them. Its only on hindsight that I realise they were gays. Now I don't know where they are, but if I meet them, I would greet them like any of my old kampong elderly.<br>At present, I personaly know of two women, who are like inseparable sisters, I and everyone else suspect they are lesbians. But we don't know, and don't care.<br>I say again, what they do in the privacy of their bedrooms is their own business.<br>And the law holds the same, unless there is a complaint.<br></div>
