In his attempt to make sure all opposing viewpoints [to his] are crushed, he spares no effort in knocking down ALL of his opponent's points, without even reading the points that are put across.<br><br>IMHO this thread is not about uplifitng the ban against gay sex. You are not a parliament member, neither am I and I don't think the govt will consult our view in reaching a decision whether to repeal the whole 377. Heck, why is there an urgency to uplift the ban since gays are not prosecuted anyway? We should be more concerned about rising costs and foreign competition.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>IMHO again, this thread is about idealism. The idealism that people holding minority views and practising minority habits should not be criminalised. So gays practising sodomy should not be criminalised. Neither should you guys be so harsh on PRP, who is obviously holding a minority view here. I suppose if you guys go to a fundamentalist xtian forum, you guys will be the minority .. hehe.<br><br>The topic of incest has everything to do with this idealism. Contrary to what SIS thinks, incest law is there not mainly because it will bring about defect children. If my guess is correct, incest law exists everywhere (except Japan and France from what I read) because it is a societal taboo. Just like homosexuality in the past, in Christian nations.<br><br>If it is a societal taboo, we can challenge it. I don't think it is too much to state incestuous acts can be seen as consensual acts between adults privately, which is not so much different from adults practising sodomy, if you ask me.<br><br>Till now, SIS has avoided my question of why sex with HIV patient is not criminalised, considering the rate at which it is spreading.  His reply that there should be mandatory divulging of condition is nothing more than a red herring.</div></blockquote>Do need to explain ...<br><br>You are a anti-gay la ..</div>

About incest, I and (i believe) the mass majority of the people will feel something about it and therefore i try to delink it with homosexual.

My answer is NO. U can read back the replies I made before<br><br>And u r giving a totally hypothetical situation. We should look at the present and the facts of the situation and not talk about "if" cases.
