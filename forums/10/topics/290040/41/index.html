Did i ever said he's right that Icemoon is this and that ? What makes u jump into conclusion? You sure should chill out. He probally said u this and that. But i never even once stand on his side that your the anti-gay or watsoever except for the proof that you asked for supporting PRP.<br><br>b) See all my replies toward PRP's view? Did i ever critic him this and that ? HE said Gay is naturally wrong in sex and other things. Yes indeed but that is his point and i pointed out my other view of point.<br><br>PRP said HIV can b transferred thru gays and i said its too generalising if only pointing the finger to gays cuz all humans are capable of transmitting the vuris to anyone. And did i said PRP a stupid ignorant basted low life or anything? He never see a bigger pic of other ppl also can transfer HIV and i even explained bout this. Talking bout bigger picture means fail to educate him on how other ppl think?<br><br>c) Lastly, why u jump into conclusion that all ppl here can meet up each other in sgf meeting or watsoever. IT depends on how u think bout getting so serious in sgf discussion. Sgf meeting are supposed to meet up new friends and do you mean if you know that person is the one whom u dun like here and you goin to show your black face and say "No" to yourself cuz they are a shyt ? Wow. (Shakes head)<br></div>
