            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>According homo supporters, there is neither right or wrong about homo.<br><br>Is it also no right and wrong for incest, adultery or having sex with an animal?</blockquote>Adultery is wrong because u let your other partner down. Incest can give birth to defect children which is cruel. Having sex with animals give uncomfortness to the animals but other than tat I don't really care. Now u say homo is wrong. Why ?<br><br><blockquote>I declare myself to be for fairness.If homo is right,I would certainly support it even thou the minority believe so.</blockquote>I think it is funny for someone to declare themselves as something... Talk is cheap u know... U declare u r fair I declare I am fair, then who is really fair ?<br><br><blockquote>U must know what the natural intercourse is.Can anal sex be considered as natural intercourse?Is rectum a sexual organ? </blockquote>I already said it is up to individual. Anal is not a sex organ but people, even heterosexual, do it. Tat is why 377, not 377a is removed now. The mouth is not a sexual organ too, but people still use it well. The penis is where u urine and the mouth is where u ingest food and water. And people r willing to use their mouth to suck the male sexual organ. Now tell me is tat nature ? The tongue, the finger, the toys, the dildo, the doll etc r all not sexual organs but people r using it. Wat is nature ? why don't u give your definition ?<br><br>Then u shouldn't wear shoes as well since the shoes r not your foot. People shouldn't wear specs as well since it is not their eyes and it is against nature. taking cars, using electricity etc r all not nature. So ? Not nature is not equal to wrong.<br><br><blockquote>Old fashion sometimes remains good. Some new fashions bring u sexual ailments such as AIDS</blockquote>AIDs is caused by casual sex. Trying out other sexual experiments with your stable partner is not old fashion and everybody is happy. Now u tell me. If u have a stable sexual partner will u have oral sex ? Will u use your finger to faciltate the atmosphere ? Tell u frankly, I believe more than 50% of the straight population done all these.</div>

U see sex is only meant after marriage but a lot of people don't see it tis way. A lot of people r married and do not have kids too. More people aren't even married and have blatant sex anywhere and anytime. Some refused to get married too. If u wanna ban, then they r all equally guilty.<br><br>Your idea of sex is not my idea.

It is not morally right to have multiple sex partners. However 377A affect the one who cohabit faithfully with one partner as well.<br><br>Furthermore it is their business anyway. Even of they get AIDs, it has nothing to do with u. And if u really wanna ban AIDs, u should be fair and ban heterosexual as well or people who already got the diesease. <blockquote></blockquote></div>
