No one would make up stories as silly as that. If they were made up, they would make more sense.<br><br>By the way, I have a true story to tell you. There was an alien being who came from another planet sent to earth by his father when his home planet exploded. Now that he's exposed to our yellow sun, he has incredible super powers. He's faster than a speeding bullet, more powerful than a locomotive, able to leap tall buildings in a single bound! Serious.
