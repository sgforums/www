No suffrage till the 20th century, social and cultural discrimination.<br><br>But are gays discriminated here? Are they boycotted? Are they beaten up? Are they denied constitutional rights? </blockquote>They r discriminated because there is an unfair and absurb law banning homosexual from having sex while people of the opposite sex can do the same thing.<br><br>And if u say the law does not work, then why force the law to exist ?<br><br><blockquote>Dont make it sound like you guys are so noble trying to fight for gay equality. Are you even a gay yourself?</blockquote><blockquote>The attitude of straights is even worse. To argue for something which doesn't even concern them.<br><br>They must be thinking all the gays are living in depression because they can't have sex legally. So poor thing, must fight equality for them.</blockquote>I don't see why u want to ask tis question. I am not a gay, but I do not like to see people discriminate others and see injustice done. If u see an old granny gonna get cheated, will u do nothing because u do not know her ? R u the type tat like to watch people get robbed on the streets and do nothing ?<br><br><blockquote>Singapore.</blockquote>And how have u help singapore ? IS singapore gonna sink because 377A is absent ?<br><br><blockquote>The issue is not whether sodomy is wrong but whether our society is ready to accept homosexual lifestyle. </blockquote>Their lifestyle has nothing to do with u when they do it privately<br><br><blockquote>Seriously you think those religious people care about the prohibition in 377A? Will the repeal of 377A see a huge surge in the no. of private sodomy acts?</blockquote>Then why do u wanna force the law to exist ? U want to make the legal system here as a joke ?<br><br><blockquote>Using your logic, then the heterosexuals here must have suffered greatly compared to the citizens in more liberal countries, when 377 was still around. </blockquote>Then they look into the law and remove 377 isn't it ?<br><br><blockquote>But isn't this what the govt is doing .. leaving them alone? </blockquote>The problem is the religious guys<br><br><blockquote>If these people so powerful, then maybe we won't have IR liao</blockquote>Com'on la... IR have a diferent impact compared with tis. These religious people have wielded enough power to make the gov form an awkward position in the penal code. Aren't they powerful enough as it is ?<br><br><blockquote>And it is not only religious people who are against it. Many older folks find it hard to accept also, and they are not really religious people.</blockquote>They r not making much noises because frankly wat gays do in private has no impact in their lives.<br><br><blockquote>If I'm not wrong,377A is not about sodomy.It is about soliciting for gey sex</blockquote>U r wrong. It is about sodomy. Please go and read carefully before posting<br><br><blockquote>The govt doesn't want them to get AIDS.So the govt is so good,they still want to complain.That's why the job of the govt is very difficult.The attitude of geys is strange &amp; inmature.</blockquote>U r talking rubbish here. U think everyone is like small kids and have to have a daddy looking after u and banning u from doing tis and tat. Furthermore, there r gays who r faithful to their partner and there r married people who r promiscuous. Why only target homosexual ?<br><br><blockquote>If geys want to reinstate S377,i have no objection.Do geys really want it?</blockquote>Tis is stupid. Give me a reason why they don't want to.<br><br><blockquote>When your son like another boy,please tell him: Sex is heterosexual.One can like a same sex person but one shouldn't have sexual relationship with a same sex person.You can be a very good &amp; close friiend with him but not having sexual relatinship.You should look for a gilt as sexual partner.U should have sex after marriage.</blockquote>If things r tat simple, then there is no gays in the world. Oh ya hor... u don't believe gays exists. No wonder u make such a silly comment<br><br><blockquote>I accept geys as any other human beings.Do u know that?</blockquote>Let me see, u felt gays r socially inept and cannot find girlfriends and resort to homosexual, u felt homosexual r promiscuous, u think they have bad parents and taught them the wrong thing, u think they r crazy to fu k people asshole. Ok, u don't accept gays as any other human beings.<br><br></div>

U post it here, u post for everyone.<br><br><blockquote>Regarding our difference on whether homosex is right or not,th s can be debated but should debate honestly and sincerely.</blockquote>Tat is right. U r not debating honestly and sincerely. I can give u a few examples. U put a title asking opponents not to read them and then writing all the rubbish u want. Also u do not exhibit honesty and sincerity when u refuse to answer any points raised by the other people. U also quote statements without showing evidence or where u get your source from. U r also guilty of going around in circles hoping the other will forget it. If u want to debate, then follow your own advise and debate honestly and sincerely</div>
