It can be recognized by several symptoms. Someone with an antisocial personality is usually decietful and is remorseless. </span><br><br>Let's see... it seems like many religious people seem to carelessly disregard the rights of others (not all of course). Christian "scientists" regularly fudge research or outright lie in order to support their religion and many christians feel it's okay to lie for god. And they are really happy when they do it.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Dependent Personality Disorder<br><br>This disorder is characterized by a need to be taken care of an a fear of being abandoned. Suffers of it are very clingy and usually have the following symptoms: helpless when alone because of exagerated sense of not being able to care for self, when one close relationship ends the person immediately tries to find another, problems initiating projects or ideas because of a lack of self esteem, difficulty dissagreeing with others, needs other to take responsibility for him/her, cannot make decisions with out advice from others.</span><br><br>This one doesn't need much explanation.

I am nothing... blah blah blah..."<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Narcissistic Personality Disorder<br><br>Individuals who are excessively grandios, have a need for admiration, and lack empathy are usually considered to be a narcissistic personality. They can only truly be shown to have the disorder if the person has five of the following symptoms: extreme arrogance and haugtiness, envious of others or believes that they are envious of him, doesn't recognize the feelings of others, exploits other persons for his/her own aims, requires admiration, has fantasies of success and power, has a sense of entitlement and believes that he/she is special.</span><br><br>God made me special!

I wonder what a demon coming out of someone's ass looks like.<br><br>Other "scientific" research supporting that sexual orientation can be changed is done by groups like the Family Research Council, which is a "Christian organization promoting the traditional family unit and the Judeo-Christian value system upon which it is built." A true paragon of unbiased research! And we're probably being generous in calling it research.<br><br>One problem is that these groups think that "success" or "curing homosexuality" means suppressing homosexual behavior. They think that even if a man is still attracted to other men, as long as he doesn't act on that attraction, he's cured.<br><br>But hey guess what, if a person is sexually attracted to someone of the same gender, that person is homosexual, whether the person acts on the desire or not.<br><br>Now, the following is the scientific consensus. It's not a consensus because of political correctness (as you imply), but it is the consensus of scientists that practice real science, as opposed to "scientists" who are looking for evidence to support what they think a magical being told them to believe.<br><br>"Sexual orientation emerges for most people in early adolescence without any prior sexual experience. Although we can choose whether to act on our feelings, psychologists do not consider sexual orientation to be a conscious choice that can be voluntarily changed."<br><br>Sexual orientation is not a choice.</div></blockquote>Who says sexual orientation cannot be changed? The real question is why would a person want to do that?</div>
