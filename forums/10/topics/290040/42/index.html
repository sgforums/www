If you are not for me, you are against me?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Ok, if you are really not on his side, then perhaps you will like to tell the audience what you think of happieman and his recent replies?<br><br><blockquote>b) See all my replies toward PRP's view? Did i ever critic him this and that ? HE said Gay is naturally wrong in sex and other things. Yes indeed but that is his point and i pointed out my other view of point.</blockquote>Well, I was only making a general statement about the treatment he got here. I never read all the replies targeted at him. But it is fair to tell him, if he's not getting the replies he wanted, then perhaps it is time to stop. I told him or at least hinted him to stop. He didn't heed my advice.<br><br>I even told him, if he wants to debate, just debate with me. I can be the devil advocate.<br><br>I apologise if you were indeed giving him sincere replies in a civilised manner.<br><br><blockquote>c) Lastly, why u jump into conclusion that all ppl here can meet up each other in sgf meeting or watsoever. IT depends on how u think bout getting so serious in sgf discussion. Sgf meeting are supposed to meet up new friends and do you mean if you know that person is the one whom u dun like here and you goin to show your black face and say "No" to yourself cuz they are a shyt ? Wow. (Shakes head)</blockquote>Don't understand your point here.<br><br>I wrote - [b]Be more magnaminous, who knows next time all of us will meet in some SGF outing. I sure don't want the situation when you guys shake his hand and think, "so .. this is the farker".</strong><br><br>I think my comment is justified. Who knows if next time all of us will meet in some outing and I sure don't want PRP to be discriminated 'cos of that.</div>

If you are not on anyone's side, then I think you can see that.<br><br>Sad to say .. happieman's latest reply still reflects his prejudice towards me and PRP. I steered clear of the path of debating whether it is right or wrong. And I don't see why he has to insinuate me in the opposite direction. It is misconstruing other's position and personally this is one of the worst thing that can happen in a debate.<br><br>Yup, enough about him, I know you will say what happieman is doing has nothing to do with you.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  Rightly so.<br><br>Well, what if does take into account it will not happen at all. Right? And when I raised that point, we were NO LONGER talking about this topic. The discussion has ended between me and SIS, and PRP is nowhere to be found. The point was raised because if you guys are truly baring your hearts out and discussing seriously, then I can't imagine how labels like extremist will be brought into real life. After all this is a sensitive topic and we sure are not discussing whether this joke is funny or that joke is funny (hey .. some of the jokes posted in SGF quite fun .. hehe)<br><br>And I have to disagree with what you said - a discussion here can be rough. You might be truly discussing with him, I can acknowledge this, but I don't think the same can be said for others. I don't think you need me to quote replies from certain forummers to prove that.</div>
