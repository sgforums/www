It's that "mum and dad" should not be used in the context of referring to parents. Saying "mum and dad" implies that one's parents involve one female and one male.<br><br>The right wingers oppose this law so of course they will try to come up with the most ridiculous example possible so they can try to repeal it. So they claim that since the law requires language that is neutral to sexual orientation in instructional material, schools have to ensure all mention of "mum and dad" are removed.</div>

They are in the best position!<br><br>Singapore has put importance on religion. It's time this sytem kicks in to salvage our youth and our future in Singapore.<br><br>I have joined the <strong>Open Entreaty to Singapore's Religious Leaders</strong>. It's time our mosques, churches temples start an education program to prevent more from suffering the homosexual mentality.<br><br>Sign the entreaty and make your voices heard.<br><br><a href="http://muhammad-ridzwan.blogspot.com/2007/10/plague-of-pinks.html" rel="nofollow">http://muhammad-ridzwan.blogspot.com/2007/10/plague-of-pinks.html</a>[/b]</blockquote>Well, firstly, you have <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>not justified the reasons </strong></span>for religious leaders to step in to reign on the "Pink Plague" as you so offensively put it. Do not merely scrape off by saying "oh ... it violates morality grounds, it disrupts family unit structure etc etc". Tell me more tangible reasons such that their actions have affected you in public. For e.g. , Perhaps did a Gay hit on you such that it scarred u? Or perhaps did u see a couple of gays behaving <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>overtly</strong></span> intimate in public which you feel offended? For the record, if they merely hold hands together or give each other a momentarily kiss, that is acceptable for me;for its how even heterosexual couples behave. ( in any case, the Gays in SG are really a mature bunch, and they have more sense to keep their more intimate and raunchy gestures in the bedroom and not in public.)<br><br>In addition, i do not understand why you are on a witchhunt for Gays? Common, there are also other <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>serious social problems </strong></span>in SG that needs attention; like for e.g. the Unusually High teenage pregnancy rates in the Muslim community.. the unusually High % of really young muslim parents (~16-18 y.o.s); the issue of pre-martial sex in the Muslim community; the issue of sexual grooming where our school girls are preys in the online virtual world; or the issue of cases where Muslim dads rape their own daughters. Or for instance, the constant abuse of maids in SG by employers; the problem of illegal workers enroaching into the HDB heartland estates in Yio Chu Kang etc; the constant plague of old aunties and uncles in rag tags scavenging the trash bins for cans to sell; or the great intellectual Gifted divide where all the talents in every cohort are only sent to RGS or RI? or the Fear of our civil service going on an auto-pilot drive (as expressed by our Senior Retired Civil servant Ngiam Tong Dow in his latest memoir), where civil servants depend merely on old and tested protocols and methods; which may lead to the Demise of SG (sharing a fate with the sparta)?<br><br>The way i see it, the Gay community has behaved appropriately and quite civilized in their verbal engagement with the Anti gay camps. In fact, their arguments are <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>so much more intellectual, witty and backed with facts</strong></span>.(for e.g. Yawning Bread's blogs) Well , but i got to admit the Intrusive email sent by Mr. Al-fian to Professor Thio kind of derailed this impression. But nonetheless, even so, you got to appreciate his honesty in owning up to this issue and Mr Al-fian's subsequent intellectual responses to Dr. Thio.<br><br>You seem to forget about the middle ground of Singaporeans that exist i.e. straight folks ( like me) who simply are not affected by their presence; or in their best notion, " this is none of my business".<br><br>The religious leaders certainly have a lot more serious issues to deal with. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>For your argument to be balanced, well .. you got to rephrase it as "To All religious leaders, Please address all the social Ills in Singapore"</strong></span>. BUt even this title may not be good; because I do not view the Homosexual community as a social Ill. They are still normal citizens like you or me, they pay taxes, abide almost every the law (except abide 377a i guess); and they contribute to the economy. In fact, most likely, (if you are working in the creative consultancy or media business), they are most likely your bosses. ;-)<br><br></div>

With all the replies asking me to f*ck off and other similar juvenile behaviour, i was losing hope that the people in this forum could carry a civilised discussion. i have ignored the juvenile replies. But your reply shows that we can still discuss engagingly in an adult fashion<br><br>I take your point that there are a lot of social ills in our community.<br><br>We have teenage pregnancies, school drop outs, illegal immigrants, beggars. etc. Yes we do have these problems.<br><br>So? Does this mean that because we are ord bogged down with social ills, we should ignore the emerging ones?<br><br>All the social ills mentioned above ARE currently being engaged by our religious entities. All I'm saying is that this is a new social ill tht we should address also.<br><br>Yes I would catgorise it as a social ill.<br><br>Granted, you refuse to accept my reasons of moral collapse, family values, traditional values as my reason for considering it a social ill.<br><br>But what about the tangible ones?<br><br>Do you not consider the rise of sexually transmitted diseases tangible? Yes hetrosexual activity does spread AIDS, but do a google on the disease and you will see that homosexuals are of MORE at risk in contracting and spreading it.<br><br>Do you not consider the harassment of homosexuals tangible?<br><br>Maybe you are not the swimming kind. I swim almost everyday. Those who go down to delta swimming complex will surely know wat i mean. Also the geylang east swimming complex. me and a few apek regulr swimmers there by now would have known of a couple of men who check into the same shower cubicle in the afternoons. we have informed the life guards and police. apparently there is no law in singapore that makes for 2 men bathing together illegal so we have no case.<br><br>Yes this harrases me. cos i have to explain to my younger ones why 2 men are bathing in the same cubicle together.<br><br>Yes it harasses me when i go to orchard cineleisure level 4 toilet. ord twice i been there and u will see homosexuals misbehaving. they will enter the same cubicle, or take adjacent cubicles and perform their deeds through the empty space underneath the partition<br><br>Proof of what i say? very simple. go the the porn version of youtube (i will not type the url here, i think most know wat site im talking about)<br><br>and type "singapore" "gay"<br><br>wat you will get is various videos of homosexuals performing deeds in very, very public places like swimming pools, public toilets etc. unlike htrosexuals who do under the cover of darkness or emergency staircases, the gays have chosen to do it in full public view most of the time. thats why it harasses me for me and my youngs have witnessed these too many times.<br><br>go ahead, do search for the videos and you will know wat i mean.<br><br>in conclusion, im fine and dandy if homos want to do it in private and lead their normal lives.<br><br>but im not fine if they want to impose their lifestlye on others, by implying onto others that their lifestyle is the normal, by repealing our laws, etc.</div>

I am totally unaware of such public intrusions of homosexual sex. I thought they have better sense to do it in their own private space. This is indeed disturbing especially in the swimming complex's changing room. Yah; i guess there are indeed renegade gays couples who like hetero-couples also like outdoor sex (e.g. in cinema, public toilets, staircase landing, swimming pool etc etc) just to spice up their sex life. Then your topic should focus on addressing the emerging threat &amp; social Ills of such Renegade Homosexuals then. It can't be an All out assault on all gays then; since there are gays who respect public space; and they are just trying to breathe and survive in SG society.<br><br>With respect to the gay videos, frankly, if the persons in the video can be identified (i mean the faces are not covered), you could lodge a police report, and investigations will step in. Because, usually, the police will not act until someone makes an official police report about such videos. I guess, it would be right to reign in on these renagade homosexuals bah; in order not to jeopardize the achievements made so far by the pro-gay camp.<br><br>Yes, it is indeed an nice intellectual exchange of thoughts with you. Are you a parent? If so, i can understand the fears you have especially if you worry that your little boys in the swimming pool complex's changing room may be potentially sexual preys of these renagade homosexuals.<br><br></div>

Since you are find and dandy with what homosexuals do in private, you should support repealing such a discriminatory law. Your sensibilities are still protected against existing laws against public indecency.<br><br>Remember, S377a is nothing more than a declaration that homosexual acts are illegal. But it should not be any more illegal than heterosexual acts and that was the crux of the debate. We have repealed the laws against oral and anal sex which were equally unenforceable .
