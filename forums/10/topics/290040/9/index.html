Very very bad. Bad on so many levels I don't even know how to start explaining the problems with it. It reveals fundamental misunderstandings on what is 'natural' and ethics in general. But anyway, let's move beyond that for now.<br><br>Okay let's take your example, though I don't think you are using the word 'right' in the correct way.<br><br>Eating is "right" because you have to eat to live. As you pointed out, if you don't eat, you will eventually die, and death is generally considered a Bad Thing (though overeating is bad as well).<br><br>Homosexuality is "right" because when homosexuals improve their quality of life when they have consensual sex with other homosexuals of bisexuals. If homosexuals are denied the ability to have consensual sex with other homosexuality, they will be sexually frustrated and unhappy, and that is a Bad Thing.<br><br>Now let's get to your allegation that the instinct of sex is heterosexual, and that homosexuality is indicative of something having gone wrong with the 'natural' instinct.<br><br>I agree that homosexuality is a deviation from the normal sexual instinct. But there is nothing 'wrong' with it.<br><br>It's natural for my legs to be used for walking. If I use my leg to scratch my other leg, is that 'unnatural'? What about if I use my leg to kick a ball?<br><br>Your reasoning frightens me because it reflects a view that we moved away from years ago - and we are far better for it. Your view makes people suffer for what you feel is 'natural'.<br><br>Let me give you another example of your version of 'natural'/'right' and 'unnatural'/'wrong'. Many years ago, people thought that right handed was natural and left handed was unnatural. Right handedness was considered 'right' and left handedness was considered 'wrong'. In fact, sinister comes from the latin word for 'left'.<br><br>Parents and schools used to try to force left handed kids to use their right hand. This caused a lot of problems and prevented many kids from reaching their full potential as they were effectively handicapped.<br><br>We later realized that left-handedness, though 'unnatural' is perfectly okay.<br><br>Again, I find it amusing that you try to create the impression that 'geys' don't like your argument even though it makes sense. Your argument makes no sense. Period.</div></blockquote>U said my argument made no sense.<strong>Is this an insult or an dishonest comment?</strong><br><br>Maybe some children born to be left-handed.If they are really born to be so,then of course it is natural.Anyway,using left hand can also serve the purpose of the hand.<br><br>Is gey born?I don't think it is.Can homo sex achieve the prupose of sex, i.e. having children &amp; bring  them up?No.</div>
