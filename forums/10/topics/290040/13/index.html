            <div class='col-md body'>man some time ago I read in a book about genetics that homosexuality is essential to the overall development of the society... can't really remember what the book's title is but I found it in Toa Payoh library... it went on with a theory called selfish genes or something and that most gays are naturally born with their inclination, they were attracted to other boys since they were little and that they don't necessarily need to be effiminates. It also said that some animals practice homosexuality. ok I gave my two cents worth about that but if you ask me kids these days are being ghey just cuz its the trend and they wanna try "best of the both worlds". if you ask me I'm not a big fan of gheyness but I would'nt wanna waste my time and effort hating them. If someone wants to be ghey its their problem so long its consensual. But some fags wanna get poked, then they get sore and decide it was'nt as shiok as it was then they complain say they kenna taken advantage. its a grey area, I don't condone it but I'm not gonna voice out my intolerance of it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Incest can give birth to defect children, yes, but so can sex with an AIDS partner. Incest can lead to defect babies, but note that incest is not the act of creating babies.<br><br>Like the reasoning made by homosexuals, a sexual relationship is a private affair between two people. Why should the law be bothered by it?<br><br>The point is that throwing away any religious argument, there isn't any compelling reason to ban incest.</blockquote>If u ask me, I felt tat there should be a law tat made it necessary for people who had AIDs to tell their sexual partner (must be sober and of the right frame of mind) before they commit the act itself. I am not in favour of allowing incest because it cause defect children, and I am pro legislation to force person with AIDs to be legally bound to inform their sexual partner tat they have AIDs before they commit the act.<br><br>Now I don't find incest similar to homosexual and there is less compelling reason to ban homosexual. Wat say u ? U want to start a petition to ask the gov to force AIDs people to inform their sexual partner of their diesease ? I will sign tat one because it is the right thing to do.<br><br><blockquote>When u compare homo sex as tea &amp; coffee,u are saying it is morally right or good as hetero sex is.Why didn't u liken homo sex as a contaminated drink in your anology?Your anology is saying homo is morally right but u still claim it is no right or wrong.Your logics fails. </blockquote>I am trying to tell u it is a personal choice in the end.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> Furthermore I have already explained in the reply on 03 December 2007 Â· 11:58 PM<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Furthermore if they wanna drink some exotic drink which u think is spoilt, wat has it got to do with u ? Smelly toufu is really spoilt tofu but people like to eat it. Who r u to stop them ?</span><br><br>And why should homo be labelled as spoilt drink ? Wat physical justification did u use ? Then wat about monk and catholic father ? Given your analogy, they r spoilt drink too isn't it ?<br><br><blockquote>Homo can lead to promiscuity,then promiscuity lead to higher chances of geting AIDS.</blockquote>Tat is ridiculous. All sex lead to promiscuity. Banned sex and doomed the human population ?<br><br><blockquote>Truth is homosexuality is a perversion.<br>Sexual orientation, genetics, freedom of expression, is all bull. </blockquote>Prove it.<br><br><blockquote>Frankly how two consenting adults get their sexual kicks in the privacy of their homes, is their own business.<br>But the problem is they want this perversion to be 'accepted'. </blockquote>The issue is gays r legally banned in singapore. It is not about being accepted. It is about being illegal. Nobody is fighting for a case where gays have the right to make public statement or advertise on TV or showing obscenities around. I think the case is some people want to push their stand tat gays r abnormal and ban them from living the same space as them.<br><br><blockquote>Just because some animals do it, do not justify humans doing it too. Those animals are just as sick, psychologically. There are some creatures that are hermaprodite, these do not count as homosexuality.<br>They can shack up among themselves, but do not shout out to the world that they are normal. </blockquote>Then how do u justify the word "normal" ? Mother nature shows homosexuality is common by having lot of animals being homosexual. U say man is different and use morals, psyhology, human customs which r "man made" and "artificial" as reasons to be "normal" ?<br></div>

I think the word "choose" is not technically correct because common belief is homosexual is inborn<br><br><blockquote>That also mean homo sex is good too.Otherwise,how can it be a rational choice?Do u say homo sex is good?</blockquote>Why must u try to split everything into good or bad  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> Wat is good or not is subjective. Is drinking beer good ? Is eating oily and fatty food good ? Is taking more plastic bags during shopping good ? Is fasting to lose weight good ? Com'on... there r many things tat depend on the individual and r subjective. It is not good or bad or right or wrong, it all depend on who u r and the circumstances. In the above questions, it can be good or bad depending on the person who is doing it.</div>

Read Section 377A of the penal code.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Any male person who, in public or private, commits, or abets the commission of, or procures or attempts to procure the commission by any male person of, any act of gross indecency with another male person, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 2 years.</span><br><br>Tat is the proof.
