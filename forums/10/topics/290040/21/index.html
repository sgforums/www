It depends on whether I belong to a religion and my outlook, and whether the child shares my religious conviction.<br><br>It is a good question, nontheless. You might not have a homosexual child, but it is possible your child is autistic. Or born with Down Syndrome. Or born with that funny disease where you will shout and scream for no apparent reason.<br><br>Seriously I will be more worried with the latter cases. At least a normal gay can survive in society; whether the child with Down Syndrome can survive and even find a bf/gf or not is still question mark.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>
