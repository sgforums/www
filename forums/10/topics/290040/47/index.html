            <div class='col-md body'>However strongly we believe in our own point of view, it is likely that other people believe equally strongly in their own point of view.<br><br>A danger arises when we try to impose our point of view on others through insults or violence instead of intelligent discourse. They are likely to respond with insults or violence too.<br><br>There's a word for this phenomena, "blowback". It's describes consequences to a logical action that is not rational.<br><br>For example, a company boss decides that to become more profitable, he'll cut the number of staff to lower operating costs. This is logical and his profits increase.<br><br>However the remaining staff feel their jobs are threatened and spend their time trying to make each other look bad so that others will be laid off if or when the next round of layoff come about. There is a loss of productivity. Some may feel that they are next so they lose interest in their jobs and stop working as hard. Still others feel the company does not care for them so they find other jobs and leave. Still others believe this shows the company is not doing well, so they leave, taking clients with them. In time the company finds itself in real trouble.<br><br>This is what's known as "blowback".<br><br>Edited for grammer.<br></div>

I don't think they have made a choice to become a transvestite at such a young  age. They mixed with girls but were attracted to boys in an unnatural manner. It's inborn. They couldn't help it.<br><br>As a grown up, I've also come across women who like to dress like men and are attracted to women.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm not sure if I understand his point of view correctly and I don't want to be putting words in his mouth. So feel free to correct me if I'm wrong.<br><br>I think what he's trying to express is something like in the way that some men may choose not to be married because they prefer to have a different type of relationship without the consequences of marriage but that social/religious bodies influences them conform.<br><br>That in the same way gay people chose their lifestyle and social/religious bodies should also influence them conform.<br><br>Or something to that effect.
