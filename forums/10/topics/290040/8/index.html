When his parents found out, they were heartbroken. First they were angry, then they were sad. They hoped and prayed it was just a phase. They forbade him to bring boyfriends home or to have boyfriends accompany him to family gatherings.<br><br>Then they realized it was not a phase, and sadness turned to despair. They wondered where they had gone wrong. They were a Christian family. The family was quite well off. They brought up their children the best they could.<br><br>But at the end of the day, they accepted him for who he is because he is their son and they love him. And they don't think he turned gay because he was seduced into the lifestyle. They realized he was gay because that was who he is.<br><br>Ultimately, they loved him for who he is.<br><br>Was my friend ever taught that homosexuality is normal? No. Did my friend go to sunday school every week? Yes. My friend had a Methodist upbringing and went to ACS.<br><br>Did my friend choose to be gay? No. Life would have been much easier for him if he had been straight. But would he have been happy? Probably not.</div>

Now we're getting somewhere. Thank you for your answer.<br><br>So you accept the fact that your dislike of homosexuality is fundamentally religious in nature. And yes, I accept that it is your perspective. And since you didn't give me a non-religious reason for homosexuality to be morally wrong, I assume there isn't one.<br><br>So please answer two more questions.<br><br>1. Why should someone who does not accept your religion be governed by your moral views? I understand that from your perspective, homosexuality is wrong. Now why should someone from a secular/non-religious perspective be subject to your religious edicts. Should it, for example, be illegal for a Christian to eat pork?<br><br>2. You quoted from Leviticus 18:22 which states:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it is abomination.</span><br><br>In the same book, Leviticus 11:9-12 states:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">9 These shall ye eat of all that are in the waters: whatsoever hath fins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the rivers, them shall ye eat.<br>10 And all that have not fins and scales in the seas, and in the rivers, of all that move in the waters, and of any living thing which is in the waters, they shall be an abomination unto you:<br>11 They shall be even an abomination unto you; ye shall not eat of their flesh, but ye shall have their carcases in abomination.<br>12 Whatsoever hath no fins nor scales in the waters, that shall be an abomination unto you.</span><br><br>So now do you advocate making prawns, crab, lobster, oysters and shellfish in general illegal? And we need to make shark's fin soup illegal as well (though that's a good idea but for different reasons) since sharks have no scales.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It borders on discrimination with regards to sexual orientation. Furthermore it may lead to certain members of the public to break a law and use the status of 377A as an example to be excused just because he/she thinks the law is unjust. One cannot deny the possibilty of such incidents in future. Let's make it all crystal clear; if you cannot and will not enforce a law, get rid of it. This law is a joke, it is a testament to the narrowmindedness and the inability of certain groups of people to think beyond themselves, evidence that our country is truly not ready for the world.<br><br>(edited due grammatical error) Hey, I try my best.</div>

If they do it privately wat has it got to do with u ?<br><br><blockquote>religious people never condemned gays, but they don't agree with their lifestyle. apparently you condemn religion, but do you condemn the people practicing it? if you do, then you're no better than the worst of us. ok anyway, that's out of the point, why should you be surprised at my answer? lol, its really how i feel and that's really the way things should be done wat. you can't just enforce ppl to agree with you if they don't. </blockquote>I don't think so. I don't condemn religious people because I did not start a petition asking them to outlawed religious people. But I guess some religious people do. I am glad u knew u cannot enforce peole to agree with u on wat u believe in. Then why r u enforcing the authorities to agree with u by enforcing a law ?<br><br><blockquote>that's abit hard, but I'll give you a good 36% at least. consisting of praciticing buddhists, christians and muslims. and for the other 15%, they usually emerge when they found out their children are gay. </blockquote>Com'on... Wat makes u think everybody will have sons tat is gonna be gays when gays r allowed ? If u give such a biased conclusion then I can give one saying tat the 36% tat banned gays now will allow gay if they found themselves to be gays or have sons tat r gays but cannot be straight ever.<br><br>Furthermore, buddhist r not as focus on condemning gays as the other religion<br><br><blockquote>as for your point that both side did the same thing, that's why i said that if the roles were reversed, the religious rights should do the same thing. i don't think i was wrong in this sense. </blockquote>U mean sending hate mails ? I thought they already did<br><br><blockquote>but by demanding for us to agree with their lifestyle, thus legalizing their lifestyle, isn't that asking us to lie about our feelings about the issue?</blockquote>Legalising gays is not equal to accepting their lifestyle  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> It is acknowledging tat such a group of people existing in tis world. If u don't like it, nobody is asking to embrace them or force u to make friends with them. It is just to allow them to live legally.<br><br><blockquote>but they are living in singapore legally. i don't see them in lockups or in concentration camps or living in some ghetto. </blockquote>They r not living legally because according tot he law they r outlawed. If u do not want them to live their life publicly, then u should just work on a law tat prohibit open gays activities and not banning them. There r other laws tat prohibit acts of indecency. 377A is simply banning gays<br><br><blockquote>Do you know the consequence of telling the world you have a law and you will not enforce it?</blockquote>I felt tat the whole thing is a joke.</div>
