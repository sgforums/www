            <div class='col-md body'>The tone in which u talk to PRP is significantly different from the way you speak to other people. Typically u tell him not to debate simply because he is right and u felt the other people are not worth listening to his words. U are supporting him. U can deny all you want but the impression sticks. If u deny it, then u prove yourself to be an insincere person who don't mean wat u say and u get rid of PRP to avoid implicating yourself in</div>
