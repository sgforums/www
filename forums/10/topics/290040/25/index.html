            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>U are insincere and even dishonest.U also insulted me by saying my msg rubbish &amp; stupid .So I don't wish to debate with such kind of person. </blockquote>I have given my elaboration on why your message is rubbish and stupid. From the response of other people, I am not the only one tat think tat way. U know who actually help the most in the debate for and against homosexual ? It is actually u. Because u show how ignorant, extreme and biased the pro homosexual can become. And when it come to hard facts, u just completely ignore them.<br><br><blockquote>As someone said,u just rebut other ppl msg but don't establish your own stand.Why wouldn't u persuade others to your stand that no right or wrong for homo (and later u changed to whether homo is right or wrong depend on circustances)?</blockquote>I thought my stand is obvious  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> There is no reason to force 377A to exists. And I did not change my stand. I told u from the start things r not always in black and white or right and wrong. Why I say tat ? It is because it all depend on situation. I explained my stand and then u say I change my stand. Do u really read carefully ?<br><br>Wat about u ? I have stated many times tat u refused to answer other people question and even when u r speechless over a point, u just ignore completely wat the other people had said and just repeat your old, faulty and rebutted points all over again. I felt I already have a lot of patience in dealing with u. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
