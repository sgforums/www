            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>I have already said it is easy to say PROVE IT, to anything that is said, and add nothing. </blockquote>It is important because we r discussing scientific facts and the best person to provide the answer is scientist.<br><br><blockquote>I have also said I do not have my own studies, or experiments, or reports.<br>I presume it is links you want. Or others peoples findings. These are accepted as inconclusive. </blockquote>I agree it is inconclusive. But I have already mention a point 3 times which u refused to acknowledge or comment.<br><br>11 December 2007 Â· 05:09 PM<br>Ok, lets say the studies r not conclusive. Tat means gays maybe inborn. Since u cannot prove it to be wrong, then why r u punishing them by forcing them to remain single and lonely ? <strong>Given the benefit of doubt, we should practise tolerance and not discrimination</strong>. A person is innocent unless proven guilty. Why is tis good ? Because we rather jail 100 less criminals than jail one innocent person.<br><br>12 December 2007 Â· 02:03 PM<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Tat is right. I never say tat the studies r conclusive. However there r studies, reason and ground to say tat gays r inborn. U cannot prove it wrong as well. And there r more studies showing homosexual is not a illness. <strong>Since we cannot say for certain, then why condemn them ? Shouldn't we give them the benefit of the doubt and let them live as normal people because it can very well mean they r inborn to be homosexual</strong>. </span><br><br>13 December 2007 Â· 01:10 AM<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">I already told u. The result is inconclusive. <strong>And tat is why we should give them the benefit of the doubt</strong>. I have stated tis point many times and u simply ignore them. </span><br><br>Wat is your comment on it ? Why ignore my reply then repeat your old point again ? R u covering up your ears and eyes and just repeat wat u thought which is proven to be wrong before ?<br><br><blockquote>Why is homosexuality not a perversion?<br>Sexual intercourse is a liason between male and female. That is the basis for sexuality. This developed into courtship, intimacies, romance, foreplay. And the basis is male/female relationship . Any deviation is a perversion, even when it is harmless.<br>Homosexuality, the second syllably denotes sex, and it deviates from the basic male/female liason to a same gender liason. Is is a hybrid? No conclusive proof.</blockquote>Who r u to judge wat is sexuality <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> Who r u to define wat is perversion or not ? Sexuality, based on dictionary is simply sexual behavior in sexual organism. Homosexual is part of tis sexuality. Who r u to redefine the word and exclude it out ? Mother nature or god had made animals gay themself. Who r u to say they r wrong and tat tat is not wat sexuality is all about ?<br><br>Who r u to tell us how people should go about in their sexual intercourse ?Psychologist do not regard it as a perversion but u do. Wat give u the right to give such a conclusion ? Did u do any studies at all or u just tell us wat u think ? Wat do u think about chewing gums in singapore before ?<br><br><blockquote>IMO, homosexuality is buddy or sistership that went too far. A man can have a bossum buddy, and live with him, nothing wrong with that. But to screw his arse, kiss him, and the like, and marry him! that's the perversion.<br>Being buddies is not. Same with sistership. Just don't cross the line. </blockquote>I am glad u write the word "IMO" in the beginning. Well IMO, Homosexual r people who r born to like people of the same sex. They too can like someone and love someone. The difference is due to their physical body, they like someone of the same sex. U can imagine yourself liking men like a normal woman, but u have a man body. If u think liking someone is a perversion, then everybody is perverted.<br><br><blockquote>Homosexuality is a perversion, whether you accept it or not. </blockquote>I wanna say the old words again  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br>Prove it. Otherwise u r just telling me wat u think which can be wrong.<br><br><blockquote>In my boyhood kampong, there were two men living together, whom I thought were brothers at that time. We did'nt think anything about them, were friends with them. Its only on hindsight that I realise they were gays. Now I don't know where they are, but if I meet them, I would greet them like any of my old kampong elderly.<br>At present, I personaly know of two women, who are like inseparable sisters, I and everyone else suspect they are lesbians. But we don't know, and don't care. </blockquote>Then why enforce a law making them illegal ? Why not just acknowledge such people exist and let the law die a nature death ?<br><br><blockquote>I say again, what they do in the privacy of their bedrooms is their own business.<br>And the law holds the same, unless there is a complaint. </blockquote>The law explicitly mention tat it is illegal whether it is done privately or not. I have mention tat in the previous statement before. If there is no complaints, u can do anything u want. A complaint only can make u go scotfree, but u still commit the offence. I can kill a vangabond with no families and friends and go away scot free because there is no complaints. But I still had committed the offence of murder.<br><br>Furthermore, who r u to say tat when the gays do it privately there won't have a complainant ? Maybe a busybody using a binoculars at their neighbour's window can spot the gay couple doing intimacy acts ? Maybe when gays r doing the act in their room, they forget to lock the door and a nun living at a next door in the hotel budge into the wrong room ? Maybe a burglar going into a room spotted the gay doing their act in their room ? U know I can go on and on... Who r u to say there won't be a complainant in all cases for the rest of time ? Just written in the law is already enough justification to show it is illegal to do it even in private.<br><br><blockquote>But the fact that higher percentage of geys infected with AIDS does indicate something unfavorable to homo sex</blockquote>Indian have a worse case of obesity compared with other races. So does tat indicate something unfavourable about the indian race ?<br><br><blockquote>The govt doesn't ban geys. Section 377A is just a piece of legislation which says the majortiy of the members of parliament don't approve gey sex and geys can't publicly promote it because it is a crime.</blockquote>So u expect them to live a life of calibracy for your... ehh.. wat reasons do u have to force them not to have sex ? Because u don't like it ? Because u do not like it u force them to remain a virgin forever ? Does tat sounds ridiculous to u ? It sounds ridiculous to me.<br><br><blockquote>1.The natural instinct of sex is heterrosexual.Homo goes against nature. </blockquote>Nature shows animals r homosexual themselves. The nature instinct of sex is mixed.<br><br><blockquote>2.The natural purpose of sex is procreation.Homo sex can't achieve the purpose of sex.So it goes against the nature. </blockquote>The purpose of sex is also enjoyment. And most, and I mean 99% of the world population people in tis world have sex some time in their life simply for enjoyment. If tat is the case everybody is guilty. And u should state a law banning all contraceptives too<br><br><blockquote>3.Higher percentage (than heterosexauals') of local geys are infected with AIDS. </blockquote>So ? Higher percentage of car accidents r motorcyclists. So we should label it as dangerous and ban motorcycle ?<br><br><blockquote>1.It follows the nature (natural instinct &amp; purpose of sex). </blockquote>True, But u cannot prove nature does not allow homosexual<br><br><blockquote>2.It is a joy to have babies and bringing them up<br><br>3.The children can look after their old parrents. </blockquote>Tell tat to the monks and catholic fathers.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by stupidissmart:</div><div class="quote_body">It is important because we r discussing scientific facts and the best person to provide the answer is scientist.<br><br>I agree it is inconclusive. But I have already mention a point 3 times which u refused to acknowledge or comment.<br><br>11 December 2007 Â· 05:09 PM<br>Ok, lets say the studies r not conclusive. Tat means gays maybe inborn. Since u cannot prove it to be wrong, then why r u punishing them by forcing them to remain single and lonely ? Given the benefit of doubt, we should practise tolerance and not discrimination. A person is innocent unless proven guilty. Why is tis good ? Because we rather jail 100 less criminals than jail one innocent person.<br><br>12 December 2007 Â· 02:03 PM<br>Tat is right. I never say tat the studies r conclusive. However there r studies, reason and ground to say tat gays r inborn. U cannot prove it wrong as well. And there r more studies showing homosexual is not a illness. Since we cannot say for certain, then why condemn them ? Shouldn't we give them the benefit of the doubt and let them live as normal people because it can very well mean they r inborn to be homosexual.<br><br>13 December 2007 Â· 01:10 AM<br><br>I already told u. The result is inconclusive. And tat is why we should give them the benefit of the doubt. I have stated tis point many times and u simply ignore them.<br><br>Wat is your comment on it ? Why ignore my reply then repeat your old point again ? R u covering up your ears and eyes and just repeat wat u thought which is proven to be wrong before ?<br><br>Who r u to judge wat is sexuality  Who r u to define wat is perversion or not ? Sexuality, based on dictionary is simply sexual behavior in sexual organism. Homosexual is part of tis sexuality. Who r u to redefine the word and exclude it out ? Mother nature or god had made animals gay themself. Who r u to say they r wrong and tat tat is not wat sexuality is all about ?<br><br>Who r u to tell us how people should go about in their sexual intercourse ?Psychologist do not regard it as a perversion but u do. Wat give u the right to give such a conclusion ? Did u do any studies at all or u just tell us wat u think ? Wat do u think about chewing gums in singapore before ?<br><br>I am glad u write the word "IMO" in the beginning. Well IMO, Homosexual r people who r born to like people of the same sex. They too can like someone and love someone. The difference is due to their physical body, they like someone of the same sex. U can imagine yourself liking men like a normal woman, but u have a man body. If u think liking someone is a perversion, then everybody is perverted.<br><br>I wanna say the old words again<br>Prove it. Otherwise u r just telling me wat u think which can be wrong.<br><br>Then why enforce a law making them illegal ? Why not just acknowledge such people exist and let the law die a nature death ?<br><br>The law explicitly mention tat it is illegal whether it is done privately or not. I have mention tat in the previous statement before. If there is no complaints, u can do anything u want. A complaint only can make u go scotfree, but u still commit the offence. I can kill a vangabond with no families and friends and go away scot free because there is no complaints. But I still had committed the offence of murder.<br><br>Furthermore, who r u to say tat when the gays do it privately there won't have a complainant ? Maybe a busybody using a binoculars at their neighbour's window can spot the gay couple doing intimacy acts ? Maybe when gays r doing the act in their room, they forget to lock the door and a nun living at a next door in the hotel budge into the wrong room ? Maybe a burglar going into a room spotted the gay doing their act in their room ? U know I can go on and on... Who r u to say there won't be a complainant in all cases for the rest of time ? Just written in the law is already enough justification to show it is illegal to do it even in private.<br><br>Indian have a worse case of obesity compared with other races. So does tat indicate something unfavourable about the indian race ?<br><br>So u expect them to live a life of calibracy for your... ehh.. wat reasons do u have to force them not to have sex ? Because u don't like it ? Because u do not like it u force them to remain a virgin forever ? Does tat sounds ridiculous to u ? It sounds ridiculous to me.<br><br>Nature shows animals r homosexual themselves. The nature instinct of sex is mixed.<br><br>The purpose of sex is also enjoyment. And most, and I mean 99% of the world population people in tis world have sex some time in their life simply for enjoyment. If tat is the case everybody is guilty. And u should state a law banning all contraceptives too<br><br>So ? Higher percentage of car accidents r motorcyclists. So we should label it as dangerous and ban motorcycle ?<br><br>True, But u cannot prove nature does not allow homosexual<br><br>Tell tat to the monks and catholic fathers<br><br></div></blockquote>PRP said this is tedious (some where previously). I quite agree with him on that.<br>This thread is not moving in any direction.<br>You only post coments on people's post.<br>Therefore it is very regressive.<br>You do not share any of your experiences, and you are extemely defensive.<br>Do you need to be scientific on this matter?<br>People have contributed to this subject, it is their 2 cents worth.<br>Have you contributed?<br>Will one, whatever their stand,  walk away with more understanding all around?<br>I have a feeling that gays are annoyed with you because you do not help their cause by being defensive.<br>I am not gay, neither am I anti-gay, but I will not support the call for the establishment of a gay lifestyle.<br>Thats my perogative, so don't ask me for scientific proof for it.<br><br>BTW, who are you to give them the benefit of the doubt? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Anyway I am hungry, i think I'll head for Chinatown for some sausages, that Austrian has a very yummy cheese sausage, that very filling.

I believe people will walk away with more understanding. At least u understand tat chewing gums is banned in singapore, there is no science proving homo as a peversion or not nature and 377A affect private life as well. To PRP he understand wat is homosexual, no clear cut case on wat is right and wrong and generally homosexual r not promiscuous.

They have a higher proportion of dying due to lung diesease. Man isn't tat terrible !<br><br>And u know wat, these people have to take medication regularly and tat is an abomination ! Asthma is against nature because they have to take medication and drug to curb their diesease. Men should not have to take medication everyday, men should not breath through machine, but these people violate these nature rules and so should be banned. They eat medicine because they r addicited to eating medicine. Isn't tat a perversion ? Nope, I don't care if science show tat they eat medicine because they have to.

I say it is a perversion is enough and my thinking is the more right compared to scientists or psychologists.<br><br>U can try telling me anything u want, but I don't like means I don't like. And I have the right not to like them and discriminate them and remain as bigot because it is my right.
