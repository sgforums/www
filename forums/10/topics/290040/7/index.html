You have a chance to be enlightened.<br><br>Straight people, by definition, will never find homosexuality normal. But they can find it acceptable.

Also, my girlfriend would kill me for cheating on her.<br><br>Anyway, who's to say that everyone has to be normal? What's next? Making long hair illegal? Banning people who like to sleep naked or people who prefer to sleep in pajamas (whatever is considered normal)? Maybe it should be illegal for men to pee sitting down.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>what's next? people with bestiality issues wanting the rights to screw their pet dogs?<br></strong></blockquote><br><br>The issue here (for the 13517871th time) is consent. Sex with children is illegal because they are below the age of consent. We don't know when exactly children are able to give consent, so we arbitrarily assign an age of 16 as the age of consent. Some children are mature enough to give consent as young as 13, some will never be mature enough (Britney Spears). However, we hope that 16 is a good compromise.<br><br>Now if you have a dog who can say, "hey baby, I want you to screw me in the ass. Hard." Please let me know.<br></div>

They are to be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads."</strong><br><br>and these are the specific instructions regarding pre-marital sex at that time:<br><br><strong>"If a man seduces a virgin who is not pledged to be married and sleeps with her, he must pay the bride-price, and she shall be his wife.  If her father absolutely refuses to give her to him, he must still pay the bride-price for virgins."<br><br>"If a man happens to meet a virgin who is not pledged to be married and rapes her and they are discovered,  he shall pay the girl's father fifty shekels of silver.  He must marry the girl, for he has violated her. He can never divorce her as long as he lives."</strong><br><br>Now I'm not sure whether in this case, it's a case of rape, or a case of consensual sex la. But I'll just see it as the same for now, until someone informs me otherwise.<br><br>as you can see, the bible although declares both deeds as morally wrong, but the compensation and restitutions are different, and the consequences are weighed differently.<br><br>now, you're free to reject biblical teachings as a guide for how we ought to live, but just humour me for now.<br><br>because this is how God view these 2 issues as different, that's why i don't think you can ask me to compare homosexual sex and pre-marital sex. and use homosexual sex constraints for the issue of pre-marital sex.<br></div>
