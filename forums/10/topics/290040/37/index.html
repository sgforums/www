            <div class='col-md body'>Allow me to summarise the whole argument of incest so far. If anyone think I am wrong, they r free to correct me<br><br>People tat support 377A to be around used incest as a ground to attack people who r against the existence of 377A. There r some similarities between the 2. Incest also deal with an act in private, much like homosexual. Both appears to harm no other party of society except the issue or reproduction. If incest is prohibited, while not prohibit homosexual ?<br><br>My arguments r incest is much worse than homosexual. First thing is, homosexual r inborn while incest is not inborn. Incest is a choice, because the person involved like people of their opposite sex and they can choose other. Homosexuals, medically, can only choose guys. If we set a law prohibiting homosexual from sex, then we r depriving these minority a grave nature need especially when they have no fault of their own.<br><br>Second, incest can give defect children tat have very poor and adverse health conditions. It is no longer between 2 consenting adults but involved a third party here. And the children lives can be very short, very miserable and very painful for all parties. Homosexual does not give such problems.<br><br>Third, incest involves people who have significant influence over others such as a father to a daughter or a brother to a sister. They can influence the latter to have sex with them due to their dependence and influence on them which should be discouraged. Homosexual do not have such problems. Their relationship does not involved family members but people from society, which is not different from other straight relationship.<br><br>Hence I conclude these 2 acts r not the same, incest being one tat caused greater problems to society and therefore there is no contradiction in banning incest while allowing homosexual to have sex. Tis is further amplified by the fact tat the anti gay people r speechless over why gays should be outlawed. They cannot even state a single reason why despite being challenged many times<br><br>Now the anti gay people bring in AIDs people to show tat having defective children shoudn't be considered when debating whether should incest be allowed. I find tat he is simply trying to confuse the fact tat incest give defective children is true. Nobody can deny tat incest can give defective children, and tat make it worse than homosexual, and tis is a valid consideration.<br><br>Should AIDs patient be criminised ?<br><br>My personal view is tat AIDs patient must inform their sexual partner of their condition prior to having a sexual act to protect the partner. In tis sense I support legislation against AIDs patient, which is consistent with my view on incest. However tis is far far away from the original discussion about homosexual.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>An example is the motorcycle. Generally motorcycle caused more accidents than cars. Law makers have to take tis point into consideration before setting the law on the use of motorcycle. Tat is why licensing of motorcycle (full class 2 compared with full class 3) is more difficult than cars. Some people can argue tat if the motorcyclist is careful, then there will be no accidents. But tat is in an ideal case and from statistics, things go to normal distribution after a large sample. Law makers have to take accidents from motorocycle as a consideration in forming laws regarding to motorcycles. And tat is why we should take into consideration incest can give defective birth when we talk about incest.</div>

First thing is, homosexual r inborn while incest is not inborn.

But does this mean you can force them not to choose this?<br><br><blockquote>Second, incest can give defect children tat have very poor and adverse health conditions. It is no longer between 2 consenting adults but involved a third party here. And the children lives can be very short, very miserable and very painful for all parties.</blockquote>They can give defect children, just like sex with HIV person can give birth to a HIV child. Likewise with syphilis or gonorrhea.<br><br><blockquote>Third, incest involves people who have significant influence over others such as a father to a daughter or a brother to a sister. They can influence the latter to have sex with them due to their dependence and influence on them which should be discouraged.</blockquote>You are muddling the issue. If the girl is underage, it will be criminal anyway. In general, if one party is too young, it is considered child abuse. So please do not muddle these scenarios with the archtype scenario.<br><br><blockquote>Tis is further amplified by the fact tat the anti gay people r speechless over why gays should be outlawed.

If anything, I also support mandatory declaration.<br><br>I realize you consistently avoided my question of why HIV sex is not criminalised. If your reasoning about banning incest is valid, then consensual HIV sex should have been criminalised long ago.</div>

Contrary to what SIS thinks, incest law is there not mainly because it will bring about defect children.

Just like homosexuality in the past, in Christian nations.<br><br>If it is a societal taboo, we can challenge it.
