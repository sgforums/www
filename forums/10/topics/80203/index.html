            <div class='col-md body'>From Strait Times Webby:-<br><br>CRAWFORD (Texas) - President George W. Bush suffered cuts and bruises when he fell while mountain biking on his ranch, White House spokesman Trent Duffy said.<br><br>Mr Duffy said the President was riding on Saturday with a military aide, members of the Secret Service and his personal physician, Dr Richard Tubb.<br>Advertisement<br><br>'He had minor abrasions and scratches on his chin, upper lip, nose, right hand and both knees,' the spokesman said. 'Dr Tubb, who was with him, cleaned his scratches, said he was fine. The Secret Service offered to drive him back to the house. He declined and finished his ride.'<br><br>Mr Bush was wearing his bike helmet and a mouth guard when the mishap occurred. Mr Duffy said he didn't know exactly how the accident happened.<br><br>'It's been raining a lot and the topsoil is loose,' he said. 'You know this president. He likes to go all out. Suffice it to say he wasn't whistling show tunes.'<br><br>Mr Bush left Crawford shortly after the bike mishap for Austin, where he was attending a private party of his daughter, Jenna, who graduated from the University of Texas earlier in the day.<br><br>As he departed from the presidential helicopter with his wife, scrapes were visible on his right temple and chin. Close-up shots taken by photographers revealed other scrapes above his lip and on the end of his nose.<br><br>Earlier this month, Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry took a spill from his bicycle while riding with Secret Service agents through Concord, Massachusetts. Mr Kerry fell when his bike hit a patch of sand. He was not injured.<br><br>Told about the mishap, Mr Kerry said: 'I hope he's OK. I didn't know the President rode a bike.' -- AP<br><br>Isn't it amazing that this kind of news also can get reported, whats next?
