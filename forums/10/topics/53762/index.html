And that's a sharp contrast from the previous five years, when Singaporeans and permanent residents got four out of every five new jobs.<br><br>The reversal is cause for concern and action, say Nanyang Technological University (NTU) economists.<br><br>They think that the Government should not only take a hard look at Singapore's dependence on foreigners, but also try harder to match Singaporeans to new jobs here.<br><br>'We should review this policy of dependence on foreign workers... to see if we can fine-tune or adjust it,' said NTU's Professor of Economics Lim Chong Yah at a media briefing. 'Otherwise, we could have an economic rebound with very little impact on the unemployment situation.'<br><br>Singapore has about 800,000 foreign workers, from unskilled to those in high-end jobs, and a jobless rate of 4.5 per cent or nearly 90,000 workers as at March.<br><br>The Government has long argued that using foreign workers, especially in highly-skilled positions, is vital to keeping the Republic's economy competitive.<br><br>While not disputing this, the academics suggested that more Singaporeans could be filling some of the jobs currently held by foreigners.<br><br>The NTU dons suggested that the recently announced statutory board for continuing education and training should also act as a one-stop job-matching agency.<br><br>Said NTU Associate Professor Tan Khee Giap at a media briefing to release NTU's bi-annual forecasts for the Singapore economy: 'The foreign workforce buffer is meant to be flexible.<br><br>'If we fully exploit this flexibility, we micro-manage it well, the unemployment problem can be mitigated.'<br><br>Still, this will work only if Singaporeans are willing to change their mindsets and adjust their expectations.<br><br>More than half of public bus drivers here are foreigners, as are many auditors, young lawyers, bank officers, electricians and hairdressers.<br><br>Prof Tan said: 'Something can be done if we job match properly. But if Singaporeans don't want to take up the jobs, then some businesses can't be viable.'<br><br>The academics found that between 1992 and 1997, when total employment rose by 250,000, Singaporeans and PRs filled four out of five new jobs created.<br><br>But from 1997 to 2002, not only did total employment rise by a smaller 187,000, but just one in four jobs went to Singaporeans and PRs.<br><br>Yesterday, Prof Lim, former chairman of the National Wages Council, also said that in the light of recent lay-offs, the flexible wage system should be re-examined to see if it was still working well and being implemented closely.<br><br>'My suggestion is that it's worth looking at the efficacy and effectiveness of a flexi-wage system,' he said, adding that although the system had contributed a lot, he wondered if it had done enough to curtail retrenchments.<br><br>At the same time, he said that contrary to the prevailing view, Singapore should keep the use of the Central Provident Fund rate as a weapon to fight recessions.<br><br><a href="http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/topstories/story/0,4386,202423,00.html?" rel="nofollow">http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/topstories/story/0,4386,202423,00.html?</a></div>

(seeing as i hate sweet stuff, no less!)<br><br>choco:<br><br>well i don't doubt ur figures and in fact quite believe them. however we must ask ourselves why businesses are employing more foreigners AND why more foreigners are accepting the jobs. is it becos singaporeans cannot do the job well? is it becos singaporeans DO NOT WANT to do that kind of work?<br><br>i do agree that the low wage that foreigners (low-level jobs) demand is a "market spoiler" but sometimes we can come down to basics. wat is the diff between a foreigner and a singaporean when it comes to why one can accept a lower pay and one cannot? both are humans, both need a roof, and food and water. just that one has higher expectations and needs a "better life". disclaimer: these are purely generalisations.<br><br>ok then we have those over-paid expats that seem like they sit or their ass and do nothing machiam collecting royalty like that. the company that pays them is usually some big MNC from overseas. of course they will put their "kaki lang" there. who are we to dictate who should hold those high end positions when the company doesn't even belong to singapore?<br><br>anyway back to the point, i dun see the govt letting foreigners in to work an extremely bad thing. it takes two to clap, the govt lets them in, but they still have to be employed. and anyway cmon, it's not like any kuching kurak fella can come in and work as he pleases. i'm sure there are some procedures to go thru to regulate such things?<br><br>and if the govt were to stop all this becos singaporeans are in need of jobs, the businesses are gonna complain becos singaporeans demand such a high pay, and job hop around like nobody's business. not happee only quit. i really can't see singaporean coolies out there doing wat the bangalars are doing with our new circle line, can u? i will even put my head out and say even i won't work as a coolie if push came to shove. would u see ur son or brother or father being a coolie if push came to shove? if yes then u steady! but hear me when i say that won't be the typical singaporean attitude.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree with your "general" assessment of Singaporean mentality - when applied to the manufacturing industry. In production line employment, most Singaporeans are job hoppers.  Foreigners stay on longer.  Perhaps they have higher level of tolerance.  They're usually single, with low cost of living and most money is spent back home.  It's difficult to earn low wages and yet live &amp; play in Singapore.  Something has to be done to correct the average cost of living here.<br><br>The general trend of Singapore employees now is that they try to change their mentality &amp; lower expectations but I think employers are already too used to having a large supply of foreign workers and don't see hiring local as a priority.  There was a suggestion of micro-managing employment and job matching.  Not sure if that's a worthy use of resource.  Perhaps alittle more time is needed for market adjustment.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by jOhO:</div><div class="quote_body">and if the govt were to stop all this becos singaporeans are in need of jobs, the businesses are gonna complain becos singaporeans demand such a high pay, and job hop around like nobody's business. not happee only quit. i really can't see singaporean coolies out there doing wat the bangalars are doing with our new circle line, can u? i will even put my head out and say even i won't work as a coolie if push came to shove. would u see ur son or brother or father being a coolie if push came to shove? if yes then u steady! but hear me when i say that won't be the typical singaporean attitude.</div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sadly the Singaporean is left high and dry when it comes to jobs, our high cost of living here means that when it comes to money, we will always end up deficit.<br><br>So if the local takes the same pay as an FT, he will actually end up poorer as the cash he earns has less spending power here and he has to support an expensive life here.<br><br>That's why they demand higher pay.<br><br>Bascially the govt. interests are going to conflict. They want us to have bigger families yet raising even a kid is so expensive, and now they want us to be less choosy and accept lower pay. No wonder their calls usually fall on deaf ears, it just won't fly far like that. Unless they expect Singaporeans to lower their standard of living, so much for the great Singapore being a world class city eh? Maybe only for FTs to come and earn bucks that is.<br><br>Anyway, FTs are not the problem, it is the unlevel playing field that the local starts out with that leaves him disadvantaged. He cannot demand a lower pay because that would compromise his standard of living (and these people are not those who want to live in style but just to scrape on by comfortably)<br><br>Consider all the stuff we have to pay off, CPF, the like... like that how can? Even using SBS "transit" now cost some more when they have to take two buses and train to get around compared to one bus before thanks to SBS myopic planning that is designed to hurt the consumer and save their hides.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>While I can understand that different interpretations or analysis of one set of statistics can result in 2 different conclusions being drawn, the huge discrepancy in the results obtained by the NTU lecturers and the MoM is nothing short of startling. I might be jumping the gun here, but IMO this is no longer a case of different interpretations or analysis, but someone is lying, and lying through his teeth at that. Who? I don't want to speculate, but which of the 2 sides in this case has something to gain from giving 1 interpretation, and which side has nothing to gain?<br><br>As for claims that Singaporeans demand more than foreigners, can Singaporeans honestly have ALL the blame heaped on them? Look at the cost of living here. We spend our money here, we get married here, we have kids here. The foreigners take our money, get married and have kids where things cost much less than here and each S$ they earned can stretch further. Can Singaporeans get by by asking less?<br><br>The mentality of the average Singaporean has to change, no doubt about that. But Singaporean workers demand a certain amount because they need to feed themselves and their dependents here, the FTs don't. At the rate wages are going down but is not reciprocated by a similar fall in the cost of living, how long can even those who are working, carry on?</div>

The difference comes when a businessman starts to decide the priority of his venture: For the good of his own enterprise or for the larger cause.

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually i think the true number is probably between the NTU figures and that of the Man Power Ministry.<br><br>I think we would already had a serious jobless problem and the associated social disruption if the figures are as bad as the NTU researchers suggest. There would already be rallies and demostrations if the jobless issue is so out of paced regardless of whatever laws are in place. The word of law cannot hold back hungry men who have nothing to do when they're jobless.<br><br>But i doubt the Man Power Ministry's figures are even close to the truth, if the people could ask the exact figures on how they came to their conclusion of 9 out of 10 new jobs go to Singaporeans there would probably be some numbers they somehow "neglected" to factor in.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I interpret this as a very dangerous sign:<br>Singapore is hitting a wall in its development, where the costs of living have been jacked up so high that it is no longer economical to employ Singaporeans in Singapore.<br><br>And the situation will not improve.  We can only take comfort in the fact that Singapore remains a stable environment in a region with much political strife and uncertainty, with the threat of terrorism extremely pronounced in nearby countries like Indonesia.  However, how long can this remain the case?  People in Indonesia and Phillipines are sick and tired of such news.  Arroyo in Phillipines may be criticised in other areas, but the fact is that she has done a rather good job of cleaning up her country politically.  Even in handling of the recent crisis in Manila, Arroyo has above all tried to ensure stability in Phillipines and a show of fairness for the military personnel involved.<br><br>Back in Singapore, we see more foreigners everywhere we turn.  It is more often than not that we see a foreigner when we ride in the MRT.  In schools, we have Thai, PRC, Hongkong, Vietnamese, Indonesian and Malaysian children.  Like it or not, Singapore IS open to foreigners and like it or not we MUST compete with foreigners for jobs in Singapore.  The pseudo- Unions in Singapore are not making life alot better for us the lowly minions of Singapore, nor are they going to change any time soon.<br><br>As we face increasing competition, the government continues to see its role as making Singaporeans THINK they are well-off, rather than doing anything concrete.<br><br>In conclusion . . .<br>If current trends continue, we're all fu*kin screwed.<br><br>Btw, if the 'recession' doesn't clear up in at the VERY most ONE year, we won't be facing a recession anymore, its gonna be a 'depression'.  But I doubt Singapore will LOOK LIKE its actually are doin so badly.  For one, theres an elections in between, the government will probably pump money somewhere useful for once to try to create a nicer economic image. . .<br><br>my two cents</div>

and with each sector further broken into Managerial, Supervisory, and Worker levels, and then again into the various sectors of the Economy Â– such as Finance, Retail, Service, Maintenance, Public Works, Manufacturing Â– Food, Ship Building and Repair, Consumer Products, Electrical and Electronics.<br><br>There is certainly a heavy reliance on Foreign Talent in the Money World - especially with SingaporeÂ’s attempt to be one of the financial hubs in the Money World.<br><br>With the merging of banks over the last three years, structural change have occurred that resulted in many retrenched Singaporean Workers Â– both Managerial, Supervisors, and Workers.<br><br>How many of these have been reemployed by new Financial Institutions that have been licensed to set up new offices in Singapore over the same three years of the Singapore Banking System being restructured ?<br><br>How many of these new Financial Institutions that set up shops bring along their own in-house talents from their original home office ?<br><br>With our Singapore Government abhorring the reliance of legislations to protect Singapore Citizens rightÂ’s to a job, it is more then likely that these new Financial Institutions - that set up shop in Singapore - would have kept their own financial trading skills and knowledge Â“In-houseÂ”.<br><br>The Manufacturing and Shipbuilding-Repair industries have seen Singaporeans manning managerial and supervisory positions, and a large dependence of Â“lower wageÂ” foreign workers from Malaysia, Indonesia, Myanmar, Thailand, Bangladeshi, and PR China.<br><br>Over the last twenty years, the Singapore Government has pushed our wages higher, with each annual wage increment review, forcing industries and services to abandon work procedures that are heavily dependent on low wage-workers.<br><br>The policy was to encourage the introduction of higher value added products and work processes, so as to bring our worker into a higher plane of skill.<br><br>While this policy is laudable, Singapore do not enjoy some features that are commonly found in the other industrial nations of Asia, Europe and USA; and that is population size that gives their home industries a large domestic market to keep the gears moving and to remain responsible to its own homeland.<br><br>Even with the big brand names Â– such as Motorola, Nokia, Ericsson, Ford, Nissan, Honda, Toyota, Volkswagen, Mercedes, Volvo, and others Â– these industrial nations have also seen their own leading manufacturers move overseas to lower cost centers of production.<br><br>While most of these brand names have moved to lower cost centers of production, they still employ a sizeable number of workers in their home operations; and also employ their own nationals to look after the interests of these national companies that moved overseas.<br><br>While the Singapore Government legislate against Singapore Companies from being too dependent on Foreign Workers Â– insisting that there should be at least five Singaporean Workers before any number more than five foreign workers will be approved Â– there is no legislations that will require any Foreign Investors to employ a proportionate numbers of locals at a pre-determined ratio of foreign talents.<br><br>This legislation weighs against Singapore Companies as it hits at their dependence on low skilled labor, while the same legislations do not apply to ANY companies who need Foreign Talent above a certain wage level.<br><br>We can see many foreign Â“talentsÂ” in low wage jobs that do not pay enough for the high Â“SwissÂ” Standard of Living that the Government has created for us Â– with its accompanying high Cost of Living.<br><br>At the same time, we can also see many foreigners with Â“real TalentÂ” in jobs that are in the Â“higher wage levelsÂ” Â– which the Singapore Government Â“WELCOMESÂ”, as the Government believe that One such Foreign Talent can create ten jobs for Singaporeans.<br><br>Sadly, it is not clear what kind of jobs have been created with the employment of such Â“high valueÂ” Foreign Talent.<br><br></div>

The information would help them see whether they have the right skills or are pricing themselves out of the sector.<br><br>Said Dr Khor: 'Information can be given in a transparent way which will help the situation and not compromise national interests.'<br><br>Another MP, Mr Tan Soo Khoon (East Coast GRC), spoke for most of the 35 people interviewed when he said people were still trying to understand the wide gap between the Government's figures and those of the NTU economists.<br><br>'Given the present unemployment situation... I think people feel that the truth is somewhere in between and hence more convincing is needed,' he said.<br><br>Several also said they would like to know the breakdown in the nine in 10 jobs going to the resident workforce, compared to one going to a foreigner.<br><br>How many of the nine are Singaporeans, how many are permanent residents and how many became PRs only recently, was one question repeatedly being asked, showing the depth of concern over foreign workers in the economy.<br><br>This, despite many illustrations and examples given by the Government to show that foreign talents create, rather than take away, jobs.<br><br>MPs Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio GRC) and Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah) said their anecdotal evidence show MOM's figures to be correct.<br><br>As MPs, they have seen and been told of more foreigners not getting employment passes and work permits.<br><br>However, as businessman Archie Teo, 28, said: 'We can't validate which set of statistics is accurate. But that's not the point. A Pandora's Box has been opened.'<br><br>-- Additional reporting by Tanya Fong<br></div>

That decision came after Indonesia said it wanted the figures made public to bolster its efforts to combat smuggling. The trade data had been kept secret since 1974, under an agreement with Indonesia's then President Suharto.<br><br>Economists are asking for more details on Singapore's performance after the March outbreak of SARS stalled tourism and business travel to Asia. Singapore's economy contracted at an annual 12 percent pace in the second quarter, the worst on record. The seasonally-adjusted unemployment rate was 4.5 percent in June, unchanged from March and close to a 15-year high of 4.6 percent in September 2002. The jobless rate this year may exceed 5.5 percent, the government has said.<br><br>`A Full Picture'<br><br>``Singaporeans and people who follow the economy need to know the whole set of data,'' said Manu Bhaskaran, Singapore- based head of economic research at Centennial Group Inc., an advisory group based in Washington DC. ``Manpower data is one of the most important sets so you can get a full picture of the economy. It's vital that data is released.''<br><br>Against that backdrop, a study by Singapore's Nanyang Technological University -- which found that in the past five years, three out of four new jobs in Singapore went to foreigners on work permits because employers prefer cheaper foreign workers -- became front-page news across the city.<br><br>Acting Manpower Minister Ng disputed the study, saying nine out of 10 new jobs in Singapore went to citizens and permanent residents in the period.<br><br>Ng said the university study -- which was published on July 30 and based on publicly available labor statistics -- was ``irresponsible,'' and ``unprofessional,'' according to a report by Singapore's Business Times on Aug. 1.<br><br>`Inappropriate Data'<br><br>Late on Friday the Ministry of Manpower distributed copies of a letter signed by the authors of the study in which they acknowledged that the Ministry's figures were correct.<br><br>``We now appreciate that we had used an inappropriate data set,'' said Chen Kang and Tan Khee Giap, associate professors at the university, in their letter to the Acting Minister. ``Our figures were based on the data in the Labour Force Survey posted on the Ministry of Manpower website,'' they said, adding that this does not include many foreign workers in the construction industry and workers who commute from Malaysia.<br><br>Granted, some economists say the information provided is adequate.<br><br>``For the day-to-day work of a brokerage economist, Singapore's data is quite useful and transparent,'' said Nizam Idris, an economist at IDEAglobal in Singapore. ``For academic research, you have to do your own surveys to supplement government data. That holds true in every country.''<br><br>The Singapore government expects the economy to expand by 0.5 percent to 2.5 percent this year, and its success in tackling SARS were widely praised by foreign investors.<br><br>Still, some say a more detailed breakdown would help them analyse the nation's performance and ability to handle future economic shocks. ``In terms of better describing the Singapore economy and the contribution to growth, it would be a lot more useful,'' said GK Goh's Song.<br><br></div>

It is on the Ministry of Manpower's counter-claim that foreigners snagged only one in 10 jobs between 1997 and 2002 and which has yet to convince the population.<br><br>There are a few reasons why the doubts - and the confusion - remain.<br><br>First, the very definition of what constitutes a foreigner has muddled the issue. When Acting Minister of Manpower Dr Ng Eng Hen rebutted the initial NTU report, he had said: "Nine new jobs went to the locals and one to foreigners."<br><br>However, this was meant to refer to the resident population, which consists of citizens and permanent residents (PRs). A truer picture of the job situation here would distinguish between citizens and PRs, said analysts.<br><br>"The very nature of foreign talent is that they do not come here unless they have jobs, and they don't normally get PR status until they have jobs," said Associate Professor Bilveer Singh of the Department of Political Science at the NUS.<br><br>He added that the distinction between citizen and PR is an important one because "citizens have responsibilities and obligations that PRs will never have, such as National Service."<br><br>It also suggests why many Singaporeans had questioned MOM's statistics, which said that, of the 102,000 jobs created from 1997 to 2002, 10,200 went to foreigners.<br><br>Even this figure disguises the trends in job flow for foreigners.<br><br>"A net value like 10,200 may look relatively small but there may be a much larger number in terms of the actual amount of hires in gross terms," said Mr David Cohen, MMS International's senior regional economist.<br><br>The increase in foreigners holding jobs here came in spite of the net departure of around 70,000 foreign construction workers, suggesting that another 80,000 foreigners came to Singapore to make the numbers.<br><br>According to the MOM, one reason why the NTU report was "way off the mark" was because it had not included on-site construction workers and daily commuters from Malaysia.<br><br>But, the job shedding in the construction and manufacturing industries means that the replacement foreigners were headed mostly for white-collar jobs, as the NTU economists had suggested.<br><br>"One way to look at it is to look at the blue-collar sector. Fewer jobs were created there, and even the Economic Review Committee said the manufacturing jobs that were lost are gone forever," said Mr Nizam Idris, deputy head of research at IDEAGlobal.<br><br>For instance, the biomedical industry represents a growth sector that mainly hires skilled workers from abroad rather than Singaporean labour, said Mr Cohen.<br><br>This explains why some Singaporeans still cling to anecdotal evidence, as the loss of 70,000 on-site construction workers is not as noticeable as the addition of 80,000 foreign household residents.<br><br>"The anecdotal evidence speaks for itself. When you go to the condominiums, you would probably see more foreigners with their families than before," said Mr Song Seng Wun, regional economist with GK Goh Research.<br><br>It is not just anecdotal evidence that has fuelled the debate. A check with the Department of Statistics reveals that there were 112,000 more foreigners in Singapore last year than in 1997. On the surface, the discrepancy between 10,200 and 112,000 is alarming.<br><br>However, there are several reasons for this, a labour economist at the National University of Singapore said, as not every foreigner in Singapore holds an employment pass. Some of them might be on study permits as international students or live as dependents of primary employment pass holders.<br><br>There were about 50,000 foreign students here last year but it is not known what the figure was in 1997. Still, the large increase in the foreign population is "an interesting piece of data," said Mr Nizam, and one that should be looked at further.<br><br>Until then, the efforts by academics and analysts to make sense of MOM's figures remain purely speculative, said the NUS labour economist.<br><br>And the issue of foreign talent and job creation is a hot topic here, said analysts. "This is an issue that can get emotional," said Dr Singh. "And we don't want to be irrational. It is not good for Singapore.<br><br>"There are no easy answers. If we turn off the foreign talent tap, it won't be good for us in the long run. And if we sacrifice the citizen, it won't be good at the ballot box."<br><br></div>
