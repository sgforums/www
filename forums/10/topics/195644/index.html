Nevermind that MOE may be employing caucasians to teach english, even before that, some parents were already demanding that their children go to classes with the 'better teachers'. They even knew these teachers by name. Fancy their intelligence!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Prior to this scintillating news, MOE were already employing some mainland Chinese to teach mandarin. The slang of Pu Tong Hua is already being permeated into some of our youths. Why didn't anyone complain about that?<br><br>Is this the right step forward? No. Are we being too naive in 'outsourcing' the English Language? Yes.<br><br>Our govt ministries seem to lack the backbone needed to ride the tough times if they think outsourcing can solve all their problems. In essence, it is the typical Singaporean mentality: throwing money to fix a problem.<br><br>Frankly, i don't see an issue in our local english teaching standards.

            <div class='col-md body'>So long as you can speak standard English (ie, minus slang and colloq.), we should be fine. Speaking in other accents are reflections of the speaker's own immersion, where they went to school , who are their colleagues and friends.<br><br>I speak with UK slangs, word choices, crisper accent when I was in the Europe for college and more American when I am in the US for work, albeit with what my wife says is clearly a Singaporean accent!!<br><br>You speak the way you do so that others can understand you. In Singapore I will speak in Singlish if that is most effective and actually promotes an emotional connection with my listener.<br><br>I revert to Singaporean accents and word choices when I am in Singapore for a while although that takes some time when you have been away for years at a time.<br><br>So don't fret, more importantly, be able to be understood clearly with right grammar and words for the right audience.<br><br>Cellphone (US) = Mobile (UK) = Handphone (Singapore)<br>although perhaps Singapore's choice is redundant since if you don't use your hand, how do you use the phone, or if you don't have to use your hand, why call it a handphone?!?<br><br>Gas (US) = Pet-trol (UK) = "Patrol" (Singapore)<br>Slight difference between Sing and UK versions but if you said that in the US ====&gt; "Huh?!?"<br><br>So there is "low-brow" Singlish (culture -which governments do not understand, anyway who should define high and low culture?), Singapore English, and of course English from Singaporeans who just don't live in Singapore.<br><br>Does not mean one is truly better than another, just make yourself understood!!<br><br></div>
