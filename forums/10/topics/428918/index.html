              <p>Housing prices, Cost of Living, Education, Foreigners, Birth rate etc.</p>
              <p>These are all the issues making the headlines recently, and all the parties have something to say about these issues.</p>
              <p>What I am appalled at is that not one person from any party actually bothered to step back, look at the big picture, and piece every issue together.</p>
              <p>All these actually reflects the people's concern about maintaining their <strong>STANDARD OF LIVING. </strong></p>
              <p>Not one politician had acknowledged that we are already at, or over, the peak in terms of living standards, and that we are seeing a gradual decline in living standards as we speak.</p>
              <p>We all say that the baby boomers had it tough, bearing the brunt of nation building, creating singapore's success story.</p>
              <p>But, they are also the generation who has seen and experienced drastic advancement in living standards during their lifetime. They progressed from a sleepy rural singapore into a metropolitan city, experienced technological booms which brought about comfort to our lives, and had seen their wages and assets rise exponentially every decade.</p>
              <p>In other words, there is tremendous upwards social mobility.</p>
              <p>lets talk about the current generation and future generations.</p>
              <p>As the saying goes, the apple doesn't fall far from the tree. our education system is so successful that we are nearing the maximum range the apple could possibly fall away from the tree.</p>
              <p>having an O level or diploma brings our parents one up over our grandparents, who were mostly uneducated. This advancement in education makes it possible for our parents to better their social status, in the form of getting higher paying jobs.</p>
              <p>nowadays, having a degree is so commonplace, that it only serve to place us at the starting line, so not as to lose out to others.</p>
              <p>So what about our future generations? do we expect them to paperchase all the way till doctoral level before starting work? We must bear in mind that human beings have a limited prime working life, and the longer we stay at school, the less productive we are to the workforce.</p>
              <p>2 qsns for you.</p>
              <p>1) Are you able to at the very least match up to your parents' standard of living when they were at your age? i.e. Income, education, assets, career</p>
              <p>2) Will your children be able to match up to your standard of living when they are at your age?</p>
              <p>would you prefer to see your assets rise in paper-value, at the expense of your children's future?</p>
              <p>e.g. your HDB flat double in value, yet, for the sake of having a shelter over your head, you are unable to liquidate your house and enjoy this growth.</p>
              <p>AND your children will have to bear with overvalued flats which they cannot afford.</p>
              <p>AND being doting parents, you will end up "subsidizing" a portion of your children's housing.</p>
              <p>This is a lose-lose-lose situation.</p>
              <p>The more your asset rises in value, the more your children have to pay to acquire their own assets.</p>
              <p>We might already been past the breaking point, but it is never too late, to absorb some damages from the drastic devaluation of your flat, to ensure that house-ownership is not something out of reach for your children in the future.</p>
              <p>Besides, it is ridiculous to pay so much for what is essentially an one-off payment for a 99 yr long term rent.</p>
              <p>Price of flat = SLA land cost, and HDB building cost.</p>
              <p>at the 99 years, since you do not get to keep anything after 99 yrs, it means that essentially, you are paying SLA for a 99yr land lease, and HDB for a 99yr property lease. so much so for individual home ownership.</p>
              <p>It would be more precise to say that 90% of singaporeans rent a home, than to actually own a home.</p>
              <p>be smart. make the right choice. safeguard the future.</p>

              <p><br>There are about 30% of S'porean having one or two condos, but not all are doing well, remember they hv to pay the high loan and interest, unless they are able to pay off, then their childrens may be the beneficiaries. Nevertheless, most singapore owns only normal condos, the high end ones have many rich foreigner living, example, the Sail at Marine Bay, Costa Rhu at Kallang River, tanjong Rhu are 50/50 own by foreigners, either businessmen or movie stars etc etc. the cost is minimium 2 million per units up, rental can cost you 12,000 per month up.</p>
              <p>The ideal of our govt is to make very single singaporeans to work and slog thru their life, by giving them higher class of living and expensive materialistic products, peoples will buy and work toward paying it off, by the time all is paid, guess their sons or son in laws will take over, and newer kind of housing will start to encourage them to sell and buy newer one and the process goes on and on,...slog and pay, slog and pay.</p>
              <p>Therefore, like me, unless you are in the upper income group, think wisely before you invest, you can sell you HDB and move into condo, but you hv to take the burden of pay and pay, once you think of the need to service your loan, you work and work and worry that you lost your job, then you decided to vote for PAP inorder to safe guard your job, that is one way how politics works ya</p>

              <p>on one part, I feel strongly that the baby boomer generation (1950s-1960s) are destroying our future.</p>
              <p>they have already enjoyed the prime years of singapore's developing years. housing, car, career, children.</p>
              <p>Today, they are the ones responsible for high market prices of housing.</p>
              <p>they are the ones driving up demands for COEs for cars.</p>
              <p>Career-wise, most of them are well established at the middle-higher managerial level, so deeply entrenched that they are depriving the younger generations the opportunity for career advancement.</p>
              <p>Government-wise, they form the ruling generation, where their policies are targeted at their fellow baby-boomers. Cheap foreign workers, high asset value, high debt burden, high healthcare cost. etc    </p>
              <p> "Let the youngsters foot the bills" mentality. They increased the financial burden of children with the Maintainance of Parents Act, forcing children to pay for their parents' expenses, even if it resulted in the children being made bankrupt. Why should the children have to pay, when its the fault of the government for not having come up with a reasonable and sustainable retirement system? i.e. elderly healthcare</p>
              <p>Lastly, the baby boomers are able to raise their kids on the cheap. some up till O levels, to diploma, and a selected few, to university.</p>
              <p>Nowadays, it is expected of the parents to support their kids up to university, which will incur a higher cost of raising children. who in their right mind would want to have children, when they are burdened by their own debts, and also the heavy burden of supporting their parents.</p>
              <p>So, I appeal to those baby boomers who are reading this. Wake up your ideas! Stop destroying the future of our younger generations!</p>

              <p>Interesting they are telling Siingaporean that HDB ceiling will be raised to 10K. As many of these couple will hit the ceiling after short working years. This is utterly rubbish!!! they are giving false message to the public during election and say, look you are earning 10K and ask for HDB, you have a problem not the government!! but we will still give you.</p>
              <p>How many Singapore couple earn &gt;10K!!!!!!!! how many???? I believe average Singaporean household likely to be one working family and medium income is not more than 4-5K!!!! Most of us live in HDB and pay2-3K in housing loan. After CPF, it is likely to have less than 2K spending income!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
              <p>What shit are they trying to say when average Singaporean have &gt;10K income!!??</p>

              <p>actually, it is not impossible to reach. esp if both couples are working.</p>
              <p>fresh uni grads can get around $3k starting pay when they leave sch at 22-25yrs old.</p>
              <p>and nowadays, people tend to get married around 30yrs old.</p>
              <p>5yrs is a reasonable period to see a payrise from $3k to $4k.</p>
              <p>so a couple each making $4k/month will easily hit the $8k income cap for hdb.</p>
