              <p>Housing prices, Cost of Living, Education, Foreigners, Birth rate etc.</p>
              <p>These are all the issues making the headlines recently, and all the parties have something to say about these issues.</p>
              <p>What I am appalled at is that not one person from any party actually bothered to step back, look at the big picture, and piece every issue together.</p>
              <p>All these actually reflects the people's concern about maintaining their <strong>STANDARD OF LIVING.</strong></p>
              <p>Not one politician had acknowledged that we are already at, or over, the peak in terms of living standards, and that we are seeing a gradual decline in living standards as we speak.</p>
              <p>We all say that the baby boomers had it tough, bearing the brunt of nation building, creating singapore's success story.</p>
              <p>But, they are also the generation who has seen and experienced drastic advancement in living standards during their lifetime. They progressed from a sleepy rural singapore into a metropolitan city, experienced technological booms which brought about comfort to our lives, and had seen their wages and assets rise exponentially every decade.</p>
              <p>In other words, there is tremendous upwards social mobility.</p>
              <p>lets talk about the current generation and future generations.</p>
              <p>As the saying goes, the apple doesn't fall far from the tree. our education system is so successful that we are nearing the maximum range the apple could possibly fall away from the tree.</p>
              <p>having an O level or diploma brings our parents one up over our grandparents, who were mostly uneducated. This advancement in education makes it possible for our parents to better their social status, in the form of getting higher paying jobs.</p>
              <p>nowadays, having a degree is so commonplace, that it only serve to place us at the starting line, so not as to lose out to others.</p>
              <p>So what about our future generations? do we expect them to paperchase all the way till doctoral level before starting work? We must bear in mind that human beings have a limited prime working life, and the longer we stay at school, the less productive we are to the workforce.</p>
              <p>2 qsns for you.</p>
              <p>1) Are you able to at the very least match up to your parents' standard of living when they were at your age? i.e. Income, education, assets, career</p>
              <p>2) Will your children be able to match up to your standard of living when they are at your age?</p>
              <p>would you prefer to see your assets rise in paper-value, at the expense of your children's future?</p>
              <p>e.g. your HDB flat double in value, yet, for the sake of having a shelter over your head, you are unable to liquidate your house and enjoy this growth.</p>
              <p>AND your children will have to bear with overvalued flats which they cannot afford.</p>
              <p>AND being doting parents, you will end up "subsidizing" a portion of your children's housing.</p>
              <p>This is a lose-lose-lose situation.</p>
              <p>The more your asset rises in value, the more your children have to pay to acquire their own assets.</p>
              <p>We might already been past the breaking point, but it is never too late, to absorb some damages from the drastic devaluation of your flat, to ensure that house-ownership is not something out of reach for your children in the future.</p>
              <p>Besides, it is ridiculous to pay so much for what is essentially an one-off payment for a 99 yr long term rent.</p>
              <p>Price of flat = SLA land cost, and HDB building cost.</p>
              <p>at the 99 years, since you do not get to keep anything after 99 yrs, it means that essentially, you are paying SLA for a 99yr land lease, and HDB for a 99yr property lease. so much so for individual home ownership.</p>
              <p>It would be more precise to say that 90% of singaporeans rent a home, than to actually own a home.</p>
              <p>be smart. make the right choice. safeguard the future.</p>

              <p>I believe that with correct governance, cost of living can be contained.</p>
              <p>example of functioning systems:</p>
              <p>1) You spend alot of money on necessities. but you also make alot to cover your expenditures, and still have enough leftover to save for retirement.</p>
              <p>2) You make very little money. but cost of living is cheap too. you still have enough leftovers for retirement.</p>
              <p>In singapore, this is not the case. you have:</p>
              <p>1) you make little money, but cost of living is very high. you are unable to save enough money for retirement.</p>
              <p>__________</p>
              <p>in singapore, most of the issues with cost of living are created by the government.</p>
              <p>housing, transport (private and public) are essentially controlled by the government.</p>
              <p>the govt can choose not to collect money for the lease of land for hdb.</p>
              <p>the govt can choose to not collect money for COE, and not let public transport operators make immense profit from their monopoly over public transport.</p>
              <p>GST should not be imposed on food and other basic essentials.</p>
              <p>in hospitals, much of the fee goes to paying five-digit salaries of doctors, who are working under public service, where they get "commission" from each surgery/procedure done. They are employed by public hospitals, bonded to the ministry of health, and are therefore public servants. hence, their focus should be more on providing public service than to profit. if they want money, they should go into private practice.</p>
              <p>We can have cheaper healthcare by imposing a flat wage for these public practitioners. it will also prevent doctors from prescribing redundant procedures, wasting resources and at the same time harmful for the patient.</p>
              <p>these are very simple and direct ways to cut down on the cost of living in singapore, and therefore, i do not see why the government is complaining so much about the difficulty of lowering the cost of living.</p>
              <p>while having a strong reserve is important, i do not believe in maintaining a massive reserve, which serve as a white elephant. having so much money locked away presents an oportunity cost.</p>
