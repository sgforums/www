              <p>those single-breadwinner families exists. but largely in the middle-aged population. these are the people who have already bought a flat.</p>
              <p>we are now talking about the new trend of young graduates couples, in their 20s and 30s, who are both working. not many women wants to be stay-at-home housewives nowadays.</p>
              <p>Yes, $8k personal income is an exception, but $8k combined family income is not.</p>
              <p>Back then, condos are the exclusive domain for the rich, or for people who are relatively well established financially.</p>
              <p>nowadays, because of the low income cap, it penalises the double-income family for being hardworking, which is contradicting the aim of encouraging women into the workforce.</p>
              <p>Couples who are only a few years into their career are forced to take up hefty debts and buy a condo, since they are not allowed to buy hdb flats due to them exceeding the income cap.</p>
              <p>and we all know that there is a quantum leap between the price of a hdb vs a pte condo. $300k for a hdb 4 room, vs $1m for a private 2 bedroom condo.</p>
              <p>multiply 30 years of interests at 2.5%, the couple will have to fork out 75% more interests, or $750k on top of $1m.</p>
              <p>That being said, it is still possible for them to afford the condo.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>BUT</strong></span> that is only if they can get subsequent promotions in their career.</p>
              <p>Due to an aging population, and to the influx of FTs, people in managerial posts are staying put longer, and therefore, there is a lack of vacancy for promotion for the youngsters.</p>
              <p>Or, jobs at every level are invaded by cheap FTs, that not only are their bosses replaced by FTs, their own jobs are also threaten by FTs.</p>
              <p>to sum it up, you have career stagnation, job insecurity and wage depression acting against you, and so how on earth are you expected to afford expensive housing?</p>

              <p><br>Ok. so why are we complianing about high HDB price? pardon me that I have already been working oversea for the past 6 years, what aspiration do Singaporean have, are they really asking for a HDB or a pte condo?</p>
              <p>I believe the &gt;10K family is an exception and probably at top 10%. Most Singapore family probably falls into the 4-5K income family where one working father and housewife to take care of 2-3 Children. These are the ppl that are facing the sandwich in life.</p>

              <p>those single-breadwinner families exists. but largely in the middle-aged population. these are the people who have already bought a flat.</p>
              <p>we are now talking about the new trend of young graduates couples, in their 20s and 30s, who are both working. not many women wants to be stay-at-home housewives nowadays.</p>
              <p>Yes, $8k personal income is an exception, but $8k combined family income is not.</p>
              <p>Back then, condos are the exclusive domain for the rich, or for people who are relatively well established financially.</p>
              <p>nowadays, because of the low income cap, it penalises the double-income family for being hardworking, which is contradicting the aim of encouraging women into the workforce.</p>
              <p>Couples who are only a few years into their career are forced to take up hefty debts and buy a condo, since they are not allowed to buy hdb flats due to them exceeding the income cap.</p>
              <p>and we all know that there is a quantum leap between the price of a hdb vs a pte condo. $300k for a hdb 4 room, vs $1m for a private 2 bedroom condo.</p>
              <p>multiply 30 years of interests at 2.5%, the couple will have to fork out 75% more interests, or $750k on top of $1m.</p>
              <p>That being said, it is still possible for them to afford the condo.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>BUT</strong></span> that is only if they can get subsequent promotions in their career.</p>
              <p>Due to an aging population, and to the influx of FTs, people in managerial posts are staying put longer, and therefore, there is a lack of vacancy for promotion for the youngsters.</p>
              <p>Or, jobs at every level are invaded by cheap FTs, that not only are their bosses replaced by FTs, their own jobs are also threaten by FTs.</p>
              <p>to sum it up, you have career stagnation, job insecurity and wage depression acting against you, and so how on earth are you expected to afford expensive housing?</p>

              <p>Yes, I was too long out from Singapore and have not been able to understand how this country has changed.</p>
              <p>Than, we have little competition from foreigners and we are not fearful of taking risk in our job. I was  a professional and there a lot of opportunities to advance, internally or job opportunities elsewhere than. Indeed, it takes me less than 8 years before I reached the peak of my career. I have no fear in speaking out at the board for policies and are not appealing to my superior than. We have a very lively exchange of views and decision than was very well debated.</p>
              <p>My project is closing in PRC and I wish to return to Singapore. Unfortunately, after one year of job searching (mind you it is done by top headhunters), I have to face the reality that I am not  competing  with my fellow Singaporean for these jobs but Indian, Indonesian and even Africa??!!!!. It is ok to compete as I am confident of my experience (that I have closed IPOs and greenfield startups) is needed as it is far better than these ppl. Unfortunately, I have been told, not once, but many times, the seeking salary from these foreigners is less than 20% of what I was paid and I am too expensive. Often I ran into interview by Indian and Philippinos whose preference is their own country man because it is cheaper with same culture. ALL this is happening in my own country. I wonder what type of companies now operate in Singapore.</p>

              <p>Citizens of Singapore, good afternoon,</p>
              <p>My name is Angel Robinson Lin, I live in Joo Chiat, I am a businesswoman doing pub's businesses with lots of Night Party.</p>
              <p>(yeah!!! whistle, clapping hands..clap claps!!!!)</p>
              <p>Thank you, thank you.</p>
              <p>All I want to say about HDB is that all citizens needs to understand what is HDB for, is it for making money...NO!, is it for buying and selling...NO!!!, is it for PR and foreigners...NO!!! Let me tell you, HDB is for Middle to lower group SINGPOREANS!!! hear properly S I N G A P O R E A N S!!! hv you all lost all your senses!</p>
              <p>CItzens of Singapore, tell me, is this our LAND!!! Yes.....!!!! is this our place!!!! yes!!!, is this our community that we are born here...YES!!!!, HDB is built in our land for us, the land that belong to us, they, the govt decided to built it for us to live in, a house not so comfort and yet better than most countries, a place, a house, a home for SINGAPOREANS!!! Yes,,,clap clap clap!!! Then why got foreigners living in HDB????? DO YOU FEEL INVADED!!! YES!!!! ....loud Clapping!!</p>
              <p>If I take over the govt, I shall allow all Singaporeans couples to own 2 HDBs, and single people like me to own 1 HDB only. As for Foreigners or PR, they can only rent from Singaporeans, paid us high rental, in this way, you will feel belonging, you will feel that this land really belong to you, you will feel like the real Landlord of this country, not a slave or goondo being manipulated by some dwarfs who think out, and not inward.</p>

              <p>talking about my aunt fantagf, I also cry like Nicole, so sad for her...I see peoples frustration more than happiness here, I see peoples trying so hard to prove their points than just being humorous like me.
