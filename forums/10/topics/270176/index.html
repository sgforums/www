Under the data churned out by our computer, it was classified as a 3-room flat transaction Â… You can call it human error or computer error."<br>.<br>Mr Lim added that the "jumbo" flat was rented to a company to house its foreign workers.<br>.<br>Today verified the claim when it visited Block 253.<br>.<br>ST said in a statement that the newspaper had "verified the accuracy of the information with ERA before going to print".<br>.<br>But after questions were raised over the flat, the paper investigated further.<br>.<br>"We found that the $2,500 monthly rental was being paid for a 'jumbo' flat in Block 253 which comprised two adjoining 3-room flats," it said.<br>.<br>Over at Block 510 Woodlands Drive 14 Â— also cited in the ST report Â— residents said they were "surprised" at the $2,200 monthly rent that an executive unit at their block fetched.<br>.<br>But Mr P Wang, who bought his four-room unit for $260,000 in February, felt the high rent was "possible".<br>.<br>The 32-year-old technician said: "It could be a one-off, given the booming property market."<br>.<br>Earlier, Minister for National Development Mah Bow Tan had expressed his concern over reports of record property prices.<br>.<br>Mr Au agreed that the media had to be "very careful" with information supplied by third parties, "especially when there might be a vested interest".<br>.<br>The latest episode goes to show how the mainstream media and the blogosphere could complement each other in revealing "the truth", he added. "Working together in a more active media scene benefits everybody."<br>$2,500 record figure not for one, but two combined 3-room Jurong East flats<br><br></div>
