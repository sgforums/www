              <p>I can forsee that in five to ten years time, only people who work for the MIW and those earning a comfortable livelihood will remain citizens. The local population is already being decimated by the amount of young and skilled citizens leaving this hellhole, which further endanger this country shortage of proper manpower and social cohension.</p>
              <p>One of the most telling signs I can see is that the fact that the MIWs are still taxing the citizens through withhold of CPFs, lack of healthcare, ERPs, rasing transport fees and utilities bills. Why is that so? MIWs know that loyalty can be brought. Civil servants will vote them in time and time again because of promotion and career enhancements, no one will wants to break their own rice bowl. The amount of civil servants such as ministers, top civil servants' pays are enomous, in the long run, they will be squezing the locals even more money to maintain their lavish ways.</p>
              <p>We will not be able to export ourselves out of trouble as you can see the amount of  people working in financial places, all of which are considered "soft" jobs, where's the people doing " hard science"?, Pay is too low, not enough innovative products being produced no thanks to MIW strangle hold through Temasek Holdings which monopolise the entire market and a yes MIW whoreshipping school life which produced faceless graduates. I have an ex Army guy, which won a scholarship to study in Imperial College of London in the engineering faculty but now fifteen years down the road, he's at GIC doing stock investment.There's a lot of investor money swimming around in Asia now, that's quite a temptation for young graduates, who can blame them, with the MIW using money to buy loyalty. But as it happened in the west, investor money that was there are now in Asia but how long more before the money move to somewhere else again? I would say Latin America will be the next emerging market and it will be on more investors' radar if China fails.<br><br>How to maintain with around a small population of maybe two million working adults? I would guess a civil servants retrenchment will still happen in the long run, simply because our economy are gong to rely on cheaper, better and faster foreigners to prop up which will effect more mediocre products coming out of Sinkapore to export, which will have wafer thin profits. How to suck more money? Citizens already have to work til death, where to suck money? Government already owns 90% of land in SInkapore, our <br>assets (HDB homes) is also theirs, any where else to milk money? MIW is selling arms to Myanmar also, also selling ATP (Anti -personnel mines which Sinkapore did not sign the UN resolution to ban them), any more ways to earn more money to feed their ever greedy civil servants? GIC and Temasek will never divest their money to use for citizens need, those are used to give other countries "good" things , to buy favour, such as building a new stadium in Jamaica, to maintain a big size so that when our hopeless ministers goes to international meetings ( hopeless becuase they can't even drive a bargin with India and instead let their people flood our country), they can still sit on chairs instead of the cold , hard floor. <br><br>Utimately, those medicrotic civils servants will get the chop while the big snakes stay on. In the future, there will only be serfs and the ruling "get out of my elite uncaring face" class, bad luck for anyone without boatloads of money and those who fall out of favour. <br><br>Singapore will become a hellhole with more lower rung officials also getting corrupted, just like those in Malaysia to milk whatever they could to retire comfortably later. It is a fallacy to to buy votes but utimately citizens will have to pay a hefty price for this, not <br>the MIW, they can escape with their billions, laughing happily, singing and dancing if they fancy in glee at what stupid and meek citizens have done to themselves. MIW are not to blame for what happen, it is what we fail to do that make Sinkapore end.<br></p>

              <p>The irony of things is that there was no welfare in singapore for fear of it becoming taxing to the tax payers.</p>
              <p>But, the taxing of tax payers came from giving pensions to ex- croonies, excessive salaries of existing croonies and sustaining croonies who do not contribute but hang on for no constructive reasons or purpose.</p>
