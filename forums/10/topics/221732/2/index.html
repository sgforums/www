            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Humpty Dumpty Sat On The Wall, Humpty Dumpty Had A Great Fall</strong><br>I also agree that he quite pia for Singapore, but I think in the early years alot of wrong policies were made, we didn't develop our own industry, he was out sourcing for FDI (foreign direct investments) to invest in Singapore. It's not a well balanced policy. Although our reliance on FDI brought about favourable economic results in the short run, it produced long term maladies. With the advent of China into global trade, all the FDIs shifted their operations there, as cost were cheaper and they have a good chance of capturing a huge market share there.<br><br><strong>All The King's Horses And The King's Men,  Couldn't Put Humpty Together Again</strong><br>Recently you see MM, SM and PM running around all over the world looking for credible investments, I think (it's a matter of opinion) it's because they realised that our economy is in doldrums. That's why they are desperately out running around looking for good investments to put our reserves in. But sad to say there is not much they or the elite genius MPs could do to about it. Basically globalisation is like a tsunami, a small ripple like Singapore can't do much to alter it's direction. You can flow with the wave, but the wave won't flow to you, the wave will flow to lower grounds (lower cost areas) and not higher grounds.<br><br>DURING THE EARLY YEARS SINGAPORE PUT ALL HER EGGS IN ONE BASKET (TECHNOLOGY AND MANUFACTURING), WHEN THE BASKET DROPPED ALL THE EGGS GOT SMASHED.<br><br>Thoughts expressed above are my opinion of issues, like all opinions, they can be right or wrong.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>He seems to be flying all over the place. Isnt it nice to travel in First Class and visit Royalty! Plus getting paid an exorbitant $million over dollars in salary. Its a good life even i can go around giving lectures at the tax payers expense during the last leg of my life! I dont even bother reading in the press what he says any longer! I'll just read the history books and be contented!</div>

People did and there is a sudden upsurge of ppl with such degrees. Ended up there is an oversupply, Lawyers ended up not practising but consulting.

All the hype was there and again, SG govt discontinued support and many ppl find themselves trapped with the investment they did in SEZ.<br><br>Then he say, people must study hi-tech and engineering fields. Now many of them end up with jobs they do not really want.<br><br>Then he say, must invest in the Riau Economic triangle. Only few succeed, the rest was caught in the red tape.<br><br>Then people must study Bio-engineering field... this is still an ongoing trend..<br><br>Now he says ppl must invest in Middle East....<br><br>Why can't he just let singaporeans have their own brains and do whatever they feel like?</div></blockquote>You mean you followed everything he said?<br><br>Whatever he says, you do not need to follow.

            <div class='col-md body'>If you think that he is just flying around and enjoying life at Taxpayers expense, I really think that you are misguided here.<br><br>Hello, he is so rich that he cannot even spend away all his money before he passes away.<br>I think he is using his reputation and leverage as an world-renowed statesman to help Sg.<br><br>Seriously, other than Mid-east, where else can we invest? Western countries are saturated and too many tariffs. Everyone is rushing into China. Only place is Mid-east where although is so messy we are sort of neutral party there.<br><br>Anyway, if you think I am very pro-govt, I can assure you I am not. But for what MM Lee has done and is doing, I is really respect him. If you see his interview, its like your grandfather who is really old, like 83yo but still working hard for your family. Of coz he got make mistake but he is not God. Sg newspaper is biased, so read everything wif a pinch of salt. I know coz I read many newspaper from many other countries.</div>
