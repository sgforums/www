            <div class='col-md body'>Malaysia actually has been making good progress, it is just that we are too used to Singapore's high standards to see much good in Malaysia.  It is also because of Singapore's size and relative lack of credible political competition that allows us to develop much faster than Malaysia.

If so wouldn't it compromise our own national unity? Remember, we r not CHINESE but SINGAPOREANS. Everyone of us be it Malays,Indians,Chinese,etc... all play a part in our nation. When the inevitable do happens, the last thing we need is to fig" ht a civil-war within ourselves while pushing the "enemy" back north. I think by transforming into a fully integrated society will do us the greatest help.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If you review the historical records of Politics in Malaysia, you will see that it is consistently based on Â“RaceÂ”.<br><br>This has resulted in their views towards Singapore being colored on the same basis.<br><br>In the Malaysian Politics, the Malay Community has always taken a domineering role, even towards their fellow citizens of other ethnic groups; despite the fact that the other racial or ethnic groups has a larger percentage of the total population make-up.<br><br>Historically, the Malaysian Malays have always felt that while Â“Political PowerÂ” is in the hands of the Malay Community, Â“Economic PowerÂ” is too much in the hands of the other races Â– especially the successful and well-connected Chinese Community.<br><br>This is largely the cause of most frictions between these two important communities in Malaysia, and set the stage for all the problems with Singapore which has a majority of the population consisting of Chinese ethnicity.<br><br>The Malaysian Government view their relationship with Singapore on the basis of  -themselves as Malays, and Singapore being Chinese (despite our well asserted multi-racial policies of equality for ALL SINGAPOREANS, regardless of race, language, and religion).<br><br>This is evident, when UMNO Politicians and most Malay Opinion Makers (editors, community leaders, lecturers, analysts, etc) make reference to the relationship with Singapore based on their Malay ethnic values of sensitivities, flexibility, respect, and accommodation, rather than on a more formal and respectable approach of negotiated agreement to a Â“win-winÂ” conclusion as befitting any Government-to-Government relationship.<br><br></div>
