            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>i recall a case way back in pri 1...i was walking to the canteen for recess wif another of my classmate...on the way, we past by the teacher's room...we were chitting chatting along the way when my classmate said sth tat was undesirable...i cun remember wad it was, all i noe was tat it was a crude word...well, unfortunately the form teacher of the class next to ours heard it as she entered the teacher's room...she ordered my frend to a corner n then scolded him for wad he said...<br><br>i was a gd 2metres away from my frend n the teacher then so i couldnt realli hear wad the teacher was telling my frend...all i knew was tat after some scolding, i saw my frend slapping both his cheeks...then i saw the teacher pointing her finger at him saying: hit until i tell u to stop, OK? she then proceeded into the teacher's room...<br><br>in the end, my frend had to spend the entire recess slapping his cheeks...the gd thing for him was tat the teacher was in the teacher's room most of the time so he could 'cheat' on the punishment by patting his cheeks instead of slapping...stil, my frend felt tired out as he had to stand thru out the recess n suffer the embarrassment of students walking past n giggling at him...moreover according to him, the teacher did come out from the teacher's room twice...once to get a drink, another to go to the toilet...on both occasions, the teacher would go up to him n order him to slap harder...my frend would do so until she went back into the teacher's room...<br><br>in the end the teacher onli released him when the sch bell rang signalling end of recess...it was indeed a harsh punishment considering we were onli in pri 1 then...i believe though tat the teacher nvr intended to punish my frend until he cried...she onli wanted to make him feel ashamed n to inflict a little discomfort n pain from the punishment...hoping tat the experience will deter him from future usage of crude words...tats y she punished him outside the teacher's room instead of inside...<br><br>i believe the teacher knew tat my frend 'cheated' on the punishment but chose to turn a blind eye to it as long as he kept up the 'rite' actions...which was to hit his cheeks wif his hands although softly...</blockquote>i met up wif the frend above recentlyn recollected our sch days...to my surprise, he stil remembers the above incident...he told me tat back then he said the crude word playfully...there was no ill intent...in fact, he tried to explain to the teacher tat it was juz a playful remark...however, the teacher wouldnt let him off, claiming tat if he wasnt punish for saying it playfully, he may say it wif ill intent in future...below is the dialogue he had wif the teacher(nt the exact words as my frend recalls)...<br><br>teacher: wad was tat word u said juz nw??? who taught u to say tat word???<br>my frend: madam, i dun mean wad i say...we were juz playing...<br>teacher: u can play in other ways...but to use such words is unacceptable...<br>my frend: madam, i...<br>teacher: u r onli in primary 1 n u r alredi using such words...if i let u off, i dunno how many more of such words u wil use in future...<br>my frend: madam...<br>teacher(points finger at my frend, looking stern): slap ur cheeks!!!(my frend slapped himself twice, once each on both sides)<br>teacher: slap without stopping!!!(my frend began to slap himself continuously) slap until i tell u to stop, ok?<br><br>according to my frend, his cheeks did hurt after it was over...the slapping lasted for the whole 25min recess..even though he 'cheated' on the punishment,  the 'slaps' stil inflicted a little pain...moreover, as my frend recalls, he spent abt the 1st 5min slapping his cheeks quite hard...he did tat cos he wasnt sure if the teacher would allow him to 'cheat'...it was onli when his hands started to feel a little tired tat he began to slap softer, realising tat he was able to 'cheat' as the teacher wasnt looking most of the time...<br><br>i mentioned above tat i felt the teacher onli wanted to make him feel ashamed n to inflict a little discomfort n pain from the punishment...hoping tat the experience will deter him from future usage of crude words...tats y she punished him outside the teacher's room instead of inside...however, according to my frend, tat was nt the case...it was clear to him tat the teacher expected him to slap himself properly...cos other than the 2 occasions when the teacher stepped out of the teacher's room to go toilet n to buy a drink, the teacher also glared at him wif a frown each time she looked at him n saw him 'cheating' on the punishment...when my frend saw her glare, he would resume to proper slapping...hence tat explains y my frend's cheeks were sore after recess...<br><br>according to my frend, he spent abt the last 10min slapping himself properly...tis was cos when the teacher came out of the teacher's room the 2nd time to go to the toilet, she walked up to him n sternly warned him tat if she had to glare at him again for nt slapping properly, she would make him stay back after sch n slap himself for another half hr...hence, in the end, my frend spent abt 15min slapping properly n onli abt 10min 'cheating'...as my frend recalls, he hated tat teacher after tat cos she made him feel so ashamed, letting other students see him being punished...moreover, he was onli a primary 1 kid...my frend felt the teacher punished him too harshly...he wouldnt mind being ask to slap himself but to do tat for the ENTIRE recess n wif proper slaps expected, it was nt deserving for a primary 1 kid, who was a 1st time offender...nonetheless, tat was abt 20yrs ago...nw my frend can onli look back laugh it off...<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i personally agree wif my frend tat the teacher punished him too harshly back then...however, i feel tat the punishment was appropriate for the offence though the duration was too long...from the actions of the teacher, it was obvious she wanted my frend to slap himself properly for the entire 25min...tis was rather harsh considering my frend was onli in primary one then n the pain he would have suffered if he had slapped properly for the whole 25min...<br><br>it seems obvious to me n my frend tat the teacher knew the punishment was very harsh n tat she deliberately made it tat way...cos when the bell rang signalling end of recess, the teacher went up to my frend, released him from his 'agony' n asked if his cheeks were hurting alot...when my frend replied tat his cheeks were sore but stil bearable, the teacher spoke sternly tat she hoped he has learnt from tis lesson n tat she dun want to hear him use such words ever again...b4 letting him go back to class, she warned him tat if she catch him using such words again, she will make him slap himself hard for a full hr in front of the school entrance after sch...well, cun imagine if tat had realli happened, my frend would have been so badly shamed tat he probably wun feel like living...<br><br>below is a dialogue of the above...(i made up tis dialogue juz to make tis post more interesting)<br><br>(sch bell rang, teacher walked out of teacher's room n approached my frend)<br>teacher: u may stop nw!!! (my frend stopped slapping, tired n relieved) how r ur cheeks? r they very painful?<br><br>my frend (nods his head): yes madam but stil bearable...<br><br>teacher: well, i hope u have learnt from tis lesson...let tis punishment teach u nt to use vulgar words ever again...<br><br>my frend (nods his head): yes madam...<br><br>teacher: dun let me hear u use such words again, do u hear me? (my frend nods his head) if i catch u using such words again, i wil make u stay back after sch n slap urself for an hr...n u wun do it outside the teacher's room, u wil do it at the sch entrance...if u dun want everyone to see u being punished, u noe wad nt to do. do u understand?! (my frend nodded) nw go back to ur class!!!</div>
