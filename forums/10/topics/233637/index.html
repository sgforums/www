In fact I will blow the incident up to press level and all levels.<br><br>I don't mind if they call me down about my child's behaviour. Punishment is fine as long as it is reasonable - like a cane whacking the non dominant hand but not in front of the class. Publicly humiliating a child is a no no for me.<br><br>I had the pleasure of a teacher always picking on me and publicly humiliating me every day for the whole year . It did nuts about my behaviour and made it worse since I felt nothing but utter hatred towards her ,the subject and the homework.</div>

The DM was so mad that he slapped my senior so hard that he had hearing problem. That to me is not acceptable. But i think it the case of this kid, the teacher asked him to slap himself because he was using foul language.<br><br>Try to put yourself in the shoes of the teacher. The teacher has to be an authority figure to keep the class quiet so that there wont be disruptive students that would affect the rest of the class. If her authority is so easily challenged no one would respect her, and hence affect her ability to teach in class.<br><br>If you used vulgar language on your own parent, dont you think they would hit you or slap you? The teacher didnt slap the student, only asked the student to slap himself, which means it wont be like the case i mentioned - being slapped till there is hearing problem.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The slapping self one is too much lor. The teacher can detain him, ask DM to cane him (publicly or privately). But forcing him to slap himself? That's overboard. They are humans and all humans have the pride and deserve a certain amount of respect.<br><br>But I'm not discouraging corporal punishment. Rather, it should be meted out reasonably. Going overboard with it will always take a bad turn on children's psychology development, which is a big No-No (Not the Taiwanese artiste).<br><br>I always believe that if parents failed at discipline their children, shouldn't the public take up this responsiblity?<br><br>These children evetually will grow up and become part of public, so it is totally reasonable for a member of public to step forward and correct all protential counterpart (in this case, a public member-to-be).

He fainted from impact and the teacher herself panicked.  In another incident , she also made him drink a whole bottle of ink because he was sucking on his pen. He vomited and made to clean his own vomit. He turned out quite odd in the end.<br><br>I was slapped by that same teacher , my hair pulled out and hit by her til one of my teeth fell out and from the impact - had actually caused a deep cut into a part of my buccal cavity ( fortunately it was my milk tooth) because I forgot to bring my homework to class. I find that appalling. That would be child abuse in itself.<br><br>I was picked on by her because back then I couldn't see the classboard too well due to lack of spectacles ( my parents never knew why I had so many problems with her until later they found out I was shortsighted ). After I got my new glasses,  she even broke my spects while slapping me and I got whacked by my parents when she denied breaking it.<br><br>Would you want your child to be terrorised in the above manner?<br><br>There are teachers I respected for meting reasonable corporal punishment after explaining to me that I did wrong not doing my homework. But that particular teacher, I hope she is dead so that she cannot continue abusing children like that.<br><br>Corporal punishments are fine as long as they are directed ONLY towards  the bum or the hand and away from the rest of the class i.e. teachers lounge room. If else where , as a parent ,  I will sue and destroy the career of the teacher.</div>

He fainted from impact and the teacher herself panicked.  In another incident , she also made him drink a whole bottle of ink because he was sucking on his pen. He vomited and made to clean his own vomit. He turned out quite odd in the end.<br><br>I was slapped by that same teacher , my hair pulled out and hit by her til one of my teeth fell out and from the impact - had actually caused a deep cut into a part of my buccal cavity ( fortunately it was my milk tooth) because I forgot to bring my homework to class. I find that appalling. That would be child abuse in itself.<br><br>I was picked on by her because back then I couldn't see the classboard too well due to lack of spectacles ( my parents never knew why I had so many problems with her until later they found out I was shortsighted ). After I got my new glasses,  she even broke my spects while slapping me and I got whacked by my parents when she denied breaking it.<br><br>Would you want your child to be terrorised in the above manner?<br><br>There are teachers I respected for meting reasonable corporal punishment after explaining to me that I did wrong not doing my homework. But that particular teacher, I hope she is dead so that she cannot continue abusing children like that.<br><br>Corporal punishments are fine as long as they are directed ONLY towards  the bum or the hand and away from the rest of the class i.e. teachers lounge room. If else where , as a parent ,  I will sue and destroy the career of the teacher. </div></blockquote>Your description is way too graphic.. almost exagerated...<br><br>At most, I was slapped tilll my nose bled in primary school by my teacher, and that was for not completing homework. I didn't die as an outcome, nor did I turned out odd...I just didn't studied well because of the God damned Mandarin as compulsary subject!<br><br>Heavy handed physical abuse by teachers can be dealt with and corrected.

            <div class='col-md body'>i think it depends on the seriousness of the offence that the child have committed. The MOE should produce a guidebook for the teachers to go along and see what type of punishment meted is the least hurting but most effective.<br><br>Me too, i was once hit by my piano teacher on the fingers at like 4, my fingers start to bleed and my nail came off. But it did work, i always practise after that.</div>

I am sure there are alot of people who underwent the same treatment if not worse 2 decades ago. I was this small little 8 year old girl  versus the full strength of an adult. I still have the indentation scar of the tooth that went into my buccal cavity.<br><br>If I was what I am now back then,  I will  hit her back in defence for all the physical abuse she rained on me.<br><br>That is why if I am a parent , I will never allow a teacher to abuse my child the way I suffered.<br><br>I will stand by '"spare the rod and spoil the child "if it is within reason. I am all for sending the child out of the classroom if the child is disruptive. Make him stand outside and pull his ears - that is fine with me. Make him or her write a 100 times "I shall not make noise". That is fine. Whack him on the bum or hand in teacher's lounge - that's fine. They can call me up and I will whack him or her at home after that on the hand or bum or  punish them through making them apologise and then taking away their pocket money depending on the severity of the misbehaviour  . But I will not slap my child.<br><br>But to make a kid's nose bleed from slapping , that is child abuse. To break a child's glasses while slapping, that is child abuse. To make a child drink a bottle of ink , I most certainly treat it as a child abuse.<br><br>Ask yourself why some parents object to their kids being punished by teachers. They probably got punished severely in school.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I was pretty much the product of a system of wacking hands (esp. by my chinese teacher) in primary school. In seconday school we were untouched except for public canings, but you have to really screw up to get there.<br><br>All in all it worked pretty fine. Certainly not for a totally hands off approach towards teaching our kids, but excessive punishments are a certain no-go.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i personally feel tat the teacher would have slapped the student herself if she had the authority...but since she was nt allowed to do so, she resorted to wad she felt was the next best solution which was to make the student slap himself...i am sure though tat the teacher had no intention to send the student for public caning...<br><br>in a way, the student was unlucky, the DM happened to walk past the class n popped in to ask y the student was being punished...the teacher reported the matter n hence the student was caned...it muz be noted tat tis teacher was very sensitive towards vulgarities...she would frown each time she heard vulgar words(i have witnessed her frowning), but they usually happened on occasions when she wasnt in class. hence she didnt punish the student/s.<br><br>the case cited is the 1st known case when the vulgarity was spoken in her class. she was coming to class n stood for a few sec. at the doorway to wait for class to quieten down...however, b4 the class could quieten down, she heard the vulgarity n hence lost her temper...in fact tis is the onli case i know of tat she punished a student so shamefully...on other cases, its juz standing outside class or sending student for detention...we can see tat she was indeed very sensitive to vulgarities being used...</div>
