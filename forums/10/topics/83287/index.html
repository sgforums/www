            <div class='col-md body'>i am born in singapore and also raise 100% here.<br>but i have slowly lost the love for this country because everytime i hear the minister speak or hear their policy i can only swear and curse. i am not against the PAP. i am against their policy. How many of the lower class ppl benefits from the PAP system. are our society advancing? if yes, maybe the elite class are advancing leaving half of the singaporean behind fighting for their survival.<br>how can we distingish between PAP and singapore? seriously i cant. i cant even distingish between NTUC and PAP too. arent NTUC suppose to be labour union? but why union leader join PAP?<br><br>i am not asking for perfect country. i just hope the minister can stop playing the policy game just to justify their 4 year stay as minister in respective ministries. govt taking care of the poor family health care and start making the rich pay more tax!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Is the subject "Future for our nation"?  Where &amp; how did it first started, where we are now and what are we going to be?  I tot this is an intersting subject. We are lead by lawmakers who have successfully "housed" (or boxed up) millions of ppl into extremely organised "pigeon holes".  The future of our nation?  If the word "nation" refers to everyone and not just some, then I hope our minds (everyone and not some) are not as "housed" like our physical being is.  When the country can no longer contain the new and fast-changing globalization brought about by new technologies like the internet, etc, we are forced to a new realisation. Suddenly we realise how small we can be.  We want change.  We need change. We have no choice.  We are attempting to change a largely efficient bureaucratic environment, hoping to breed the entreprenuers of the future.  I am thankful though that our leaders realise this fast enough. Fact is, we are in a reactive mode in this merciless wind of change.  Hopefully, our minds do not rest on the statistics of our past or on-going achievements. If we want to change our students today, we should have first changed our teachers yesterday.  The values that are feeding the vanities of our minds today ought to be questioned. Today we wow the mercedes and its drivers, while the official legalized loan-sharks are laughing their day in their banks.  Ask how many of these beloved majority of Singaporeans are still living in "middle earth" thinking that all is well.  The future of Singapore is not going to be shaped by the cream only, the high IQs though they have their place.  It will also be shaped largely by the sleeping giants - those who still think their minds should live with their bodies in their HDBs, those who think that they are lesser than the higher IQs, those who conform their limits and allow themselves to be categorised to that of EM1s or EM2s, those seemingly Ah Bengs and Ah lians who are yet to realise how their guts could be transformed to better things,etc...  If Singapore's future is to be BIG, then perhaps it will do us good if our sleeping giants will awake - the sooner the better. What is there to celebrate in "success" if we don't understand failures? How to fail, if in the first place we have not the courage to?</div>
