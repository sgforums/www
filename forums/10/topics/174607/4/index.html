As a citizen, Im sure one has the responsibility to voice out any unfairness in the system. It is thus the duty of the respective government agency to look into the problem and correct it. What happens when the appropriate government agency does not look into it or refuses to rectify the situation? Unhappiness occurs.<br><br>Take for example the HDB resale levy. Im sure many singaporeans are against it and yet it has been in exsistence for over a decade. Was anything done to correct the unfairness? No. This is why you still see a number of complaints on the subject.<br><br>Im sure Pavin is not the first person to voice his opinion on the unfairness of the system. There are many others before him who had voiced out but had failed to change it. The flaw also lies in the fact that you can only renounce your citizenship at the age of 21. Why 21? Why not 18 or 17? Why 21? That is the question which needs to be answered.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well and good, shade, but IS there unfairness in this case?  If Pavin was stuck in Singapore, he may have some grounds to complain, but the fact is that he himself has said that he holds Thai citizenship as well, so where's the problem?  It's not as if he has nowhere else to go.<br><br>The situation MAY be unfair if his parents had no choice in the matter, but again, the fact that Pavin is perfectly entitled to settle in Thailand shows that there WAS a choice, the choice WAS made by his parents and not the government, and if anybody is answerable for Pavin's unhappy circumstances, it is the parents.<br><br>If there's any change to be affected here, it is to occur on the Limanont family's end of things.  If Pavin wants to complain to the government and not to his parents, what changes can he expect, and what improvement does he have a right to expect?<br><br>I said it before, I'll say it again - this is entirely a matter for Pain to take up with Mummy and Daddy.  They chose to put him the the tragic position of being liable for NS by CHOOSING to reside in Singapore and not Thailand, something that was entirely preventable and currently changeable by them.</div>

Your argument for universal suffrage at age 18 can only be based on one point and that is "if one's can bear arms at the age of 18 then one's should be mature enough to vote."<br><br>Let me reiterate a few points. Firstly, for the majority Singaporeans, the calling for National Service generally starts at the age of 18 (JC) or 19 (Poly). From the society propective, these newly enlistees have just completed college education. These young bods are at their fittest level hence is the best time to conscripts. From the economic viewpoint, it is often more productive to draft enlistees early to minimise the disruption in their career later on in life. Therefore, it seem that age 18 is the most suitable age afterall. It seem, the government cannot get a better time then to draft at age 18 yet somehow leads to argument for lowering of legal voting age. Alternatively, we can do it another way. And that is to allow conscipting before certain age limits say 27. In this way, most people would have past the age of 21 when it come to bearing arms because more people would want to further their studies as first priority. For this, althought I foresee more problems than the original age for NS drafting, do not conflict with the voting age.<br><br>I think you make a very unfair statement (highlighted in red) for the citizens from low-income families. The concern is not for whether the rich will bear an animosity against the state or whether they chose to migrate or not but instead it should based on a fair and just system. Every Singaporeans' son who is of legal age for National Service, should do their part irregardless. That is the price for being a Singaporean and that is also the price for foreign couple migrating here.<br><br>Hence, in summary. By fine-tuning the NS legal-age system, your argument for universal suffrage cum renoucing citizenship at age 18 would be proven fallacious and most Singaporeans I believed, prefer the original status quo when it come to legal voting age. But what is most important is that a system should always be based on equity priniciples and not at the whine and fancy of the rich and powerful.<br><br>"What use is a loyal force of a conscript army without righteous?" ~TooFree <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
