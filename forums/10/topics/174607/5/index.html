            <div class='col-md body'>Yes. I couldn't agree more with that. Those who are not born in Singapore but was forced to obtain Singapore Citizenship due to descent in my opinion should be allowed opt out of NS if they want to emigrate. Eg, if one was born in USA (automatically gets US citizenship) whose father is a Singapore Citizen should be allowed to leave without serving NS; afterall he might feel that Singapore is not where he wants to live in the future. Moreover, he will cease to become a Citizen of Singapore unless he takes the OATH of Renunciation, Allegiance and Loyalty by his 21st birthday. This means that he must give up his US citizenship even though if he does not want to and if not, he will lose his Singapore Citizenship and if you allow me to say, that is extremly unfair as he would have served and completed his NS by then.  The government should allow people in this category to leave without serving NS as they do not need to discharge their NS liability to renounce their Singapore Citizenship unlike the recent infamous Pianist Melvin Tan who was Singapore-Born as they will automatically lose their citizenship if they do not take the OATH at 21 years old.</div>

This is and must be an equity society.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br>May God forbid the law from amending to one's ability to renounce citizenship at the age of 18. This is to prevent the discrimination against the rich and the poor. Have you ever spare a thought to those who are from low-income families? Despite how progressive our nation is moving forward, they are still many around you know. So what happen if such a law is passed? The rich man's son will gets two choices - Serve or Renounce. Then the poor man's son get only one choice and that is to suck thumb because the family has no means to migrate! FAIR?<br></div></blockquote>The thing is--you are trapped. The law has forced you into a corner. By not allowing you to renounce at 18, the law is saying. "look. YOu want to renounce? By all means do so AFTER you have serve your NS". That is the flaw which makes things unfair. And if you leave before 18, you pay a 75k bond. So its an issue of both sides against the individual.</div>
