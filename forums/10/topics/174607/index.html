            <div class='col-md body'>Jan 18, 2006<br>Let those who intend to emigrate opt out of NS<br><br>I REFER to the Insight article, 'Doers &amp; dodgers: Time to heal the rift?' (ST, Jan 14).<br><br>I share the same sentiment as Mr Paul Wong, feeling no allegiance to Singapore and not being able to assimilate into Singaporean culture even though I was born and raised here.<br><br>As a child, I grew up watching classic American movies and cartoons, and listening to American-genre music like country, southern gospel and classic American oldies.<br><br>My paternal aunts and uncles are Ivy League students and speak with a slight American accent and use American grammar in speech. I was influenced by them.<br><br>Because I am the child of a Thai father and a Singaporean mother, I am a citizen of both Thailand and Singapore. I hold a Singapore passport and will have to serve national service next year.<br><br>I do not intend to live in Singapore and, in fact, have made serious plans to emigrate to the United States in future.<br><br>Many friends of mine who have gone overseas to study intend to settle down in their host country after serving national service.<br><br>I do not support the evasion of national service but I appeal to the Government to make some changes to the policy.<br><br>For those who do not intend to live in Singapore, there is no purpose in serving national service. It is a waste of resources for the Government and a waste of time for those affected.<br><br>In my case, I will renounce my Singapore citizenship at age 21 and take on Thai citizenship. The US will be my home in future and if a war breaks out between Singapore and the US, God forbid, obviously I would help to defend the US and fight Singapore if need be.<br><br>Therefore, I do not see the purpose of training men who might 'turn against' their country in unforeseen circumstances.<br><br>Perhaps the Ministry of Defence could come up with a policy to permit those who intend to emigrate to opt out of national service but if they do not leave by a certain age, then they would be drafted.<br><br><strong>Patriotism and loyalty cannot be forced. It is ultimately up to an individual whether he wants to serve the country.</strong><br><br>Pavin Limanont<br></div>

He claimed that he held dual citizenship because of his SinThai parentage but intend to renounce Singapore for <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Thai citizenship</span> in near future. This fully justified his last second sentence 'Patriotism and loyalty cannot be forced'. Later he talked about that as a child, he grew up watching and listening to classical American movies and music genre. So now he wants to base his loyalty to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">US</span> and even come up with the absurd idea of what happen if war breaks out between US and Singapore.<br><br>Wow!<br>He definitly fits the bill of someone who will either defect or commit treason !!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sometimes, things are hard to be perfected. If you don't "force" people to go NS, some people are so afraid of NS that they can commit suicide. So based on this fear, I am certain there is a probability that some people will do anything to get out of NS, such as migrating to other countries. It would become a loop hole in a certain way, people will be moving out of Singapore in flocks, I mean, do you really believe the majority of Singapore men enjoy serving NS? The pay is really insulting. To add insult to injury, you are going to spend 2 years being scolded/tortured by people who sometimes abused their authority unfairly. Then there will be cover ups. If you ask me, going to NS is a necessity to protect the country, but NS men could do with more pay rather than the meagre money they call allowance. How can NS men serve the country well when they are filled with problems such as putting food on the table for the family, the PUB bills and stuff like that?</div>

If the Singapore passport is really so coveted, why not trade 2.5year of your life for it? After-all, Mr Pavin has already enjoyed the best English education one can get in Southeast Asia.. Mr Pavin is still entitled to his Thai passport.<br><br>I am not exactly pro-NS, but why should he treated differently from anyone else who grew up in Singapore. Everybody should be treated equally. As long you grew up in Singapore, and has the Singapore passport, please serve the National Service. If you do not intend to serve the national service, do not apply for the Singapore passport.<br><br>A Note to Mr Pavin: read the fine lines in future.</div>

But according to what I heard, one is unable to renounce Singapore citizenship until he hits 21 years of age. I dont think the authorities in charge will let him give up his Singapore passport. And my guess is that his parents applied Singapore citizenship when he was young, not his own personal choice.<br><br>If only migrating was that easy, especially for those with NS obligations.</div>

If I am not wrong, you used to be a commando and you are at present, staying and living in Australia. Is it because you have to serve NS before you could leave for Australia that you are opposed to the writer's idea? would you still harbor the same view if you do not have to serve NS?<br><br>I am sure the thousands of millions spent by the government on unnecessary upgrading exercises could be put to good use.
