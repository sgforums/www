            <div class='col-md body'>without intending to continue the needless argument which might get too irrelevant, i have here a post from someone and you decide abt it:<br><br>During my time as a medical officer, I met many people like Pavin. They had great difficulties coming to terms with serving in the SAF. Some threatened suicide. Many said exactly what Pavin had said. Many a time I told them it was the law that they had to serve. No amount of reasoning should change that. Many of these boys said they never had a say, and it was all their parent's decision to come to Singapore, yet their father's never had to serve NS and thus did not know exactly what they were talking about when they ask their sons to serve NS.<br><br>I recall very clearly one Indonesian Singapore PR (2nd generation) who told me "If Singapore and Indonesia go to war, I will run to the Indonesians and fight for them. <strong>I will use your SAF weapons and what I learned from the SAF to kill people like you, rape your wives and daughters and laugh in your face</strong>"<br><br>when that happens, you will be paid fully for the warped sense of "bills" that comes with interest as well.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I really do not do justice to overlook all the issues mentioned here..but suffice to say it 's not just stupid on the hastily formulated laws regarding N.S. defaulters.. there are so many issues on this which the GARMEN parliamentarians had overlooked or are just considering..we have a hastily made law because of one American musician or just because surrendipitiously the Garmen are on a blind road down the way of unforseen situations?<br>Read:<a href="http://www.sgwiki.com/wiki/SAF_Deaths" rel="nofollow">http://www.sgwiki.com/wiki/SAF_Deaths</a> which I quote here at length:<br><br><strong>Government to impose stiffer penalties for NS defaulters</strong><br><br>There are really several issues which in the course of being of dual citizenship which can be burdensome for those needed to do their national service in Singapore. Some people may be born and brought up as Americans or Australians or some foreign countries where they don't know anything about Singapore except that their parents were from an alien Country and had registered them as "citizen" of Singapore by no choice of their own. Should such a person when he come back to Singapore as a tourist wanting to see his parent's homeland, then <strong>suddenly discovered </strong>that he had been N.S.defaulter! That had happened before, so had the Parliamentarians discuss this issue at all?<br>Besides the financial restraints and the out-of-Country plus out of sight situation, should these dual citizenship holders be forced to comply with the narrow-minded laws of Singapore?<br><br>Then what:they would be forced to live with a bunch of N.S. whose worldviews and culture were not exactly his own, what would be the likely culture shocks be , Are Singapore aware of these people who maybe truly Singaporean at heart, however, the N.S. would be negatively be inculcating some initial wrong values among foreign born registered Singaporeans serendipitously! Is that what the Garmen really wanted? I think the Garmen imagine those foreign born Citizens of Singapore in China and India are wealthy enough to fly home and to their loyal services to Singapore... I believe such issues are just the top of the tip of greater issues that I believe Singaporeans had  allowed their Garmen people to run the show, but down to the bottomline, a law when made, is still LAW and who will take all the stupid blames? Who will suffer at the end of the stick?&gt; The rich rulers, the politicians, or <strong>the common people</strong></div>
