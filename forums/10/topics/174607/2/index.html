He could be in Thailand right now guzzling Mekong if Daddy and Mummy decided to ship him over there.  I've personally come across (and been disgusted by) cases where the parents ship the kids off while they stay and work in Singapore, until the kid turns 21.  There's nothing stopping him from going except for his (or his parents') greed in sucking that last little bit out of Singapore before bailing out.</div>

What the devil does HDB upgrading have to do with the topic at hand?<br><br>I've already pointed out that if we're discussing the topic of serving NS, the key privelege in question is the safety provided by others doing their duty, with the accompanying obligation to fulfil the same duty at a given time.  Your insistence on going off on a tangent of unrelated aspects of Singaporean life simply does not make any sense.<br><br>I'll bet you're one of those people who doesn't believe in insurance, but sure as hell you'll bleat like a stabbed nanny goat when the proverbial excrement hits the fan.  I'm certain that many Kuwaitis felt exactly the same way you did on 1 August 1990, only to change their minds quite hurriedly the next day.  If you want to believe that you can happily trot along without any form of defence, feel free to get an Egyptian passport and reside in denial - history has already proven you wrong.<br><br>If this Pavin fellow wishes to freeload on some country willing to provide him safety, let him go there.  He and his parents have had forty years or so to catch up with the introduction of NS in Singapore and have no excuse for not knowing that unlike other countries, safety is not counted as a freebie here.<br><br>You're the one who brought up Japan, so I addressed your point.  Going off on another tangent is not going to do you any good here.<br><br>The thread that you referred to is, at best and being very charitable, only peripherally related to your point.  You're the one who made the assertion, so why do I have to be the one who takes a tally on JobsDB on your behalf?  You want to make a point?  Back it up.  Otherwise it's tripe.<br><br>In any case, my intention here is to debate the substance of Pavin's wild theories of why he should be exempt from NS.  I'm really not interested in meandering and entertaining rambling irrelevancies.</div>

What the devil does HDB upgrading have to do with the topic at hand?<br><br>I've already pointed out that if we're discussing the topic of serving NS, the key privelege in question is the safety provided by others doing their duty, with the accompanying obligation to fulfil the same duty at a given time. Your insistence on going off on a tangent of unrelated aspects of Singaporean life simply does not make any sense.<br><br>I'll bet you're one of those people who doesn't believe in insurance, but sure as hell you'll bleat like a stabbed nanny goat when the proverbial excrement hits the fan. I'm certain that many Kuwaitis felt exactly the same way you did on 1 August 1990, only to change their minds quite hurriedly the next day. If you want to believe that you can happily trot along without any form of defence, feel free to get an Egyptian passport and reside in denial - history has already proven you wrong.<br><br>If this Pavin fellow wishes to freeload on some country willing to provide him safety, let him go there. He and his parents have had forty years or so to catch up with the introduction of NS in Singapore and have no excuse for not knowing that unlike other countries, safety is not counted as a freebie here.<br><br>You're the one who brought up Japan, so I addressed your point. Going off on another tangent is not going to do you any good here.<br><br>The thread that you referred to is, at best and being very charitable, only peripherally related to your point. You're the one who made the assertion, so why do I have to be the one who takes a tally on JobsDB on your behalf? You want to make a point? Back it up. Otherwise it's tripe.<br><br>In any case, my intention here is to debate the substance of Pavin's wild theories of why he should be exempt from NS. I'm really not interested in meandering and entertaining rambling irrelevancies.</blockquote>what i meant from upgrading when i originally posted:<br><br><blockquote>I am sure the thousands of millions spent by the government on unnecessary upgrading exercises could be put to good use.</blockquote>You probably got me wrong.<br>i refer the upgrading exercise as the HDB upgrading exercise, not SAF upgrading exercises.<br><br>and I agree that the thread is getting irrelevant.

Let's take it from the top.<br><br>First, when discussing NS, the corresponding privelege is obviously and logically the safety provided to the citizens.  It's not harping on a point, it IS the point.  Within the context, education, economy and what not are relevant only insofar as they hinge upon a stable and safe environment provided by proper defence.<br><br>Second, well, you may have tried to delete it, but it shows the weak foundation upon which you are basing your propositions.  I have provided the one piece of evidence needed to disprove your assertion that you can merrily traipse along without defending your country and assume you will continue unmolested.  The fact of the matter is that Singapore does not have the population size upon which to form a properly-sized regular army, and therefore conscription is necessary to the defence of the country.  If Singapore were to have a similar percentage to the US of its population serving as regulars, there would be just about bugger all to keep anyone from invading.  Just in case you want to argue that nobody would want to invade Singapore, I'd recommend you read your history books.<br><br>Also, the invasion of Iraq is an entirely separate war, otherwise it would have been called Desert Strom instead of Iraqi Freedom.  Again you muddy the waters.<br><br>Let's get to the key issue, shall we?  No matter how you cut it, if you're living safely, somebody's paying for it.  If you're even half decent, you must foot your part of the bill.</div>
