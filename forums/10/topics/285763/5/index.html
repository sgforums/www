I don't think they are interested in winning a seat as well, or may have given up hope on winning. Nothing they have shown proves that they are interested.<br><br>His allies abroad are screwing him. Yes they can dish out awards to him but who the hell are they ? Have they done anything else for him ?

But they got severely raped. Bloody amazing isn't it ? The internet and and in fact whole Singapore was outraged and on the internet many blamed the government as well. Here comes Chee and Co to force the government to reveal the "truth" about their "cover up". They didn't uncover anything and got severely raped in Sembawang.</div>
