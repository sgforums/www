I would say that it happens in alot of major corporations as well. It is probably more obvious in your NS days as the major proportion of SAF are "Part-time". You see a diverse group of people. you have the hardworking ones and you have the seriously lazy ones. You can say the same about regulars as well. Then you have inexperienced junior officers around. Hiccups are bound to occur and no one wants to get punished and it is not easy to juggle both operational and administrative duties. The problem starts from here.<br><br>I don't know if the senior officers resort to "covering up" or not but if there is a blemish, their bonded career will stagnate. Yes, i would believe that there are cover ups in the SAF, especially when there are audits and inspections conducted . To what degree i do not know.<br><br>But this is very different from what we are discussing so far.</div>
