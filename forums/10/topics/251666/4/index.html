            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Atobe,<br><br>after 3-4 rounds of debate, I still see no outcome. First of all, you branded me as "slithering". I would appreciate if you could go back to my posts and scrutinise my statements again.<br><br>To infer that I would turn my back on my statements with little effort after reading your views is a derision of my personal character.<br><br>I often read your views in Speaker's Corner. They are strong and reasonable arguments backed up with a sound knowledge of facts and figures. Isn't it? However, you tend to go into personal attacks, albeit subtle ones. Unnecessary, in my opinion. It clouds one's judgement and rational cognition. You are also inclined to downright wrestle the opponent over to your views. I could term it as"never say die". That mentality again blurs your sense of proportion.<br><br>I do not intend to continue this debate further as it is going nowhere.<br><br>Fyi, my summary of CSJ is this (even before debate):<br><br>1) He has the passion and courage to stand up for democracy<br>2) He is an intellectual with an understanding of the region's economics<br>3) He has been badly portrayed by our media, so much so that millions of Singaporeans see him as a lunatic, often barking up the wrong tree.<br>4) He must be applauded for giving up his comfortable job as a psychology lecturer to enter the opposing end of politics.<br><br>I can't profess to know very much about him but I have read two of his books and I have seen numerous rallies of him via youtube. I have even viewed a clip of him and family at their HQ. I have also been to the SDP website to read his political and economic ideologies.<br><br>Still, my conclusion of him is: He's a goner. We do not have to wait for LKY's death. As far as his lifetime is concerned, he has no more hope in our political arena. I can do an essay on him and back it up with my arguments but there's no need for this currently. As usual, you will cry foul of my statements but it does not matter anymore.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Oh apologies, I forgot to add my own views on the political situation in Singapore.<br><br>Just a quick summary:<br><br>1) It is sad that we have so little opposition in parliament<br>2) PAP uses propaganda to its full effect which is another sad thing<br>3) Image counts in politics, to the extent of it superceding a politician's political and economic acumen<br>4) Opposition parties must build much more credibility if they are to succeed at the next elections<br><br>My vote for the last election has gone to WP. That's because they are keen to bring in new and talented blood. They also play the game within PAP's boundaries because once they step out of line, jail awaits. And then reputation goes down. Well, other reasons too.<br><br>Play the game within the tiger's lair, once the opportunity presents itself, make the kill.</div>

If you are referring to unit trusts, it all depends on the market performance. Volatile funds may offer between 10-35% return p.a.but it is only for the adventurous. Funds of between 5-10% may suit those with a moderate risk appetite but then again, fluctuations are involved. Any ordinary Singaporean at age 55 with a balance of $50,000 - $200,000 (after CPF deductions for housing and children's education) would most probably fall into the risk averse categpry. CPF's guaranteed 4% interest payable at age 55 and beyond is a well suited plan here.</span></strong></blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">You seem to have some kind of telepathic ability to conduct surveys in this virtual world of the web.<br><br>When did you conduct any polls on the respectability rating of anyone in this Speaker's Corner that you have assigned me the unsolicitted respect.<br><br>In any case, which part of my simple statements in the preceding paragraphs that you have found to be unbelieveably balloney ?</span><br><blockquote><strong><span style="color: blue;"><br>(Now read this carefully): I can't say the same for 2.5% though. I have told you before my stand on CPF interest rates. If you cannot do youself the justice of reading my posts carefully, then save all forumites the hassle of this debate.</span></strong></blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">Did you not attempt to close this debate already in your last post on 4 May 2007 12.15 PM ? </span><br><blockquote><strong><br><span style="color: darkred;">If there are no 10 year Fixed Deposit that is comparable to the long term saving offered by CPF, is there anything to stop anyone of us to take on another 3 month term after the first fixed deposit period has lapsed ?<br><br>As long as the program is available for the next 10 years, are there anything in the fine prints that restrict the number of times that this 3 month term can be renewed within any given period ?<br><br>Even if this program offering 6% for a 3 month term deposit is no longer available, could we not find anothe program either with DBS or any other banks, or Unit Trusts, or other reputable Financial Institutions ?</span><br><br><span style="color: blue;">Are you losing the plot that you can't come to the point? The above 3 paragraphs are harping on the same thing when you could have summarised all into one for easy reading? Do be more concise.<br><br>More bullshi.t from you again. Is the above feasible? Below are some of the reasons:<br><br>1) Every time you buy an investment/FD with a bank, hefty management fees are involved. If you buy plans like these 5 times a year, you can incur fees in the thousands.<br>2) A large number of Singaporeans are already so ignorant on matters of financial planning, what makes you think they will consciously monitor the market and invest accordingly? And it's not just the uncles and aunties on the streets, graduates even. How many of your relatives and friends do so?<br>3) Even if you park your money with a fund manager to save you the hassle, can one guarantee that he will act in one's best interest? Can you guard against him selling you a product, praising it to the skies only because the plans offer a high commission?<br>4) A lot of banks offer "attractive" plans but on the condition that you bring in money from other banks. An example is the 6% plan you broached. Moreover, investing in another bank means looking for another fund manager, not to mention that it will be a search for a reliable one too.</span></strong></blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">Now I am wondering why are you opening your old wounds.<br><br>1) Now you are exaggerating with your statement that is loaded with nothing but hot air that makes too much thunder clap sound - but you are using it on the wrong guy.<br><br>Before you accuse me of being too robust with you, I suggest that you do a reality check with your statement that thousands of dollars have to be paid for management fees to renew Fixed Deposits ( FD ).<br><br>If your Fixed Deposit portfolio is $1,000,000 - are you going to crap with the bank over the management fees of $1000 for each renewal ?<br><br>You must be in the small league if you are going to be bothered on this trivial amount - only 0.001%, while 1% is only $10,000.<br><br>2) Do you think that those with monies are not educated, or are foolish ?<br><br>Even if they are ignorant, this does not mean that they do not know how to ask, and attempt to clear all doubts before parting with their monies.<br><br>3) Commissions ? Are commissions paid to the Officer who assist in the opening of Fixed Deposits ? Which banks are you working with that pays you commissions for the deposits made ?<br><br>4) Banks are here to make money by being a Legitimate Money Lender, and in order to do so, they must attract your money with tantalising programs.<br><br>It is for you to be smarter and not to fall into their web.</span><br></div>

Its only in recent years, the money was allowed to be used for investments. If not the govt can still tap on cheap capital at the expense of the citizens and pretend it got no responsibilities towards the lack of retirement funds among the elderly. I guess when the PAP says humans are their only resource, they mean leeching on citizens but pretending they have no responsibilities towards them after they have sucked them dry, after milking the cheap source of capital from the citizens.<br><br></div>
