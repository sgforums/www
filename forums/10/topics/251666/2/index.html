It doesn't help that many S'poreans have little idea on retirement planning. The govt should start a mass campaign on this. But then again, by doing so, they would expose the inadequacies of the CPF.</span><br><br><span style="color: darkred;">Does the government play fair by paying 2.5% to the CPF account (4% for the Medisave), and only paying a full 4% to a Retirement Fund of $120,000 only when we reach 55 years ? </span><br><br><span style="color: darkred;">Does the Government play fair, when they get to use cheap CPF funds at below market rate, using our money to build infrastructure, and thereafter charges us atrocious prices for the use of it, and in the process bloat up the National Reserves.</span><br><br><span style="color: blue;">If you look at the nature of my previous post, my "fair" referred to the 4% interest paid to retirement account upon age 55. One will never get a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">guaranteed</span> rate like that anywhere else in the market. However, I can't say the same for pre-55. It is definitely on the low side. "Fair" also refers to the amounts that members may encash at 55 and the distribution method to reduce the possibilities of one living longer than one's money.</span><br><br></div></blockquote></div>

The way he goes about discrediting the govt (even if he was right), would only further cement his image of a fanatic lunatic. Has he even learned from past lesson not to go around the system? Maybe no one has noticed but I have mentioned a long time ago here in sgforums that Chee is a "martyr born in the wrong era".

I have read his "To be free" before and they are in no way fanatic views. He presents reasonable arguments and I have to agree with some truths of his. Compare that with his public image? I can't say the same. I still remember how he hounded Goh Chok Tong in the 2001 elections while the latter was doing a walkabout in Jurong. He lost badly that year. His image has gone down ever since and it does not help that PAP has taken every opportunity to smear his name.<br><br>Conclusion? Politics is about image and he has none of that. He's a goner and only his die hard fans would buy his books on sale.</span><br><br><span style="color: darkred;">If you have, then anyone in this Speaker's Corner that holds similar persistent negative views will also qualify to be considered by you to be similarly guilty of ranting. </span><br><br><span style="color: blue;">It's just business.

            <div class='col-md body'>After NKF, the ministers one by one denies problems by making good speeches which sound that there is no problem and everything is being taken care of. (Government misses the opportunity to make charity organization accountable and transparent and upgrade the auditing firms' many "he who pays the pipers calls the tune" self-centred practices)<br><br>After Shin Corp, again, ministers and Temasek continue to behave like they have done nothing wrong with good speeches like "it is a long-term investment, every decision made in acquiring the shin corp shares were accountable complying with expert advice". (Government misses the opportunity to upgrade their overseas investment criteria failing to understand people's needs to use surpluss to create job and opportunities for lower income groups over previous losses of taxpayers' monies in similar projects in Suzhou)<br><br>After the backfiring on their further attempt to increase their ministers' pays to allow ministers to win first-prize lotteries, ministers and PM Lee continue with making of similar speeches during the labor day to make it look like everything is under control and there is no problem and there is no wrong doing in ministers taking taxpayers' monies (free lunches) without their clear consent.<br><br>(Government will miss yet another opportunity to upgrade our autocracy and make all decisions truly accountable and for the greatest good of the greatest number.)<br><br>In 2006, he has kicked off a campaign to upgrade our retailers' service standards wanting them to be more service-oriented to customers. Now is he willing to or has he set himself as a good example by being more service-oriented to his citizens in handling or relating to their complaints or problems.<br><br>Are our ministers not being too talented in denying problems thereby missing so many opportunities in the past in solving real problems?<br><br>Citizens will be wondering how come our million-dollar ministers cannot be more humble and less self-centred or legalistic and try to solve problems instead of always staying on the defensive treating complaints as something negative to be put down.<br><br></div>
