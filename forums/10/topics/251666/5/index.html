Where did you get your information from ?<br><br>Were you referring to Unit Trusts, or some other investment programs ?<br><br></span><br><br></div></blockquote>I honestly appreciate this post engaging solely on our topic and nothing else. As for the hotline, I'm not in Singapore. Your verification is good enough.<br><br>Yes, what you mentioned above is correct. Management fees are for unit trusts, not fixed deposits. Please render point 1 invalid.<br><br>I just did a quick check on the fixed deposit rates from these banks: OCBC, UOB, Maybank and DBS/POSB. Seems that the "6% p.a. 3 months" promotion is not the norm of banks here. All the banks have their interest rates below CPF's retirement account's 4%. And as written in fine print on the DBS webpage <a href="http://www.dbs.com/sg/personal/deposit/specialinv/" rel="nofollow">HERE</a>, only new funds from other banks are eligible. It seems to me that this promotion is meant more as an enticement to compete with rival banks than to stay as a perpetual feature.<br><br>Unless such plans come out all of the time, then CPF's plans for the individual after age 55 is still effective in my opinion.<br><br>As for Chee Soon Juan, perhaps there were some comments from me about him that you deemed condescending. I see it differently, I was just telling the truth as I saw it. May I quote an example: Lee Kuan Yew is revered by many but he also has his naysayers. Criticism of him will sound unpleasant and even insulting to his supporters. Everyone has a point of view, don't they? Whether right or wrong, only time will tell.<br><br>As for my shifty views on CSJ that you alleged, well, I leave it to your interpretation.</div>

Raising retirement age can be considered a recognition of these developments.<br><br>Singapore's population is also aging and that means its work force too isn't young.

If you were the employer, are you telling me you wouldn't factor in the 13% employee CPF contribution into your overall operating cost that dictates your employment wage structure? So basically, you're telling me employers are so generous as to be paying you the additional 13% to your CPF contribution as a gesture of goodwill? If that were the case, maybe you'd like to shed some light on why such charitable employers wouldn't bat an eyelid in shifting their operations when the opportunity for a cheaper outsourcing alternative arises?<br><br>b) No. There's no correlation to the nonsense you espouse - show me a statistical correlation that proves otherwise. Tendencies and actualities do not necessarily go hand-in-hand, do they?<br><br>c) Maybe for folks like you who haven't got a clue on the importance of savings, you do need people to mind your finances for you. Surely, that alone doesn't render it necessary for other more capable and responsible individuals to be denied the right to utilise their savings as they deem fit? If your argument were true, why stop at having a minder for personal savings? Why doesn't this regime deploy minders to ensure I don't cross the road when the red man is on or ensure I consume a balanced diet daily?<br></div>
