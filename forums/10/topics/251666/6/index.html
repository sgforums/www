            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by walesa:</div><div class="quote_body">a) Let's consider the case of a large corporation that employs thousands of employees. If you were the employer, are you telling me you wouldn't factor in the 13% employee CPF contribution into your overall operating cost that dictates your employment wage structure? So basically, you're telling me employers are so generous as to be paying you the additional 13% to your CPF contribution as a gesture of goodwill? If that were the case, maybe you'd like to shed some light on why such charitable employers wouldn't bat an eyelid in shifting their operations when the opportunity for a cheaper outsourcing alternative arises?<br><br>b) No. There's no correlation to the nonsense you espouse - show me a statistical correlation that proves otherwise. Tendencies and actualities do not necessarily go hand-in-hand, do they?<br><br>c) Maybe for folks like you who haven't got a clue on the importance of savings, you do need people to mind your finances for you. Surely, that alone doesn't render it necessary for other more capable and responsible individuals to be denied the right to utilise their savings as they deem fit? If your argument were true, why stop at having a minder for personal savings? Why doesn't this regime deploy minders to ensure I don't cross the road when the red man is on or ensure I consume a balanced diet daily?<br></div></blockquote>1) I dont think you quite understand my point about employer being "generous". As long as there is an opportunity to reduce cost, any tom, dick, harry company will jump on it. So what I am trying to say to you is that if we dont have CPF, do you think your employer will pay you that extra 13%, because what most people care about is their take home salary.<br><br>2) You need statistic? Just look at the amount of roll over credit card bills and the no. of people taking 90% car and housing loan. If you have money, you dont need to take up such expensive loan because you end up working for the banks.<br><br>3) I suspect that you are still a student who have yet to take home your first salary and have yet to experience life on an independent adult who can apply credit card using his own pay slip. When you are done with that, then you ask me the question if the general young adult here in Singapore has the tendency of saving for rainy days.<br></div>

Fund managers only have access to your money - and a pre-determined amount at your absolute and sole discretion - after you've given them consent to handle your funds. In other words, if you do not wish to have your money entrusted to fund managers for whatever reasons, there's no way they can lay hands on your money.<br><br>So are you telling me this regime operates in the same manner as fund managers when it comes to handling your CPF? Do you have that <strong>option</strong> of ensuring this regime does not touch your money should you <strong>not</strong> wish to have them interfere in your finances that come in the form of your CPF?</div>

Where's the correlation that conclusively suggests people spend more money when they're given more to spend? Do you have any tangible figures, obtained from an independent statistical survey done on a significantly large sample population with an unbiased estimate to conclude <strong>people actually spend more money when they're given more than when they're given less</strong> ?<br><br>3) I've no wish nor desire to speak about my experience nor education - my educational qualifications and work experience will dwarf yours in all probability (if you're really interested, you can go and dig up threads elsewhere in this forum where I've briefly mentioned them) and still, I assume less than you do. Typical of shallow-minded folks who think they've seen the world and assume there's only ever 1 exclusive viewpoint to scrutinise matters.<br><br>You'll do well just to have a further discussion on point 1.<br></div>
