            <div class='col-md body'>I think May Day is about celebrating the Â‘workerÂ’. In my imagination, the Â‘workerÂ’ is someone young(ish), full of life, healthy and has a lot to live for.<br><br>But in his May Day speech, SÂ’pore PM Lee (quoted in <a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/273404/1/.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/273404/1/.html</a>) mentioned something that I would think are not likely to be found in the same sentence: Â”agedÂ” and Â“labourÂ”.<br><br>According to CNA, Â”Mr Lee noted that one major long-term challenge is the rapid ageing of SingaporeÂ’s population. The key goal, said the Prime Minister, is to enable <strong>workers to work longer and retire later</strong>.Â”<br><br>Â“Which other developed nation in the world tries to get their elderly to work longer/retire later, rather than retire and enjoy retirementÂ”, I wonder? I think this is the twisted logic of a staunchly non-welfare state where the elderly have to take care of themselves, despite how much theyÂ’ve contributed to the nation in their youths.<br><br>IÂ’m not one to suggest that the Singapore government gives out money to the unemployed young in fits of Â‘welfareÂ’ kindness, but IÂ’m sure that with all our wealth, the aged and elderly should be able to retire at 62 (the official retirement age) and be supported by the state (in terms of medical, daily needsÂ…etc) if they qualify. Asking our aged to work longer/retire later is to insult their efforts of nation-building that they wouldÂ’ve been engaged in for the past 4-5 decades of their lives. I know I want to retire at 62, if I can, and take a long rest.<br><br>Anyway, how many of of elderly in Singapore can get a plump job like our 80-year-old+ MM LKY who draws a few millions each year? With that salary, I would volunteer to work till the day I stop breathing.<br><br></div>

I have always doubt is he that sincere and genuine in caring for the people of Singapore.  probably he wants singaporeans to work longer and retire later is to make sure he will still be paid the unreasonable super high fat salary.  if majority is to retire early, then they will get less revenue and this may affect their salary.  he has stated a couple of times before that Singapore is not to be a welfare state, look at what he said, do we still have faith and confidence that he will take very good care of the old.  Well, think he only thinks of his own good.<br><br>So far, what he said in his position as PM doesn't carry much weight.  To me he is just being superficial and not have a genuine and sincere heart to serve the nation.   No wonder, so many don't respect him and think he is not capable.

With LHL as our PM, I really am not confident of the future of Singapore. Talking about future, yes he has a good future but I am not sure about the future of the people of Singapore.  Finance Ministry - wealth ??? Lee hsien loong is the minister for this ministry.   MAS under him, Finance ministry also under him, wa where $$$$ he wants to have a hand to control and have a say.   Does he become a PM because of $$$?  What a shame!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br></div>
