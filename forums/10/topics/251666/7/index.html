If abetting multinational corporations by exploiting the peasants is what would yield them the financial returns they want, why not?<br><br>What this regime is currently doing is nothing more than an extreme version of the Reagan administration (adopting the same corporate philosophy without any nuance of social justice nor the slightest regard for its citizenry) - given Singapore's geopolitical advantages in the region and a population willing to bite the bullet at their own expense for the greater good of the fascists, there's little doubt this economy will be boosted further through the corporate incentives. With the economic boost, expect the fascists to start re-writing their own paychecks in no time for the exceptional "talent" they've in helping suppress the citizenry's welfare for corporate interests.<br><br>In time, this serves as nothing more than a vicious cycle already documented in the Orwellian classic "Animal Farm"...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

He doesn't know the factors affecting the circulation and printing of money and plainly assumes any mint could print their currencies at will.
