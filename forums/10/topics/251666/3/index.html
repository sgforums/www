That's what Chee has been doing.</span><br><br><span style="color: darkred;">It is rare that someone is prepared to look at both sides of the coin.<br><br>Have you tried to understand CSJ's background, his family, his upbringing - why he would have given up a stable job as a lecturer in NUS, and went against his faculty head - (a diehard PAP hatchet man) - to enter politics on the side of the Opposition, when he was offered to join the Ruling Party ?<br><br>Was he ALREADY attempting to be a martyr at the time when he entered politics ? </span><br><br><span style="color: blue;">Nope, I have never said he attempted to be a martyr. That's how the press painted him. CSJ is a very different person off the political scene. He behaves rationally and is a family man. Qn is.....how many actually know this? </span><br><br><span style="color: darkred;">All this is a matter of perception - yours - as you placed more weight on images than on the strength of the person, his message, and his willingness to stand-by his words and his actions.</span><br><br><span style="color: blue;">So I was the cause of his low votes during the past 2 elections? This statement should be posed to the electorate. Let me reiterate, image counts. Whether I place more emphasis on it than strength of character or not, is unimportant here. </span><br><br><span style="color: darkred;">Can the same be said of any of the Members of Parliament willing to stand on the conviction of their views, and go against the Party Whip, and truly represent the position of their Constituents who elect them into Parliament ?<br><br>Or have they sold their soul to represent their Political Party and not the Constituents, and renegading on the promise of defending the Constitution and Singaporeans in Parliament ?<br><br>The Constitution has been raped a thousand times over with new amendments that make nonsense of the original text and meaning of the Singapore Constitution - and all made to the benefit of ensuring that the incumbent Ruling Party will retain the political status quo in perpetuity.</span><br><br><span style="color: blue;">These bunch are mostly "yes-men", not worth a mention.</span><br><br><span style="color: darkred;">CSJ refused to play by the rules dictated and set by the Ruling Party, as these make nonsense to what is already spelled clearly in the Singapore Constitution.<br><br>Will you fight a war by the rules of engagement set out by the enemy ?<br><br>Will you fight Al Qaeda and the JI Groups on their ground rules ?.</span><br><br><span style="color: blue;">Trust me, that's his biggest ever political mistake: not playing by the rules. He has not seen the last of prison yet and he will continue to be painted as a lunatic. Till the day he rests in peace, PAP will still be in power. No prizes for guessing who still has control of the press then.<br><br>Al Qaeda and JI do not count as relative comparisons. They are unexterminable, highly secretive and act on the sly. No govt has control over them. But Chee? He's always in the tiger's lair and one wrong move means serious trouble. Therefore, when in that lair, do as it says and make a move to kill it once it is low on guard.</span></div></blockquote></div>

Government must correct all their major past mistakes before trying to tell people how to complain and how to write details of their suggestions to be more pleasing to their senses.<br><br>In the face of all these track record of the government in handling complaints and problems, I am sure you will agree that people are being very patient to let government get away with many mistakes and not solve them by resorting to hypocrisy and denials. These are not the hallmark of a talented or world's best government. It will be hypocrisy too for you to pretend these arrogance of the government does not happen and exist only in people's imagination.<br><br>Can you therefore speak with moral authority on behalf of government and can you therefore assure that all the constructive suggestions and ideas will not continue to be ignored or brushed aside by ministers or MM Lee due to self-centredness and autocracy and hypocrisy which as I see it is the source and root cause of all our current problems faced by majority of citizens.<br></div></blockquote><strong>Did I even talk about the self centreness of the government? No.<br>So why raise this?</strong><br><br>I am talking about the work longer and retire later issue! Is is a good one or bad one? Is there others better than this? This is discussion on a policy, not talking about giving our government ideas! And certainly not talking about getting our government to look into our ideas.<br><br>For your informatiom, I support this policy.<br><br>First, <strong>can the government actually control when you want to retire</strong>? You can retire now if you want to, just submit a letter. The problem is, can you support your retirement? If you can, why do you even have to bother if the government increase the retirement age up? You can send in your letter even at age 35 and they can't do anything about it.<br><br>Secondly, it gives me <strong>flexibility</strong>. I can decide when i really want to retire and not at a age where the company can boot my out of it. Actually, I never thought of early retirement. I didn't like the idea of staying home and doing really nothing. i got into the situation once, and it makes me kind of feel old and ageing. That was at a age when i should be bursting with energy.<br><br>Lastly, at least it gives those <strong>poor families a chance to continued working</strong>. These people may not be able to retire at ease to enjoy life. So, isn't it better if they can carry on working to build up their retirement nest before retiring? Well, of course, i wasn't thinking of a 70 year old man still working lah. But the point is, they should be able to retire and live comfortably and not retire early with problems in their financial health.<br><br>My only concern with this policy is on the CPF. Will they use this excuse to increase the CPF withdrawal age limit?<br><br>Well, my conclusion is, government cannot force you to work. You can retire anytime you want but you have to support your retirement. If you can't support it, wasn't it better that you would want this work longer and retire later scheme? For me, i liked the flexibility of my retirement age given to me by this scheme.<br></div>

Maybe no one has noticed but <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">I have mentioned a long time ago here in sgforums that Chee is a "martyr born in the wrong era</span>"</strong>.

And certainly not talking about getting our government to look into our ideas.<br><br>For your informatiom, I support this policy.<br><br>First, can the government actually control when you want to retire? You can retire now if you want to, just submit a letter. The problem is, can you support your retirement? If you can, why do you even have to bother if the government increase the retirement age up? You can send in your letter even at age 35 and they can't do anything about it.<br><br>Secondly, it gives me flexibility. I can decide when i really want to retire and not at a age where the company can boot my out of it. Actually, I never thought of early retirement. I didn't like the idea of staying home and doing really nothing. i got into the situation once, and it makes me kind of feel old and ageing. That was at a age when i should be bursting with energy.<br><br>Lastly, at least it gives those poor families a chance to continued working. These people may not be able to retire at ease to enjoy life. So, isn't it better if they can carry on working to build up their retirement nest before retiring? Well, of course, i wasn't thinking of a 70 year old man still working lah. But the point is, they should be able to retire and live comfortably and not retire early with problems in their financial health.<br><br>My only concern with this policy is on the CPF. Will they use this excuse to increase the CPF withdrawal age limit?<br><br>Well, my conclusion is, government cannot force you to work. You can retire anytime you want but you have to support your retirement. If you can't support it, wasn't it better that you would want this work longer and retire later scheme? For me, i liked the flexibility of my retirement age given to me by this scheme. </strong><br><br>aint what you have said photocopy of PAP version??<br>why cant our govt take care those age above  65 years old enjoy free medical care. free transport and basic amount of money for livihood.<br>yes the public transport is privatise, so what? that the multi millionaire minister job to convince these blood sucking transport company. and in the first place why are these company privatise??<br><br>does everything we do need to be dollar and cents? is govt spending hundreds of millions in research spending and bulk at spending 10 of millions helping the age? citing lame reason like complaceny.<br><br>yes, the govt has successfully raise the GST to 7% and revenue from casino should start to rollin in after 2010. these extra billions of dollars a year from tax revenue has yet been plan for the needy and poor, yet the very thing our Dear leader has done is to increase their own salary.<br><br>when we move forward, dont leave your buddy behind.<br>i hope you have the same mentality in your army days.<br></div>

He was perhaps just as old as Lee Kuan Yew and is already a very rich man. Yet he had continuing working. Even during holiday he work. Even when he looked as if he could be died any moment in life. Even when he already has enough money to last through his life. And i want to be in his shoe. To be able to love working. To love it so much that i would not want to retire so early. Thats why i support this policy.<br><br>And then no one stands to lose from this policy. you can retire anytime you want. So whats the issue with it. Government tells you to work until 65 but are you going to blindly listen to them and work till 65? If you got the financial power, then you quit at 60 lah. Who is to say you can't do that?<br><br>i don't agree with your policy of government giving all those benefits for elderly. Firstly, not every elderly needs those benefits. They may be rich enough. Secondly, I don't fancy seeing tax rate goes up just because some people decides not to plan for their retirement and depends on government. Well, I don't mind to see government helping those who really cannot support themselves but I would have issue if they simply want to spend their money on some luxury goods and depends on government to support themselves. There is an article of an old guy who got a sum of money for being photographed. but he simply spent this amount on beer! So means I pay tax just so that he can spends his own money on beer and depend on our money for living. That sounds carp to me. I would only agree to giving enough for livelihood and just to those who need them.</div>
