I was interested in a domestic cleaning business that can provide part-time jobs for unskilled, middle-aged aunties. But Singaporean workers demand higher pay and there is no demand as long as Singaporeans can pay cheap foreign maids S$300 a month to work 24/7. Even with the foreign worker levy, it is still worthwhile to get a full-time maid.<br><br>For such a business to work, we will need the government to drastically increase the foreign maid levy or ban foreign domastic help altogether to force Singaporeans to give up their foreign maids. Will that happen? Singaporeans will scream blue murder.<br><br>Singaporeans can talk about turning away foreign workers but it is really Singaporeans who create the business case for them in the first place.</div>

Just consider the number of families who have domestic maids.<br><br>There is a big difference between cheap foreign workers in factories and cheap foreign domestic maids in our homes. Local businesses benefit from a cheap source of labour and although unskilled Singaporeans lose out in the competition, at least the businesses benefit from lower costs and greater competitiveness. More foreign revenue is generated as the nation becomes more competitive as a whole and the economy benefits. In contrast, foreign domestic maids take revenue out of the country.<br><br>If we want to restrict unskilled and low-skilled foreign workers in Singapore, we should start with domestic maids but most Singaporeans will not have it. No political party would even dare to suggest that, whether it is the ruling party or the Opposition.</div>

Just consider the number of families who have domestic maids.<br><br>There is a big difference between cheap foreign workers in factories and cheap foreign domestic maids in our homes. Local businesses benefit from a cheap source of labour and although unskilled Singaporeans lose out in the competition, at least the businesses benefit from lower costs and greater competitiveness. More foreign revenue is generated as the nation becomes more competitive as a whole and the economy benefits. In contrast, foreign domestic maids take revenue out of the country.<br><br>If we want to restrict unskilled and low-skilled foreign workers in Singapore, we should start with domestic maids but most Singaporeans will not have it. No political party would even dare to suggest that, whether it is the ruling party or the Opposition.[/b]</blockquote>Funny how similarities are drawn between maids and slaves back in the 1800s.<br><br>The only difference is maids are paid and treated humanely (well, most of the time anyway) and with equal rights. Slaves were considered 'sub-human' by their inhuman 'masters'.<br><br>In short, we have 'legalised' humane slavery....exciting times these days....</div>
