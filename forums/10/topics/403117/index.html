              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>Written by: Shafie</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>Why a better economy in </strong><strong>Singapore</strong><strong> may mean more unemployment for Singaporeans? It is possibly enshrined in our Trade Agreements. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">People have always wondered why is it seems easier for foreigners to get work visas or permits nowadays. The possible reason could be the trade agreements our leaders so eagerly signed on, to increase Singapore’s Growth Domestic Product (which their bonuses and salary increments are tied to) without a thought for the negative social consequences.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>India-Singapore Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">In reference to India-Singapore Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA) 29 </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">June 2005: </span><a href="http://www.fta.gov.sg/fta_ceca.asp?hl=6"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #0000ff;">http://www.fta.gov.sg/fta_ceca.asp?hl=6</span></span></a></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><em>“Professional bodies in the accounting and auditing, architecture, medical (doctors), dental and nursing services in both countries will negotiate agreements, within a year of the signing of CECA, recognising each other’s education and professional qualification. This means that upon the completion of these mutual recognition agreements, </em><em>India</em><em> and </em><em>Singapore</em><em> professionals from these five professions could be able to practice in </em><em>Singapore</em><em> and </em><em>India</em><em> respectively.”</em></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><em> “Professional employed in 127 specific occupations will be allowed entry and stay for up to 1 year or the durations of contract, whichever is less.”</em></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><em> <strong>“Intra-corporate transferees (i.e. managers, executives and specialists within organisations) will be permitted to stay and work in </strong></em><em><strong>India</strong></em><em><strong> and </strong></em><em><strong>Singapore</strong></em><em><strong> for an initial period of up to 2 years or the period of the contract, whichever is less. The period of stay may be extended for period of up to 3 years at a time for a total term not exceeding 8 years.”</strong></em></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><em> “</em><em>Singapore</em><em> companies will have certainty when they choose to deploy </em><em>Singapore</em><em> staff to help manage their Indian operations. Skilled and qualified professionals and service suppliers from </em><em>Singapore</em><em> would also gain easier access to the vast Indian market. Similarly, this would also apply to Indian companies when they deploy Indian staff to manage their operations in </em><em>Singapore</em><em>”</em></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The trade agreement is supposed to be beneficial for both countries whereby, professionals from India and Singapore can work in each other country.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">There is also freer movement of goods and services with lesser red tape. And if you noticed, the agreement does not impose restrictions on the number of professionals a company can employ from either country.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">What is most disconcerting is that  India tends to import our products, services and investments (mostly from the banking industry and for our Foreign Sovereign Funds (SWF)) and NOT our labour, while we import their labour but NOT their products and services&gt; Have anyone seen a flood of made-in-India products in our major department stores?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">This forms a skewed economic picture, whereby, our GDP will grow because of increased trade, but at the same time, Singaporean professionals will be displaced by professionals from India.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">In other words, better economy in Singapore = more unemployment for Singaporeans.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Guess who signed the agreement that seems to disregard our well-being? Hint, he is the son of an old man who claims he can rise from the dead.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">And it may not be over yet based on the  the following article reported on  18<sup>th</sup> April 2010: </span><a href="http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/articleshow/5823303.cms"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #0000ff;">http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/articleshow/5823303.cms</span></span></a></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><em>“</em><strong><em>India will seek greater access for its professionals</em></strong><em> in Singapore in areas such as </em><strong><em>IT, health, education</em></strong><em> and </em><strong><em>finance</em></strong><em> in the upcoming review of the bilateral agreement between the two countries. The second review of the comprehensive economic cooperation agreement or CECA that was rolled out in 2005 will begin early next month.</em></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> <em>“</em><strong><em>Although we managed to get access for some of our professionals in Singapore</em></strong><em> as part of the CECA, </em><strong><em>we will try to get more</em></strong><em> in the review,” a commerce ministry official said. </em></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Commerce department is holding consultations with the industry and other ministries to finalise how much more it could offer Singapore in exchange for greater access in services.”</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Currently, we already have many PMETs  (Professionals, Managers, Engineers and Technicians) losing their jobs to foreign workers because companies rather employ based on the cost factor  than acquiring  qualified skilled and productive workers. If the report from the above article is true, we may see more of our local PMETs losing their jobs in the IT, health, education and finance industries in the near future.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Indian leaders should not be blamed here. For all its worth, they signed the agreement because it benefits their workforce greatly since the number of quality job opportunities in India is low. Leaders with great foresight can see a good deal which is sorely lacking in our own leaders.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span><a href="http://www.fta.gov.sg/fta_csfta.asp?hl=27"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #0000ff;">http://www.fta.gov.sg/fta_csfta.asp?hl=27</span></span></a></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><em>“The market access obligation means </em><strong><em>that a country cannot impose</em></strong><em> additional </em><strong><em>market access restrictions</em></strong><em> for these sectors, </em><strong><em>both quantitative and qualitative</em></strong><em>. For instance, restrictions cannot be imposed on: i) the number of service suppliers, </em><strong><em>service operations or persons employed in a particular service sector</em></strong><em>; ii) the value of services; or iii) the legal structure used.”</em></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>Trade Agreement With </strong><strong>China</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Due to the currency exchange, the majority of Singaporeans will not head to China just to work in their service industry unless they are willing to uproot and live in China with expatriate terms.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">However,  the people of China will definitely want to come to Singapore to work in our service industry to accumulate enough wealth to live comfortably in China.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Moreover,  they don’t even have to be excessively qualified to work in the service industry in Singapore. Based on the agreement, restrictions cannot be imposed on the number of foreigners a company can employ even if they are not qualified.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Close to 70% of the world’s products are made or contracted to be made in China. So basically, we are already buying and importing made-in-China goods long before the signing of this agreement.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Singapore does not have anything that China would need in terms of goods and services. But China (as in India), do have low quality job opportunities. So, once again we have traded our job market in exchange for a country to open up their markets for us – mostly for the banking industry and  investments for our SWF.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">As our local banks and SWF grow, so does our GDP. However,  Singaporeans,  will be displaced by cheaper foreign workers from China working in the service industries such as Food &amp; Beverages, Retail and Hotel/Tourism.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">In other words, better economy in Singapore = more unemployment for Singaporeans.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Foreign workers are also given free training to improve their communication and skill sets, while Singaporeans will have to pay (with subsidies depending on the courses) for the same training.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Why do our  country insists on acquiring so many foreign workers knowing plain well that they will displace our own local workers?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> And why could a company employ so many foreign workers so easily? Hint, “<em>restrictions cannot be imposed on persons employed in a particular service sector”</em></span></p>
