But I'm still guessing that the high cost of living in Singapore is that this is merely an island of 683 sq km.... 680 if you count high tide <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> .... Anyway, because of this, things are natural to be expensive. HDB flats are expensive coz there is a big demand for it because of the population and simple economics states higher demand = higher price. The only way of lowering the price is to add in more supply of HDB flats...<br><br>BTW, I don't get what you mean being poor is rich. In Singapore, being rich = draged down by taxes..... Being poor means living under the HDB flats...</div>

If these people are not paid enough they will just get demoralised and turn to corruption. Since when did the same rules apply?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
