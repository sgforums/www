            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Oh. My. God. Do you know how bad it is in most government schools compared to a SAP school? Our education system absolutely does not recognize late bloomers, just the typically "smart" kids who memorize well. It's all just cram school, route learning. Such late bloomers are regularly told they're not good enough just because the school is concerned about their overall aggregate.. my case is classic - I scored poorly in maths but my other subjects were A1-B3.. SAP school still forced me to drop Art Elective Programme, A maths and only allowed me to take a single science.. wtf is that.. I still dun understand the logic in making me drop all those subjects, why not just put me in maths remedial class? - especially AEP .. it's the subject I was best at! Stupid system.<br><br>Then my younger sister - she was in normal academic @ a govt sch.. From sec 1-4, her english was far better than her teachers! The teachers couldn't even string a grammatically correct sentence together.. on top of that, they taught the wrong pronounciation/grammar to the students. If my sister tried to correct them, they sent her our of the class! how can teachers be allowed teach subjects that they're obviously not qualified to teach? In 2001, my sis clinched 1st prize at an interschool english competition.. none of the other students in her school even got consolation.. but the school did not even recognize or reward her! Fricking incompetent.. And that's just the surface.<br><br>She's now studying overseas, where her talent is actually being recognized and properly nurtured. I'm gonna join her again soon to complete my studies, once I save up enough money!<br><br>There is alot of talent in Singapore.. but our education system ignores a large portion of it. </blockquote>No system is perfect. Maybe you should look at the whole or compare the system to other countries. From what I know, our literacy rates are much higher than the US and they even replicated our Maths teaching system because Singapore students consistently scored high marks in international competitions.<br><br>Are you sure that if another party takes over, they will improve the system? If you have a better idea on how to improve the system, maybe you should suggest it to the authorities. And don't tell me they won't listen to you, because there's no guarantee that another government will listen to you either.<br><br><blockquote>No one disputes the govt done a good job in the past. Now that we know they're good at handling our economy, don't you think it''s time to look at Singapore's social growth? Culture and arts - give Singapore a soul? So that when people say they're proud to be Singaporean, they can really understand what it means. And it's not just about the right to criticize them, it's about having a choice - a say in how OUR country is run. This is stuff that affects us, hello! Otherwise, it's not really our country. It's the Lee Family's country. </blockquote>Maybe it's time. But what do you think you should do? Overthrow the government just because it's time to look at Singapore's social growth? That would be abit extreme. Try to lobby for it through the right channels. Anyway, this is only what you think and not the majority of the people, right? I believe the government tries to listen to the people, but they can't please everybody since there are so many differing opinions. The people have chosen who they want to run the government and I seriously can't see any other party good enough to run Singapore.</div>

It is because of our immaturity as a nation that PAP cannot loosen its hold completely, and suddenly.  However, that does not mean that they should not do so gradually.

Come on, give your own Singaporeans some credit.  We're tame compared to people in other countries.  If our police is so ... resourceful ... as to be able to catch teenagers in parks and issue warning letters, and harass key opposition leaders day and night, why can't they oversee a small peaceful demonstration in a blue moon?

In an ecosystem,every predator has a limited amount of power,though its power is great. However, even predators sometimes become prey to organisms of equal or greater power, or face an organism to powerful to hunt. They are destroying the balance of the political system,leaving themselves with no checks on their power and a different perspective to tell them whether or not they are wrong.<br><br>5)Regarding the apathy of people;see it for yourself!Keep quiet,mind your own business,let the government handle the business of governance.Make money,accumulate material wealth,look after yourself and your interests.<br><br>Its a shortsighted view.I want to create something for the future.This is my country,I have bled for it(laceration from barb wire during SOC traininglso can be considered  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> ).We could be so much more.There is so much "wild talent" within the population,yet have a system that that refuses to recognise this.<br><br>No system is perfect,but we have the money,the resources and the intelligence to make it a better,more balanced system.No system is perfect,that is a tryth,but a good,balanced system can be made.<br><br>I want a say in how the government is placed in power.I do not suddenly want to end up in a situation where I end up in Tanjong Pagar due to magic.During the recent election,I live in Tanglin but somehow became part of Tanjong Pagar.Strange.I stepped out of my home in Tanglin and ended up in Tanjong Pagar.The wonders of election magic.<br><br>It is this sort of event,this sort of abuses,that should be avoided.</div>
