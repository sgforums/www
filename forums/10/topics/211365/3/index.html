Do you know how bad it is in most government schools compared to a SAP school?  Our education system absolutely does not recognize late bloomers, just the typically "smart" kids who memorize well.  It's all just cram school, route learning.  Such late bloomers are regularly told they're not good enough just because the school is concerned about their overall aggregate.. my case is classic - I scored poorly in maths but my other subjects were A1-B3..  SAP school still forced me to drop Art Elective Programme, A maths and only allowed me to take a single science.. wtf is that.. I still dun understand the logic in making me drop all those subjects, why not just put me in maths remedial class? - especially AEP .. it's the subject I was best at!  Stupid system.<br><br>Then my younger sister - she was in normal academic @ a govt sch.. From sec 1-4, her english was far better than her teachers!  The teachers couldn't even string a grammatically correct sentence together.. on top of that, they taught the wrong pronounciation/grammar to the students.  If my sister tried to correct them, they sent her our of the class!  how can teachers be allowed teach subjects that they're obviously not qualified to teach?  In 2001, my sis clinched 1st prize at an interschool english competition.. none of the other students in her school even got consolation.. but the school did not even recognize or reward her!  Fricking incompetent..  And that's just the surface.<br><br>She's now studying overseas, where her talent is actually being recognized and properly nurtured.  I'm gonna join her again soon to complete my studies, once I save up enough money!<br><br>There is alot of talent in Singapore.. but our education system ignores a large portion of it.<br><br><blockquote><strong>I would certainly prefer a superior government than the right to criticise them, since they have done a relatively good job.</strong> </blockquote>No one disputes the govt done a good job in the past.  Now that we know they're good at handling our economy, don't you think it''s time to look at Singapore's social growth?  Culture and arts - give Singapore a soul?  So that when people say they're proud to be Singaporean, they can really understand what it means.  And it's not just about the right to criticize them, it's about having a choice - a say in how OUR country is run.  This is stuff that affects us, hello!  Otherwise, it's not really our country.  It's the Lee Family's country.<br></div>

We are farmed like animals.. in a zoo, the animals don't have a say in how the show is run.. But once domesticated, we have a hard time letting go of our creature comforts..and most of us fear we cannot survive in the wild.    Some, like myself, are lucky (or unlucky depending on how you see it) to realise what's going on and yearn for our freedom, a voice, our right.<br><br>Each individual can make a difference, but we cannot hope to be a one-man/woman army.  [b]An ironic tragedy is.. while the opposition has ideas, too many people either do not want to get involved, or do exactly what the PAP does - which is to believe the mainstream media's portrayal of the opposition as a bunch of bumbling fools without bothering to find out more about ideas behind the faces.  </strong><br><br><strong>But is that what YOU think??  Or what the government WANTS you to think?</strong>  If u truly feel the PAP's arrogance and power is a threat to Singapore's future, what are you doing about it as an individual?  Certainly not taking action - at least that's what the opposition's doing.  Why simply diss the opposition?  Why not find out more about them?  Talk to them?  Get involved, pitch in, even?  A toothpick on its own can be broken easily.  but put a bunch of them together, and they will be 1,000 times harder to break.  <strong>WE the people are the reason the opposition cannot succeed... because although alot of us have a few common goals (bring PAP's absolute power under control by setting a system of checks n balances), we don't want to get involved!  We're like.. trembling obedient ninnies who have seen how the opposition is persecuted mercilessly by the PAP, and don't want to be in that position!</strong><br><br><strong>Most Singaporeans complain and complain, but still choose the blue pill.  And that's something the PAP can count on every single time.</strong>  But I know what I want, and what I'm going to do.  Do you?[/b]</blockquote>Let me give the other side of the coin to achieve a balance and fairer picture.<br><br>Your fear for Singaporeans without having the courage to rise to the challenge from the outside dynamic world is uncalled for. The rise of globalisation coupled with the harsh reality of life will certainly encourage potential entrepreneur to take on the world stage and push man to their upmost limits. This is the brilliant works of the economic system and need not neccessarily be in the form of political reform to achieve the effect. Sadly but truthfully, terrorism is another distinct problem in this century and potentially a crucial factor that may deter any country wishing to grant complete democracy freedom without thinking twice, much more a multi-ethical society like ours. Lives are at stakes not rights.<br><br>Singapore is a multi-racial society, a fact which many overlooked or choose to neglect in the course of political reformative. In terms of diplomacy, Singapore has insofar done pretty well but the breach and nothing can be more worse is the outbreak of a civil war. So before we yearn for more freedom of speech or rights, perhaps we should first examine the context and nature of our nation. All political party have their own ideas and system that they wanted to contribute, henceforth, the onus is for the respective party to convince the masses with their ideological system. Simply pinpointing out at fellow Singaporeans for being cowardly and not getting involved is not the way to do things. In my humble opinion, it is neither the flaw of the system nor the political apathy of the people but a first class opposition has yet to emerge.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>
