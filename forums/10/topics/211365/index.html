But Idealism will remain only as ideals if they are not developed into concrete solutions. These people are also advocating for changes, which is also nice. But I do think that we should take things a step further and its should not be just "things must change" " but more of into concrete policies proposals that can be realistically implemented with reasons like "we should change A into B because of C and we are prepared to do in X number of phrases because of D". V for Vendetta is a movie and therefore it does not need to consider the "what now?" factor. Civil disobeience can bring down a government, but before every such dramatic change, people who propose the change should consider the "what now?" factor.  And I think that in order to prepare for this "what now?" factor, people possesing these passion really must committ considerable effort into the study of public administration and politics. More ideals must be exchange, interactions must occur with the society to really find out what they need and want. And it is only after the foundations and fundamentals of a complete set of political ideals is ready before we can ask for any dramatic changes. Hope cause by then certain political legend would not be around anymore and the chance for a change is also more likely.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>He is not Malay.<br><br>And most of what he has said, I've bitched and ranted about when I was younger.<br><br>Nowadays, I'm just getting more cynical, and I'm just more leaning towards the arts as a vehicle of social and community education and empowerment. If you want change here and continue to live a good life, you need to think strategically and not tactically.<br><br>Sardaukar, I know what you mean, and believe me, when you calm down, you will be much more able to formulate what you want to do.It starts with a small step, and within our constraints, all we can do is to educate and wait.I am optimistic that we have a growing segment of people who are sufficiently educated and perceptive enough to realise that this nation is not going to grow any further without real nourishment.<br><br>First and foremost, what is needed here are strong, stable democratic institutions, that is not ideology driven, although that is but an intangible factor that may influence in an unduly fashion. We need a more robust press, a press that has the gumption to question the Govt when things are not right, when the people have their misgivings. The Feedback Unit is just a messenger, it is not a medium-level facilitator of policy moderation and formulation.<br><br>To be inclusive in state-people relationships, the govt has to take into account the groundswell, and what better channel than the media, if only it were independant and not state-owned. That is the point of friction. You cannot realistically expect neutrality when one faction owns the press, can you?<br><br>We need to rediscover the confidence in ourselves and reject a constructed narrative because that does not value the Singaporean as the individual, and it cheapens the national story.</div>
