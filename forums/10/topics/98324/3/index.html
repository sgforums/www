            <div class='col-md body'>Qitai, it was not GMS who said you are a PAP's person. It was I. You are also no different, jumping to conclusions.<br><br>At least for me, I am new here. And reading for posts for the 1st time, I felt that you really sounded like doing PAP's job until you clarified that you are 'neutral'.<br><br>Anyway what's wrong with having agendas? When you date a girl/boy you also have a agenda right?<br><br>You are like many citizens of Singapore, that although do not agree with PAP all the time, have been brainwashed by PAP into perceiving what opposition politicians ought to be in a cerrtain mould. One aspect is that they cannot have agenda. Which is dumb. PAP wins elections by having hidden agendas all the time. Tell me why NSS and ERS payment always coincide with election? If opposition clears their table of having hidden agenda, then even Hougang and PP will be lost!<br><br>And also, brainwashed that non-partisanship is high and mighty and being non-partisan gives the right to be 'lazy' whereas your fellow human being, more honest with himself, is 'punished' for his honesty by being expected to produce more content in this forum. Nelstar too, can argue before coming up with facts and we should forgive him just because he is 'neutral', whereas he sets higher standards for GMS just because GMS is honest about his political stand, so he as opposition must have facts before arguing.<br><br>Really... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>EmptyCage</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hahah...... can opposition brainwash when it does not even have much access to reach out to 3+ million Singaporeans?<br><br>Yes, partly because you said you don't trust GMS. Not because of your distrust, but because you were not able to substantiate your distrust. And when asked you just said you are 'lazy'. How can a lazy thinker's words be credible?
