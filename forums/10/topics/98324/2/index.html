            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Nelstar,<br><br>You have asked a very valid yet very simple, critical question:<br><br>"Do you really think remaking PAP will solve Singapore's problem?"<br><br>Yes, I do believe so simply because they are running the govt at the moment! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Innovative Economy is managed through a "holistic" approach, not a passive "reactive" approach as demonstrated by PAP....no jobs? Cut wages and CPF. Any man could come to that conclusion! But whether such conclusion is EFFECTIVE to solve the ROOT problem, is another matter.<br><br>Thus, if PAP is not remaking itself into a party that could possibly grasp the Holistic view and way of management, then it simply cannot deliver what Singapore needs most right now. And the fact that it is running the govt, it affects the whole attitude of civil service from top down.<br><br>You ask:<br><br>"Why political reform when you have elections? If we need to have political reforms each time the Government needs revamping, we should throw elections out of the window"<br><br>Now, you are mixing up the govt with political structure. Though they are not mutually exclusive, but they have distinctive roles. If you read the article on "The need for Political Innovation", you would realize that the structure of political discourse and debates is very different. Diversity is the most important assets for such things to evolve. The communication between the Govt and the parliament works both ways, not one way. Robust political debates are carried out in an inclusive manner, to look at all possible aspects of the problems raised. Parliament is NOT treated as merely a "Rubber Stamp" for passing the various bills, policies, laws and budget, but as a place for robust debates on various issues.<br><br>And a monopoly of power by a single party is detrimental to such robust process which need diversity in competition of ideas. And to be "inclusive" in its approach, it is inevitable that a proportionate representation system should be setup. This has nothing to do with the govt, so far, but rather, the political process in which the representation of the social segments are being included.<br><br>I don't think Workers' Party is not doing its job in making itself "stronger", whatever that means. It is interesting you think that way that opposition parties shouldn't "criticise" PAP..<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> It is just like talking to a "perceived"  weaker contester in a boxing match that you should not punch the big guys and you should just go on defence. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>More interesting enough is that why do you think I have the ability, if I am that weak, to "bring down" the "LEADING" political party PAP in the very first place? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> I think that's pretty irrational; strong guy doesn't just drop dead like that. And I don't think I am in any ways "bringing down" PAP; it is just like training a dog or getting a horse to run faster. You don't "kill" them, but yet, you need to exercise stick on them to make them do better. If you couldn't differentiate about that, it is not my problem. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>And besides, nothing is permanent. PAP may be the "leading" political party now, but that's not a divine status. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> If it is not careful and anti-progressive, I think it will just collapse one day, sadly, with Singapore together.<br><br>Goh Meng Seng<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Nelstar:</div><div class="quote_body">I'm too lazy to argue about the remaining point but I think you seriously need to look at the problem of forming a stronger opposition than criticising someone else.<br><br>Come on, if you're worthy, why wouldn't I vote for you?<br><br>(It's another walkover at Marine Parade GRC again... nothing to hear from opposition.)<br><br>You don't help Singapore by killing the leading political party.

But its okay people can judge.<br><br>I think GMS can't offer you much in debate because you can't offer him much in the first place. Compare your 2 sentences vs his 6 paragraphs. When he was shaing his 'Innovative Economy' concept, yours is just one liners like 'I don't trust him' or 'I don't like his ideas' or 'His ideas are untested'.

To put in a Socrates way of asking -- what alternative has PAP got to opposition's ideas? In fact, PAP has been agreeing with WP by copying so many ideas from their manifesto!<br><br>I think Singaporeans here need to get out from their 'Matrix' illusion.<br><br>And one thing I noticed is, of all forums that I have participated - Sammyboy, Sintercom, YP and here, this forum has the most number of people that 'run away' from a question or debate.

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Qitai,<br><br>I believe you could do better than that. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>To tell you the truth, my most capable and effective "researcher" helping me right now is also my most effective critic. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>I respect him as a person able to put up a more rational and reasonable argument against me at many times. I approach him to become my "sparring partnet", to keep my thoughts and writings in check, constantly giving me feedback and criticisms. I appreciate every bits he is providing me.<br><br>But I think you are far from being one good critic I could find anything worthwhile to respect. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> Try harder next time. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Goh Meng Seng<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Qitai:</div><div class="quote_body">Okay, I do some bashing on GMS now (and him only).<br><br>You sound like an idiotic boss now, whom when told that he is not trusted, instead of figuring why he is not trusted, comes up with all these reasoning and defends why he should be trusted. You read the rest. . . . . . . . . . . .<br><br>I can't trust a person like this to be able to run a country well.<br><br>And just let me add one point why I don't like you.

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Cage,<br><br>I think it is ok for the moderator to start the thread with this topic. Moderator should have their right of speech and expression as well.<br><br>It is a valid concern from the moderators' point of view. But I think some of the forumites here have rightly point out that I am not "bashing" PAP for the sake of bashing or hatred, but simply putting up alternative view points and researched materials in comparisons to what PAP govt has done so far, to demonstrate the short comings of PAP governance.<br><br>"Bashing" is based on incoherent, irrational feelings (such as Qitai's distrust of me) and hatred. Criticisms are not necessary bashing. If one is unable to tolerate criticisms, then he should not talk about "inclusive" society in the very first place. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>And people like Qitai or Nelstar may claim that some of my concepts or ideas are "untested"; that's not true at all. Finland and other Nordiac countries has mounted on the Innnovative Economy model for more than a decade right now and it is enjoying the fruits of it. Proportionate Representation existed for more than a decade in many political systems in the world.<br><br>I think more readers of this forum are well informed in one way or another to form their own opinion on what I wrote here. It is nothing new, sometimes "originial" in some sense, but it is just a matter of re-focusing on something that PAP govt's many committees may not be able to capture, for the lack of the ability of "Thinking out of the box" which requires them to pull themselves out and look at the whole system from far. They are too engrossed in "step by step" reviewing policies, searching through the trees, missing out the whole forest's development in the end.<br><br>Goh Meng Seng<br></div>
