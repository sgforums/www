            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Nelstar,<br><br>I know exactly what you mean, believe me. That's exactly what I have written for Hammer issue last year.<br><br>As I have already declared, I am here to show that opposition party like Workers' Party does have ideas and even Vision for Singapore. And they could prove that they have substance, if only they are given the opportunity to reach out to more people. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> That's politics anyway.<br><br>Here's my article:<br><br>http://www.wp.org.sg/news/hammer_online/05_critique_opp.htm<br><br>By Goh Meng Seng<br><br>Initially it seemed strange to write a "self-critique" in the Hammer that is supposed to propagate our political ideas. However I believe that any constructive and self-evolving political party should have both the ability to "criticise" its "opponents" as well as the courage to do a "self-critique" and "self-evaluation". It is only by doing so, that the party will be "reborn" again with greater strength to fight another battle and I believe that the Workers' Party, under the new leadership of Mr. Low Thia Khiang, is open enough and has the strength for self-reflection.<br><br>The first question I asked myself is this: "Is it a coincidence that the PAP won 75% of the votes in the last election?" Many critics of the PAP would jump into their war-gears and start shooting all sorts of "explanations" - unfairness or the lack of transparency in boundaries redrawing exercise, the expanding of the GRC system, the $13,000 deposit, the short campaign period allowed, and NSS handouts... the list goes on.<br><br>On the other hand, the PAP supporters and those who are sceptical about opposition parties would point to the "fact" that many opposition candidates only appear during election time and would disappear after the election. Well, some of the PAP's new candidates also appear not long before election time! The only difference is that the PAP's new candidates could acquire their political strength from the groundwork that their seniors had done within the GRC framework.<br><br>Opposition politics in Singapore had for decades been based merely on "Opposing". I am not saying that there is anything wrong with "opposing" or giving constructive criticism of the PAP government. However, this is not enough.<br><br>If we take the election process as a "Market of Free Choice", then the candidates who participate in this "market" are the "salesmen" and "saleswomen" who are trying to sell their parties' brand name. What we have seen so far indicates that most of us have rather "ineffective" sales persons as candidates. Why is it so? It seems that opposition parties would lose their "identities" without the PAP! Opposition politics has so far been defined as "opposing the PAP". These sales people have only one thing in common: making all sorts of criticisms against the PAP. Is this really "enough" to convince a customer to choose your products and services? Any good business person or sales person will tell you that such selling techniques would never work in the long run. It is only through "promoting" your own products and strengths that your sales can be improved.<br><br>Except for Hougang and Potong Pasir, we have had successes in the past that did not last long. Why is that so? It is basically because these short and "sweet" successes had been built on the opponents' (PAP's) mistakes or negligence in serving those constituents and not built upon the strengths of the opposition candidates. HDB upgrading and goodies might have lured the voters to give the PAP back these wards, but why did such tactics not work for Hougang and Potong Pasir?<br><br>We should stop blaming others and learn from our failures instead. PAP's victory is by no means a "coincidence". Although those new PAP candidates might not have done anything substantial for the people prior to their involvement in politics, the PAP must have done some things "RIGHT" for the people. After all, it is the political party that voters have chosen to be the government. We can argue that the PAP has all the advantages as a government and can take control of all grassroots networks. As such, it has the means to reach out to the people and control the playing field. This may be true but this should not stop opposition parties from counteracting.<br><br>The Workers' Party has reflected on its political direction and aims. We are aware that merely "opposing" the ruling party is not enough. We must also embrace the true spirit of SERVING the people. Walking the ground is merely a basic and fundamental political exercise we do weekly. There are other important and meaningful areas of work such as standing up for the less privileged, organizing various activities for the community, and co-ordinating social and voluntary work for the needy, etc. These are some items in our "report card" which we could show the voters in the next election. It demonstrates that we are not merely an "opposition party", but a political party that really cares for the welfare of our people.<br><br>In the spirit of "Pro Singapore, Pro Singaporeans", we will strive to be an opposition party that goes beyond "opposing politics". We sincerely hope that we can garner the support of all like-minded Singaporeans. We hope that they will lend us both financial as well as moral support to work towards our vision of a better and caring Singapore.<br><br>You do not need to be a party member in order to join us in serving the people. You can volunteer your service by being a part of our Hougang Youth Action Committee.<br><br>Goh Meng Seng is a member of the Workers' Party and the 2nd Treasurer for the Hougang Youth Action Committee. He has an Honours Degree in Economics from the National University of Singapore (NUS) and runs his own business.<br><br></div>

Where is the vision of PAP for Singapore? Any concrete vision? At least I have provided one; the Innovative Economy. Does PAP fulfill its last election promise of "Jobs Jobs Jobs"? No. There are still many jobless, so many that PAP admits that we are most probably going to have a persistent unemployment of 4% or more for the years to come.<br><br>And it seems that to the PAP, only cutting wages could save itself as well as the economy. Isit the case around the world? If that is so, countries that have high wages would not be progressing at all! Thus it would seem that PAP is the problem for Singapore's future economic development, if it continues to believe in such uncontested formula.<br><br>The Innovative Economy that has been tested successfully in places like Finland and Sweden requires a total revamp of the political culture we have in Singapore. PAP has resisted such a change for whatever reasons and thus become an obstacle to Singapore's economic well-being for the next phase of development.

That's exactly what I have written for Hammer issue last year.<br><br>As I have already declared, I am here to show that opposition party like Workers' Party does have ideas and even Vision for Singapore. And they could prove that they have substance, if only they are given the opportunity to reach out to more people. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> That's politics anyway.<br><br>Here's my article:<br><br>http://www.wp.org.sg/news/hammer_online/05_critique_opp.htm<br><br>By Goh Meng Seng<br><br>Initially it seemed strange to write a "self-critique" in the Hammer that is supposed to propagate our political ideas. However I believe that any constructive and self-evolving political party should have both the ability to "criticise" its "opponents" as well as the courage to do a "self-critique" and "self-evaluation". It is only by doing so, that the party will be "reborn" again with greater strength to fight another battle and I believe that the Workers' Party, under the new leadership of Mr. Low Thia Khiang, is open enough and has the strength for self-reflection.<br><br>The first question I asked myself is this: "Is it a coincidence that the PAP won 75% of the votes in the last election?" Many critics of the PAP would jump into their war-gears and start shooting all sorts of "explanations" - unfairness or the lack of transparency in boundaries redrawing exercise, the expanding of the GRC system, the $13,000 deposit, the short campaign period allowed, and NSS handouts... the list goes on.<br><br>On the other hand, the PAP supporters and those who are sceptical about opposition parties would point to the "fact" that many opposition candidates only appear during election time and would disappear after the election. Well, some of the PAP's new candidates also appear not long before election time! The only difference is that the PAP's new candidates could acquire their political strength from the groundwork that their seniors had done within the GRC framework.<br><br>Opposition politics in Singapore had for decades been based merely on "Opposing". I am not saying that there is anything wrong with "opposing" or giving constructive criticism of the PAP government. However, this is not enough.<br><br>If we take the election process as a "Market of Free Choice", then the candidates who participate in this "market" are the "salesmen" and "saleswomen" who are trying to sell their parties' brand name. What we have seen so far indicates that most of us have rather "ineffective" sales persons as candidates. Why is it so? It seems that opposition parties would lose their "identities" without the PAP! Opposition politics has so far been defined as "opposing the PAP". These sales people have only one thing in common: making all sorts of criticisms against the PAP. Is this really "enough" to convince a customer to choose your products and services? Any good business person or sales person will tell you that such selling techniques would never work in the long run. It is only through "promoting" your own products and strengths that your sales can be improved.<br><br>Except for Hougang and Potong Pasir, we have had successes in the past that did not last long. Why is that so? It is basically because these short and "sweet" successes had been built on the opponents' (PAP's) mistakes or negligence in serving those constituents and not built upon the strengths of the opposition candidates. HDB upgrading and goodies might have lured the voters to give the PAP back these wards, but why did such tactics not work for Hougang and Potong Pasir?<br><br>We should stop blaming others and learn from our failures instead. PAP's victory is by no means a "coincidence". Although those new PAP candidates might not have done anything substantial for the people prior to their involvement in politics, the PAP must have done some things "RIGHT" for the people. After all, it is the political party that voters have chosen to be the government. We can argue that the PAP has all the advantages as a government and can take control of all grassroots networks. As such, it has the means to reach out to the people and control the playing field. This may be true but this should not stop opposition parties from counteracting.<br><br>The Workers' Party has reflected on its political direction and aims. We are aware that merely "opposing" the ruling party is not enough. We must also embrace the true spirit of SERVING the people. Walking the ground is merely a basic and fundamental political exercise we do weekly. There are other important and meaningful areas of work such as standing up for the less privileged, organizing various activities for the community, and co-ordinating social and voluntary work for the needy, etc. These are some items in our "report card" which we could show the voters in the next election. It demonstrates that we are not merely an "opposition party", but a political party that really cares for the welfare of our people.<br><br>In the spirit of "Pro Singapore, Pro Singaporeans", we will strive to be an opposition party that goes beyond "opposing politics". We sincerely hope that we can garner the support of all like-minded Singaporeans. We hope that they will lend us both financial as well as moral support to work towards our vision of a better and caring Singapore.<br><br>You do not need to be a party member in order to join us in serving the people. You can volunteer your service by being a part of our Hougang Youth Action Committee.<br><br>Goh Meng Seng is a member of the Workers' Party and the 2nd Treasurer for the Hougang Youth Action Committee. He has an Honours Degree in Economics from the National University of Singapore (NUS) and runs his own business.<br><br></div></blockquote>What is the diff between YAC and YP?<br><br>and what business do you run anyway?</div>

Remember that in the past, singapore, has a lot of swampy areas. These areas are now developed into housing estates, industrial park etc. To go underground, they have to go deeper than previously dug. And often in many parts of singapore, there are marine clays underneath the hard rocks that has been used to fill the evaulated swamps.<br>They have to dig very deep amidst the marine clays, inorder to build up the foundation for taller buildings/undergroud mrt etc.<br><br>2ndly, I personally feel that there is a limit on how much we can go underground. Why? It is like hollowing the ground that the tall buildings stand upon. Yes, they can build underground support.<br><br>But do u think it is good if there are a lots of underground in singapore? Ever wonder it may not be easy to rebuild the tall buildings where there is already underground tunnels underneath.<br><br>Conclusion, there is a limit on how much we can go underground.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ok maybe for expressways mrt stations etc. But other than that can't do much.Anyway, the new Paya Lebar Expressway is being built, circle line is also being built. We gotta wait till these are complete and observe for a few months before we can say anything about congestions.If all else fails, then perhaps we could offer more express bus services? More alternative bus routes etc. Million and one ways. But we gotta wait and observe first.<br><br>And buses are limited to 50kmh they seriously won't go faster.<br><br>As for the scv monopoly, well, introduce a new company, why not? But that is provided that the market is big enough to substain 2 companies.Otherwise the weaker one will lose out and fall. Everything will be back to square one.</div>
