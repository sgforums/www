            <div class='col-md body'>Are the opposition here because they are anti pap or do they truely love their country? I just want to question their motives. Are you here because you love this place or because you hate the current party? How many of you here can give out concrete plans for this country, step by step in detail? How many of you are here simkply because you are discontent. Frankly, Most of the time i just step aside and let all the topics go on. But sometimes, i see the topics as more anti pap then patriotism. I always wanted speakers corner to be one that would benefit the country, not one where people take pot shots and spew discontent. How different would this be as compared to sammyboy if that is the case?Well, i advocate free speech, and i won't close topics this easily. I just want to see how sincere you are to this country.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It is okay to have anti-PAP sentiments. This is a free country. But to have a Speaker's Corner downgrade to a mug-slinging session of PAP all the time destroys the purpose why this place is set up initially.<br><br>I believe what CenturianMBT wants is a place where we can discuss all topics political and not just anti-PAP sentiment topics... it is damn boring you know and intellectually unstimulating   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>First of all, you must be able to differentiate between the country, the govt and the ruling party.<br><br>Anti-PAP isn't equating to traitor or "unpatriotic". And the word "opposition" itself has a bad connotation which I never like. I prefer to use "alternative party".<br><br>As for what you have said about having "concrete" plans for Singapore, step by step...etc etc. I think you are mistaken; running a country doesn't go like this.<br><br>If it is so, then PAP has failed badly. Where is the vision of PAP for Singapore? Any concrete vision? At least I have provided one; the Innovative Economy. Does PAP fulfill its last election promise of "Jobs Jobs Jobs"? No. There are still many jobless, so many that PAP admits that we are most probably going to have a persistent unemployment of 4% or more for the years to come.<br><br>And it seems that to the PAP, only cutting wages could save itself as well as the economy. Isit the case around the world? If that is so, countries that have high wages would not be progressing at all! Thus it would seem that PAP is the problem for Singapore's future economic development, if it continues to believe in such uncontested formula.<br><br>The Innovative Economy that has been tested successfully in places like Finland and Sweden requires a total revamp of the political culture we have in Singapore. PAP has resisted such a change for whatever reasons and thus become an obstacle to Singapore's economic well-being for the next phase of development. For patriotic reasons, we have to deal with PAP's resistance to reform the political structure first before we could proceed toward our next phase of economic development. So is this considered anti-PAP or patriotism itself?<br><br>Goh Meng Seng</div>

Then I do not understand what is mudslinging at all.<br><br>As I have pointed out, if Finland, from its great depression in 1990 with 18% of unemployment, could bounce back strongly to become the world's number one competitive economy, then there must be something we could learn from them. And I don't think you go by your assertions, "how to create jobs?" kind of question! Anyway, only PAP that is incapable of creative thinking could see things that way.<br><br>What they have done back then, is to look at their economic-political-social model, what have they done wrong? It is not about jobs only, it is about the whole system. And they are "proud" people of their own right, very patriotic indeed. And it is precisely due to such patriotism and pride, they are willing to take a hard look at themselves, what's wrong with the whole country and system?<br><br>Innovative Economy could not possibly evolve in Finland if they really take your approach "how to create jobs"! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> If you still don't really get it, then do some research on Finland.<br><br>Goh Meng Seng<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by CenturionMBT:</div><div class="quote_body">Disclaimer:Take note that i am here to listen to ideas and not mudslinging.<br><br>ok, so as a representitive of your party, what is your party's plans to increase the number of jobs?.</div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I am for the betterment of our lot and our country's.<br><br>PAP politicians should change their hardened mindset and start putting  their ears to  the ground.  That way, they will get to know how unpopular they have now become.<br><br>No amount of criticism will destroy our country more than what the ruling party has already destroyed -   political freedom and providing a decent level playing ground for politics.<br><br>PAP is denying many Singaporeans right to vote by forming GRCs.<br>I dare say Singapore politics is NOT 100% democratic.<br><br>Political dissent is not neccessary 'hate country'.  We disagree to  improve our country, not destroy it.<br><br>High handed policies have been handed down to us with no regards to our feelings and hardship.  Take GST for example - I thought the timing was terribly cruel and insensitive of the government.<br><br>The news about opening up and listening to the 65ers is  nothing but the usual PAP charades.<br><br>The ruling party has lost the faith and trust of many Singaporeans.

Rather, I would like to ask people who say WP and opposition can't offer anything -- what PAP has offered as the government? 3 recessions in 5 years? Is that a good track record? And every election they expect a strong mandate? Even governments in other countries in the world that did better than PAP have to work harder to earn mandate instead of threatening people with their own tax money. And still end up with 80% of the seats the most, not like PAP which get 95% of the seats.<br><br>I don't think your 'salesman' example is appropriate. Its not about 2 salesman from 2 companies. To me, a monopoly company is preventing new entrants to the market by legal measures, such as the unlevel playing field like GRCs that prevent smaller players or the PA grassroots that PAP illegitimately use as a party tool. GMS don't even have the chance to be a salesman.<br><br>You want an idea from a non-PAP person, how to see jobs created? I will give it to you. Notice how Singaporeans in the working world are usually overworked until they don't have time to start families, yet how come there are unemployed people around.

But how successful it is, we will have to wait and see.But as for the post about governments not working through plans etc. Lets take it this way, i as a potential voter want to see the goals for your party. And i want to see what you can offer to me and how you are going to deliver it to me. I want to see its benefits. Right now you are just a sales man. And a sales man don't sell his products by attacking another company's product only. He must show in depth knowledge of what he is offering.if he can't, his product simply can't sell. So i don't mind you attacking the weak points, but you must proove to us that what you have is something that the other party doesn't have. Now, is that simple enough?</div></blockquote>+1 agreed, as working man and a potential voter I too want to see what benefits are being offered.<br><br>As centurion mentioned I noticed that opposition groups like to "attack another company's product" to score points or to try to sway sentiments. That may have worked in the 40's 50's or even up to the 70's when people were hungry and less educated, not anymore today.<br><br>The fact remains that all these promises to do this or that means nothing to me. Or maybe you say freedom of speech, that means nothing to me too. Does that help me pay my bills? Maybe it does to the younger more impatient and frustrated singaporean looking for someone to blame, to me the young dunno what they want. Maybe thats your real target to rally the impatient young and emotionally frustrated you find in many of these forums.<br><br>I want to know what is being offered to me. Instead of finding other peoples  faults,  improve the wards you represent to the point it is better than what the ruling party is doing now or show me something concrete since you say you and your comrades are selfless, maybe the ruling party have funds to improve their wards and you don't but can't you try personal touch?<br><br>During the recent recession were there soup kitchens in your wards, or did WP youths go out of their way on weekends to organise sponsored charity events, were there collection and distribution of food parcels to the needy. Has something been done for the sickly in your wards and elsewhere? In your own small way was every effort done to help improve lives of the people that you want to represent.<br><br>Not that PAP did many of these things but word would have gotten around, religious groups and charitable organisations would have known and that would have magnified your humble image many times with the peoples and improved your standing, your efforts though small would have shone brightly and maybe prompted the PAP to 'catch up', forced them to act and take you seriously but as it is you guys didn't do squat! You wasted your time on meaningless countless debates amongst yourselves fearful at the same time the ruling party will steal your ideas and squandered a golden opportunity. How selfless or different are you from the ruling party then?<br><br>And now you come here to sgforums the place where I hangout to de-stress and force feed all this crap down my throat and ask me to cast my vote for you. How do you think I will rate you?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Nelstar,<br><br>Hahaha.. that's the original question! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>PAP has demonstrated its unwillingness to a political reform, first by saying Singapore needs remaking, but PAP doesn't need remaking but only refreshing. Isn't this evident enough? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Secondly, it has rejected suggestions and calls for political reform in Singapore! This is NOT personal judgment but all demonstrated by PAP's own doings!<br><br>And it is obvious that such resistance to reform has becoming a big obstacle to our next progression... another example how theie inept thinking process has stopped us from evolving into a more matured economy--- the over emphasis on low wage high tech! It is always the workers' fault for economic recession and thus need to cut CPF and wages! Why isit so? They claimed they have gone through the review committee to come up with such suggestions; then I say, why US and European countries could continue to progress and develop economically when they have higher wages than everybody else?<br><br>It would mean that we are NOT progressive enough to aim for a better situation for Singapore! We are actually comparing ourselves to places like China while we should be aiming for Swiss standards of living! That's pretty ironic! Even the Chinese are not taking India or Singapore as "competitor"; they are taking the Japanese as their real competitors! That's progressive thinking!<br><br>Thus, with this in view, it is quite clear that PAP is an obstacle to Singapore's progression, no doubt about that. Such mindset alone is self deflating and self defeating. It is NOT progressive at all!<br><br>How to talk about helping Singapore without talking about THE PROBLEM, PAP?
