It is not about whether PAP is an obstacle to opposition politics, but rather PAP is an obstacle to our progression to the next phase of  economic development. That's the basic difference. Political reform is only part of it. It involves more than that.<br><br>For example, PAP always talk about "Creative Thinking" or "Creative learning", but does it really knows what it is afterall? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> Giving strange exam questions to students?<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>If you visit Finland's Ministry of Education website, you will find a research paper on how the education system should be built to cater to a Innovative Economy. Innovation comes from two sectors, mainly social innovation and technological innovation, both of these are NOT mutually exclusive but takes a double communicative ways i.e. they influence each other in an interactive way. Thus, for the education system, they are aiming for BROADBASED learning, instead of some crazy "Creative Thinking" courses! I bet, they couldn't make a difference about that. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>And inorder to social innovation to evolve, the political culture as well as the cultural setup (which both are influencing each other in an interactive manner too) will have to be liberalized. For example, Starbucks or Coffee Bean is a form of "social innovation" which may or may not require high tech innovations. It is an innovtaion on lifestyle, both a cultural as well as a social framework. Same for bubble tea culture.<br><br>I am not that concerned about PAP "stealing" this idea but I bet they will not want to formulate any concrete steps towards a vision of Innovative Economy, because they are not ready to reform themselves politically.<br><br>Goh Meng Seng<br><br></div></blockquote>Fully agreed with u,,<br><br>That why Lee H .

            <div class='col-md body'>there is NO way i'm gonna read 5 pages. Therefore i am uninformed in the issues discusses and it would therefore appear proper for me to jump right in with my opinion:<br><br>Kudos to GMS for coming here. I dun see any government ministers arguing in this forum about politics.<br><br>I agree that what the opposition parties need is to have a more complete product to sell. Eg. Economy: Why you think its bad, and what you think should be done about it. Immigration, etc. You need to sell your plan for singapore more i think.<br><br>BUT i think many people have too high an expectation of the opp. parties. This is SINGAPORE. Not the UK or the US where they have question time in parl, or where they have a freedom of information act. I'm not sure if the opp parties are paid in SG but int he UK they largest opposition party is paid because it is recognised that a healthy opposition is part of a healthy government. SG's leadership is handicapping them by limiting them from getting information and resources. Bear that in mind.<br><br>The way i see it, we are faced with a conundrum. The Opp doesn't have enough to work with, we are afriad of them not having a proper plan. The only soln is to vote Opp and hope they open up more info. Yet to vote for the opp requires faith on our part for we have to accept their policies formulated based on limited resources.<br><br>A catch 22 situation really.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>Personally though, i see it as my duty to help vote for a healthy opposition. It is quite inconceivable that the opp will take over as government anytime soon, but i believe my vote can help create a parliament that is healtheir, and who can influecen government policies. Right now, parl is a joke.<br><br>-----Off topic----<br><br>By the way, is the WP advocating any parliamentary reform. Our system is clearly flawed right now. With 75% of the votes PAP got about 98+% of the seats in parl. This is the flaw of the first past the post system we are using.<br><br>Plus,imo, compulsory voting is a flawed concept. Ppl dun vote because a. they dun like either party, or b. they dun care about politics.<br><br>In this case, then probably, if forced to vote, they will go for the incumbent.<br><br>-------------------</div>
