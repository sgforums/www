              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and Minister Mentor Lee
                  Kuan Yew are expected to take the stand in Singapore's High Court next
                  week.
                  <br> <br> The hearing is to assess the damages they are claiming against the Singapore Democratic Party (SDP) and its leaders.
                  <br> <br>Both Mr Lee Hsien Loong and Mr Lee Kuan Yew won their defamation
                  suit against the SDP for defamatory remarks in the SDP publication "The
                  New Democrat" after they obtained a summary judgement from the court.
                  <br> <br>The defamatory remarks were contained in an article - both in
                  English and Mandarin - about the National Kidney Foundation scandal in
                  April 2006 that was published at the height of the 2006 General
                  Election.
                  <br> <br>Lawyers from Drew and Napier, who will represent the two Singapore
                  leaders, confirmed they will appear before Justice Belinda Ang during
                  the three days set aside for the hearing to determine the quantum of
                  damages to be awarded.
                  <br> <br> Besides the two Singapore leaders, several journalists are also expected to take the stand.
                  <br> <br>The article in question was headlined: "Govt's Role In The NKF
                  Scandal". A captioned photograph in the publication - which showed a
                  group of protesters outside the CPF Building holding a placard and
                  wearing T-shirts with the words "HDB, GIC, NKF and CPF" - was also
                  singled out as having caused offence.
                  <br> <br>PM Lee had argued that in their ordinary meaning and innuendo, both
                  the words and the photograph alleged that he is dishonest and unfit for
                  office.
                  <br> <br>The SDP also alleged that as Prime Minister, Mr Lee perpetuated a
                  corrupt political system for the benefit of the political elite.
                  <br> <br>These allegations were based on the premise that the government had
                  access to the information, which has now been unearthed about the NKF,
                  but concealed it to avoid criticism.
                  <br> <br>Similarly, Mr Lee Kuan Yew argued that the words and photograph
                  implied that like the PM, the Minister Mentor is also dishonest and
                  unfit for office.
                  <br> <br>Another allegation was that Mr Lee Kuan Yew had managed the
                  Government of Singapore Investment Corporation (GIC) in a corrupt
                  manner.
                  <br> <br>Meanwhile in a separate case, lawyers for both PM Lee and MM Lee
                  will be arguing in the High Court to grant them a summary judgement in
                  their case against the Far Eastern Economic Review (FEER).
                  <br> <br>FEER and its editor are being sued for defamation by the two
                  leaders for an article published in July 2006 about the National Kidney
                  Foundation saga.
                  <br> <br>Lawyers for PM Lee and MM Lee claim the article had set out to
                  disparage the leaders. The hearing for this case, also fixed for next
                  week, is before Justice Woo Bih Li. </span></p>

              <p>I'm a victim of grave abuses from people in power in Singapore with access to telepathic person(s). They have friends here too. All abuses are to convince people I'm mentally ill to cover their grave evil. Telepathy is not a far off fiction. It's a fact. I've realized I'm fighting a 12 year old.</p>
              <p>I'm perfectly functioning and not suffering from any mental illness. Any ordinary people would see that.</p>
              <p><strong>LKY family are liars without conscience.</strong></p>
              <p>Just because I say that there are people who can read mind doesn't make me crazy. They defamed me of being szizhophernic(whatever the spelling) in which I'm hearing voices inside my mind. I refused medication and proceeeded to finish my graduate degree locally in Indonesia refusing to go back to NTU. The NTU authority even sent me a letter stating that my doctor has given permission to resume my study. <strong>What doctor since I never saw one and what letter? LYING BASTARDS</strong>.</p>
              <p>One of my hobbies is model kit building one of which that I built took me 5 weeks to complete. Any idiot could tell I'm not what they told me I am.</p>

              <p>Have you been sleeping for the last 3 years and 5 months ?</p>
              <p>Your imagination is super to make you believe that there is nothing there for SDP to stand on in the statements that they have made.</p>
              <p>Have you even read what the issues are about that is raised by the SDP before submitting your skewed judgment on their position ?</p>
              <p>Is there any reason for MM and PM to take such actions against the SDP, or like you was it their self-inflicted imagination that led them to believe that the SDP actions had alleged that they are dishonest and unfit for political office ?</p>
              <p>Surely you do not believe your imagination as real perceptions in the details that you have written about others ?</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and Minister
              Mentor Lee Kuan Yew are expected to take the stand in Singapore's
              High Court next week.<br>
              <br>
              The hearing is to assess the damages they are claiming against the
              Singapore Democratic Party (SDP) and its leaders.<br>
              <br>
              Both Mr Lee Hsien Loong and Mr Lee Kuan Yew won their defamation
              suit against the SDP for defamatory remarks in the SDP publication
              "The New Democrat" after they obtained a summary judgement from the
              court.<br>
              <br>
              The defamatory remarks were contained in an article - both in
              English and Mandarin - about the National Kidney Foundation scandal
              in April 2006 that was published at the height of the 2006 General
              Election.<br>
              <br>
              Lawyers from Drew and Napier, who will represent the two Singapore
              leaders, confirmed they will appear before Justice Belinda Ang
              during the three days set aside for the hearing to determine the
              quantum of damages to be awarded.<br>
              <br>
              Besides the two Singapore leaders, several journalists are also
              expected to take the stand.<br>
              <br>
              The article in question was headlined: "Govt's Role In The NKF
              Scandal". A captioned photograph in the publication - which showed
              a group of protesters outside the CPF Building holding a placard
              and wearing T-shirts with the words "HDB, GIC, NKF and CPF" - was
              also singled out as having caused offence.<br>
              <br>
              PM Lee had argued that in their ordinary meaning and innuendo, both
              the words and the photograph alleged that he is dishonest and unfit
              for office.<br>
              <br>
              The SDP also alleged that as Prime Minister, Mr Lee perpetuated a
              corrupt political system for the benefit of the political
              elite.<br>
              <br>
              These allegations were based on the premise that the government had
              access to the information, which has now been unearthed about the
              NKF, but concealed it to avoid criticism.<br>
              <br>
              Similarly, Mr Lee Kuan Yew argued that the words and photograph
              implied that like the PM, the Minister Mentor is also dishonest and
              unfit for office.<br>
              <br>
              Another allegation was that Mr Lee Kuan Yew had managed the
              Government of Singapore Investment Corporation (GIC) in a corrupt
              manner.<br>
              <br>
              Meanwhile in a separate case, lawyers for both PM Lee and MM Lee
              will be arguing in the High Court to grant them a summary judgement
              in their case against the Far Eastern Economic Review (FEER).<br>
              <br>
              FEER and its editor are being sued for defamation by the two
              leaders for an article published in July 2006 about the National
              Kidney Foundation saga.<br>
              <br>
              Lawyers for PM Lee and MM Lee claim the article had set out to
              disparage the leaders. The hearing for this case, also fixed for
              next week, is before Justice Woo Bih Li.</span></p>

              <h1 class="clr">Court hearing on defamation award adjourned</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE: The High Court hearing to assess damages claimed by Prime
              Minister Lee Hsien Loong and Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew against an
              opposition political party, has been adjourned for two weeks.</p>
              <p>PM Lee and MM Lee are taking the Singapore Democratic Party (SDP) and its leaders to task for defamation.</p>
              <p>On Monday, the High Court adjourned the hearing to give SDP and its lawyers more time to prepare their arguments.</p>
              <p>The outcome will now be known on 26 May.</p>
              <p>The
              article at the centre of the defamation action appeared in the SDP
              publication "Demokrat" in April 2006 with the headline "Government’s
              role in the NKF scandal".</p>
              <p>The court found that the article defamed PM Lee and MM Lee.</p>
              <p>Both
              leaders successfully obtained a summary judgement against SDP chief Dr
              Chee Soon Juan, his sister Chee Siok Chin and the party.</p>
              <p>After two years of court procedures, all that is left now is to assess the quantum of damages.</p>
              <p>Both PM Lee and MM Lee were to have taken the stand from Monday to Wednesday.</p>
              <p>But
              there was a turn of events on Monday. Lawyers for the Prime Minister
              and Minister Mentor said a major part of Monday’s hearing was centred
              on whether issues which were meant to be dealt in chambers should be
              heard in open court.</p>
              <p>The SDP and its lawyers felt they were of matters of public interest and hence should be heard in open court.</p>
              <p>But the judge finally decided that these matters could also be dealt with and heard in chambers.</p>
              <p>The
              Chees also wanted Justice Belinda Ang to disqualify herself from
              hearing the case on the grounds that she had awarded the Lees a summary
              judgment in 2006 after the Chees had walked out of court.</p>
              <p>But this was dismissed, with Justice Ang emphasising that it is her duty to hear all cases presented to her.</p>
              <p>Also
              dismissed was an application to allow a representative from the
              Malaysian Bar Council to be admitted to observe the hearings in
              chambers.</p>
              <p>Another point brought up on Monday was the affidavit
              known as "Evidence in Chief" filed by the SDP, its leaders and a former
              opposition election candidate Francis Seow.</p>
              <p>Lawyers for the Singapore leaders want them to be struck off, arguing they are irrelevant to the hearings.</p>
              <p>This
              matter will now come up for hearing in chambers on 22 May, four days
              before the court sits again to start proceedings to assess the damages
              claimed by PM Lee and MM Lee. — CNA/ir</p>

              <p>Professor Jayakumar said over the TV tonight that his greatest achievements as a Law Minister for the past 20 years have been raising the standard of law and justice to match that of first world country.</p>
              <p>He probably regarded it as his achievement too to keep quiet about the suing of political oppositions for remarks many of which are highly of public interest and justifiable in the heat of electioneering.</p>
              <p>If he has indeed earned those achievements he mentioned would we have MM Lee challenging George Gomez to challenge him with a law suit in his court where judges were appointed solely by him and promotions decided by him and pay scales benchmarked by him too.</p>
              <p>He claimed that he is open about the decision of the international court over Pedra Blanca.</p>
              <p>Is he ready too to submit all political defamation suits against government ministers' political oppositions to International Court and feel sanguine about accepting such international court's verdict as well. If he can be that honest as well to accept international court's verdict to avoid bias in government's defamaion suits against political opposition then he would certainly be looked upon differently as an international stateman and not a yes-man.</p>

              <p>It doesn't make an awful lot of sense to regard this as being significantly newsworthy, does it?</p>
              <p>With a corrupt judiciary that allies with a politicised legislature which is effectively a puppet of the executive that basically self-elects, what sort of rational jurisprudence could you expect to witness in cases where the interests of tyrants are concerned?</p>
              <p>After all, as Francis Seow (once the regime's solicitor-general) aptly pointed out, nowhere in the free world is there an anectodal precedence of someone having successfully filed more than 20 libel suits within the same jurisdiction and won them all. Surely, it can't be a matter of pure coincidence or sheer probability that a blatantly obvious fact highlighted by a one-time second-in-command at the Attorney General's Chambers could be missed by the public?</p>

              <h3 class="post-title entry-title">Singapore. Deputy Prime Minister Jayakumar says Singapore needs talent in International Law: Channelnewsasia</h3>
              <p>Ladies and Gentlemen,<br><br>According to Singapore's state controlled media <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_0" class="blsp-spelling-error">Channelnewsasiaof</span> May 13, 2008, former law minister in Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_1" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew's cabinet, S <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_2" class="blsp-spelling-error">Jayakumar</span> wants more Singapore lawyers to enter the field of international law;
              quite a daunting task since lawyers themselves are turning out to be an
              endangered species there.<br><br>In 1997 when the population was only
              3.5 million in the island, there were 3,400 lawyers, a very small
              number even for Singapore of the time, already a city engaged in
              international trade, banking and commerce. After 10 years, today, you
              will be <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_3" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">surprised</span> to know that the number of lawyers have not increased remaining still
              at 3,400 despite the fact that business has increased 10 times and so
              has the population to 4.5 million!<br><br>In fact the <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_4" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">Singapore</span> legal profession is declining from <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_5" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">reliable</span> intelligence indicating today of not more that 3,000 actually doing any <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_6" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">legal</span> work. Resignations, <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_7" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">retirements</span> and emigration has been the order of the day.<br><br><span class="blsp-spelling-corrected">Why</span> the malaise in the profession? It should be obvious. With Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_9" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew determined to use the law as a tool to <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_10" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">eliminate</span> <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_11" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">political</span> <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_12" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">opponents</span>, by suing them in defamation of <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_13" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">character</span> lawsuits and bankrupting them with the help of conniving compliant judges, the law has lost all respectability.<br><br>No self respecting human being would want to join the profession in <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_14" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">Singapore</span> <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_15" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">which</span> means joining a large firm and doing corporate work while willing lawyers are used to sue Lee's opponents, <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_16" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">while</span> everyday the <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_17" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">Constitution</span> is violated by arresting peaceful <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_18" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">protesters</span> and imprisoning them and while the <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_19" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">Internal</span> Security Act is used to detain and torture innocent citizens who challenged Lee's political <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_20" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">authority</span>.<br><br>So we should tell Mr. <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_21" class="blsp-spelling-error">Jayakumar</span> not to raise his hopes. If he cannot even increase the numbers in the <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_22" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">profession</span>, how can he increase the numbers in a selective field such as <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_23" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">international</span> law.<br><br><strong>The article also refers to how he "discovered" the new Minister for Law while he was a <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_24" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">professor</span> at the <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_25" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">Singapore</span> University. He says he noticed the young Indian student, recognized him
              as a good student and invited him to his office to invite him to enter
              politics and "serve".</strong> Coming from a state controlled media you probably
              guessed that is not the whole truth.<br><br>Perhaps it is more like this. Since the age of 10, this young man had realized that the only way to succeed in <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_27" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">Singapore</span> is to sell his <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_28" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">soul</span> to the devil, that is to serve his master Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_30" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew unconditionally; never mind the constitution, never mind the laws,
              never mind nothing. In other words, he had decided from an early age
              that he was going jump anytime and as high, and as many times as Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_31" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew wanted. Whenever Lee flicked his fingers. In other words, he was a
              sterling member of Hitlers Youth wing, sorry Lee's "Young PAP".<br><br>It is true that <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_32" class="blsp-spelling-error">Jayakumar</span> had <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_33" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">asked</span> him if he wanted to serve. <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_34" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">What</span> he meant, and what <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_35" class="blsp-spelling-error">Shanmugam</span> understood to mean, is of course, whether he was <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_36" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">prepared</span> to serve Lee, unconditionally; not serve the <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_37" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">country</span>.<br><br>So, there <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_38" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">you</span> have it.<br><br>My dear Mr. S <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_39" class="blsp-spelling-error">Jayakumar</span>. It is simply not going work. <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_40" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">Don't</span> raise your expectations.<br><br>If I am to give some advice to <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_41" class="blsp-spelling-error">Jayakumar</span>, it is this. If you want a <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_42" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">vibrant</span> legal profession, engaged in the country and in their work, then
              introduce democracy. Introduce the rule of law. Otherwise the
              profession will continue to <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_43" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">decline</span>, <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_44" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">Singaporeans</span> will emigrate and you will find only yourself and your chosen disciple <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_45" class="blsp-spelling-error">Shanmugam</span> left. In an English speaking western thinking country like Singapore,
              most people are uncomfortable to jump just becasue Lee wants to see it.<br><br>There may be some like this Shanmugam, but most would decline the invitation.<br><br>Thanks but no thanks.<br><br>Gopalan Nair</p>

              <p>With so much negative information related to the present Political Regime, where are their erstwhile defenders with their ever willing vigor to ''polish up the gloss on the rotten apple'' ?</p>
              <p>The various national prints will never publish the events that transpired even in an open court, and it takes a blog site to publicise the shocking efforts in ''fixing'' the system ''to fix'' their political challengers.</p>
              <p>Why will Judge Belinda Ang insist on holding the hearings in chambers ?</p>
              <p>Are the issues so ''private'' as claimed by the lawyer for the plaintiffs ?</p>
              <p>Is it so ''private'' to the extent that it will further damage their already self-inflicted bad reputation without any help from SDP ?</p>
              <p>It must be their moral conscience to interprete the SDP publication on the NKF issues to have impinge on their personal reputation, and make them believe that they are ''dishonest and unfit for political office''.</p>
              <p>If at all the SDP's publication was a hit at the entire PAP Government, and it should be the PAP taking legal actions against the SDP - not MM LKY and his son PM LHL.</p>
              <p>At the end of the day, this would have been POLITICS in any other democratic countries - but not in thin skin Singapore, where the politicians refused to allow their actions to be called as it is - ''a spade will always be a spade'' and ''a rose will always be a rose'' even if you attempt to call it by any other name.</p>
              <p>If the political truth hurts is it the attempt to bar the proceedings from getting any further publicity that will simply hit CSJ and his sister below the belt ?</p>
              <p>So much for the high standards of Singapore Law that the outgoing Law Minister has managed to have achieved - it is only by is own imagination.</p>
              <p>In reality it is ''one set of legal interpretation'' for getting Citizens to tow the political line, ''another set of legal interpretation'' for the commercial world for the sake of Global Publicity, and a ''final set of legal interpretation'' for the Political Elites that keep them above the Law.</p>
              <p>Sadly, it is only in a 'Totalitarian State' that allow this to happen.</p>
