            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by ShutterBug:</div><div class="quote_body">Yes, true you have a point.  In this regard, the gov should SERIOUSLY DO SOMETHING about the pathetic Polyclinics - they lack doctors. Why? Because it isn't worthwhile for doctors to work there. Why? Because our gov created such circumstances wherein doctors won't work in Polyclinics!!!</div></blockquote>What 'circumstances' are you talking about? The reason is money...you pay polyclinic doctors half as much as what private GPs are getting and expect them to work three times as hard. Only the stupid ones who cannot find a job anywhere else or cannot pay off the bond will stay...Why are they not paid more? Because Singaporeans like you will complain about medical costs rising. Why are they forced to work so hard? Because Singaporeans like you rant about long queues in polyclinics.<br><br><blockquote>As for smoking; why the HELL, did our gov come up with such a HALF-ASSED idea of dividing smokers from non-smokers at public food centers and coffee shops??? Half-assed solutions, will only yield half-assed results - if not more social problems - such as arguments and fights at food centers and coffee shops.</blockquote>Because non-smokers deserve the right not to be poisoned by carcinogens? Smokers have every right to kill themselves smoking at home, but why should we allow them to give our children cancer?<br><br><blockquote>I'd say total ban of smoking at coffee shops altogteher. No yellow box or whatever. Just no smoking and sale of ciggies. </blockquote>I support that too...but businesses will close. Coffee shop owners will lose money and customers. And if that happens, I will open a private smoking club that charges for the well-heeled smokers to dine and smoke.<br><br>By separating out smoking and non-smoking areas, Singapore is following examples in the West, trying to strike a balance between the rights of smokers and non-smokers.<br><br>I have a suggestion though: install sprinkers activated by smoke directly above non-smoking tables. If a smoker lights a cigarette in a non-smoking zone, the sprinkler comes on and extinguishes the light immediately. No argument...    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br></div>

If you are prepared to pay more taxes for a welfare state, do most Singaporeans agree?<br><br>Secondly, we will have to bring in even more foreigners to work or make our older citizens work longer, as the population ages. With increasing number of retirees who are not working but consuming services, a smaller tax base will have to pay more for increasing medical costs. You talk about the UK. The UK NHS is not viable....to approve the drug Herceptin for breast cancer patients, they had to axe drug funding for Alzheimer disease and myeloma....and already people are paying 25-40% tax.</div>

If the entire Singaporean population can take jobs overseas that pay better, what are you ranting about here? This is the global economy...if it is better for you to work somewhere else, go..<br><br>My guess is that you are ranting because you cannot compete with the foreigners and yet do not have a marketable skill that other countries might want. In that case, get off your bed and upgrade yourself <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br></div></blockquote>I can and some locals can, but majority don't have the means to work abroad. Re-read my posting to understand my pointer to population size differences.<br><br>I am helping locals by giving ONLY locals jobs in my company, and I'm saving whatever I can and when time is up, I am leaving this motel of a country. I am NOT against globalization, but I re-iterate that our gov should put in place a limit on the number of un-skilled foreigners coming in and filling up ordinary folks' jobs. Don't come and tell me ordinary folks should go abroad just to work as waiters/waitresses, etc. And shut your mindless babble about how they can we should be able to. Where they come from they have a choice to live the life they want, people here largely don't have any choice.<br><br>Problem with you, is that you GUESS and ASSUME everyone's status in here. I'm gainfully self-employed, and I rant on hehalf of those who are suffering because of our gov's thoughtlessness.<br><br></div>
