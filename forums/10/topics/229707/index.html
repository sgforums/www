These people  only cease to exist in your utopia, which will never exist in real life because no one's utopia will ever exist in reality.<br><br>All the "Shame and name" thingy you propose will only lead to loads of defamations and slandering lawsuits, lesson learnt from of MM, SM and PM. Besides, when profit in mind, I don't think that many owner (in terms of hawker center) would do anything to stop customers from smoking in their shop. I quote from the infamous 1993 Hong Kong drama "The Greed of Man", "Ethnics were put aside; Profits will be put in the center" (dao4 yi2 fang4 liang3 pang2; li4 zi4 bai3 zhong1 jian1)<br><br>Btw, they win my vote because they are holding my future. "If you are not with us, you are against us"<br><br>Anyway, back to the cigarette issue, the government can't ban cigarettes from coming into Singapore. We have already seen what Al Capone did when US banned alcoholic drinks.<br><br>(The co<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>ckest idea I ever thought of) The tariffs on cigarettes' sales should be scrap. Instead, the system as "pay more when you sell more" should be implemented. i.e, A certain standard of cigarette sales will be set. If wholesaler A sells more cigarette compared to that standard, he will be entitled to pay more tax or whatever expenses incurred. If A sells less cigarettes than that standard, he might need to pay less tax, or even no tax at all; Rather than pay (tax) as you sell.</div>

Besides, when profit in mind, I don't think that many owner (in terms of hawker center) would do anything to stop customers from smoking in their shop.

Instead, the system as "pay more when you sell more" should be implemented. i.e, A certain standard of cigarette sales will be set. If wholesaler A sells more cigarette compared to that standard, he will be entitled to pay more tax or whatever expenses incurred. If A sells less cigarettes than that standard, he might need to pay less tax, or even no tax at all; Rather than pay (tax) as you sell.</div></blockquote>Precisely, they are holding everyone's testes so to speak....<br>I shudder to think of future in their hands....<br><br></div>

I feel that the public does not give smokers the proper respect.<br>ItÂ’s true that treatment for smoking related illness is not cheap.<br>Let's punish smokers with a tax that does not directly benefit them. But why stop there? Let's also raise the alcohol tax for alcohol related diseases, impose a sugar tax and junk food tax to tackle obesity, tax those who are not a member of a gym, or who fail to see a doctor regularly to check their heath.. But, wait! We can do more. We can tax those with a genetic disposition for getting ill! When will the madness stop?!
