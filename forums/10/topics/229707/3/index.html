If you are healthy and do not use it, it does not go to the hospital or the government. Who do you mean by already paid? Putting money into your savings account does not mean you are paying the bank, can't you understand this simple logic?<br><br>The medisave is meant for your long term needs. Medical care is mostly required in your old age. If you use it up for one childbirth, for example, how are you going to pay for your medical needs when you are old? 30% co-payment is there to prevent abuse by unthinking Singaporeans who might splurge all their medisave funds on an A class bed in a private hospital for one delivery and have nothing left if that child needs subsequent hospitalisation care.<br><br>The safety net we have is the best we can afford. Nobody owes you a living and nobody owes you the best medical service available. The government's responsibility is to try to offer the best medical service WE CAN AFFORD. If you can afford better service, pay for it. The poor will get the best basic service the patient can afford to pay and the nation can afford to subsidize.

And for what in return?<br><br>If they don't owe us a living or ways to make a living for ourselves, we shouldn't owe them the votes and their living as well!!<br><br>I mean, if our gov increases Tax and make us top-up more in Medisave, we wouldn't mind if we receive what we paid for at the end of our working life. But no, that's not what we are getting now - we are expected to cough up more money even in our old age to pay for ever increasing medical and health care costs, at an age where most will not find employment. And so you may say our children can pay for us through their Medisave, but that would only mean depleting their Medisave and thus causing our children to pay more in cash! Isn't this "saftey net" an LPPL policy?<br><br>As far as many of us are aware, our gov is only interested in PROTECTING their own  system which churns out all their own incomes.  Now this, is the REALITY.<br><br>And if Medisave is such a perfect policy and medical and health care is so cheap as proclaimed by OM, why then is Mr Khaw revising Medisave coverage to include CAT scan and MRI for cancer patients, and private hospitalization as well???<br><br>It is as with anything from our gov, a half-assed solution to an age old problem.

Simple: Everyone wants cheap medicine/medical and yet you want Lots of professional help.   Who's going to foot the bill?  Do you suggest taxing the private doctors to subsidise and increase public doctors pay?<br><br>As for the smoking thing It's good/bad.  It's a start.  Singapore isnt a country with 100% camera coverage.  You cant ban cigarettes You will kill all those smokers right here right now.  Gov idea is to make life difficult for them  so less will pick up the habit in the future.  The problem with the idea is ENFORCEMENT just like every one of our "Fine/s" city.  Best way is to outsource to private companies where they have no "quotas" but have "performance records"  At least that way more Singaporeans will have jobs.</div>

Most of us cannot afford to be taxed anymore at this moment.  Then what % do you want us to pay? 10/20?  I feel that you will end up paying the same amount but it will become 20% cause the cost increase to pay doctors better.<br><br>Dont forget, not everyone gets sick all the time.
