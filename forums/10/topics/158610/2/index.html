Be it via non-intrusive methods such as MSN chatting or even regular face-to-face weekly informal "learning/sharing" sessions.<br><br>i'd love to hear from fellow forumites about my above proposition. conceptualized only very recently. what do you think?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It really depends on what kind of subjects you are talking about man. If you are talking bout stuff like communication and business courses, maybe having experience practical work helps. but then again such courses usually need u to prep up on theory work b4 you are good enuff to do the practical.<br><br>for engineering and science subjects, all the more you need theory from basic to advance.... so it is for maths, econs, literature subjects...<br><br>come on, there's a reason why ppl spend so much to go to school.<br><br>what u are talking about here is street smart... I feel street smart is sometimes based on ur upbringing, the culture and social expectations of you. Some ppl are just not meant to be very street smart, while some excel in life through street smart.<br><br>sometimes ppl tend to deface the value of education esp during bad economic times and thinking street smart is the way to go. That is simply not true... in the world we are living in today, all the more u need a book education. and singaporeans are not getting enuff. i mean u look at the way americans work, do you know their military commissioned officers if im not wrong all have to be graduates? in singapore, we are still having regular officers who are poly educated. and for their lawyers and doctors, they get their law and med degrees as a second degree.. meaning they study an undergraduate degree like econs, or science, and then go on the graduate school for their post grad med and law degree? while we singaporeans are doing med and law as an undergrad degree. i understand we have to do it that way due to many reasons. what i meant is , book education is of great importance. practical work gets things done.. but u need to be learn some theory first to really get you anywhere</div>

Invest in bonds, stock market, start company .. many students are doing that and on their own. The university facilitates by allowing societies like entrepreneurship clubs to exist. Even the faculty organises talks that invite industry people to share their experience with students. Like I mentioned,  there are also business plan competitions where there are opportunities for you to get funding.<br><br>About interacting with each other . . I dunno. I see not much point, pardon me, in seeing how my HR friends work, the marketing dept pple work, the lawyers work, if I'm working in a company.

            <div class='col-md body'>True, the emphasis need to be on a more practical oriented delivery.  However, the problem with existing institutional practice is the over emphasis of the how to skill and not on the why.  Having grads who know how to without knowing why might not be a good thing in the long term.  It somewhat reflects the society in that it is slowly becoming more apathetic.  IMHO.</div>

Or get an overseas IA.
