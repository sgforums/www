              <p>Even our world-class airport is not spared:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">I am very disappointed with the services provided at the <span>Singapore</span> <span>airport</span> staff. I am from India, Delhi, but right now living in Manila, Philippines with my husband. I gave birth on 11 April 2007 to a baby girl and my mothers, Mrs. Rekha Gopalani from India planned to visit me in last Sept. (2007). Since it was her first trip out of India I was making sure that everything goes right and confirming everything with the embassy, but unfortunately she had such unpleasant <span>experience</span> with your staff at <span>Singapore</span> <span>airport</span> that she doesn't want to travel anymore. We booked our tickets through internet at makemytrip.com, this website provides you with the cheapest fair available, she was traveling through Indian airlines from India to <span>Singapore</span> <span>Singapore</span> to manila was through Tiger Airways. She only had to transit from terminal 1 to budget <span>airport</span>. Since there was no information provided by our travel agent n even your embassy, we were not aware that we need visa to transit. So she didn't had Transit visa, but your staff could help her by providing her with the correct information and spoke to her nicely and may be issue her a ticket through <span>Singapore</span> airlines from same terminal, but she was treated so badly and was given orders to be deported to India, we also called like 100 times and  tried to explain it to the duty officer n other staff there, but they refused to cooperate,  however in the end after keeping her for 20 hrs, when another duty officer came, he understood and decided to give her the visa from the port (however I don't understand how come another officer could give her the visa?), anyways since they took so long to decide, she already missed her connecting flight, as told by one of the staffs at <span>airport</span> we booked another budget ticket, which also went to waste because they refused to take her in their flight since she had deportation order...even though it was by mistake, any ways finally it was suggested by my mother, Mrs Rekha Goplalani, that she was ready to buy the ticket from the same <span>airport</span> at the same time but couldn't before because of the insensible staff ignorance, finally she bought ticket for SQ airlines and arrived manila next day. So basically we spent trice the price and on top of that we had to pay for the inconvenience provided by your insensible staff.<br> I have never expected this from SQ <span>airport</span>, used to hear that u provide the best services to your passengers...even thought if they are there for transit. However the fact is that my mother dint even had unpleasant <span>experience</span> but we lost so much money also. Would like to know if you can take any action regarding this matter, then only I would like to bring the officer's names to your attention. </span></p>

              <p class="intro"><strong>THE
              Civil Aviation Safety Authority is investigating an air traffic control
              report that a US Learjet came within 60 seconds of a possible collision
              with a Jetstar Airbus because of confusion about uncontrolled airspace...</strong></p>
              <p>An Electronic Safety Incident Report of the incident, written by the
              air traffic controller on duty and obtained by The Australian, states
              the incident occurred last Saturday after a section of airspace on the
              Melbourne to Sydney route suddenly became unmonitored at 7.30am due to
              an <span style="color: #ff0000;">air traffic control staff shortage. </span></p>
              <p>A shortage of controllers has increasingly forced large chunks of
              Australian skies to be left unmonitored in recent months, forcing
              pilots to rely on themselves and other pilots to avoid collisions.</p>
              <p>The ESIR indicated the declaring of uncontrolled airspace on Saturday caused confusion among pilots of several aircraft.</p>
              <p>The worst of these was when the pilot of an American-registered
              Learjet flying from Wollongong in NSW to Melbourne baulked at climbing
              up into uncontrolled airspace despite being cleared to do so. The
              report says the pilot failed to climb "apparently due to uncertainty
              with proximity traffic" in uncontrolled airspace....</p>
              </blockquote><blockquote>
              <p>Mr Mason said yesterday; "Aeroplanes passing 15 miles apart may seem
              like a lot ... but they are travelling so fast that in some scenarios
              there can be less than 60 seconds to react and avoid an accident. This
              incident is a clear example that the current system related to
              (uncontrolled airspace) has an unacceptable safety level." ..</p>

              <p>Do u think it is a problem?Do u think I am anti--Oz by posting this news?</p>
              <p>the australian is a main stream newspaper selling in all major cities,</p>
              <p>not a unknown newspaper just selling in small town.</p>
              <p>Besides,do u know traffic controlling  in Oz is outsourced to a private company.</p>
              <p>The Australian take the risk of being sued.</p>

              <p><span>SINGAPORE: An airport security lapse has raised further concerns about complacency and what has been done to strengthen procedures. <br><br>The passport mix-up - which allowed a man to fly out of the country using his son's passport – is the third security breach in six months. <br><br>Mr Ang Heng Soon managed to check in for a Tiger Airways flight after mistakenly using his son's passport. <br><br>The mistake was not spotted in spite of four levels of checks, enabling him to board his flight to Vietnam. He came back later after spotting his own error. <br><br>"This is yet another incident of human error, but it's within the same home team, and we've seen a build-up of various incidents within various departments and this is troubling," MP Indranee Rajah said. <br><br>"It's really two things, as I see it - one, the complacency that has entered into the day-to-day routine. And two, the sense of a lack of danger that if something can go wrong, it will," she added. <br><br>The MP intends to raise this and other wider security concerns in Parliament. </span></p>

              <p>The aircraft, flight SQ286 to Singapore, was forced to circle the airport on March 12 for about 20 minutes before making an emergency landing. None of the 369 passengers, 17 cabin crew, or three pilots was injured in the accident, but the tail of the plane was extensively damaged.</p>
              <p>A Transport Accident Investigation Commission report, issued yesterday, says the aircraft's three pilots were almost completely to blame for the strike, which occurred when the captain tried to take off at too slow a speed.</p>
              <p>It says the incident was the result of the first officer mistakenly entering an aircraft weight figure 100 tonnes lighter than that of the aircraft into his take-off speed calculations.</p>
              <p>The captain then failed to pick up the error when he checked the calculation, the second officer did not check it and all three pilots failed to notice the difference between their own calculation and that of the flight management computer.</p>
              <p>As a result, the captain "rotated" the plane to a takeoff angle at 123 knots (221km/h) rather than the correct 151 knots (272km/h).</p>
              <p>With the plane failing to take off, it tilted 4 degrees more than normal, resulting in its tail striking the runway and dragging for 490m.</p>
              <p><em>Singapore Airlines</em> said yesterday that it accepted the report's findings in full and had demoted the captain.</p>
              <p>"The safety recommendations of the TAIC to SIA have been, or are being, implemented in full," said the carrier's public relations manager, Stephen Forshaw.</p>
              <p>All three pilots had been reprimanded over the incident.</p>
              <p>The captain was demoted and had since left the airline. The first officer was severely reprimanded and the third officer, who played no active part in the take-off, was "reminded of his obligations".</p>
