What is more important would be getting a good tactical information distribution system such that a composite air-picture can be built and be received by all combatants, surface or air (something like the US Navy's soon to be introduced Cooperative Engagement Capability, now THAT's something to drool about!!)<br></div>

Had RSAF gone with the Link-16 update, they could essentially pass secure data to the Vipers. However, RSAF have gone to purchase an Israeli made (was it IAI or Rafael) secure link, and in the process pissed the Americans/Pentagon who gone through great length to get the sales approved in the congress.<br><br>Anyway, theortically, it is possible to upgrade the Hawkeyes (provide ST and DSO has the source code) to modify the comm system, and with the secure links send radar information to the Vipers and any future Gen 4 fighters. They should be able to send their BVR missiles on their way without having to turn on their radars.<br><br>Raptors are specifically built with this technology. In fact, the Raptors are supposed to be fighting in the format where the wingman will be some 20 miles or more behind the leader.  The wingman radar will do the scanning and pass target information to the leader who would fire the BVR.  The Raptors can also send target informtion sent from AWACS/AEW to their BVR weapons.<br><br></div>

The crews of the CG were nice enough to show us some of the "targets" they plotted while I was on board, and they briefed us extensively on the capabilities of the system, and it was impressive enough considering that most of the systems was turned off during my visit. Have to agree though that it is not necessary in Singapore context, as we are mostly defending local sea lanes and not looking for blue water capabilities. Hawkeyes with over-the-horizon targetting capabilities for Harpoons and AEW should be more than enough, esp that the MPAs habe the Harpoon targetting capability themselves.</div>

As for exocets launched from their ships.... I really do believe the BARAK missile with the radar system on our corvettes can handle the threat.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think we have to balance the risk of a mass saturation anti-ship missile attack against the prohibitive cost of getting a weapon system capable of putting up a significant amount of vampires in the air. If we achieve even air superiority in the air, coupled with a early strike against the enemys naval assets, the risk could be reduced to a point where that threat is virtually non-existent.<br><br>Just my $0.02; but I do feel that as far as naval capabilities go, the purchase of the frigates + new naval helos, and if we do get more advanced C3 systems for the RSN, it would be enough to face any regional threats that might develop, China notwithstanding...<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I feel that a balance between a slightly downgraded multiple component Aegis battle management system, together with a better C3I, would be able to negate any possible naval threats alone.  Thus freeing the RSAF for other more demanding missions such as SEAD.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>one thing i feel necessary to point out for the Sunburn is that it is a Mach 3 capable missile...in terms of the range as faced in littoral waters, that is as good as an instant hit...granted that it is a very big and bulky missile and overkill to hit anything smaller than a frigate...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yea, like what I said before, Sunburn would have been a massive overkill.  In anycase, most of the guys here feel that our Hawkeyes are sufficient. For me, I just feel it would be better having another ace in the hole.<br><br>BTw, the Aegis system was supposedly approved for sales, but according to the page I saw that time, it never commented of the governments ever considered buying them seriously.</div>
