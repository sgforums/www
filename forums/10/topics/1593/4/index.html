            <div class='col-md body'>Hmmm, not so much a matter of range, but a matter of scanning the huge amount of airspace. They can only scan a very small portion of the airspace at one time, thus the use of AWACS. The APG-68 has pretty good range, IIRC. (of course, cannot compare to the range of AWACS platforms lah)</div>

What is interesting though is that USAF are developing aircraft radars (such as the ones in Raptors to scan a wider volume of sky at any one time).

            <div class='col-md body'>Oh yah, the latest news fron China is that the J-10 is entering production, and will soon enter service. Go to any chinese military forum, they are in a frenzy over this. I've been visiting a chinese military info website recently, <a href="http://www.999junshi.com," rel="nofollow">www.999junshi.com,</a>  and I realised that most chinese military enthusiasts are pretty blinded by nationalism. I mean, look at some of their essays, claiming that their tanks have better firepower than the Abrams(!), that  they have a stealth helicopter, the WZ-10(!?), pic of which I've seen, and by god, I think the Supercobra looks much more stealthy...and much more BS. Really, I also feel a little ashamed for them. Come-on, nobody said they wont be a military power 1 day, but that day's at least 10 to 20 years away....<br>Anyway, back from my rambling, the J-10 seems to be the most capabable plane produced by China. Chinese enthusiasts tout that its more capable than the F-16 Block 50(yeah, right...), but others estimate its performance to be about that of the F-16 Block 30, which is still pretty damned good, for them. BTW, the plane looks pretty good too.<br><br>[This message has been edited by YourFather (edited 08 February 2002).]</div>

Most of them think their stuff is really top of the line. while western analysts think they're rubbish, for example the JH-7(FBC-1) maritime strike aircaft has been likened to F-4 technology.

            <div class='col-md body'>Network-centric? Ala CEC? nah, too axe. But Isreali datalinks are already in use in our air-force, and I wonder if the Navy has such a system for its Naval assets. (like sharing info between the Fokkers and the ships?)<br>As for AAW for the ships, I say money can be better spent elsewhere. We already operate under the best air-cover in the region, no need for further redundancy. I would rather money be spent to further ASW capabilities, as well as anti-mine capabilities.</div>

The MPVs plus the frigates and 9-12 helos which we're looking for would be more than enough to take care of regional sub threats.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well nobody's perfect with numbers, if u know what I mean.  Intelligence agencies aren't GOD.  I can sympathize them if they decide to err on the higher numbers than on the lower numbers.<br><br>Simple logic that these numbers will either increase, or stay the same.  Since they don't know the actual numbers at the time they are doing their report, it would be perfectly logical if they up the numbers a little.<br><br>I'm not tryin to diss you guys off or anything.  Its just that, you can't expect the 100% accurate results from these intelligence firms/companies.  Only those working for their respective military would have a clue of what the numbers are really like. =)</div>
