The most memorable moments when I went inside a carrier (I believe it was Kitty Hawk) CIC, and also the CIC of an AGEIS cruiser (Bunker Hill). Cool man. I was totally impressed. RSN never allowed such visits into the CIC. I often wonder what the CIC of the MCV looks like...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>

Have the Spike sight marry onto the top of the turret integrating with the commander's periscope, then we've got something like the M2 Bradley.<br><br><strong> </strong><blockquote><strong><br>In "Command n Conquer" yeah, perhaps 50 bionix/similar vehicle can take out medium/heavy tanks with its 25mm gun.

But then again, I am talking a lot...<br></div>

It will not cause the profile to be raised. If you look the pictures of the latest gen LAV25, they also now carry TOW launchers at the side of the turret, one missile on each side. The guidance sight has to be on top though, it would have to be somewhat like the gunner's sight. The control joystick and firing trigger will be embedded inside the turret, somewhere the VC can easily reach while aiming the "crosshair" at the target.<br><br></div>

I'm sure that are too brass in the SAF pissing their pants if they haven't got an answer to the T91. I'm sure something is in the pipeline. It is just not public domain yet. AFAIK there will be a new light tank to replace the SM1. As for MBT, I think they have been looking at acquiring some secondhand ones including AMX-30, M-60A3, etc.<br><br>It still stands that I hope when it comes down to getting a secondhand MBT, SAF will choose Leopard 1A5. Otherwise, they should seriously look at the Swedish CV40-120mm tank...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>
