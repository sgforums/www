            <div class='col-md body'>About the LAV-25, the experience was related by the Australian Military in East Timor.  Even the USMC had encountered problems where the vehicle actually toppled.  In anycase, the LAV's armor is seriously inadequate, (30mm steel. An 5.56 rounds can plow holes in that thing under 30 meters.)  The LAVs have so far got stuck in Mud, washed off slippery roads and turned turtle, stuck in loose sand, and past experience has proven LAVs to be sitting ducks.<br><a href="http://www.geocities.com/lavdanger/" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/lavdanger/</a><br><br>This website tells a lot of unseen facts about the LAV.

            <div class='col-md body'>The AV81 looks more impressive than other vehicles of its class (4x4). It sure does look more stable than the LAV too!  Other than that, wheels can be punctured, and like its family of vehicles, Limited to roads.  Of course, I doubt SAF would use the vehicle on its own as an independent element..... I wonder how much armor that thing has.</div>

How soon is soon? 5 yrs? 10? Near impossible. They'll face fiscal insolvency if they build up their capabilities THAT quickly... Anything over 10 is not very soon to me.<br><br>Also, assuming that the MAF is upgrading its weapons to counter SAF forward defence capabilities, it should be considered also that the SAF is moving along as well... nobody is playing the hare in a race with the turtle.<br><br>Thailand on the other hand, does seem rather quiet of late... Aircraft carrier's still in dry dock and no flashy arms purchases... anyone read anything? Economic downturn must've hit them really hard.</div>

Its hard for me to be objective here but I'll try.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>I've corresponded with aviation enthusiasts all over the world, some of them work in their respective air forces, though not necessarily as pilots. They've either had first hand experience, or heard from colleagues with first hand experience of "tangling" with RSAF pilots at exercises like Red flag, Maple Flag, Churinga etc. The consensus I hear is that the RSAF guys are a solid, professional bunch who know what they're doing and good at their job. I don't have specifics and I don't know if they're just being courteous knowing I'm from Singapore, but I'd like to think they're being truthful!<br><br>I don't know much about Malaysian pilots, but heres a quote on another forum:<br><br>==========<br>As one australian fighter pilot i have met said "If you shot down a malay in mock combat he wasn't there and never got shot down. If a singaporean got shot down they want to know how they got shot down so they could get better. thats a sign of an air force that beleives they will go to war and really want to win!"</div>

Its expected that they would smarten up sooner or later and buy stuff they need instead of stuff that looks good.

            <div class='col-md body'>I thought I read somewhere we got tons of A4 hulls, all second hand bought from Israel, Jordan and ex-US-navy mothballs counting at least 130 or more. So won't be surpise we have at least a 100 of them still in service. For F5E, besides the first few batches bought new from Northrop, also bought some 2nd hand Jordan and receive a quite a couple of them Taiwan. Also heard we got so much F-5E spare parts (kiasu syndrome) that the RSAF assemble 5 RF-5Es just from these parts alone.</div>
