What a waste. If its Russia who found a counter to F117, its ok, but its CHINA!!!!!! CHINA sucks!!!! I just don't understand man.... WHY do they have to take back what they had lost last time??? TIBET, TAIWAN..... see how they treat the DALAI LAMA and Tibetians, 1940s, they force the Nationalist out and now, they claim that Taiwan is part of them!!! SHIT!!!! See how arrogant they are, so they think they are powerful, conducting exercises at that don't know what island. Actually, Taiwan is fighting a losing battle on the ground and sea, and maybe even the air as the air is going to be used to support ground and sea... i see this ssiiue as big bullies " DA CHI SIAO" in chinese.

            <div class='col-md body'>China has a long 5000 year history. It was bullied by the league of nations.  Western countries simply capitalised on them.  Of course, it was their system of government that was left to blame. Lack of modernization, corruption and on and on. Right now, it is well on its way to become a regional power, it seeks to reassert control over land and territory it once lost to the western alliance as well those lost in its revolution.  Technically, Taiwan IS a part of China, unless Taiwan declares independence.  My point of view is that, China will not back off certain issues or soften its stance for the following reasons, 1. China Does not want to appear weak and easily persuaded.  Please remember, China in its history was "persuaded" or rather forced to give up partial control of its territory in its history.<br>2. It regards Taiwan as soveriegn territory as its right in its own "backyard."  Just as how the USA regards the carribean as a national interest. It must strive to maintain a friendly Taiwan in fear of Taiwan to be used as a base for "unfriendly" actions.<br>3. If Taiwan was to declare independence, other dissenting territories might do the same, hence leading to the break up of several other territories like Tibet.<br><br>As for the Stealth issue, it would not be easy using handphones to detect "stealthed" ships.  Why it works against stealth aircraft is becos the planes are in the air, and the phones are on the ground.  The waves therefore hit n rebound off the broad underside of a stealthy fighter or bomber.  But whether it will work anot, is a different story.<br><br>Stealthed frigates, would be on the sea. And in order to catch it on its broadest side, the phone array would have to be in the air.  Flying phones... hmmm...  Probably a couple dumbass passengers on an over-loaded 747.</div>

Even in today's modern submarine like the U.S Navy Sea Wolf Class attack sub and the Ohio class?

            <div class='col-md body'>All US submarines have a floating wire communications system.  And can afford to communicate more often.  In the past, they had to stick their coms antannae above the water, catch the message rebounding off the satellite, then dive.  While the stupid stick is above the surface, and the submarine is moving too fast, it will generate a "Feather" which is a trail of water slush visible  from the surface.  (kinda like jaws when the fins are above the water).<br><br>But the floating wire system eliminates that, the submarine will stay at a safe depth, maybe around 60ft, and unreel its communications wire and let it float up. It will generate less disturbance on the water surface and accomplishes the job of communication.</div>
