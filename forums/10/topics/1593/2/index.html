I believe that the Aegis will serve as a complementary battle manager to our current ground based defense.

Costs for singapore is not a problem, as long as a the threats are there.  The Lafayette frigate will merely be a sub component to the RSN's naval surface to air net.  My analysis is that, there will be further vessels, as well as modifications that will allow an interlinked surface task force to run a singular aegis shield over it.<br><br>I disagree with the last point that the RSN does not face threats from ASMs.  Anti Ship missile technology is perhaps one of the most proliferated technology now.  The Chinese have acquired Sunburn missiles, Indonesians have more exocets now just to name a few.  Missile threats are very real especially in this particular region.<br></div>
