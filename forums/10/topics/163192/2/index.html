You most likely have never even met any of them or worked with the stat boards and ministries.<br><br>I am a frontline man for many years and I meet with people of every sector and I can tell you that the cream of Singapore do work for the govt. The private sector has been mismanaged by second rate Singaporeans, thats why very few listed companies make it big regionally.<br><br>If Robert truly wants to help Singapore, he shld focus his attention not on whining but get off his butt and start to open his eyes, work hard and smart, get out there and create jobs. </span><br><br>i have been working with a bunch of scholars for years, and frankly i dont agree to what you have to say. most of the career path are actually plan in advance and most of them are arrogant bunch with no truth qualities in my humble opinion to be proud of.  after i left. i learn much more from the so call second rated private sector than i had the opportunity in years of service in givt sector.  and one must never forget these so call second rated citizens in private sector in your opinion are paying majority of these civil servants salary, bonus, incentives and whatever perks they are enjoying. private sector are always the first wave to weather any economic crisis and govt sector are often mildly hit and first to recover to re-enjoy their perks on the slightess sign of economic recovery.<br><br>sorry iam bad in my english vocab but i do know, the only difference when one can make a change in current system is through your vote in coming election. re-elect some MP that are good because they dare to voice for the ppl in parliament but most just sit quietly inside parliament with no intention to challenge minister during parliamentary debate.<br></div>
