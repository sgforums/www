            <div class='col-md body'>Citizens probably gave up trying to do anything long ago due to a sense of futility.<br><br>They may know what the government has been doing in double charging or triple charging on lands and vehicles are wrong and anti-entrepreneurship or anti-business but they feel that they cannot do anything and they just keep quiet and let them do as they like.<br><br>They may know that there are many creative accounting in pushing up HDB prices or medical charges and that the government is only keeping to their past policies for self-preservation rather than caring about competitiveness or survival of the masses.<br><br>But people will not do anything and they might just gave up trying and continue to vote for all the MPs even if the MP fail to raise issues or problems about wrong policies or issue of high costs in parliament.<br><br>It is now beyond Apathy or ignorance.

            <div class='col-md body'>For many years now our leaders have been trying out many types of scholars and all the so-called high flyers election after election. A number of them were quietly without showing the reasons why they could not meet the expectation.<br><br>So the so-called meritocracy or scholars do not make matter. At the end it is a matter of finding effective people and not just people with certain high academic qualifications. But effective people do not agree with the leaders' past policies easily and they tend to have their own rationale and logics and abilities. So effective people might be dropped and miss the chance to serve the country due to self-preservation instinct of the leaders themselves.<br><br>If our meritocracy system cannot make the difference, and so far have not thrown up any capable ministers who could succeed in upgrading our economy to value-adding technology economy, why do we still want to emphasise on what doesn't work in practice.<br><br>In the absence of such entrepreneurship in our government that can upgrade our economic structure the only way forward seems to be to stick to past narrow track-minded policies which are mostly anti-entrepreneurship and anti-business system of running the government. The only way is to play safe then and not change might incur risk to status quo. The better reason not to change is to show that the original leadership or meritocracy formula has been successful.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Robert, i admire your passion in pushing for changes, my passion has run out. My conclusion about politics is that only power and representation matters and makes changes - the only way is the ballot box. Iif the ballot box is rendered useless by the expanding GRC strategy, then i be an apathetic Singaporean who flees Singapore at the slightest tremor.<br><br>I think there are a significant amount of people who are dissatisfied, but have given up discussing on internet. Discussion does not influence government policies, only power and representation does. We need tp elect people who can represent our views. In the first remaking of Singapore, how many suggestions from the Committee were taken? Close to nil<br><br>Even polices like changing school ranking that are obviously flawed were rejected by these bureaucrats. They just want to save their faces. (although changes was implemented later)<br><br>What are the chances of a power change?<br><br>If you visit http://www.singapore-elections.com/, the change from Single wards in 1984 to the current big GRC system is biased towards the incumbent party . Candidates can always piggy back on a few heavyweights (like MM LEE or SM goh) to win a large number of seats. With complete control over the media, whose odds are better? I wouldnÂ’t be surprised if several Internet forums about the Singapore are indirectly owned by the government and is used to silence critics in less overt ways, this one included.<br><br>I have talked to some  people around me. There are some who like and support government, especially the older generation who have benefited from the early PAP goverment during the boom years. The younger students are more critical of the goverment because of flawed-elitist polices  that deny children with sports talent but not academic results from entering sports school. Imagine Fandi Ahmad cannot qualify for sports school! What a silly policy!Their argument was there was not enough money to open new class for the normal students and yet they spend billions on lavish office buildings<br><br>The policy was was changed but i think it is because of the coming election. After they have won the election, expect more flawed-elitist polices. I have read in the papers that there are 20% of older Singaporeans earning $1200 or less, and their standard of living has been falling due the economic problems. In my opinion, this coming election could be one of the worst for PAP in history but they may still win the majority.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It is not about "Robert" or my business that I have posted about this problem. I cannot change anything. I do not represent the average joe. I agree that we cannot make the government accept their shortcomings and even if the government change it will be very slow and unnoticeable like what has happened to the streaming of students into EM1, 2 and 3. Even If we have face to face exchange with MPs. ministers or some forumers from grass root or MPs like Salman (who after initial denial has admitted he is from the grass root) it will not do any good. It will not be of any use for Salman to try to convert us to his pro-government stance as what is wrong is wrong and cannot be made right just because of his posts or calling forumers whiners. May be like what someone here has posted the only change is through the ballot box.<br><br>This thread is about whether at this stage after what the government has done to the economy whether there is still a chance for citizens to overcome all odds and obstacles to the business environment by the government's GLCs and what-nots by adopting some citizen-self-help and self-reliant approach. For now the current conditions are heavily stacked against average citizens turning to doing business because the conditions are extremely negative in our case.<br><br>I do hope that the government will not have to be so negative by sending so many "Salmans" here to check our views and will instead be more proactive and not be so carried away like Salman to post and preserve the past unworkable policies. If past policies cause all such problems as posted then the problems must be understood and relevant changes made the sooner the better.<br><br>Salman ought to grow up in his political maturity and be more objective about my posts. If citizens do not speak up the government will continue to assume many excuses about citizens and lecture them for having no view. Government should know that when citizens begin to write and give their views and they should not go and try to stop them and call them whiners or all kinds of names like Salman is calling them. In other words Salman will not help the cause only worsen the situation of disaffection as posted by Dr. Catherine Lim now featured in the new film.</div>
