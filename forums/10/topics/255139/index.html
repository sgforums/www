            <div class='col-md body'>With the current population as it is, hospitals are already hard put to room patients. What will happen, when we reach 6 million?<br><br>They can acknowledge that this is due to a higher than normal cases of infectious deseases, but hwy do you think this is so? Take a look at how crowded our MRT is during peak hours, and you can have a good idea what is causing a higher cases of infections....<br><br>========================================<br><strong>Hospitals running out of room<br>By Tan Hui Leng, TODAY | Posted: 18 May 2007 0758 hrs </strong><br><br>SINGAPORE: A spike in infectious disease cases and other factors have pushed occupancy rates up at hospitals here Â— resulting in patients in C- and B2-class wards engaged in a game of musical chairs or, in this case, beds.<br><br>From putting orthopaedic patients in psychiatric wards, to giving C-class patients free upgrades, the healthcare institutions are trying more than ever to cope with the burgeoning patient load.<br><br>The National University Hospital (NUH), for one, is "filled to the brim", one doctor told TODAY. "We have been told to hold off elective day surgeries and every day, we're urged to discharge patients quickly if they are fit enough to go home," he said.<br><br>The NUH said occupancy rates had hit 90 to 95 per cent in the last three weeks. Singapore General Hospital has seen 89- to 97-per-cent bed occupancy over the past two weeks.<br><br>Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH), meanwhile, has hovered at between 88- and 93-per-cent occupancy this year. The hospital's former chief operating officer Christopher Tay explained: "At every hospital, there is a trigger point for bed occupancy which averages 80 per cent across different departments.<br><br>"When these points are hit, the bed management units at hospitals will tell doctors to 'actively discharge' patients."<br><br>However, doctors would only persuade patients who are truly fit enough to go home, assured Mr Tay.<br><br>"Many patients are actually fit to go home but remain due to social reasons such as not having a carer at home. If the trigger point has not been met, doctors usually give such patients the benefit of the doubt. But if they occupy a bed when a patient who is truly ill needs it, then they need to be persuaded to be discharged."<br><br>With the heavily subsidised C-class wards often full, incoming patients have to be directed to wards for other specialities or upgraded to higher-class wards. But they continue to enjoy the 80-per-cent subsidy on their ward charges.<br><br>While hospitals can just about cope with the normal overflow, the situation is compounded seasonally. Currently, the virus du jour is the flu, with upper respiratory tract infections at polyclinics up 40 per cent last week over the same period last year.<br><br>Also in the air are dengue fever, chicken pox, and hand, foot and mouth disease, with a spike in cases. So it is no surprise if, in general, the 65-per-cent subsidised B2 class wards are full as well, said Mr Tay.<br><br>"It's very busy, there just seems to be many more sick people around," a Changi General Hospital doctor told Today.<br><br>The usually calm 775-bed hospital in Simei has had patients fill beds in wards not designated for their conditions, as public hospitals only transfer patients to another hospital as a last resort.<br><br>As C-class wards are perpetually in high demand, no adequate solution seems to be in sight, even as the unpopular move that is means-testing has been mooted. And simply increasing the number of such beds may not be the good idea it seems.<br><br>Said Mr Tay: "We put in an extra C-class ward when I was at TTSH and it was quickly filled up; it's a bottomless pit."<br><br>- TODAY/so<br></div>
