We think that will better meet our objectives than an IPO (initial public offering). At the moment, we are not inclined to retain any residual stake in any of the gencos, so a trade sale would meet that objective better."<br><br>But Temasek is not ruling out other options, such as selling shares through an IPO for the other two gencos.<br><br>Temasek has declined to give a dollar value for the gencos, but reports have estimated that each company could fetch between S$2 billion and S$3 billion.<br><br>The long-awaited sale is in line with the government's aim to liberalise the electricity market in Singapore.<br><br>To increase competition, there will be no restrictions on foreign ownership of the gencos.<br><br>Temasek said this change in ownership is unlikely to have an impact on electricity prices.<br><br>Mr Wong said: "Changing ownership by itself is not expected to have any impact on consumers because they will continue to be served by SP services, which will continue to buy from the wholesale market and enjoy the benefit of competition among these gencos."<br><br>Temasek said it is an optimal time to sell because of favourable market conditions and the huge demand for electricity.<br><br>Moreover, there is also a gas regulation framework in place to ensure there is a steady and orderly supply of gas and power.<br></div>
