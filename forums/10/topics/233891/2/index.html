Even USA will not be counted as democractic according to your statement, in fact, no country is. So back to the original question, why vote for him when you hate him so much?

This <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_dictatorship" rel="nofollow">wikipedia article</a> seems to state otherwise. Firstly, the political power resides with the military, not the people. It is also quoted that "Although there are exceptions, military regimes usually have little respect for human rights and use whatever means necessary to silence political opponents. A military regime is also rarely willing to leave power unless forced to by popular revolt, whether active or imminent."<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by ChineseThai:</div><div class="quote_body">S'Pore government was behind the 1992 coup!

            <div class='col-md body'>People in Thailand seem to have a short memory about what happened over 60 years ago which unfortunately left a very huge mark on the military.<br><br>Back 60 years over ago, the King was a powerless person and he abdicated because he was opposed to the junta's policies then. I think his successor was found shot thereafter possibly with Junta involvement.<br><br>The military Govt sided with the Japanese and later on even invaded some neighbouring country. After WWII, the Junta collapsed and was replaced by a civilian administration, only to have the civilian administration collapsing and the head of the last junta making another bid for power.<br><br>Decades later, people do not approve of juntas in general, though it seems that there are segments of shortsightedness in the population, but the fact of the matter is that Thailand's military has never respected the civilian adminstration, and it was only under the current king that they even bothered to respect the king. The current king's masterstroke in protecting the monarchy was to gain the respect and trust of the country side people etc. Else, you'd likely have another king with a bullet in the head.<br><br>Edit: It was the current king's brother who had a bullet in the head which was why the current king was king in the first place. The Thais naturally didn't want to investigate any further....</div>

An interim government under Arnand was appointed but in 1992, Suchinda became the prime minister and wanted an amendment to the clause in constitution for him to remain as prime minister until the parliament was dissolved. That sparked massive protest under Chamlong, and later the infamous Bloody May in Thai history, when the military fired at students and demonstrators resulting in don't know how many deaths. Thousands were arrested, tortured and left to die. But finally with the intervention of the King, Suchinda resigned but the military constitutions continued until 1997.<br><br>Tell me, in 1992, Suchinda was the prime minister, who was the coup leader? Chamlong? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"> Who are the blood suckers???<br><br>In 2006, the Thai military has done it again as they did in 1991, they ousted a demoncratically elected government and a military commander took over as prime minister. Then what?  Can the Thai people now make any changes through demoncratic process or would they need to go on the street to oust the military? be careful, the military is still using M16.<br><br>The transition from military to civilian rule in Thailand since 1973 has been difficult and sometimes bloody with several reversals along the way. Is this yet another reversals? It seems that demonizing the previous government would be a good and innovative means to divert the attention of the people from the ugly past.<br><br>Don't pull in Singapore unless you have the evidence!!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sometimes, we have to admit that our government asked for it. In Thailand's case, it is a well-known fact that the ShinCorp affair was one of the main reason why the coup took place.<br><br>Therefore the Singapore government made a very serious mistake when it decided to receive Thaksin. No matter the reason, but it was a bad move because it is insensitive, and the new government in Thailand (which also happened to be a military government which isn't great news) might have seen it as a provocative move by Singapore.<br><br>It also doesn't help matters that we are the smallest, yet is also the most successful and the richest.</div>
