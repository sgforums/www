            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by wisefool83:<strong><br><br>That is a very idealistic approach. 2 random questions came up to mind.<br>The first is on the definition on Freedom. Current common interpretation of freedom is the liberal sense of freedom which basically dipicts freedom as "free from interference".<br>There exist however, a more republican form of interpretation, which is "free from domination". And one read the Machivalli discourses, which features republican ideas, they are very similar to what Singapore is currently doing.<br>I'm sure you subscribe to the first, but would it be wrong for people to subscribe to the second?<br><br>The 2nd question remains on the paradox of "forcing to be free". The whole idea of democracy was to let everybody vet a certain decision or political party. If a decision is being considered 4.5 million times and most think that it's A, then the chances of it being A rather than B is higher. If most people in Singapore thinks that liberal freedom is not that important, then should the democractic activies overturn the population's decision and impose liberal freedom? Should we become democratic tru autocratic means or should we stay autocratic democratically?<br><br>U.S.'s democracy was reputed to be forced upon, if a general polled was organised during the war of independence, the 13 states prob remain as British colony. But is a fight for freedom always going to result in creating an America? Does democracy not have a chance of creating more misery? Is freedom necessary the upmost important issue? Of what use is liberal freedom if we have to return to the state of nature because of it?<br><br>I'm personally more incline to republicanism rather than liberalism. </strong></blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">How did you come to the conclusion that <span style="font-style: italic;">''.... if a general polled was organised during the war of independence, the 13 states prob remain as British colony.''</span> ?<br><br>It was an established fact of US History that the War of Independence came about from the unreasonable and oppressive tax imposed by the Crown and its Government on the Colonies.<br><br>The <span style="font-style: italic;">''Boston Tea Party''</span> was an expression of the displeasure of the colonists towards the rules from Mother Great Britain.<br><br>Out of the struggles with Mother Great Britain, the initial concept of <span style="font-style: italic;">''Democracies''</span> was <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">forged</span></strong></span> not forced upon the various colonies founded in North America.<br><br>The idea of <span style="font-style: italic;">''Democracies''</span> came from the minds of the early settlers who dared to cross the ocean to find new future for themselves, and had the intellectual, moral and physical strengths to challenge the military might of the Crown.<br><br>Is it not simply too convenient an argument to simply put that <span style="font-style: italic;">''liberal freedom .... will.... return [us] to the state of nature''</span> ?<br><br>Are Singaporeans given the opportunity to decide if <span style="font-style: italic;">''... liberal freedom is not that important''</span>, or were the issues at Election confined to <span style="font-style: italic;">''Neighborhood Upgrading''</span> ?<br><br>It is simply presumptious that just because 4.5 Million pick Choice A then it is natural that the subsequent <span style="font-style: italic;">''...chances of it being A rather than B is higher''</span>.<br><br>Even in Switzerland with a population that is nearly double that of Singapore, on issues that are <span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">fundamental</span></span> to the interests of every Swiss, the Swiss Government does not assume that because the Swiss had chosen A for their being elected, then all subsequent major decisions will still be A.<br><br>Switzerland and Swiss has survived and thrived as a Nation without too much economic hardships, have abundant creativity, and enjoy high Standards of Living that is at the top of World Ranking despite their reputable high taxes.<br><br>All these achievements and accolades are due to the fact that the Swiss Citizen enjoy a form of individual political liberty and responsibility in exercising their decisions through National Referendums.<br><br>The Singapore Government that started with LKY and his team - has never trusted the political maturity nor the ability of Singaporeans since the 1950s, and has consistently refused to subject their political future - based on their assumed superior breeding - to the whims of average and below average Singaporeans.<br><br>This is sheer arrogant thinking.<br><br>Singapore will perpetually be in a state of political and economic limbo, when LKY, the Ruling Party and the Government that it forms refuse to give political space for other Singaporeans to challenge the status quo.<br><br>The comments from Singapore's retired Civil Servant - Ngiam Tong Dow made in an interview which he gave and published in the article <span style="font-style: italic;">''PAP bigger than Singapore ?"

If I'm not mistaken either Kenneth Waltz or Robert Jervis argued that bread and butter would be more important than [liberal] freedom in situation where the former is deprived.</span><br><br>Are Singaporeans given the opportunity to decide if <span style="font-style: italic;">''... liberal freedom is not that important''</span>, or were the issues at Election confined to <span style="font-style: italic;">''Neighborhood Upgrading''</span> ?<br><br>It is simply presumptious that just because 4.5 Million pick Choice A then it is natural that the subsequent <span style="font-style: italic;">''...chances of it being A rather than B is higher''</span>.<br><br><span style="color: darkblue;">The idea here was that say we were asked a question, somebody proposed answer A and somebody proposed answer B. Both answers were then given out for consideration. Say after looking at both answers, I did my own consideration and I thought that A is the answer. After which the question is presented to my Dad who looked at it, and after considerations, determined that A is the answer.... and the whole process is repeated for 4.5million times. If all 4.5million people look at the question and thinks that A is the answer, then generally speaking, A would have a greater chance than B as the correct answer as the collective intelligence of the entire population is being drawn on.</span><br><br>Even in Switzerland with a population that is nearly double that of Singapore, on issues that are <span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">fundamental</span></span> to the interests of every Swiss, the Swiss Government does not assume that because the Swiss had chosen A for their being elected, then all subsequent major decisions will still be A.<br><br><span style="color: darkblue;">Neither did I.

I understand that if Singapore and PAP are put into the context, it gets some people a little bit edgey. So let's take Singapore and PAP out of the equation and just invent some little island like how Harrington invented Oceana.<br><br>Say this island was democratic but very poor, to the extent that almost every other person is dying of hunger. Then suppose some dude come up and said, "I can provide the food and material wealth that everybody needed, but in order for me to do that, you all will have to listen to me." A general poll was then taken to decide if they will follow this person and the people being very hungry and poor, voted to have the island turned into an autocratic state. Some years down the road, the dictator, being a benevolent one, caused most people to become very wealthy and the even poorest could at least feed himself even just by eating leftovers of others. So essentially, nobody on the island starved to death anymore.<br><br>Then one day, one of us here in Sgforum got our hands on a Time-Machine which allows us to travel back to the time where the decision was made to turn the democratic island into and autocratic one. And somehow or rather, that person has the ability to change the whole thing, but he/she knows that ,by some unknown reasons, that by doing so, the island will continue to be poor and hungry.<br><br>If you were the person, would you or would you not change the island back to its democratic nature. Why?<br><br>This is a political theory exercise, so let's just discuss it in a pure theory manner and assume that there never was a Singapore, there never was PAP or MIW. We can bring back the reality next time yah?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Do not kill a soul which Allah has made sacred except through the due process of law ... (6:151)<br><br>Here also homicide has been distinguished from destruction of life carried out in pursuit of justice. Only a proper and competent court will be able to decide whether or not an individual has forfeited his right to life by disregarding the right to life and peace of other human beings. The Prophet, may God's blessings be on him, has declared homicide as the greatest sin only next to polytheism. The Tradition of the Prophet reads: "The greatest sins are to associate something with God and to kill human beings." In all these verses of the Quran and the Traditions of the Prophet the word 'soul' (nafs) has been used in general terms without any distinction or particularization which might have lent itself to the elucidation that the persons belong- ing to one's nation, the citizens of one's country, the people of a particular race or religion should not be killed. The injunction applies to all human beings and the destruction of human life in itself has been prohibited.<br><br>'The Right to Life' has been given to man only by Islam. You will observe that the people who talk about human rights if they have ever mentioned them in their Constitutions or Declarations, then it is clearly implied in them that these rights are applicable only to their citizens or they have been framed for the white race alone. This can clearly be gleaned by the fact that human beings were hunted down like animals in Australia and the land was cleared of the aborigines for the white man. Similarly the aboriginal population of America was systematically destroyed and the Red Indians who somehow survived this genocide were confined to specified areas called Reservations. They also penetrated into Africa and hunted down human beings like wild animals. All these instances go to prove that they have no respect for human life as such and if they have, it is only on the basis of their nationality, colour or race. Contrary to this, Islam recognizes this right for all human beings. If a man belongs to a primitive or savage tribe, even then Islam regards him as a human being.</blockquote></div>
