Chee has been convicted and imprisoned several times for charges such as "speaking in public without a permit" and "attempting to hold rally without a license".

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Billybong:</strong><br>"A PhD holder, who chooses to lecture and perform research at a specific university is automatically given this title."<br><br>Actually, I disagree. I may not agree with Mat Toro's other points, but I can see what he's getting at. Because in some (or most) english-speaking countries only a Full Professor can be called "Professor xxx". That's how it is in NUS anyway, I remember one lecture when one student said called an Assistant Prof "Professor" and the guy replied "Eh u trying to promote me ah?"<br><br>So, a PhD holder, who lectures and performs research, is NOT automatically given the title of "Professor". Assistant Profs and Associate Profs are not called "Professors". I always call them Dr.<br><br>If you're not convinced, see:<br><br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professor#Most_other_English-speaking_countries" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professor#Most_other_English-speaking_countries</a><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by BillyBong:</div><div class="quote_body">For the benefit of everyone, please note that a professor is a title conferred by a university. A PhD holder, who chooses to lecture and perform research at a specific university is automatically given this title. There are several levels such as assistant professor (starter), associate professor (intermediate) and a full professor.<br><br>A PhD holder not working at a university is considered a doctor in parenthesis only and not strictly a 'professor'. There are some exceptions to this: Professor S Jayakumar (Law Minister) and Professor Tommy Koh (Ambassor-at-large), who are both full-fledged professors despite not being 'employed' at any specific university. I believe they are under a special arrangement that permits them to retain their professorship in exchange for a minimum number of hours giving lectures and performing other duties etc. </div></blockquote>A Professor also has to have a certain amount of academic achievement. A Ph.D is but only the beginning of an academic life and he/she make a fair amount of publication and lecturering before being conferred the title of Professor or Associate Professor. In short, a Doctorate does not automatically makes one a Professor, but to be a Professor, you must first obtain a Doctorate.<br><br>As for whether Dr Chee is a Professor, I have no idea, but given his relatively young age and short academic career, I highly doubt he has ever attempt to apply for Professorship.<br><br>(okie, hope this will close the Dr vs Professor sub-topic, please get back to the main topic please.)</div>
