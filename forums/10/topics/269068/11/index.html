I may not agree with Mat Toro's other points, but I can see what he's getting at. Because in some (or most) english-speaking countries only a Full Professor can be called "Professor xxx". That's how it is in NUS anyway, I remember one lecture when one student said called an Assistant Prof "Professor" and the guy replied "Eh u trying to promote me ah?"<br><br>So, a PhD holder, who lectures and performs research, is NOT automatically given the title of "Professor". Assistant Profs and Associate Profs are not called "Professors". I always call them Dr.<br><br>If you're not convinced, see:<br><br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professor#Most_other_English-speaking_countries" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professor#Most_other_English-speaking_countries</a><br>[/b]</blockquote>It is somewhat ridiculous to split hairs over what constitutes a 'professor'.<br><br>It is common knowledge that even an assistant professor does not mean one is any less of a professor. We are not referring to a full-fledged professor; we are simply talking about the 'title' of professor.<br><br>Whether the person is a assistant professor or an associate hardly changes the fact that the person is STILL a 'Professor',<br><br>Does an 'intern' or 'houseman' make that person any less of a doctor?<br><br>To validate whether Dr Chee was conferred that professorship, one will have to check back the records dating to his employment at NUS. Given his length of time before he was dumped, he will certainly more than qualify to be an assistant professor.<br><br>Unfortunately there are those who insist on arguing into semantics, offering worthless one-liners but demanding proof from everyone, without offering any to support their own hopeless position.</div>

Coming from someone with as limited intellect as a 5-year-old intent on rambling home the same old argument.

The burden is therefore on the plaintiff to prove his accusation with indisputable evidence and facts.<br><br>Since you have blatantly claimed that Chee is NOT some professor, the onus is on you to demonstrate and back up your words with proof, certainly not the other way round.<br><br>Silly silly...who is being silly?
