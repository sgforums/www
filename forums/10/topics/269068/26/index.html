            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>How is the taxation and income distribution communistic? Could you provide some facts and figures from relevant sites to stake your claim?<br></blockquote>I promise M13 that I'll get some facts and stats for the above question. I haven't got much time to do a good job, so I'm just using one particuar industry that I'm familiar with to illustrate my point as to why I say the income dist in NZ is almost communistic.<br><br>(A note of disclaimer, the term "communist" was used in a previous casual dialoge with my lecturer who was a Kiwi and it was him who used the phrase to describe the current situation in NZ where the govt takes the money from the rich and give them to the poor so that most people bring home about the same income. It is therefore, different from Marx's communist and Maoist communist or any of the normal form of explanation for communism for that matter. As I do not have the habbit of recording my conversations, nor do I encourage my lecturers to write books on every topic we discussed on so that I could reference it in the future should I feel the urge to write on an informal discussion forum, I apologise for not being able to provide any proof that the conversation actually took place.)<br><br>One would GENERALLY agree with me that within the same industry, a person with a higher qualification should take home a higher pay than someone of a lower qualification. If someone invested at least a decade into getting some outstanding qualification, one would probably expect some substantial returns from this investment in education. Below are some stats on the education industry comparing 4 persons who each newly entered their post. Their income are based on the lowest on their category.<br><br>In NZ, a new teacher in NZ without a degree but with some qualification such as a diploma earns 32,468 a year.<br>A teacher with a degree earns 39,425<br>A University Assistant Lecturer with Master Degree at least earns 41,670<br>A University Lecturer with at least a Ph.D earns 56,267<br><br>The income tax for all income below 38,000 a year is 19.5% while income between 38,001 and 60,000 is 33% and anything above 60,000 is 39%. And NZ's tax system is such that it deducts directly from your pay slip so that you only receive the after taxed pay.<br><br>Therefore, after the taxation, the above mentioned subjects' pay would be:<br>Teacher without degree: 28936.53<br>Teacher with degree: 26141.5<br>Uni Asst Lectuer with at least Master Degree: 27918.9<br>Uni Lecturer with a Ph.D at least: 37698.89<br><br>Translate that to monthly pay:<br>Teacher without degree: 2411.3775<br>Teacher with degree: 2201.2083<br>Uni Asst Lecturer with at least Master Degree: 2326.575<br>Uni Lecturer with Ph.D at least: 3164.07<br><br>In short, without a degree, you take home $200NZD more per month than one with a degree and about $100 more than a University Assistant Lecturer who had a Master Degree. If you spend about 10 years of tertiary study to get a Ph.D(In NZ, degree is 3years + 1 for honours, 2 years for Master and another 4years for Ph.D), well, congratuations, you get to take home $750 more than someone without a degree.<br><br>If however, you and your partner are both unemployed and you have a child still schooling, you get easily get at least $1665.76 in benefits per month AFTER TAX. Which means that the same family depending on a working parent teaching with a degree will be richer than you by slightly more than $500 per month; and that is if the people on benefits don't apply for other accomodation or minority grants and rebate which is rather easy to get if one applies.<br><br>This is not to say that NZ is therefore a crap place to work in. There are many other factors that make up for such a strange taxation system.For eg. the working culture allows a person who enter into a new industry to learn on the job. Colleagues help each other a lot and working environment tends to be friendly. Which is more than I can say for Sg's working culture.<br><br>Ok, I hope this fulfills my promise to M13 and god damn this is tiring and time consuming in the face on oncoming assignments and thus it is unlikely that I will venture into similar escapades in the recent future.<br><br>*Informations were gathered and processed via the following websites.<br>www.emigratenz.org<br>www.stats.govt.nz<br>www.aus.ac.nz<br>www.ppta.org.nz</div>

Below are some stats on the education industry comparing 4 persons who each newly entered their post. Their income are based on the lowest on their category.<br><br>In NZ, a new teacher in NZ without a degree but with some qualification such as a diploma earns 32,468 a year.<br>A teacher with a degree earns 39,425<br>A University Assistant Lecturer with Master Degree at least earns 41,670<br>A University Lecturer with at least a Ph.D earns 56,267<br><br>The income tax for all income below 38,000 a year is 19.5% while income between 38,001 and 60,000 is 33% and anything above 60,000 is 39%. And NZ's tax system is such that it deducts directly from your pay slip so that you only receive the after taxed pay.<br><br>Therefore, after the taxation, the above mentioned subjects' pay would be:<br>Teacher without degree: 28936.53<br>Teacher with degree: 26141.5<br>Uni Asst Lectuer with at least Master Degree: 27918.9<br>Uni Lecturer with a Ph.D at least: 37698.89<br><br>Translate that to monthly pay:<br>Teacher without degree: 2411.3775<br>Teacher with degree: 2201.2083<br>Uni Asst Lecturer with at least Master Degree: 2326.575<br>Uni Lecturer with Ph.D at least: 3164.07<br><br>In short, without a degree, you take home $200NZD more per month than one with a degree and about $100 more than a University Assistant Lecturer who had a Master Degree. If you spend about 10 years of tertiary study to get a Ph.D(In NZ, degree is 3years + 1 for honours, 2 years for Master and another 4years for Ph.D), well, congratuations, you get to take home $750 more than someone without a degree.<br><br>If however, you and your partner are both unemployed and you have a child still schooling, you get easily get at least $1665.76 in benefits per month AFTER TAX. Which means that the same family depending on a working parent teaching with a degree will be richer than you by slightly more than $500 per month; and that is if the people on benefits don't apply for other accomodation or minority grants and rebate which is rather easy to get if one applies.<br><br>This is not to say that NZ is therefore a crap place to work in. There are many other factors that make up for such a strange taxation system.For eg. the working culture allows a person who enter into a new industry to learn on the job. Colleagues help each other a lot and working environment tends to be friendly. Which is more than I can say for Sg's working culture.<br><br>Ok, I hope this fulfills my promise to M13 and god damn this is tiring and time consuming in the face on oncoming assignments and thus it is unlikely that I will venture into similar escapades in the recent future.<br><br>*Informations were gathered and processed via the following websites.<br>www.emigratenz.org<br>www.stats.govt.nz<br>www.aus.ac.nz<br>www.ppta.org.nz </div></blockquote><span style="color: blue;"><br>The basis of a caring government is to provide for it's population irregardless of their physical abilities.

Current common interpretation of freedom is the liberal sense of freedom which basically dipicts freedom as "free from interference".<br>There exist however, a more republican form of interpretation, which is "free from domination". And one read the Machivalli discourses, which features republican ideas, they are very similar to what Singapore is currently doing.<br>I'm sure you subscribe to the first, but would it be wrong for people to subscribe to the second?<br><br>The 2nd question remains on the paradox of "forcing to be free". The whole idea of democracy was to let everybody vet a certain decision or political party. If a decision is being considered 4.5 million times and most think that it's A, then the chances of it being A rather than B is higher. If most people in Singapore thinks that liberal freedom is not that important, then should the democractic activies overturn the population's decision and impose liberal freedom? Should we become democratic tru autocratic means or should we stay autocratic democratically?<br><br>U.S.'s democracy was reputed to be forced upon, if a general polled was organised during the war of independence, the 13 states prob remain as British colony. But is a fight for freedom always going to result in creating an America? Does democracy not have a chance of creating more misery? Is freedom necessary the upmost important issue? Of what use is liberal freedom if we have to return to the state of nature because of it?<br><br>I'm personally more incline to republicanism rather than liberalism.</div>
