            <div class='col-md body'>So Mat Toro, you haven't really answered the questions raised about your points on why the PAP isn't doing anything about Chee's foreign funding.<br><br>Are you implying that:<br><br>1) The ruling party is allowing such an obvious breach of electorial laws despite having all the powers to do something about it, and indeed being compelled by the law to do something about it as part of some conspiracy to cover up law-breaking in our elections by Chee just so they have ammunition to use, hence breaking a very basic law of electorial intergity in the first place?<br><br>2) Despite having resources to gather information far beyond your wildest speculations, the ISD are somehow incompetent to find out about this foreign plot to mess around with our politics?<br><br>Sorry, I think your PAP cover-up conspiracy theories are just not catching any air. I believe the PAP may play hardball, but they are not as low as you put them to be, or at the very least you ought to verify your statements beyond speculations and saying this or that is "obvious" or you are indeed no different from Chee as you say him to be, and worse, might find yourself in his position when the court of the law comes after you for sedition.<br><br></div>
