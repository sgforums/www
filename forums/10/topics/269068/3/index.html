            <div class='col-md body'>Clinical neuropsychology is a sub-specialty of clinical psychology that specialises in the diagnostic assessment and treatment of patients with brain injury or neurocognitive deficits.<br><br>Typically, a clinical neuropsychologist will hold an advanced degree in clinical psychology (in most countries, this requires a doctorate level qualification: Ph.D., Psy.D., or M.D.) and will have completed further studies in neuropsychology, or in some countries, neurology.<br><br>In the USA, a neuropsychologist is a psychologist, who, in addition to completing a Doctoral Degree in Psychology, also completes a Clinical Internship (1 year) and specialized post-Doctoral training in Clinical Neuropsychology. Such post-Doctoral training (i.e. Fellowship/Residency) currently ranges from 2 to 4 years. Neuropsychologists use models of brain-behavior relationships to determine whether expected neurobehavioral function has changed to a degree that is consistent with impairment. Such relationships are demonstrated through the interpretation of performance that is derived from a variety of specialized assessment procedures. Thus, the domain of neuropsychologists is expressed brain function: for example, reasoning, learning/recall processes, selective attention/concentration processes, perception, sensation, language processes, controlled/directed movement processes. Serial neuropsychological examinations may be used to monitor deteriorating neurobehavioral performance (as with dementing disorders) or to monitor improving neurobehavioral function (as during the recovery after an acquired brain injury).<br><br>What distinguishes a clinical neuropsychologist from other clinical psychologists is an extensive knowledge of the brain, including an understanding of areas such as: neuroanatomy, neurobiology, psychopharmacology, neurological illness or injury, the use of neuropsychological tests to accurately assess cognitive deficits, and the management, treatment and rehabiliation of brain injured and neurocognitively impaired patients.<br><br>Clinical neuropsychologists perform a number of tasks, usually within a clinical setting. They are often involved in conducting neuropsychological assessments to assess a person's cognitive skills, usually after some sort of brain injury or neurological impairment. This may be for the purposes of planning treatments, to determine someone's neurocognitive functioning or mental capacity (often done for presentation as evidence in court cases or legal proceedings) or to detect changes over time.<br><br>A clinical neuropsychologist's typical caseload may include people with traumatic brain injury (TBI), cerebrovascular accidents (CVA) such as stroke and aneurysm ruptures, brain tumors, encephalitis, epilepsy/seizure disorders, dementias, mental illnesses (e.g. schizophrenia), and a wide range of developmental disorders, including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), learning disabilities, autism and Tourette's syndrome.<br><br>Clinical neuropsychologists' training has included methods of psychotherapy and counseling. They can also provide therapeutic services to patients in need of education and emotional support concerning their neurological injuries or illness.<br><br>Many clinical neuropsychologists are employed by medical schools and hospitals, especially neurology, psychiatry, and rehabilitation facilities. Some work in private practice. They are frequently active in teaching at the university level and conducting research into a wide range of issues concerning human brain-behavior relationships. Some clinical neuropsychologists are also employed by pharmaceutical companies to help develop and test neuropsychological assessment tools.<br><br>The practice of cognitive neuropsychology and cognitive neuropsychiatry involves studying the cognitive effects of injury or illness to understand normal psychological function. Because of their day-to-day contact with people with brain impairment, many clinical neuropsychologists are active in these research fields.<br><br>Source: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_neuropsychology" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_neuropsychology</a><br><br><span style="color: blue;">When you see him for a lobotomy, make sure you ask for buy 1 get 1 free offer.</span><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Information form another source.<br><br>What is a neurologist?<br><br>A neurologist is a medical doctor with specialized training in diagnosing, treating, and managing disorders of the brain and nervous system. Neurologists do not perform surgery.<br>A neurologist's training includes an undergraduate degree, four years of medical school, a one-year internship, and three years of specialized training. Many neurologists also have additional training in one area of neurology such as stroke, epilepsy, or movement disorders. This is called a subspecialty.<br>What does a neurologist treat?<br>Common neurological disorders include:<br>Â·	Stroke<br>Â·	Pain<br>Â·	Headache<br>Â·	Epilepsy<br>Â·	Tremor<br>Â·	Sleep disorders<br>Â·	Alzheimer's disease<br>Â·	Parkinson disease<br>Â·	Multiple sclerosis<br>Â·	Brain and spinal cord injuries<br>Â·	Brain tumors<br>Â·	Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also called Lou Gehrig's Disease<br><br>What is the role of a neurologist?<br><br>Neurologists are principal care providers or consultants to other doctors. When a person has a neurological disorder that requires frequent care, a neurologist is often the principal care provider. People with disorders, such as Parkinson disease, Alzheimer's disease, seizure disorders or multiple sclerosis may use a neurologist as their principal care doctor.<br>In a consulting role, a neurologist will diagnose and treat a neurological disorder and then advise the primary care doctor managing the person's overall health. For example, a neurologist may act in a consulting role for conditions such as stroke, concussion, or headache.<br>Neurologists can recommend surgical treatment, but they do not perform surgery. When treatment includes surgery, neurologists may monitor the patients and supervise their continuing treatment. Neurosurgeons are medical doctors who specialize in performing surgical treatments of the brain or nervous system.<br></div>
