He practised law after graduation and later became a lecturer in an educational institution.  From late 2004, he began developing the mindset that he had to wage Â‘militant jihadÂ’ in a land where Muslims were under attack.  His views were shaped by the radical discourse that he avidly looked up on the Internet.<br><br>In Oct 2006, Abdul Basheer left Singapore for a Middle-East country.  He planned to live there for two years, learning Arabic so that he could communicate with Â‘mujahidinÂ’ fighters.  However, within two months, his Â‘militant jihadÂ’ plans escalated as he became even more deeply influenced by the extremist propaganda he read on the Internet.  By Dec 2006, he had decided to embark on Â‘militant jihadÂ’ immediately.  At the time of his arrest, he had purchased an air ticket to Pakistan, where he intended to make contact with a militant group Â– the Lashkar e-Tayyiba (LeT) - that could help him train for Â‘militant jihadÂ’ and to cross over into Afghanistan to fight alongside the Taliban.  Abdul Basheer enlisted the help of his friend in Singapore, Muhamad Yassin Khan bin Muhamad Yunos, to facilitate his plans.  He was arrested and repatriated before he could embark on his violent agenda.<br><br>Abdul Basheer was detained under the ISA in Feb 2007.</blockquote>Lol, you want to troll, at the very least know how to troll safely.

I didn't press on, not because I can't. And why do I not want to press on? Because I know that pressing on these mistakes is only going to provoke you into saying that is even more off topic and the whole discussion becomes point less.<br><br>If you would kindly go tru our previous conversations, you would realised that you had shown me much less courtesy than I had shown you. When Gazelle started calling you names and implicating your parents into it, I did not hesitate to voice my objections. By then I had already received my fill of aggressive words from you, and why do I still stand up then? Because of the above, I want to keep proper discussion going on.<br><br>Discussion has room for mistakes, which I admit for than once that I make them. That's not important. What is important is that after we admit, we don't repeat them and we move on.<br><br>Your current arguments had been based on partisan line. You attack a person based on your perception of his/her camp. And once you decide your target, you simply look out for flaws and flaws will be all you ever see. This is not a discussion, this is nit-picking. This is counter-productive to a forum because it drives people of different views away and when everybody in the same forum has the same views, there won't be much left to discuss.<br><br>I have tried my best to be patient and I sincerely hope that you would read this post carefully and understand where I am coming from. If unfortunately your next post is still disappointing in its <span style="color: blue;">attitude*,</span> I would heed one of your previous advice.<br><br>* I emphasized the attitude because I do not mind you posting different view and I am not stoping you from posting your points, but the very same points can be posted without deliberately aimming at pissing other people off.</div>

I understand that if Singapore and PAP are put into the context, it gets some people a little bit edgey. So let's take Singapore and PAP out of the equation and just invent some little island like how Harrington invented Oceana.<br><br>Say this island was democratic but very poor, to the extent that almost every other person is dying of hunger. Then suppose some dude come up and said, "I can provide the food and material wealth that everybody needed, but in order for me to do that, you all will have to listen to me." A general poll was then taken to decide if they will follow this person and the people being very hungry and poor, voted to have the island turned into an autocratic state. Some years down the road, the dictator, being a benevolent one, caused most people to become very wealthy and the even poorest could at least feed himself even just by eating leftovers of others. So essentially, nobody on the island starved to death anymore.<br><br>Then one day, one of us here in Sgforum got our hands on a Time-Machine which allows us to travel back to the time where the decision was made to turn the democratic island into and autocratic one. And somehow or rather, that person has the ability to change the whole thing, but he/she knows that ,by some unknown reasons, that by doing so, the island will continue to be poor and hungry.<br><br>If you were the person, would you or would you not change the island back to its democratic nature. Why?<br><br>This is a political theory exercise, so let's just discuss it in a pure theory manner and assume that there never was a Singapore, there never was PAP or MIW.

The youths were used to spending future money from young and many took loans for school, cars and houses. High school students were often seen driving 4WD which is definitely outside of their purchasing power. The problem has been recognised and was featured by a number of news program in the country. The society over there is getting worried about it(basically older generations getting worried about the younger ones) because it seems like it's developing into a culture where the youths are used to living a good life and wants more than they could actually afford.<br></div></blockquote>So....based on this observation, you determined that the youths are heavily in debt and don't clear their debts till the day they die?<br><br>What kind of 4WD are they driving? Rolls Royce or Bentley? A typical Toyota RAV4 only cost below NZ 30,000 (estimated). First of all, finance companies and banks are not as naive as you, if you want a loan, you definitely need collateral and downpayment. If you fail to make payments for your car or house, the finance company will repo your car or house, sell it off to make good on the loan. Therefore the market value of the car or house will always be above your loan amount. No rational business would want to make a loss in a business transaction.
