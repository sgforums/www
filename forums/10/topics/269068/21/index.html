The youths were used to spending future money from young and many took loans for school, cars and houses. High school students were often seen driving 4WD which is definitely outside of their purchasing power. The problem has been recognised and was featured by a number of news program in the country. The society over there is getting worried about it(basically older generations getting worried about the younger ones) because it seems like it's developing into a culture where the youths are used to living a good life and wants more than they could actually afford.</span><br><br>How is the taxation and income distribution communistic? Could you provide some facts and figures from relevant sites to stake your claim?<br><span style="color: darkblue;">I'm unable to do that at the moment as I'm in my office now, less I wish to get sack from my boss, but I'll try to do that after some research, prob reply in a night or two.</span><br><br>[b]No point stating baseless claims, anybody can do that to win arguments. Show us the facts and statistics.</strong><br><span style="color: darkblue;">Facts and statsitcs requires time to research, most of the time after I do that, the topics and threads had already gone way off.</span><br><br>If your allegations against New Zealand is true, I hate to imagine the level of corruption in Singapore. After all New Zealand is ranked by Transparency International to be No.1, whereas Singapore is ranked No.5.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><span style="color: darkblue;">Yes, that is something that I've been pondering too. While I was there, the level of corruption does seem to be outrageous, but most of these cases were on the grey area as they were also trying legal manner to say that they weren't corrupt such as the retrospective law case.</span>Consider yourself corrected by facts.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br><span style="color: blue;">I am however, not saying that the place is terrible, no, I've enjoyed myself there very much.

Or is it just chit chat and humour, where entertainment is primary and facts are secondary.<br><br></div></blockquote>Wow, you are really testing my memory aren't you.<br>Ok, Newspaper, I'm sorry, but if you've ever read a New Zeland newspaper, you would notice that it's basically about Rugby, rugby and rugby. From my memory, Singapore had only hit their newspaper twice, once was when we hung the Australian Viet guy and the other time was when LHL visited NZ and the Dominian Express featured a photo of him and Halen Clark watching Rugby a Rugby game.<br><br>Oh, and now to think of it, Don Brash did make a comment which was featured on the Newspaper, something like saying how he was impressed at how Singapore had developed over the years and how when he was young during the late 60s he met a diplomat who told him that Singapore won't make it and now Singapore is doing better than New Zeland. (But you can disregard his comment or at least discount as he was the opposition leader and prob using the chance to just the ruling party a bit. He subsequently lost his post as opposition leader a few months down the road but wasn't due to this comment.)<br><br>The comments that I've overheard were informal comments, some I stumbled upon when I was in school, (no prize for guessing which school I went to). The Dr Lance Berth was clearer in my head at the moment. He commented that LKY was one of the most brilliant men he ever met, along with Benard Loo and some others whom I've forgotten. Apparently Dr Lance Berth specialised in South East Asia Politics and Strategy.<br><br>The Mortlock's comment was along side Dr Lance Berth, basically telling us (the entire lecture theatre) to go read LKY's memoir.<br><br>Dr Piers and Dr Harper's comment were overheard when I was working. I worked as a waiter in a conference facility which therefore allows me to overhear a lot of big shots comments but most of the time I don't know who they are and hence didn't list them in the above post.  Forgot the exact words they were using but the conversation started with colonial masters which went on to the Malayan emergency which then went on to about Sg and LKY. The comments were that Lee did a fantastic job bring Sg out and such and such. Perhaps as ex-military personel, they weren't exactly the hottest fan of western liberal democracy either.<br><br>And now that my mind is back into that page, I've also recalled that a certain LTC who was my lecturer for a while, was posted in Sg for a number of years. He subsequently made comments about how he actually prefers Sg and suffered from culture shock when he came back to NZ.<br><br>Note that, however, not all Kiwis were saying that Sg is good. Some of the political groups that I've particiapted when my time allows me to had more negative comments about Sg, but mostly on our death sentence rather than corruption.<br><br>There was an article that I had come across in some Economic mag that did say something rather negative about Singapore's economy prospect, to which the Dominian Express put it on one of it's economy column and to which the Singapore High Commissioner Office wrote a reply to. Can't exactly remember what the article was about, just remember that it's not good and the  High Comm Office wrote something about "Singapore don't need foreigners to comment on us" to which I have already written a letter to ask the high comm office not to write such nasty things in the future and to which they replied that they will take note.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by wisefool83:</div><div class="quote_body">Wow, you are really testing my memory aren't you.<br>Ok, Newspaper, I'm sorry, but if you've ever read a New Zeland newspaper, you would notice that it's basically about Rugby, rugby and rugby. From my memory, Singapore had only hit their newspaper twice, once was when we hung the Australian Viet guy and the other time was when LHL visited NZ and the Dominian Express featured a photo of him and Halen Clark watching Rugby a Rugby game.<br><br>Oh, and now to think of it, Don Brash did make a comment which was featured on the Newspaper, something like saying how he was impressed at how Singapore had developed over the years and how when he was young during the late 60s he met a diplomat who told him that Singapore won't make it and now Singapore is doing better than New Zeland. (But you can disregard his comment or at least discount as he was the opposition leader and prob using the chance to just the ruling party a bit. He subsequently lost his post as opposition leader a few months down the road but wasn't due to this comment.)<br><br>The comments that I've overheard were informal comments, some I stumbled upon when I was in school, (no prize for guessing which school I went to). The Dr Lance Berth was clearer in my head at the moment. He commented that LKY was one of the most brilliant men he ever met, along with Benard Loo and some others whom I've forgotten. Apparently Dr Lance Berth specialised in South East Asia Politics and Strategy.<br><br>The Mortlock's comment was along side Dr Lance Berth, basically telling us (the entire lecture theatre) to go read LKY's memoir.<br><br>Dr Piers and Dr Harper's comment were overheard when I was working. I worked as a waiter in a conference facility which therefore allows me to overhear a lot of big shots comments but most of the time I don't know who they are and hence didn't list them in the above post.  Forgot the exact words they were using but the conversation started with colonial masters which went on to the Malayan emergency which then went on to about Sg and LKY. The comments were that Lee did a fantastic job bring Sg out and such and such. Perhaps as ex-military personel, they weren't exactly the hottest fan of western liberal democracy either.<br><br>And now that my mind is back into that page, I've also recalled that a certain LTC who was my lecturer for a while, was posted in Sg for a number of years. He subsequently made comments about how he actually prefers Sg and suffered from culture shock when he came back to NZ.<br><br>Note that, however, not all Kiwis were saying that Sg is good. Some of the political groups that I've particiapted when my time allows me to had more negative comments about Sg, but mostly on our death sentence rather than corruption.<br><br>There was an article that I had come across in some Economic mag that did say something rather negative about Singapore's economy prospect, to which the Dominian Express put it on one of it's economy column and to which the Singapore High Commissioner Office wrote a reply to. Can't exactly remember what the article was about, just remember that it's not good and the  High Comm Office wrote something about "Singapore don't need foreigners to comment on us" to which I have already written a letter to ask the high comm office not to write such nasty things in the future and to which they replied that they will take note.</div></blockquote>Sighs.<br><br>Any web links? Any specific books? So all of this is purely hearsay and gossip.</div>
