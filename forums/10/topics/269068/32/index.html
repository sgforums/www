I am accusing you of being partisan because you used a double standard, pursuing to a far greater detail of truth in post that favours or seemingly favours the PAP while on the other hand, accepting views that are anti-PAP without much questionings.<br><br>I had questioned people of both sides, for example, recently when Gazelle posted something to say that certain table was more accurate in protraying Sg's democracy level and such, I had questioned him why so, to which unfortunately he did not answer and I had no means of prying answers off him.<br><br>Similarly, when people posted something that were anti-PAP, I would also question it. More recently the one about SanLi's program which someone had kindly provided us the link to, in which I question the program's neutality and accuracy.<br><br>I had questioned the anti-PAP camp more often for the following reasons.<br><br>There are more anti-PAP people here than pro-PAP and hence a higher chance of actually questioning something.<br><br>The anti-PAP people here had more posts which has more room for questioning, the Pro-PAP camp however..... as in your camps' words "oneliner" and hence there is hardly anything worthly to question.<br><br>Hence I knew I am not partisan as I had tried my best to use the same standard for people of both camps, but the quality of their posts sometimes do not allow me to question them as much as I would want to.<br><br>Also, I am not very into the +1 or X2 culture of this forum and if I agree with either one of the camp, I simply keep quiet. And therefore while it seems I never agree with an anti-PAP statement, it wasn't because I don't agree, it's simply because I don't voice it out.<br><br>Lastly, as I am not a professional forummer, meaning I don't spend 24hrs a day writting posts, nor do I get any income simply by postings. My posts are therefore not necessarily at the top of my priority and hence I might miss out a few replies here and there. It doesn't mean I avoid question or adopt the modius operatus of the Pro-PAP, it just mean I had to work, study and get a life.</div>

Singpaore may or may not have such a problem, but neither situation would dispute the "fact", as you like to use, that NZ still has such a problem. Now I have said this a number of times and may I repeat it once more.<br><br>I am not saying Singapore don't have such problems, neither am I saying that NZ is helll compared to Singapore. I have personally lived in both places and had happy times in both. When I was in NZ, I missed Singapore. And when I am here, I miss NZ too. Both places are great, but they all do have some problem, and neither government would necessarily be better off running each other. (Interestingly as I had mentioned before, a opposition leader by the name of Don Brash did say that Singapore is doing much better because of its government and implies that Sg would do a better job at running NZ. Unfortunately, he wasn't on any NZforum.com.nz and hence I couldn't raise Sg problems to him.)</div>

Reports, if done correctly, can bring about objective and "birds eye view" of the picture.<br><br>Living in the other side certainly gives you a better "feel" of the place, but is limited by how many people and places you can experience.<br><br>An accurate or rather a less inaccurate conclusion can often be reached by combining both sources of information. More often than not however, stats and actual feelings can be contradicting and it's difficult to say which is more accurate.<br><br>Of course what Atobe said about bringing in ideas and helping Singapore to improve would be the next step, where after a conclusion is reached, feasible ideas and concepts can and should be brought in. I personally think however, that whateve is brought in must be subjected to certain amount of social experiment and adjusted to suit the intended host.

Surely you don't expect North Korea to suddenly declare universal suffrage and opening up the economy. Change is difficult unless Kim Jong Il is totally replaced, same as Iraq and Afghanistan.<br><br>Sacred cows make the best burgers.<br><br></div>
