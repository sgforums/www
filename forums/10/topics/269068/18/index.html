as can be seen in the month long preparations on the mass media that culminate in the <span style="font-style: italic;">''mass hysteria''</span> seen in the final National Day hurrah.<br><br>If one is to trace the differences in methods used to deal with CSJ compared to <span style="font-style: italic;">''political knuckle-dusters''</span> used towards JBJ in the 1980s, and the <span style="font-style: italic;">''political steel rods''</span> against the luminaires from the Barisan Sosialis in the 1960s through 1970s - the manner in dealing with CSJ is more subtle.<br><br>The efforts in handling CSJ is in the indirect manipulation of mass media in subtle moulding of the public opinions and views towards CSJ - with carefully selected <span style="font-style: italic;">''catch-words'' and ''labels''</span> that sticks onto CSJ personally.<br><br>It is as if a kid in school is stucked with a label for the duration of his school life, or that of a Recruit stuck with a label throughout his NSF.<br><br>Did <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>''SDP lost Chiam''</strong></span> or is it more accurate to say <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>''SDP kicked Chiam out''</strong></span> ?<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">''SDP losing Chiam''</span> indicate that Chiam left on his own accord, or that Chiam choose to be recruited by some other party in favor of the SDP that he created in the 1960s.<br><br>According to events that transpired, CSJ was maligned by his NUS Faculty Head - Dr Vasoo (an old-guard from the Ruling Party) - who had approved his expense claims more than a year ago before CSJ stood for election, but will later pull these papers out to accuse CSJ of cheating the NUS.<br><br>One must surely ask - Why did the NUS Faculty Head not vetted the claims a year ago before CSJ declared his candidacy to stand for elections under the SDP banner ?<br><br>According to the charges made by the NUS Faculty Head - CSJ had over claimed his taxi fare travelling from the NUS to some Child Care Centre for his research on child behavior - claiming some $1 to $2.00 extra, when the <span style="font-style: italic;">''usual''</span> taxi fare from the NUS to the CCC should cost some X-fare.<br><br>One must surely question the idiocy of such a statement - as on different days, subject to traffic conditions, and on the many different routes that a taxi driver can take - the same trip between the NUS and CCC can cost differently.<br><br>The other cheating claim levelled at CSJ - was the charge that CSJ had included his wife's doctoral research together with his research for assessments by an Overseas University - both being sent under NUS funds, when his wife is not employed by NUS.<br><br>CSJ had claimed that his wife's doctoral research had formed part of the body of his research, and that it was not uncommon for such joint efforts and deliberate researches to be made.<br><br>CSJ went on hunger strike in protest for these false charges - which Chiam did not approve nor supported to the chagrin of the SDP Chairman Ling How Doong and the SDP Executive Committee and members.<br><br>One event led to another, and Chiam was then asked to leave.<br><br>However, Chiam held a press conference that deepened the antagonism between him and his Executive Committee, leading the SDP to call for a vote to kick Chiam out.<br><br>Did CSJ make any <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>direct efforts</strong></span> to back-stab or play politics with Chiam to usurp Chiam's Chair ?<br><br>Or was the fact of the matter being that the events and circumstances of the tumultuous clash between CSJ and Dr Vasoo - resulted in the SDP seeing Chiam for what he truly is, and caused SDP to abandon Chiam in favor of CSJ - as Chiam was already seen to be ineffective in Parliament for more then 10 years ?<br><br>This was heavy material grasped by any political opportunists to use to black tar CSJ - who was then the most credible threat from a new generation, one that was equally qualified to be recruited even to the Ruling Party - (and which CSJ had stated that he was courted by his faculty head to join the PAP but declined).<br><br>If CSJ is what he is today, it is largely due to the raw political medicine that the Ruling Party had dispensed to deal with CSJ's decision in not accepting the hand that looked after him at NUS.<br></span><br></div><div class="quote_body">----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>So Atobe, did you help him (chee) out?  or is sgforums for entertainment only?<br></div></blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">Is sgforums for entertainment based on inaccuracies, or should it be based on an intellectual experience based on facts as each of us see and experience around us ?</span><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Daddy!!:<strong><br>You hate the oppressive and corrupt Ming emperor: will you collaborate with the Manchus, betray your country and let the gates down for the Manchu soldiers in?</strong>[/quote]<br><span style="color: darkred;">Are the Ming or the Manchus descendants of Han ?<br><br>By your logic, you will probably not even support Sun Yat Sen as it would be seen as betrayal of the Manchus too -
