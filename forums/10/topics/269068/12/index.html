That is his primary source of income to feed his family, along with the occasional grant.</strong> As to the charge of wanting to be a martyr, once he started dissenting, he found it impossible to stop in good conscience. Â“The more you got involved, the more you found out what theyÂ’re capable of, it steels you, so you say, Â‘No, I will not back down.Â’ It makes you more determined.Â”</blockquote>And also one more thing, you never heard of the bill "Political Donations Bill" ah? The bill ban political organisations from receiving money from overseas sponsors. What, you think Chee want to get locked up for accepting donations ah? How come the Govt hasn't charged him for that yet?<br><br>And grant refers to research he has done abroad. He is allowed to take some of the money for his own personal expenses, as most research grants do in the West.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
