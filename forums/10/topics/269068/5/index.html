The exercise of the profession of medicine.<br>2. The business of a practicing physician or group of physicians, including facilities and customary patients.<br><br>Due to the narrow perspective and definition of the term by some inept, has cause himself to be portrayed in a negative manner.<br><br><a href="http://nanonline.org/content/pages/prof/billing.shtm" rel="nofollow"><br>b) The neuropsychology sections from standard medical textbooks, such as Principals of Neurology (Adams et al), Neurology and Trauma (Evans), Neurology in Clinical Practice (Bradley et al), and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (Lahaita). <strong>The purpose of these chapters was to illustrate that neuropsychology is part of medical practice</strong>, rather than being part of psychiatric practice.</a><br><br></div>

I'm been reading your post and I've seen you getting significantly worked up over the past few days. I've realised that it's common for the people whom you are replying to resort to names calling and the likes. I was rather disturbed at first, but I've sort of got used to it and learn not to take their words too seriously or to the hearts. A forum is afterall an informal place and we are not exactly looking out for thesis materials here. Their actions do remind me of vultures though, flying high at first, then stoop low and attack in packs. When you run into them alone, you are pretty much dead.
