It would be highly unusual for any internet poster to claim the title of troll, rather a community member may try to deflate a post that is controversial or though provoking by referring to it as a “troll”. In usage troll is more of an insult like “nerd”, "jerk" or “geek”.<br><br>To call someone a troll is to say that any dispute over a post is not valid not because the issues raised are not valid, but to claim the intent of the poster invalidates the post. As a speech act the term troll is generally used as an ad hominem argument, attacking the poster rather than the content or issues of the post.<br><br></div></blockquote>maybe you're a clone?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
