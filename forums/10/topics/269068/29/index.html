But essentially neither of us (Aka either one of them and me) are saying that freedom is less important to brend and butter. We are saying that they are both important and it's better to have "some of both" than "max of only either one"</span><br><br><span style="color: red;">What is the premise for all ''Hypothesis'' ?<br><br>Can your platform be put to a test with 4.5 Million people ?<br><br>If Democracy is not a freedom of choice, what is the use of collective wisdom ?<br><br>Is wisdom not developed from experience from the exercise of choices ?<br><br>Can collective wisdom exist if there is no experience in exercising individual and personal choices ? </span><br><span style="color: darkblue;"><br>Dude, you misunderstood my points here again. They don't have to be a zero sum game. I'm just illustrating that Democracy is not only giving you a choice, but is also asking people to think when making their choice and that the decision produced by a democracy is more likely to be correct than the decision produced by an autocract because in democracy, a lot more people thinks about it.<br><br>Hence the statement about tapping into collective intelligence and wisedom. </span><br><br><span style="color: darkblue;">I see your arguments, but I don't see them to be against mine because you completely mistook what I was trying to say.<br><br>For godness sake, would you and Maurizo13 stop being simply zealous to the point of fanatic about democracy and give some room to discuss it. Ironically the aggressive nature of both you guys' argument are very undemocractic</span></div>

Rousseau's 5 hunter theory, social contract concept and others before him influenced the French Revolution heavily</span>.<br><br><span style="color: red;">Since the end of WW2, we have seen European dominated Colonies gaining independence across the globe - how many of these ex-colonies can you named to be poor and are democratic ?</span><br><br><span style="color: darkblue;">Indonesia and India (Arguable, depends on how you define poor and democracy). Nigeria, Ghana, Botswana(used to be riched, but kenna hit badly by AIDS), just to name a few. Lots of other poor countries, but hardly anywhere near the democracy mark to make it to the list.</span><br><br><span style="color: darkred;">More often than not - and up till this present day, it is the autocratic and dictatorial countries that continue to be backward and pushed into poverty - Cuba, Indonesia </span>(<span style="color: blue;">recently said to be more democratic than Singapore in another thread</span>), <span style="color: red;">Myanmar, Philippines, Zimbabwe -<br><br>and it was only until recently when China decide to loosen its Dictatorial Political Ideology that it became prosperous. </span><br><span style="color: darkblue;">A certain Dr Dong Yu Zhen would argue against that. He recently published a book "Ju Ren De Bei Ying" which argues that China's present economy power depended a lot on previous infrastructure established in the times of Mao. It's a rather interesting read (ISBN 981-04-8534-4)</span><br><br><span style="color: darkred;"><br>However, was China's decision based on any democratic move to be where she is in her present political form ?<br><br>No matter how you twist the situation, it does not justify any dictator - whether benevolent or not - to usurp the Citizen's Political Rights and make all decisions as to where, why, when, who, and how we live or live with.</span><br><span style="color: darkblue;">My imagined scenario here is, what if the rights were not usurp? But voluntarily given up? The question is still the Rosseau's political paradox, should anyone be "forced to be free?"</span><br><br><span style="color: red;">You previously wrote that in your reading of <span style="font-style: italic;">''the Machivalli discourses, which features republican ideas, they are very similar to what Singapore is currently doing''</span> - and you also asked <span style="font-style: italic;">''would it be wrong for people to subscribe to the second?''</span>.<br><br>Machiavelli was a 15th Century Political Philosopher and is only one amongst the many political philosophers articulate in the writings on the Political Philosophy of <span style="font-style: italic;">''the Republic''</span>.<br><br>Is Singapore's version of <span style="font-style: italic;">''Machiavelli's Republicanism''</span> the only form that will be beneficial to Singaporeans </span>?<br><br><span style="color: darkblue;">No, I was just entertaining the thought if LKY had actually ripped a couple of pages of the discourses. And the other point was trying to asked if Lazerlordz would object very much to the republican definition of freedom aka "Freedom from domination" as his postings sugests that he subscribes more to the liberal school of definition, "Freedom from interferance"</span><br><br>It is political convenience that the present Singapore Politicall Party has borrowed this philosophy - only in parts - with the obscene intention of entrenching itself permanently in the Politics of Governing Singapore.<br><br>Even amongst the contemporaries of Machiavelli, they will collectively agree that their traditional philosophy of Republicanism share many common ideas and concerns - ''such as the importance of <span style="font-style: italic;">civic virtue, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">political participation</span>, the dangers of corruption, the benefits of a mixed constitution and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the Rule of Law</span>, etc.; and it is characteristic of their rhetorical style to draw heavily on classical examples -- (from Cicero and the Latin historians expecially) -- in presenting their arguments. (In the light of the last point, this is sometimes referred to as the 'classical republican' or 'neo-roman' tradition in political thought).''</span><br><br>Is there any justification for someone to lead a community out of poverty, and to subsequently rule as a benevolent despot - even if one is seemingly given legitimacy by being returned through some cleverly <span style="font-style: italic;">''manipulated''</span> electoral process ?<br><br>My exampe were not meant to be used under a "manipulated" electoral process, what I'm saying is, if you hold a poll tomorrow and majority of the people voted again democracy, should we still be democratic?<br><br>If Singapore is a true Republic - is there any Rule of Law, or is the Law being used to Rule with terror over the People ?<br><br>Try reading the following about <span style="font-style: italic;">[b]<a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/republicanism/" rel="nofollow">''Republicanism''</a></span></strong> and grasp the debate in what is known as <span style="font-style: italic;">''Civic Repubicanism''</span><br>[/color]<br><br>Like I said dude, just leave Singapore and PAP out of this, people here seems to have developed somekind of mental allergy to these two and everytime they come to mind, everything just get block.<br><br>[/b]</blockquote></div>
