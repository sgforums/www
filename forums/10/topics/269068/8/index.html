Or if he is still the owner or retain his seat in the law firm that he started with his wife ?<br><br>If you need to know go ask Chee Soon Juan - the Man, himself directly, and see if he is evasive and judge him then.<br><br>In any case, is Dr Chee obliged to give any answer to you since  he is not in Public Office, nor taking any of our money that we are not prepared to give ?<br><br>For a while I had the hope that you had awaken from sleeping on the straw mat. </span><br><br></div>

It is far safer to accuse him of something unrelated or discredit him in another way.<br><br>Either way it serves the PAP no good to keep such an obvious detail as part of their "final line of defence".
