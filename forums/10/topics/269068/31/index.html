Sure I was embraressed, but I don't mind having my mistakes pointed out; I get to watch out for it in the future.<br><br>My issue was your aggressive arguments which tends to exclude people from discussion rather than engaging them. Calling names is only one of the tactics, other things like<br>"Sometimes I really wonder if you are an anti-pap agent and that you are here to make PAP look stupid"<br>or<br>"Suggest you stick to Straits Times and Lian He for your daily propaganda.

The thing is that the opposition does not have any policies because they are not in control of the government.<br><br>About engaging in productive discussion, you seem to have omitted my reply to your post about New Zealand students.

The taxation system and income distribution is almost communist, University lecturers for examples don't earn much more than Kindagarden Teachers, which led to regular strikes.<br><br>New Zealand has its charm and I certainly wouldn't mind staying there for my whole life, but it's not as perfect as it would seem from here.<br><br>Oh, on a second note, although their ministers are not paid as much as ours, they often run into money scandals, Don Brash and his party were associated with Exclusive Bretham due to some dodgy donations. The Attorney General didn't pay his own company's tax or something, some trade minister got Thais to work on his house for free in exchange for rights to stay and the ruling Labour party attempting to pass retrospective laws to clear themselves of misusing campaign funds and such.

The youths were used to spending future money from young and many took loans for school, cars and houses. High school students were often seen driving 4WD which is definitely outside of their purchasing power. The problem has been recognised and was featured by a number of news program in the country. The society over there is getting worried about it(basically older generations getting worried about the younger ones) because it seems like it's developing into a culture where the youths are used to living a good life and wants more than they could actually afford.<br></div></blockquote>So....based on this observation, you determined that the youths are heavily in debt and don't clear their debts till the day they die?<br><br>What kind of 4WD are they driving? Rolls Royce or Bentley? A typical Toyota RAV4 only cost below NZ 30,000 (estimated). First of all, finance companies and banks are not as naive as you, if you want a loan, you definitely need collateral and downpayment. If you fail to make payments for your car or house, the finance company will repo your car or house, sell it off to make good on the loan. Therefore the market value of the car or house will always be above your loan amount. No rational business would want to make a loss in a business transaction.

However, that was still beyond the means of high school students which I was refering to <blockquote>"High school students were often seen driving 4WD which is definitely outside of their purchasing power."</blockquote> As high school students tend not to have income, any vehicle would be beyond their purchasing power, much less than a 4WD. There are options to purchase cheaper vehicles, my own car cost $750.<br><br>Finance companies are not naive, but it is very easy to get cash loans and credit from banks for reasons beyond me. I personally do not have any substantiate income (some part-time jobs, but income is not really worthly of mention), but I am able to get up to $500 credit from the Bank without much problem. Finance companies such as GE money and other neighbourhood smaller financial firms often advertise on special deals such as no background checks or instant money.

Apparently this is not a problem faced by New Zealand alone as a very simlar problem was featured on Dr Phil too addressing the US youth living beyond their means. His hypothesis was that the youths were too used to the good lives at home and when they got out into the society (unlike youths in Singapore, youths in NZ and perhaps US as well, tend to be independent by around late high school and college age.), they borrow money to continue to live a lifestyle which their parents could afford, but not them.<br></div>

Or do you have a similar ideology that since it is not brought up by Straits Time, it does not exist? If you don't have a comparative figure, how do you wish to compare New Zealand with Singapore. Singapore students are different, they seldom take loan because they rely on their parent's CPF to fund their university education.<br><br>Your links also had a report in which in added up debts of car, housing, study loans to calculate the debt of the average New Zealander. I wonder if all the Singaporeans add up their mortgage on housing (overpriced housing), education (which the kids use from their parents CPF, car (our cars are extremely expensive), how will we stack up against the New Zealander?<br><br>All those links you provided is of little significance if you don't have comparative figures for Singapore.
