            <div class='col-md body'>Well dude, I have no vested interest in defending Atobe and will disagree with him if indeed I do have a different opinion.<br><br>And also I'm not trying to be a busybody, but seriously dude, I am just telling you that to any reasonable outside observer, the person who appears to be a moron in this "who is Dr. Chee" saga is not Atobe, but you. It is plainly obvious to anybody reading the post that this is a non-issue that somehow you have decided to ride to the death, as if anybody would be silly enough to ride it to the bitter end with you.<br><br>All I am saying that if you seriously want to actually have an effect, you should consider changing your tatics instead of heading down this line of argument which is unfortunately proving to be counterproductive to your own cause and actually hurting you more then it hurts Atobe.<br><br>What I am pointing out is that at the end of the day, if you carry on like this Atobe will be still around to post his very effective posts and your current tack is quite useless in taking any of that effect away.<br><br>Of course I am saying this assuming you are actually attempting to be involved in the discussion in here, if you are just in this to get in your shots to vent off some steam and get some ego boosting regardless of if your posts and arguments are rational or not then by all means do so, but nobody is going to consider what you have to say at all.<br><br>Hence you have rendered yourself a +1 dude... which while trolling might be fun for a while, you will realize sooner or later that it renders anything serious you might have to say for once totally ignored, and believe me when that happens it isn't fun.<br><br>So by all means, the choice is yours: You can carry on trolling and chasing silly lines of argument all you want, but you might find it a lonely sport quite quickly.</div>

So if your statements are indeed true, then Singapore would be 4 ranks more corrupted than New Zealand.<br><br>So based on this misstatement of fact which I have corrected you. Are all your other unsubstantiated claims reliable, or are they the same as this erroneous claim?<br><br>You need to have a backbone, learn to stand your ground and prove me wrong with facts, instead of making baseless claims and side tracking when confronted with facts.<br></div></blockquote>That's not what I'm implying. All I'm saying is, look, New Zealand is a great place, but it's not as perfect as most of the people in this forum think it is. It has its fill of crap too. Singapore has them, New Zeland has them. Both countries are placed at the top few for least corruption level. Sure NZ is higher than Singapore by 4 places.
