They don't have to be a zero sum game. I'm just illustrating that Democracy is not only giving you a choice, but is also asking people to think when making their choice and that the decision produced by a democracy is more likely to be correct than the decision produced by an autocract because in democracy, a lot more people thinks about it.<br><br>Hence the statement about tapping into collective intelligence and wisedom. </span></div></blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">I am not sure if it is me who have misunderstood your writing, or you have a tendency to switch from your stated position with each new clarification.<br><br>If this is not a zero sum game, as shown in your posted opinion that <span style="font-style: italic;">''...subsequent statement was then to re-present the situation where IF the collective intelligence decided against democracy, should we then continue to be democratic?''</span> ... what else can it be after your tediously elaborate explanation of how collective wisdom will determine your opinion applied to the other 4.5 Million ?<br><br>Can any sensible democracy sell itself out in favor of any Autocracy ?<br><br>Did you not read my posts about the validity of your question on the subject of <span style="font-style: italic;">''Freedom vs Bread and Butter issues''</span> ?  Did you attempt to understand the minds of the American Colonists who fought for freedom over the very Bread and Butter issues that were threatened by the British Crown ?<br>Did you even attempt to understand the minds of those Singaporeans subject to the oppressive rule of Japanese Occupation - if they will value Freedom more than Bread and Butter issues of survival ? </span><br>[quote]<strong><span style="color: darkblue;">I see your arguments, but I don't see them to be against mine because you completely mistook what I was trying to say.<br><br>For godness sake, would you and Maurizo13 stop being simply zealous to the point of fanatic about democracy and give some room to discuss it. Ironically the aggressive nature of both you guys' argument are very undemocractic</span></strong><span style="color: darkred;">You have made a poor attempt at redirecting the simple reading of what you have clearly printed that can only result in the interpretation of your simple words to express your wishy-washy uncertain and undeveloped thoughts.<br><br>How many ways do you wish to discuss the concept of Democracy vs Autocracy ?<br><br>To start with, is there any Democracy in Autocracy ?<br><br>While the concept of Democracy can probably find some room to accomodate Autocracy, it will be the death of Democracy when Autocracy come into full being - as to be Autocrat, it cannot tolerate any form of Democracy.<br><br>Stop being wishy-washy, and plant yourself more firmly into basics. </span><br><br></span></div>

Is there any outcome to your <span style="font-style: italic;">'wishy-washy'</span> position dabbling with <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>''Choices A or B''</strong></span> ? </span><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from"><span style="color: darkred;">Since the end of WW2, we have seen European dominated Colonies gaining independence across the globe - how many of these ex-colonies can you named to be poor and are democratic ?</span><br></div><div class="quote_body"><span style="color: darkblue;">Indonesia and India (Arguable, depends on how you define poor and democracy). Nigeria, Ghana, Botswana(used to be riched, but kenna hit badly by AIDS), just to name a few.

He recently published a book "Ju Ren De Bei Ying" which argues that China's present economy power depended a lot on previous infrastructure established in the times of Mao. It's a rather interesting read (ISBN 981-04-8534-4)</span></div></blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">To a diehard ideologue even the devil's work is praiseworthy.<br><br>About the only infrastructure that Mao has created is probably the structured organisation of Communist China, its multi-tiered supervisory levels that allow the Central Government to reach and monitor every individual in this vastness of its population.<br><br>As much as it provided the infrastructure for manpower control and management, it also created the obstacles to growth and prosperity; and it took the wisdom and vision of Deng Hsiao Ping to dismantle Mao's ideologue that allowed China to be where it is today.<br><br>It will be interesting read about Mao, as much as it is interesting to read LKY's personal autobiography. </span><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from"><span style="color: darkred;">However, was China's decision based on any democratic move to be where she is in her present political form ?<br><br>No matter how you twist the situation, it does not justify any dictator - whether benevolent or not - to usurp the Citizen's Political Rights and make all decisions as to where, why, when, who, and how we live or live with.</span><br></div><div class="quote_body"><span style="color: darkblue;">My imagined scenario here is, what if the rights were not usurp? But voluntarily given up? The question is still the Rosseau's political paradox, should anyone be "forced to be free?"</span></div></blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">If a man who knows not about fire, will he appreciate its use, or will he fear it more ?<br><br>In a Japanese WW2, Prisoner of War Camp, the prisoners were treated harshly and anyone who dare make any attempt to escape were cruelly punished when re-captured - to serve as a deterrent to the others from thinking the same.<br><br>Should Freedom then be forced onto those who are helpless to think, and will only succumb to the fear ? Should Freedom be forced onto those who would rather live in abject cruelty, and will not make some effort even to help the others to escape to Freedom ? </span><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from"><span style="color: darkred;">You previously wrote that in your reading of <span style="font-style: italic;">''the Machivalli discourses, which features republican ideas, they are very similar to what Singapore is currently doing''</span> - and you also asked <span style="font-style: italic;">''would it be wrong for people to subscribe to the second?''</span>.<br><br>Machiavelli was a 15th Century Political Philosopher and is only one amongst the many political philosophers articulate in the writings on the Political Philosophy of <span style="font-style: italic;">''the Republic''</span>.<br><br>Is Singapore's version of <span style="font-style: italic;">''Machiavelli's Republicanism''</span> the only form that will be beneficial to Singaporeans </span>?<br></div><div class="quote_body"><span style="color: darkblue;">No, I was just entertaining the thought if LKY had actually ripped a couple of pages of the discourses. And the other point was trying to asked if Lazerlordz would object very much to the republican definition of freedom aka "Freedom from domination" as his postings sugests that he subscribes more to the liberal school of definition, "Freedom from interferance"</span></div></blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">You did make an attempt to <span style="font-style: italic;">''take Singapre and the PAP out of the equation''</span> in your pursuit of the hypothetical idea of <span style="font-style: italic;">''following someone who can provide all the food and wealth, in exchange for complete obedience to the person''</span>.<br><br>It takes a leap of imagination to follow your line of thought at addressing Lazerlordz position. </span><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from"><span style="color: darkred;">It is political convenience that the present Singapore Politicall Party has borrowed this philosophy - only in parts - with the obscene intention of entrenching itself permanently in the Politics of Governing Singapore.<br><br>Even amongst the contemporaries of Machiavelli, they will collectively agree that their traditional philosophy of Republicanism share many common ideas and concerns - ''such as the importance of <span style="font-style: italic;">civic virtue, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">political participation</span>, the dangers of corruption, the benefits of a mixed constitution and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the Rule of Law</span>, etc.; and it is characteristic of their rhetorical style to draw heavily on classical examples -- (from Cicero and the Latin historians expecially) -- in presenting their arguments. (In the light of the last point, this is sometimes referred to as the 'classical republican' or 'neo-roman' tradition in political thought).''</span><br><br>Is there any justification for someone to lead a community out of poverty, and to subsequently rule as a benevolent despot - even if one is seemingly given legitimacy by being returned through some cleverly <span style="font-style: italic;">''manipulated''</span> electoral process ?<br><br>My exampe were not meant to be used under a "manipulated" electoral process, what I'm saying is, if you hold a poll tomorrow and majority of the people voted again democracy, should we still be democratic?<br><br>If Singapore is a true Republic - is there any Rule of Law, or is the Law being used to Rule with terror over the People ?<br><br>Try reading the following about <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong><a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/republicanism/" rel="nofollow">''Republicanism''</a></strong></span> and grasp the debate in what is known as <span style="font-style: italic;">''Civic Repubicanism''</span><br></span><br></div><div class="quote_body"><span style="color: blue;">Like I said dude, just leave Singapore and PAP out of this, people here seems to have developed somekind of mental allergy to these two and everytime they come to mind, everything just get block.</span><br></div></blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">When a dog raise its hind leg to position itself against the wall, one should know that pee will follow - can that be ignored ?<br><br>You may not wish to be the wall to receive the pee, but - like it or not - that dog is still going to pee... the best thing is to get out of the way unless you want to get drenched.<br><br>Is it allergy towards the pee, or is it not the smarter thing to do in addressing and responding to it ?<br><br>Why hide the fact that the pee will drench oneself ?<br></span><br></div>

This year, the republic celebrates its 40th National Day; what will it be like in another 40 years?<br><br>How much of today's Singapore and Singaporeans will remain?<br><br>The ladies that evening had gone to the same school in the late 60s and were now mothers (and a few grandmothers) with children aged 20 to 28.<br><br>As the night wore on, I found out that the majority of their offspring were graduates or studying in universities, half of them overseas.<br><br>I soon learned that most had every intention of remaining abroad. The parents, mostly conservative people, had spoken of it matter-of-factly, as if it was a natural thing to do. From a handful, the number of Singaporean emigrants has turned into a torrent as globalisation intensified and jobs became harder to come by in Singapore.<br><br>Some are looking for more space, a freer lifestyle and bigger opportunities - what they think smallish Singapore cannot give.<br><br>All this - rising migration and a low birth rate - has become Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's biggest challenge, totally different problems his father encountered.<br><br>It will change Singapore's demography and its future.<br><br>Consider this: every year, 6,000 to 7,000 Singaporeans leave to settle down overseas, including many professionals. This is 15% of today's annual births, probably the highest proportion in the world.<br><br>One website survey, which is unverified, has put Singapore's average outflow at 26.11 migrants per 1,000 citizens, the second highest in the world - next only to East Timor (51.07).<br><br>Fortunately, the loss is replaced by the influx of foreigners, numerically speaking. For every one who leaves, three or four outsiders flock in to take his place.<br><br>For Singapore, it will mean a larger population and a weaker national cohesion. The "foreign" content will steadily increase as the "local" portion declines.<br><br>These recent developments offer little hope for improvement:<br><br>* Nearly half of all Singaporeans do not think they need to be a resident to be emotionally rooted to the country.<br><br>* Six out of 10 undergraduates said they wanted to go abroad to live or work mostly for better economic and job prospects, and enjoy a higher quality of life with less stress. About 7% attributed it to a lack of sense of belonging.<br><br>* An ACNielsen poll showed 21% of Singaporeans, mainly professionals, were considering emigration, half opting for Australia and New Zealand.<br><br>* Between 100,000 and 150,000 Singaporeans are studying, working or in business in foreign countries; leaders fear that many of them will not return.<br><br>This failure to build a strong-enough sense of belonging is ironic considering the state's rapid growth.<br><br>In 40 years, it has shot from a backwater to one of Asia's richest economies, with living standards envied by many.<br><br>The dilemma has led to calls for a redefinition of the word "citizen" to include Singaporeans who have become foreign citizens or PRs, if they retain a strong emotional home link. This is short of dual citizenship which is rejected by the government.<br><br>In recent years, I have detected a steady shift away from an inflexible attitude that condemned all Singaporeans who leave to improve their fortunes abroad as "quitters" or, worse still, "disloyal" citizens.<br><br>It is now accepted that they are not the same as people (a much smaller number) who have abandoned Singapore for good.<br><br>In fact, the opposite may be taking place.<br><br>Instead of condemning them, many conservative parents and some younger political leaders now believe that having its new generation working long periods overseas, without losing their loyalty, should be encouraged.<br><br>What is making it a necessary evil is the rapid change in the global - and Singapore's own uncertain - economy, rather than any domestic argument of right and wrong.<br><br>Singapore's future lies beyond its shores and Singaporeans can best serve their homeland if they are able to seize opportunities abroad.<br><br>Anyway, unlike before, the country can no longer provide jobs for every qualified youth.<br><br>The change in official attitude is evident. It wasn't too long ago that it set a cap on university places for doctors and lawyers for fear of unemployment.<br><br>Today, with the wider horizon in mind, the goal is to provide top education to meet a global demand.<br><br>"While loyalty to one's own nation is a virtue, the search for a better life elsewhere is not, in itself, a moral sin," Hansen Yeong wrote in a letter to the press.<br><br>Older leaders like Lee Kuan Yew and Goh Chok Tong may not have changed their strong feelings about "quitters" but they have stopped criticising them in public.<br><br>Theirs is one of acceptance of the inevitable and moving to derive some benefits from it.<br><br>A result has been organising ex-Singaporeans in committees in several world cities to contribute ideas and promote business ties with Singapore.<br><br>Some critics blame the ruling party in part and say unless it frees more of its control on society, things will worsen.<br><br>Sinapan Samydorai, president of civil rights group Think Centre, said: "It's the failure of the government to understand the will of the people that leads them to move overseas."<br><br>There are, however, other reasons for optimism that the situation will eventually right itself.<br><br>Firstly, the state has set a birthrate target of 50,000 compared to the present 35,000. It is providing fresh incentives worth more than half a billion dollars a year, a powerful nudge to reluctant couples.<br><br>Some of those who take up foreign PRs are likely to return home eventually with a more rounded view of life.<br><br>Fong, a woman who had spent five years in Amsterdam, said online that she now had a better understanding of the good and bad, both of Singapore (she once disliked) and the West.<br><br>Sharing the view was university student Tyco who had lived in the UK for 15 years since eight. He found it hard to understand people who say the grass is always greener elsewhere.<br><br>He said he was ready to return and rough it out even if a job is hard to get.
