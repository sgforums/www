A priceless item (ie your knowledge in this case) can be viewed in 2 ways<br>1) priceless to people who knows its value and thus is deemed of a value beyond any possible pricing<br>2) "priceless" to a fool who does not know its value and treats it as a piece of garbage (no value coz its garbage to him).<br><br>The best way of handling such a person is to report to the authorities of this certain person whom is accusing the govt of a conspiracy with CSJ, which is tantamount to defaming the reputation of our Govt.</div>
