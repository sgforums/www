              <p><strong>Total wages in Singapore up by 7-year high of 5.9% in 2007<br>Posted: 30 June 2008 1115 hrs</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>SINGAPORE: Despite the fact that Singapore's economy grew by a lower 7.7 per cent in 2007 compared to 8.2 per cent in 2006, wages grew strongly last year.</p>
              <p>Total wages – basic wages plus bonuses – of private sector employees rose by a seven-year high of 5.9 per cent in 2007, higher than the increase of 4.5 per cent the year before.</p>
              <p>Although inflation was higher in 2007, resulting in a lower increase of real basic wage, the real total wage increase of 3.8 per cent last year was still higher than 2006's 3.5 per cent.</p>
              <p>Labour productivity growth, however, declined from 1.5 per cent in 2006 to -0.9 per cent in 2007, partly due to record employment gains last year.</p>
              <p>The National Wages Council (NWC), in its recommendation of wage guidelines this year, said companies should grant built-in wage increase commensurate with the companies' performance as well as business prospects so that such increments are sustainable.</p>
              <p>It added that companies which have done exceptionally well should consider granting workers a higher variable payment.</p>

              <p>There must be a reason for the Official Propaganda machine to churn out the good news - could it be the harsh times that Singaporeans are sinking into that require an injection of desparately needed "good" news ?</p>
              <p>Was it not in 2007 that the Department of Statistics again confirmed that even as Singapore achieved a First World GDP per capita of US$29,000 -  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.chinapost.com.tw/business/2007/11/12/130587/Singapore-income.htm">‘Singapore income gap widens with economic boom’.  </a>?</p>
              <p>Has Singaporeans recovered from the shock that - <a rel="nofollow" href="http://singaland.blogspot.com/2006_12_01_archive.html">‘Two surveys by the Dept of Statistics, Household Expenditure Survey 2003 and General Household Survey 2005, showed that 40% of Singapore Households not only had declining incomes but were also unable to pay their monthly bills !’.  </a>before being hit again by the 2007 report ?</p>
              <p>Singapore's Gini co-efficient, a measure of income inequality, has worsened from 42.5 in 1998 to 47.2 in 2006 - and is in league with the Philippines (46.1}, and Guatemal (48.3), and worse than China {44.7}.</p>
