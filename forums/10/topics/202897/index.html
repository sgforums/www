            <div class='col-md body'>This is about managed healthcare, which is quite common in the US and also in Australia. The healthcare company signs an agreement with a group of doctors who will treat patients who have taken up a medical insurance with them. In turn, the healthcare company pays the doctors for their services.<br><br>A big and powerful managed healthcare (MHC) company can monopolize the market and pressure its doctors to cut services, reduce lab investigations and prescribe cheaper drugs to cut costs. New doctors often find it difficult to survive as private practitioners because the MHC is able to offer patients lower healthcare costs by virtue of its size. But patients pay in other ways, as this report illustrates..<br><br>We do not face such a big problem in Singapore but company doctors are often under pressure by the company to restrict MCs and there is a cap on prescriptions as well. For example, the company may restrict the doctor to prescribe no more than $20 worth of medication each visit. Some doctors bypass this problem by giving half the course of antibiotics and advise the patient to return when the medication is completed. They can then give the second half of the antibiotic course as it is considered as separate visit.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Medical costs will always be expensive in the more developed countries. It is just a matter who foots the bill.<br><br>In Britain, it is the government, but at the expense of taxing the people more, and having an inefficient service.<br><br>In the US, group insurance is the thing.<br><br>In the past, and in less developed countries, healthcare costs is cheap because modern drugs and technology, both of which cost lots of money, is simply unavailable.<br><br>Paradoxically, our average life-span has increased significantly even before the advent of things like MRI machines, top-of-the-line surgery, or modern chemotherapy. The main factors are better nutrition, simple vaccinations and improved living conditions. The fancy new stuff does make an improvement, but only slightly. Therein lies the problem for our government, trying to keep a cap on healthcare costs (not sure, but I think our government spends very little on health compared to the west), knowing we have reached the stage that pouring a lot more money in would not reap a lot of improvements in return.<br><br>Notice how our Health Minister is always harping on cutting costs. Little mention about the government spending more of its budget on health? The minister for law is a lawyer, but the minister for health is an adminstrator.</div>

The idea is that different people recover at different rates...you can always extend the MC, but you are not supposed to give everyone longer MC than required.</div>

As explained, there are companies that are not set up by doctors, but by administrators that arrange for other companies to subscribe for healthcare. These middlemen would then source for GPs who are willing to join up. It is these middlemen who ask for the charges for each visit to be capped at a certain amount. The GPs could either acquiese in this arrangement, or not join up. They DO NOT have a say. Rather then blame the medical staff, it is the middlemen who made this arrangement. And by being the middlemen, they get a chunk of the money, as you can imagine.<br><br>And to get to the bottom of it, it is ultimately the employers who ask for this as a means to reduce the amount of money they have to pay up. The only way doctors would be able to get around this is to set up a "middleman" company themselves.<br><br>And as I have explained, some diseases need a certain course of medications, that would cost more than the capped charges. Hence to avoid having the patient from paying up the difference, the patient returns for a second visit, which would again be paid for by his/her employer. It has nothing to do with inefficient medications. And anyway, some illnesses take time to run its course.</div>
