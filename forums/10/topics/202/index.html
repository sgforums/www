            <div class='col-md body'>wah since when you enter OCS have -proven methods-<br><br>either you have it. or you dont. officers are selected by peer appraisal sometime in your BMT. so if you've proven yourself to be a good leader and shown yourself to be respectable among your batchmates, they'll write good things abt you and you'll go to OCS.<br>and there's another way. which is by studies. i dont know if this is still in place but most of the time people with 'A' level have higher chances of being an officer. or is a requirement? i cant remember. and there are scholars who are officers too. but they are officers only because of that. doesnt mean that they can lead.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To enter OCS there are a couple of criteria;<br>1) education - either poly, A level (minimum)or degree holder as a prerequisite. Anything *lower*, sorry.<br><br>2) fitness - PES A and B only. anything else *sorry* and not just passing your IPPT. you need to score well.<br><br>3) peer appraisal - if your peers think you're shit, then the officers will be very hesitent about recommending you to OCS; cos chances are that if you can't even get along with your peers - you'd be a shit leader.<br><br>4) PSC Scholar - unfair as it may sound these b*stards worm their way into OCS purely cos they have some O(^*%*( scholarship. Many of these people are lousy soldiers, but hey, this is S'pore. Got paper qualifications can already. MINDEFwill close both eyes.<br><br>5) If your father is bigshot and plays golf with LKY or GCT - duh.<br><br>6) BMT performance - usually the platoon best 5-6 will get it. Or if you go to SISPEC, don't fret, if you do well, and come int within the top 10% (i could be wrong) you also get recommended to join OCS<br><br>Hope that helps<br></div>

Actually not only Pes A and B enlistees go to OCS, Pes BP (Obese) also DO get into OCS. As for IPPT, a pass is sufficient... an pass in SOC is NOT a requirement. though it helps.<br><br>3)Appraisal... peer appraisal during sit test, as well as the EOC one. Assessor and instructor appraisal is also impt.<br><br>4) Well but i think that going to OCS helps your chances of applying for a PSC scholarship.. it's not the other way round...<br>but  being a scholar definitely helps.<br><br>6)Yup.. BMT results lar..for everything..<br>from BTP to IFC to personal Turn out and bearing.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Why the big fuss about OCS? It's one of the worst place you could be during your NS times. If you are capable enough, have the potential to be one, don't need all these tips and 'wayang' your way in the army.<br><br>Unless you thinking of signing on, but then if you do............DEFINITELY go in, but have to tie this ribbon round your neck.... the bond that doesn't decides what you WANT to do but more of where they lack manpower, that's life for the next couple of years.<br><br>CAn tell us why you so hard up for OCS?</div>
