Whether a company close shop is a cashflow issue, if you have lots of cash, you can sustain alot of losses, there is no need for you to close shop. The problem arises when you cannot meet your debts (interest) payments to the bank, else, if you have the funds to make these payments, though you are making losses, you will still be a going concern.<br><br>The advantage is when you can cooked (pun intended) the books, then you can claim back more input tax. Else, it is of no advantage to the GST registered business. The government is suckering unrefined hawkers and small businesses into registering so that they can collect more GST.</div>
