              <p><br> there are other jobs that pay people well but no need for them to

              allow them to work long long hours.   </p>

              <p>Even investment bankers oso need to work long long hours...people pay you good money because you bring them more money / work long long hours.</p>
              <p>Reason i do not want to go into ministerial pay is i dunno what they do and i cannot say its justified. You look at it at face value and one will tell you that the pay is obscene. They can say that its hard to find talent so need money to lure talent. That however is a problem they caused....anyway it's a long story and can be left to an existing thread.</p>

              <p>a fren of mine is an investment banker with a dutch bank here. clients are mainly filty rich europeans. he practically lives on their time zone looking after their investment interests in asia.</p>
              <p>the reward is mindboggling. he is at least 50x richer than me today. he was my senior with just a year head start in working life than me. once, his client paid fully for his london trip as a small reward for a good job done.</p>
              <p>when i think back that during my early post-nus job hunting years, i deliberately shun banking jobs despite having a economics degree with focus on financial econs and investments. i had thought that it was boring and sitting on a desk all day long didn't appeal to me. i realized today that i am the fool. <br>for the pap, my belief is that they worked long hours too. however, most are not revenue generating, it is more administrative. my mp has a 3 meet-the-people nite sessions in a week. i personally do not have that kind of stamina. do they deserve the pay? i think not. </p>

              <p>Thus, does this mean as long as MNCs can find cheaper workers regardless of job titles and skillsets, you can be replaced in the name of cost cutting which means more profit which means CEO more happy as personal happiness increase many many?</p>
