            <div class='col-md body'>To my friends,<br><br>I've been hearing a lot of talk about "bombing Afghanistan back<br>to the Stone Age." Ronn Owens, on KGO Talk Radio today, allowed<br>that this would mean killing innocent people, people who had nothing<br>to do with this atrocity, but "we're at war, we have to accept<br>collateral damage. What else can we do?" Minutes later I heard<br>some TV pundit discussing whether we "have the belly to do what<br>must be done."<br><br>And I thought about the issues being raised especially hard because I<br>am from Afghanistan, and even though I've lived here for 35 years<br>I've never lost track of what's going on there. So I want to tell<br>anyone who will listen how it all looks from where I'm standing. I<br>speak as one who hates the Taliban and Osama Bin Laden. There is no<br>doubt in my mind that these people were responsible for the atrocity<br>in New York. I agree that something must be done about those<br>monsters. But the Taliban and Ben Laden are not Afghanistan. They're<br>not even the government of Afghanistan. The Taliban are a cult of<br>ignorant psychotics who took over Afghanistan in 1997.<br><br>Bin Laden is a political criminal with a plan. When you think<br>Taliban, think Nazis. When you think Bin Laden, think Hitler. And<br>when you think "the people of Afghanistan" think "the<br>Jews in the concentration camps." It's not only that the Afghan<br>people had nothing to do with this atrocity. They were the first<br>victims of the perpetrators. They would exult if someone would come<br>in there, take out the Taliban and clear out the rats nest of<br>international thugs holed up in their country. Some say, why don't<br>the Afghans rise up and overthrow the Taliban? The answer is, they're<br>starved, exhausted, hurt, incapacitated, suffering.<br><br>A few years ago, the United Nations estimated that there are 500,000<br>disabled orphans in Afghanistan-a country with no economy, no food.<br>There are millions of widows. And the Taliban has been burying these<br>widows alive in mass graves. The soil is littered with land mines,<br>the farms were all destroyed by the Soviets. These are a few of the<br>reasons why the Afghan people have not overthrown the Taliban.<br><br>We come now to the question of bombing Afghanistan back to the Stone<br>Age. Trouble is, that's been done. The Soviets took care of it<br>already. Make the Afghans suffer? They're already suffering. Level<br>their houses? Done. Turn their schools into piles of rubble? Done.<br>Eradicate their hospitals? Done. Destroy their infrastructure? Cut<br>them off from medicine and health care? Too late. Someone already did<br>all that. New bombs would only stir the rubble of earlier bombs.<br>Would they at least get the Taliban? Not likely.<br><br>In today's Afghanistan, only the Taliban eat, only they have the<br>means to move around. They'd slip away and hide. Maybe the bombs<br>would get some of those disabled orphans, they don't move too fast,<br>they don't even have wheelchairs. But flying over Kabul and dropping<br>bombs wouldn't really be a strike against the criminals who did this<br>horrific thing. Actually it would only be making common cause with<br>the Taliban-by raping once again the people they've been raping all<br>this time. So what else is there? What can be done, then?<br><br>Let me now speak with true fear and trembling. The only way to get<br>Bin Laden is to go in there with ground troops. When people speak of<br>"having the belly to do what needs to be done" they're<br>thinking in terms of having the belly to kill as many as needed.<br>Having the belly to overcome any moral qualms about killing innocent<br>people. Let's pull our heads out of the sand. What's actually on the<br>table is Americans dying. And not just because some Americans would<br>die fighting their way through Afghanistan to Bin Laden's hideout.<br>It's much bigger than that folks. Because to get any troops to<br>Afghanistan, we'd have to go through Pakistan. Would they let us? Not<br>likely. The conquest of Pakistan would have to be first. Will other<br>Muslim nations just stand by? You see where I'm going.<br><br>We're flirting with a world war between Islam and the West. And guess<br>what: that's Bin Laden's program. That's exactly what he wants.<br>That's why he did this. Read his speeches and statements. It's all<br>right there. He really believes Islam would beat the west. It might<br>seem ridiculous, but he figures if he can polarize the world into<br>Islam and the West, he's got a billion soldiers. If the west wreaks a<br>holocaust in those lands, that's a billion people with nothing left<br>to lose, that's even better from Bin Laden's point of view. He's<br>probably wrong, in the end the west would win, whatever that would<br>mean, but the war would last for years and millions would die, not<br>just theirs but ours.<br><br>Who has the belly for that? Bin Laden does. Anyone else?<br><br>Tamim Ansary<br><br>I wonder why US didnt help the Afghanistans against the Taliban when thousands of them were killed. Maybe American lives are more equal than Afghanistans lives.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>in our eyes, the afghans are suffering, due to lack of food and proper amenities of living. but deep in their souls, they have God. What more can a person who believes in God (Allah) asks for, if that person can be in constant closeness to God?<br><br>that is why, outsiders, will never know what the natives of the land are really feeling about, or thinking about. The afghan who is in USA writting that article, he doesn't know what it feels to be an afghan in afghanistan, if he talks bad about the taliban, who he said gets to eat, while the rest of the people suffer, how about him? he left afghanistan, and migrate to the Us, for over 35 years, has he ever done anything to help that country?<br><br>only afghans in afghanistan know the truth of the matter, media makes us think, we know the truth, but the truth is only within those very people. The best is, we mind our own business, and help whenever possible, and not by wars certainly, by giving real help like food, money, clothes and so on.<br><br>anyway, watever it is, killings are bad, it's people who make them look justified and good. If everyone is to take an eye for an eye, the whole world will go blind. inspired by mahatma gandhi.<br><br>osama or no osama, our world has already been widespread with killings. it's only about time, we learn about such things happening, especially in our sunny island singapore. it is the reality of life, which the garmen tries hard to conceal, so we don't get to panicky and start asking questions, which have answers that would take the garmen out. well, it's ur life. u think about it, and decide on it, and live with ur decision.<br></div>
