The moment the govt gets its dirty hands on R&amp;D- which it shouldn't have done- and with the civil servants and A*Star "scholars" in place, there will not be enough freedom for these scientists to do their research.<br><br>Unlike in South Korea, where the govt only gives them verbal encouragement, and research facilities, they don't take a heavy handed approach and interfere in everything.

            <div class='col-md body'>By: Mellanie Hewlitt<br>Source: Singapore Review<br>Date: 8 Jan 2003<br>(First Published on Singapore Review)<br><br>http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Sg_Review/message/76<br><br>In the 4 Jan 2003 issue of the Straits Times (PhD pool to be expanded with new<br>scholarships), Mr Philip Yeo adopted the analogy of PHDs as an investment. Let<br>me play devil's advocate and apply simple Cost/Benefits analysis to his<br>analogy.<br><br>"A full scholarship from undergraduate to PhD level, including salary, fees and allowance, works out to a hefty $900,000 or so per student."<br><br>When can we expect to recover initial CAPEX and outlay of $900k? Definitely not<br>during the minimum 4-6 years when the scholar is completing his PHD. This is<br>a "Holding Period" for the investment horizon.<br><br>Now let's see the Benefits side of the equation. Going along the lines of Mr<br>Yeo's analogy, let us treat human capital like a stock or a bond and apply<br>basic Valuation Theory where:<br><br>Â“Total Expected ReturnPHDÂ” = Â“Current YieldPHDÂ” + Â“Capital Gains YieldPHDÂ”<br><br>What is the Current Yield on the PHD "Talent"? PHD scholars are not productive<br>assets and do not earn any cash returns whilst in school. Also, unlike a share<br>(or bond) there is no dividend (or coupon) return during this 4 year Holding<br>Period. So Current Yield of PHD is virtually zero.<br><br>As for the Capital Gains Yield, that may or may not take place and is a<br>function of the scholar's estimated salary (the price of the investment) if and<br>when he does find gainful employment 4 years later. Unlike a share or bond, you<br>also cannot "liquidate" a scholar. So what is the potential return on a<br>PHD "Talent" in 4 years time? This potential return is even harder to estimate<br>when you consider that there is a Risk Premium to be weighted.<br><br>RISKS:<br>What is the Market Risk Premium here? There are several risks, the first and<br>most obvious being that after the 4 year Holding Period, conditions in the<br>labour market have changed so drastically that there is no avenue for<br>employment of these highly trained professional scholars. In that worst-case<br>scenario, the human capital will not reap any return at all.<br><br>Additionally, there is also the Asset Default Risk taken on the actual stock<br>(or in this case the scholar himself). What happens if he fails the course and<br>has to repeat an entire semester? This would delay his final entry into the<br>labour market and increase the Hold Period which also increases the window of<br>risk exposure. Or, what happens if we have a bond breaker? That would mean the<br>entire investment has to be written off.<br><br>Finally, the Holding Period itself is a window of risk that may not necessarily<br>be limited to only 4 years. Many of these graduates have already been in<br>university for 3-4 years for their undergraduate degree before embarking a<br>further 4 years on the PHD program. So this brings the sum total of the<br>gestation period or 'holding period to 7-8 years. Factor in another 2-3 years<br>in full time National Service, this would mean that the scholar will be close<br>to 30 years old before he is finally ready to start work. Of cause, one way to<br>reduce this risk is to have the scholar pursue his PHD course whilst gainfully<br>employed.<br><br>So, is a PHD Talent worth $900k? The above valuation theory is unable to<br>confirm this conclusion.<br><br>What then is the object of this entire PHD exercise? Quoting A*Star chairman<br>Philip Yeo, "Eventually, they (the PHD scholars) will become a key attraction<br>to multinational companies to move their high-end research projects to<br>Singapore".<br><br>This is a rather ambiguous, distant and vague outcome to wager an investment<br>on. The availability of research expertise is only one of a myriad of factors<br>that will influence a foreign MNC's decision in setting up shop here. Each MNC<br>will have its own individual needs and requirements. These include<br>political/economic environment, logistical factors, tax-incentives,<br>operating/production cost base, industrial factors, infrastructure and support<br>Â… the list goes on.<br><br>And let us also not forget that talent and expertise can be bought and<br>imported. But I will not digress into a discussion on Foreign Talent today.<br><br>Given those numbers and odds, it is understandable why there is some doubt<br>regarding Mr Yeo's latest investment product and his overwhelming fascination<br>with the accumulation of paper qualifications, which also begets the question:<br>have we lost the better part of ourselves in this on-going paper chase?<br><br>Perhaps itÂ’s time to step back and look at things in perspective.<br><br></div>

Sg_Review@yahoogroups.com<br>Send Email<br><br>Editor's Word;<br><br>Earlier this year, a New Paper journalist had approached me regarding a<br>Singapore Review article which debated the merits of investing in PHDs.<br><br>I initially gave permission to New Paper to re-print the article. However, on<br>hearing that my article would be heavily edited and subject to comment by<br>various members of the NUS academic profession, I had withdrawn my consent. It<br>sounded like a clandestine set-up to me and I wanted nothing to do with it.<br><br>Having heard nothing further from the New paper, I assumed the New paper and<br>SPH had abandoned the story (as I had also requested for them to inform me<br>should they publish the story).<br><br>This incident was long forgotten until a colleague e-mailed me the New paper<br>article. In true underhanded Singapore Press fashion, the New Paper had<br>published a one sided version of the story. Whilst brief mention was made to my<br>article, this was purely done as an opening to provide avenues for the four NUS<br>academics/professors to launch their premise. My initial fears were well<br>founded and it was a set-up in typical SPH fashion with New paper holding all<br>the cards. I was out matched and out numbered 4-1.<br><br>What is noteworthy is the fact that the New Paper had approached (of all<br>professions) various academics (four professors from the NUS) for<br>their "unbiased" and "objective" views. This is akin to approaching a cigarette<br>manufacturer for a confirmation on the health benefits of Nicotine consumption.<br><br>Additionally, the New Paper had focused on only 1 solitary company which was<br>set-up by the same four NUS Professors.<br><br>To be honest, this is not the first time I have had to put up with "selective<br>myopia" from Singapore's local press. In this instance, the surreptitious<br>nature of the New paper article left my blood boiling.<br><br>For the sake of clarity, I have appended both articles (unedited) below for<br>benefit of readers so they can see both sides of the story.<br><br>Singapore Review Article:<br>http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Sg_Review/message/76<br><br>New Paper Article:<br>http://newpaper.asia1.com.sg/top/story/0,4136,18449-1046966340,00.html<br></div>
