              <p>If more real stat is being known by people, i think more people will go against them. To keep you ignorant from truth is one of their strategy in staying in power.</p>

              <p>To me, this is history repeating itself. Our forefathers are no different from the foreigners you currently see on the streets of Singapore. Like these foreigners, our forefathers came to Singapore (from their villages in China, India, etc) to make a living. Like these foreigners, our forefathers had no intention of planting their roots in Singapore. Like these foreigners, our forefathers had to face the wrath of the local population as they strive to feed their families.</p>
              <p>But things change after 3 generations. You and me no longer see ourselves as Chinese or Indian, but as Singaporean who are deeply rooted to this land. Bottomline is that foreigners need time to be fully assimilated into our society. 3 or 4 generations later, their descendents will be like us - lamenting about the foreigners invading the streets of Singapore.</p>

              <p>I think you're wrong on both. It was a lot more difficult to travel between Singapore and China, or India, in those days, so new migrants - mostly indentured labour - didn't have much of a choice. To say they had no intention of planting roots is disingenuous, to say the least. No one really thought about planting roots - it just happened.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And those were completely different times - China was divided among the imperial powers, as was India. Everyone was under colonial rule - life was hard. People were more occupied with daily bread and butter. There was no question of facing the locals' wrath because everyone was brought here by, and ruled, by the white man.</p>

              <p>History ? Not so.</p>
              <p>Back in those days. There's no such thing as NS. Perhaps when NS is abolished, youngsters will no longer feel pushed into a corner.. disadvantaged due to this mandatory obligation.</p>
              <p>Back in those days, there's room for everyone and newcomers. Now, we live on reclaimed land, work our ass off to pay for a small HDB pigeon hole.</p>
              <p>Back in those days, there's plenty to go around, as long as you are willing to slog it out and be thrifty. Today.. we are competing for our livelihood, wages going down , cost of living going up.</p>
              <p>Back then, our forefathers could farm for their daily meal. Now, what do we do to get food on the tables ? A job, and who competes with us ? The stakes are much higher now.</p>
              <p>Our forefathers came to a fishing village. Now, the foreigners come and enjoy the fruits of our forefathers, stepping their filthy feet on the children of those who developed this land.</p>
              <p>How can we welcome them with open arms ?</p>
