              <p>Hi LordoftheLamers</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I simply can't make sense of what you're saying.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"There was a change the year after I got PR in about 2005 or so."</p>
              <p>What change was that? As far as I know, there has been no change at all in PR status vis-a-vis doing NS.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"I found that out because i've met a lot of foreign students at NUS who get automatic PR upon graduation in SIngapore, they are bonded to work in Singapore for 3 years ofcourse, but no army at all."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There has never been an army requirement for Ist-gen PRs. And as far as I know, the automatic PR has been sort of scrapped. Graduates don't get invited to become PR any longer. They have to apply on their own.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"If i had waited a year i could have gone on that scheme, it is new."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you are referring to the three-year bond, it isn't something new. It has been around for quite some time.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"But the end result is still the same, foreigners that get the right to stay without seriously serving time. I feel its unfair and PR has little use now, i sweat for nothing."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You don't sound like a PR at all :)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The end result has ALWAYS been the same. Foreigners have never had to serve NS, but always get to enjoy their time in Singapore with a whole lot of privileges. And could you please elaborate on "PR has little use now" and why you have to "sweat for nothing"?</p>

              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Foreign students that are required to work 3 years in Singapore are under Singapore government scholarships, which are given to hundreds, if I am not wrong, every year (I met one on a flight to Bangkok) and they are even given money to go home once or twice a year. I think it applies only to PRC citizens or at least the majority are given to PRC.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">I don't think it has anything to do with PR status.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">I think NS applies only for citizenship status.</span></p>

              <p>As usual, Uncles like to talk about last time stories, nevetheless it shaped what it is today, perhaps by blaming the govt foreigner policies from our perspective is abit too narrow to consider as we tends to look at the present while others such as the govt may look into the future.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My next point will delight my Uncle Andrew a thousand times, after all, who voted the PAP to govt us? and when you voted them, haven't u consider their foreigner policies, did you questioned them directly during their presentation?? So, i believe most of our sg Uncles and Aunties are actually knocking themselve on the head to blame here and there but forget to blame themselve for voting the ruling party that created this mess.  </p>

              <p>I would think that only the good ones (FTs) will leave, leaving the not-so-good ones here (FWs). The FWs will spread the word that S'pore is a good place to earn money and more FWs will flock to S'pore, reducing the pie for locals.</p>
              <p>And when these FWs are willing to take a lower pay, companies will not consider locals at all. And even if they consider locals, they will expect locals to accept a lower pay.</p>
              <p>FWs spoiling the market generally will generate distaste by the locals.</p>

              <p>I thought our forefathers strive to build up Singapore to what it is today? Original shareholder's of a company should have reap more benefits than new shareholders, that's why original investors who bought Microsoft in the early 1980s reap the rewards of the company through many stock splits and stock price increases.</p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #0000ff;">"Someone who invested $10,000 in the company's IPO would own a stake worth roughly close to $3,000,000 today. "</span></em></p>
