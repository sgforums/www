              <p> Gahmen wants to welcome foreigners to earn revenue.. can lah.</p>
              <p>But first..</p>
              <p>Give all Singaporeans free housing .</p>
              <p>All Singaporeans at birth gets free education and priority to public school systems, starting from Kindergarten to University.</p>
              <p>All Singaporean children gets free medical care.</p>
              <p>When all basic neccesities are taken care of.. they can welcome as many foreigners as they want.</p>

              <p>Yeah and most of the foreigners will be from LDCs (Lesser developed countries).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It's really interesting to see how citizens/people choose to migrate to better "core" countries. European countries and America/Australia are core countries, with superior industrial/labour relations and higher quality life. Lesser developed countries like India and China and Thailand are periphery countries. Singapore is semi-periphery since it tries to dominate with mercantilistic practices (trying to implement the growth triangle programme and buying up foreign assets).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So Singaporeans choose to emigrate to better core countries like Europe or Australia, which is coincidentally what Middle Easterners are doing. While citizens from peripheries in Asia migrate to Singapore, since a semi-periphery is better than a periphery. Singapore is fab compared to the lesser developed countries in Southeast Asia. But Singapore is crap compared to EU states and Oz.</p>
              <p>Yes. It is unsurprising the bulk of people here will be foreign, and chances are they would not have served their NS because of the new PR scheme. I see masses of citizens from LDCs are the ICA offices, no Europeans at all.</p>

              <p>Yeah and most of the foreigners will be from LDCs (Lesser
              developed countries).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It's really interesting to see how citizens/people choose to
              migrate to better "core" countries. European countries and
              America/Australia are core countries, with superior
              industrial/labour relations and higher quality life. Lesser
              developed countries like India and China and Thailand are periphery
              countries. Singapore is semi-periphery since it tries to dominate
              with mercantilistic practices (trying to implement the growth
              triangle programme and buying up foreign assets).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So Singaporeans choose to emigrate to better core countries like
              Europe or Australia, which is coincidentally what Middle Easterners
              are doing. While citizens from peripheries in Asia migrate to
              Singapore, since a semi-periphery is better than a periphery.
              Singapore is fab compared to the lesser developed countries in
              Southeast Asia. But Singapore is crap compared to EU states and
              Oz.</p>
              <p>Yes. It is unsurprising the bulk of people here will be foreign,
              and chances are they would not have served their NS because of the
              new PR scheme. I see masses of citizens from LDCs are the ICA
              offices, no Europeans at all.</p>

              <p>new PR scheme so they won't have to serve NS?</p>
              <p>I thought it is always the second generation serve NS? Has there been a change?</p>
