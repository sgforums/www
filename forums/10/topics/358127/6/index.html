              <p>Actually not, there was no country back then, so my grands were

              <p>I'm not sure if you have been retrenched or out of work for a
                          long time as a freshie, but you sound like Straits Times to me.</p>
              <p>It's theoratically rosey, the picture you have painted.</p>

              <p>In terms of jobscope, if both FW and local are similar, why
                          would a boss want to pay extra when he/she could have paid
                          lower?</p>
              <p>Paying you extra because you upgraded yourselves? No way, I
                          expect you to take up more responsibilities at your
                          current pay with your additional skill-sets. No happy? The exit
                          door is right over there.</p>

              <p>if u are worth your weight in gold, why wouldnt anyone pay you ur worth? Like you said, if one local is similar to another local but yet one is willing to be paid lower, would any boss want to pay extra?</p>
              <p>You upgrade urself so that you fit in role which cannot be replace with someone willing to be paid less or easily source. Which is what the gov is trying to do.

              <p> </p>
              <p>the main flaw of sg gov is that they dun realise that they have created a country which local talent hate and despise. Hence the out flow or local talent.</p>

              <p>Sorry Bro, I said if one FW is similar to one local. And it's a stark reality that bosses will not pay extra even if you're worth the weight cuz costs is the main concern, and if you're good, they expect you to multi-task, take on more roles, thus bringing down your time for family or studies or hobbies.</p>

              <p>Actually, there may be plenty of folks out there willing to take up less desired job if they are paid appropriately. However, if bosses' can easily get much cheaper labour, they will forsake the locals.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Desired" jobs, like IT? Our frens from India can do it. Engineering, our China friends are willing to be paid cheaper. Admin? Our Philipino and Myanmese folks are easily available. Casino &amp; MICE? Our M'sian, Macau neighbours have all the experience.</p>

              <p>Actually, the outflow is to the developing countries. Our talents chose to remain in the developed countries.<br>With the FTs &amp; FWs taking up the desired jobs in Singapore, they will gain the experience at the expense of the locals, and when the US and Europe beckons in the upturn, they will just leave our shores with the experience they gained.</p>
              <p>The locals, sorry, please pay up for your next upgrading training.</p>

              <p>Yes, you are right. We should reward based on performance, irregardless of nationality. Unfortunately, many companies here are unwilling to go along this path, they would rather bring in new foreign blood, willing to slog.</p>
              <p>If an employee knows that the effort you put in will not be rewarded, instead will be replaced anytime by a cheaper source, why work hard? I'm not finding excuses for these type of people, but that's human pysche which many local companies don't understand, still having the local towkay concept, can squeeze you at a minimum price, the better.</p>

              <p>Now imagine no one bombs Sg for another 50 yrs. Imagine your life here....rising bills, more crowds, fewer jobs, more stress, more pressure, declining quality of life....you keep waiting for a bomb but nothing happens.</p>

              <p>Meantime, everyone who can leaves, but you are stuck here - unable to go, unable to compete, unable to touch your CPF money...that's worse, and quite possibly the reality of the future.</p>

              <p>Moral of story: Don't wait for an attack...try and plan your future now.</p>

              <p>Yes, you are right. We should reward based on performance, irregardless of nationality. Unfortunately, many companies here are unwilling to go along this path, they would rather bring in new foreign blood, willing to slog.</p>
              <p>If an employee knows that the effort you put in will not be rewarded, instead will be replaced anytime by a cheaper source, why work hard? I'm not finding excuses for these type of people, but that's human pysche which many local companies don't understand, still having the local towkay concept, can squeeze you at a minimum price, the better.</p>

              <p>Its is good to bring in talents, the problem is how you define talents?? are you really bringing in talents or just to make up the nos??  it does not mean you study high high means you got talent, some are goondos and cannot work and some bought their certificates just to show that they are talents. So, singapore hv to becareful of what talents they bring in...1st or 3rd tier talents?? Talent Time</p>

Our forefathers did not get anything but as generations passed, the land became fruitful and prosperous. Now foreigners coming here, very obviously are doing the reverse, which is reaping the profits and prosperity which our forefathers had gathered and gained for the past many generations.
