              <p>I think you're wrong on both. It was a lot more difficult to
              travel between Singapore and China, or India, in those days, so new
              migrants - mostly indentured labour - didn't have much of a choice.
              To say they had no intention of planting roots is disingenuous, to
              say the least. No one really thought about planting roots - it just
              happened.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And those were completely different times - China was
              divided among the imperial powers, as was India. Everyone was under
              colonial rule - life was hard. People were more occupied with daily
              bread and butter. There was no question of facing the locals' wrath
              because everyone was brought here by, and ruled, by the white
              man.</p>

              <p>You think the native Malay population who were present in Singapore during the 1800s were happy to share their land and whatever jobs available with the Chinese and Indian immigrants?</p>
              <p>You think our forefathers came to Singapore with the intention of never going back to their homeland in China or India? My great gandfather died in Singapore but was buried in his native village in Fujian province (as requested by himself) - that's where his root was.  I am sure he is not the only one that did that during that era.</p>
              <p>So immigrants from China during the imperial time to seek economic opportunity in Singapore is  more acceptable that current immigrants who are here for the same reason?</p>

              <p>You see ah. That's why we women must play our part.</p>
              <p>These men are not very civilized yet. They need to be taught some manners by the women.</p>
              <p>It is our job to teach them.. educate them.</p>
              <p>Without women.. men are just savages. That's why God gave us the power to mesmerize men with our body.. our scent and our beauty. And the intelligence to make men do the dirty work.. we just enjoy mahjong and high tea.</p>

              <p>There was a change the year after I got PR in about 2005 or so. I found that out because i've met a lot of foreign students at NUS who get automatic PR upon graduation in SIngapore, they are bonded to work in Singapore for 3 years ofcourse, but no army at all. If i had waited a year i could have gone on that scheme, it is new. But the end result is still the same, foreigners that get the right to stay without seriously serving time. I feel its unfair and PR has little use now, i sweat for nothing.</p>

              <p>There was a change the year after I got PR in about 2005 or so.
              I found that out because i've met a lot of foreign students at NUS
              who get automatic PR upon graduation in SIngapore, they are bonded
              to work in Singapore for 3 years ofcourse, but no army at all. If i
              had waited a year i could have gone on that scheme, it is new. But
              the end result is still the same, foreigners that get the right to
              stay without seriously serving time. I feel its unfair and PR has
              little use now, i sweat for nothing.</p>

              <p>Wah, even PRs can feel short changed at the government's policies.</p>
