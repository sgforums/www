But you have a valid point here. Which links back to my earlier posts on why many, if not most, people just wanted to live peacefully. They may have 'perceived' what they wanted to perceived? Or they did not perceive enough? Or some other factors.</div>

We will see you soon," RCTV presenter Nelson Bustamante told viewers.<br><br>Twenty minutes after RCTV was pulled off air, the state channel started transmission with the national anthem conducted by Gustavo Dudamel, the 26-year-old Venezuelan who was appointed as music director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic.<br><br>Programming started with a concert of traditional melodies, interspersed with government trailers. After the concert, the channel planned to show a film on 19th-century commander Simon Bolivar, Chavez's hero who freed much of South America from Spain.<br><br>CENTRALIZING THE STATE<br><br>Since becoming president in 1999, Chavez has centralized power, politicizing the judiciary, military and oil industry.<br><br>But before the closure of RCTV, political analysts had identified Venezuela's critical media as one of the main guards against him forging a Cuban-style system in the footsteps of his mentor, communist leader Fidel Castro.<br><br>The closure was condemned by the U.S. Senate and the EU Parliament, but Chavez's supporters justified the move by criticizing the journalistic ethics of the channel.<br><br>RCTV ran movies and cartoons when the tide turned in Chavez's favor in the 2002 coup, and refused to show huge crowds of the president's supporters rallying against the coup leaders.<br><br>Pollster Datanalisis found almost 70 percent of Venezuelans opposed the shut-down, but most cited the loss of their favorite soap operas rather than concerns about limits on freedom of expression.<br><br>Among the Chavez supporters swigging beer and dancing in the streets of central Caracas, some thought the president should go further and shut down the few remaining opposition networks, such as Globovision.<br><br>"They all participated in the coup and incited violence," said shopkeeper Jose Quijada, 58, wearing the hallmark red T-shirt of Chavez supporters.<br><br>But Wilmer Granadillo, a cameraman doing his last shift at RCTV, said: "It is sad, so sad. This was my second home."<br><br>Most dictatorial regimes would want to control the media, to control the people's thoughts and ideas.<br></div></blockquote>Singapore never even had an opposition television channel before ....</div>
