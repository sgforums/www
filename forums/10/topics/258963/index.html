Nobody stands up and criticize (and in Singapore, that can be very costly) the situation can only get worse.<br><br>So people like CSJ and JBJ... (slimed by the press) ..........while you think that they have done nothing... think again.<br><br>The dictators, given a completely free hand would have turned this country into an even more stressful place to live  by taking even more of Singaporeans' money.<br><br>Knowing that CSJ and JBJ is there to scream at them would have held back their hand a little... if there is stronger opposition, it might even reverse the situation and Singapore in reality becomes a better place for all instead of becoming a better place for some at the expense of the majority.<br><br>Think, less luxuries for the dictators and more class C wards for all.</div></blockquote>The few who are aware and tried to expose the ugly side of the governing and such (Durai case for example) are those who seek the truth and justice. The sad (or good?) thing is that, most of the citizens do not have the same curiousity or fervor in seeking the truth.<br><br>I used to put this in my siggy in the past: 'There are ALL kinds of people in the world'. How true that sentence is as we need a few people willing to take a step forward or sacrifice to educate the masses. How true it is that there are people like Durai. How true it is there are incompetent people in the higher rankings.<br><br>Actually, I am glad for those few who are out to seek the truth. This way we can see the picture even clearer. The thing is: I am one who do not want to be involved in any political issues. Too much of a hassle. I am more concerned with the path in which humanity treads, the enviornment and our future together.<br><br>Call me lazy or crazy. I am not bothered with nations, governance and their deep dark secrets. Governance WILL change hands, whether they like it or not.</div>
