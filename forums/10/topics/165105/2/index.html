AFAIK all discussion and expression has been cordial, so can hardly be called a colonial direction or instruction.  I'd be disappointed if Australia hadn't tried to prevent the execution, and would be similarly disappointed if Singapore didn't apply similar diplomatic pressure to another country if one of its citizens was caught in dire straits overseas.<br><br>Sorry for the OT post.</div>

We are a sovereign state and foreigners have no right to interfere with our internal policies.
