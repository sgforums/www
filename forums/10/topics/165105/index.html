We rank very high in terms of efficiency - ie. churning out cases fast.  Quality of justice?  That's another story.<br><br>We suck seaweeds in the area of criminal justice.<br><br>Nothing to be proud about.</div>

Let him live,' declared a front-page banner headline in the weekend edition of the Sydney Morning Herald.<br><br>Newspaper columnists, letter writers and callers to radio shows have also been vocal in criticising Singapore's decision to proceed with the death sentence for Nguyen Tuong Van, describing it as 'inhumane' and 'barbaric'.<br><br>Nguyen, who admitted acting as a drug courier, was sentenced to death last year after being found guilty of trafficking in almost 400g of heroin, found on him at Changi Airport in December 2002.<br><br>Public anger over Nguyen's execution has intensified recently, with calls for trade sanctions against Singapore, a boycott of Singapore commercial interests in Australia and a referral to the International Court of Justice.<br><br>In a commentary yesterday, the Australian's editor-at-large Paul Kelly yesterday argued that while Singapore had the 'most intimate ties with Australia of any Asian nation', the execution would 'inflict grave damage on its reputation in this country'.<br><br>'The hanging of Nguyen will shock many Australians; it will be seen as a punishment out of proportion with the crime.

While all these smack of (Western?) imperialism, it is made especially more pertinent since the citizens of Singapore live under the very same laws that convicted Nguyen.

And it doesn't address the point I've made.  By the way, I'm flabbergasted by the following extract from the article:-<br><br>"It is usually true, however, that a fairer system clears cases with less efficiency. But Singapore has opted for efficiency, entrusting the integrity of its competent police and prosecutors working at the pre-trial stages to ensure fairness. And Amnesty International must now show why this utilitarianism is irredeemably unacceptable."<br><br>What is he saying?  Justice is now not only in the hands of the judiciary??<br></div>
