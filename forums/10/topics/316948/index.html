              <p>There are still other alternative energy sources that we have still not fully explored and which are freely available as Singapore is located in the equatorial belt.</p>
              <p>Sunlight  as a source of energy has not been fully explored other then on a small scale with solar panels charging batteries for limited applications - as in providing power for bus stop lighting, remotely located electrically operated outdoor monitoring equipment, remote installations of telephones.</p>
              <p>Other then solar cells to convert sunlight into electrical power, there is little R &amp; D activities to apply the potential of tapping the focussed heat from the sunlight to drive steam turbines to produce electricity.</p>
              <p>The other alternatives that can be considered will be tidal sea wave power and wind power.</p>
              <p>Like tapping energy from the sun, the energy from tidal wave motion and that of the wind will require large surface area to install the equipment.</p>
              <p>While the flat solar panels can easily be merged into the landscape of the building roofs or walls, the wind turbines need to be located onto tall towers that may pose aesthetic challenges to the social environment.</p>
              <p>Similarly, with a shrinking surface territorial waters due to land reclamation works, the option of tapping the tidal energies from sea waves remains a challenging options.</p>
              <p>Other then sourcing for alternative energies, the architectural and engineering professionals should seriously consider their design works to incorporate building and equipment features that will use energies efficiently - as well as incorporating equipment to tap the energies from the sun, wind and sea that will form part of the building external features.</p>
              <p>Nuclear energy ?</p>
              <p>This should be the very last option, as the cost of storing nuclear waste can also be very costly.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Lol this is hilarious. Alot of expertise is required and a nuclear powered-plant needs to be built on an off-shore island, but they are too many health hazards to consider(including those to the staff working there) that's why pilots are given alot of time off to fend off the radiation while flying. Not a feasible plan and will probably invite alot of criticisms, unless the majority of the indonesian parliament steps in, it will not proceed. Furthermore, I believe solar energy will be the next replacement for energy, as it is eco-friendly, almost free. (Only worry now is the efficiency and tremendous cost for equipment)</p></div>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Because LKY said nothing is free in this world, then the author rebunk by saying, "Since his birth, doesn't he needs air? But did he pay for the air that he breathed in? Doesn't he needs sunlight? Did he pay for the sunlight he received?"</p>

              <p>After 1986, I've yet to see a single meltdown in US or Japan.  With the proper foreign talents (REAL TALENTS this time), it is possible to build and maintain a safe nuclear power plant.</p>
              <p>As for storage, I believe in some countries like Japan, the waste fuel is reprocessed to remove fission product and then reused.  I believe with stringent measures in place, and vigilance (not complacency), a nuclear option can be a viable and in the long run, economical way of generating electricity.</p>
              <p>The last reactor meltdown, for the record was the famous Chernobyl Disaster back in 1986.  That pretty much shook up the world and made everyone revise and implement further emergency measures to safeguard against meltdowns.</p>

              <p>It seems that most of you have serious misconceptions regarding nuclear power. There are a few other countries, including the United States, that are relooking at nuclear power. France is an excellent example, with about 80% of their energy needs met by nuclear power.</p>
              <p>Nuclear power is one of the least pollutive energy source available. It requires only minimal land space, which is suitable for Singapore's offshore islands. Secondly, with proper monitoring, there are no dangers associated with nuclear power plants. The incident that happened in USSR in the 80s was due to their experimentation with the reactor.</p>

              <p>After 1986, I've yet to see a single meltdown in US or Japan.  With the proper foreign talents (REAL TALENTS this time), it is possible to build and maintain a safe nuclear power plant.</p>
              <p>As for storage, I believe in some countries like Japan, the waste fuel is reprocessed to remove fission product and then reused.  I believe with stringent measures in place, and vigilance (not complacency), a nuclear option can be a viable and in the long run, economical way of generating electricity.</p>
              <p>The last reactor meltdown, for the record was the famous Chernobyl Disaster back in 1986.  That pretty much shook up the world and made everyone revise and implement further emergency measures to safeguard against meltdowns.</p>

              <p>lowest operational cost only if u plan to use it 24/7..den the cost of operation will be low..so the more impt qn is do we even need that source of power to be produced 24/7 in the 1st place, are our industries currently running 24/7..?</p>
              <p>moreover the capital cost of building one is sky-high..</p>

              <p>No, the US military will not supervise it unless we ask them to.  And a civilian reactor is none of their concern.  The only agency we ought, or rather we must have full transparency to is the IAEA.  So essentially, if we are "certified" by IAEA to have fully complied to their standards, and that wear are not making  erm.... "silver bullets", we'll be fine.</p>
              <p>Currently, only the US stores nuclear waste.  Other countries like UK and Japan reprocess their waste to be used as fuel again.</p>

              <p>The point of the thread is not about the supply; its about prices. If Malaysia/ Singapore was not politicized and free market prevails in Malaysia, electricity companies can also supply a portion of electricity to compete with local electricity companies.  </p>

              <p>If I am not mistaken, Oz also stores nuclear waste and the waste cannot be reprocessed repeatedly. </p>
              <p>"No, the US military will not supervise it unless we ask them to.  And a civilian reactor is none of their concern."</p>
              <p>Yes they will. The IAEA is a powerless watchdog organization (re: Iran). They can recommend reports, but lets face it, only the USA will enforce it. </p>
              <p>After MSK's escape, do you think that USA will trust Singapore with guarding a potential weapon that could kill thousands of people? Moreover, I recall a Singaporean (or Malaysian working in Singapore I cant remember) got caught recently acting as middle-man selling the centrifuges to Iran.</p>
