              <p><br>1.  Even if the waste cannot be repeatedly reprocessed, we'd still have already achieved greater energy to fuel efficiency.  As for what we can do to the eventual waste, I'm sure we can think of a solution should we really decide to go into it.</p>
              <p>2.  Again, its for IAEA to decide, not the US government.  If we are fully transparent and compliant to IAEA, there is no reason for US to enforce anything.</p>

              <p>The main issue is about the enrichment of uranium. </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Iran is being offered help to develop a civilian nuclear power programme including light-water reactors. Crucially, Iran would not be allowed to make the fuel itself. This would be done in Russia in a partnership with Iran. However, as a condition for any substantive talks, Iran has to suspend enrichment. It does not accept such a pre-condition.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>So why does Iran not want to accept this pre-condition? Why must it insist of enriching uranium itself?  That is why the IAEA and US is suspicious of Iran's intentions.</p>

              <p>OTOH, if Singapore was to develop a reactor, I think we wouldn't mind having someone else enrich the fuel for us.</p>

              <p><br>I'm not surprised if that were so.  Singapore is a very densely populated country, and has a very high energy consumption rate.  Look at the number of appliances per household, then the amount of infrastructure  in all that needs to be powered 24/7.</p>
              <p>Even with 1 plant, we should be able to see a cost reduction in the long run. </p>

              <p>Now, If we have a nuclear plant we prob will have increased desal capability, imagine we can make a combined plant, where seawater is used to power the turbine and as a side stream, we get desalinated water.</p>
              <p>Bear in mind the govnt is privatising our power plants, so if its not profitable the plants would prob close down... But  we still have the one in tuas that burns rubbish, so  I guess we will still  backup.<br><br>But the startup cost will be very inhibiting,there is probably no one in singapore capable of running the plant, let alone design it, maybe u will see new courses in poly in nuclear tech(hey its better than dealing cards right?).... Unless they are very desperate, dun tink they will use it.</p>
              <p>Yes and one more thing, Imagine the hot effluent(water) coming out of the plant will probably do some considerable damage to the marine lives around singapore.... And you know what our neighbours reaction might be!</p>

              <br> <br> Even as oil prices ascended to new highs of more than $124 a barrel
              this week, many oil and gas industry executives say they expect the
              price to fall significantly by year's end, a new survey shows. <br> <br> <br> Fifty-five percent of 372 petroleum industry executives surveyed by
              KPMG said they think the price of a barrel of crude will drop below
              $100 by the end of the year. Twenty-one percent of respondents
              predicted a barrel of oil will end the year between $101 and $110,
              while 15 percent forecast the year-end price to be between $111 and
              $120 a barrel. <br> <br> Nine percent said they expect the price to close the year where it's been this week -- above $120 a barrel. 
              <br> <br> What's more, 44 percent of the executives said their companies plan to
              increase capital spending on exploration and production by 10 percent
              during the next year. <br> <br> The survey was conducted last month and scheduled for release Friday.
              Participants included executives for major oil companies, independent
              exploration and production outfits and other energy companies. <br> <br> "The expectation of increased investment by U.S. energy companies shows
              oil and gas executives are deeply concerned about energy security,"
              said Bill Kimble, who oversees the global energy institute at KPMG, the
              audit, tax and advisory firm. <br> <br> Of late, all eyes have been on crude prices, which have nearly doubled
              in the past year. The dollar's decline against the euro and other
              foreign currencies has helped spur the rise, attracting investors
              looking for a hedge against inflation. <br> <br> Rising demand for oil from the rapidly developing economies of China
              and India has played a role too, as have concerns about tighter
              supplies. Indeed, 63 percent of survey participants said growing demand
              in emerging markets was the main factor in the historic rise in oil
              prices. <br> <br> Widely watched oil price prognosticator Goldman Sachs said this week
              oil prices could rise to $150 to $200 within two years; others say
              crude could plummet to as low as $40 or $50 a barrel during the same
              period. <br> <br> "To be sure, the future does not unfold neatly in line with any
              projection, and the time frame of the actual price surge has been
              remarkably short," Cambridge Energy Research Associates said in a
              report this week. <br> <br> Asked what would most enhance U.S. energy security, participants
              overwhelmingly said opening up more acreage for domestic drilling was
              the best option. In particular, 43 percent said the Arctic National
              Wildlife Refuge should be opened for drilling. Another 28 percent said
              more investment in renewable energy sources such as biodiesel would
              enhance U.S. energy security the most. <br> <br> However, even though many of the executives support further investment
              in renewable energy sources, the majority still don't view renewables
              as a serious near-term solution to the energy supply equation. <br> <br> In last year's survey, 60 percent of 553 petroleum industry executives
              said large-scale production of renewable fuels was not a near-term
              possibility, at least not in the next couple of years. <br> <br> In the most-recent survey, 54 percent gave the same response, though 2015 was the target date.

              <p>Whether oil hits $200 a barrel or plummets will really depend on OPEC now.  The biggest problem is whether to up the output.  If they raise the output, oil prices might go into a free fall, bursting the oil bubble.</p>
              <p>Even the Chief of OPEC, Ali Al Naimi views the high oil prices to be caused by speculation.  The supply of oil is definitely there and capable of meeting rising demands.  In short, the high oil prices is definitely not due to shortage.  Perhaps its time to rein in the traders.</p>
