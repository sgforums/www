              <p>I think Singapore will never use nuclear option.</p>
              <p>Because it is contradicting to Singapore's character.</p>
              <p>Singapore's character is pragmatism and avoiding white-elephant projects.</p>
              <p>In my opinion nuclear power is 'costly' because of all the investments, new know-how, and security risks. And also need to divert some critical mass, manpower.</p>
              <p>Quite hard to imagine Singapore having a nuclear power plant.</p>

              <p>Those who think solar energy can even supplement more than a few percent of Singapore's total energy needs are stark, raving mad. You'd have to cover the entire Singapore landmass with photovoltaics to even get close to 10% of Singapore's total energy needs.</p>

              <p>The COE has NOT regulated the size of the car population because Singaporeans had been pressing the government over the right to own cars. So the government has relented and increased the number of COEs in the past 5 years, allowing more cars on the road and instead regulate car usage with ERP and petrol taxes. The COE is the most effective way of curbing car ownership but that is not possible so long as Singaporeans cannot get over their love affair with the car.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans cannot have it both ways. Either pay 30k for the right to own a car or pay high petrol taxes for the right to use it.</p>

              <p>And please, don't EVER let those greenpeace idiots misled you into thinking, nuclear powerplant = building nuclear bomb, and the fact that a nuclear meltdown means the whole island get blown up along with the reactor.</p>

              <p>Take this article as a example on how important it is to replace fossil fuel with an alternative power source.</p>

              <p>The world needs to invest $45 trillion in energy in coming decades, build some 1,400 nuclear power plants and vastly expand wind power in order to halve greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, according to an energy study released Friday. <br><br>The report by the Paris-based International Energy Agency envisions a "energy revolution" that would greatly reduce the world's dependence on fossil fuels while maintaining steady economic growth. <br><br>"Meeting this target of 50 percent cut in emissions represents a formidable challenge, and we would require immediate policy action and technological transition on an unprecedented scale," IEA Executive Director Nobuo Tanaka said. <br><br>A U.N.-network of scientists concluded last year that emissions have to be cut by at least half by 2050 to avoid an increase in world temperatures of between 3.6 and 4.2 degrees above pre-18th century levels. <br><br>Scientists say temperature increases beyond that could trigger devastating effects, such as widespread loss of species, famines and droughts, and swamping of heavily populated coastal areas by rising oceans. <br><br>Environment ministers from the Group of Eight industrialized countries and Russia backed the 50 percent target in a meeting in Japan last month and called for it to be officially endorsed at the G-8 summit in July. <br><br>The IEA report mapped out two main scenarios: one in which emissions are reduced to 2005 levels by 2050, and a second that would bring them to half of 2005 levels by mid-century. <br><br>The scenario for deeper cuts would require massive investment in energy technology development and deployment, a wide-ranging campaign to dramatically increase energy efficiency, and a wholesale shift to renewable sources of energy. <br><br>Assuming an average 3.3 percent global economic growth over the 2010-2050 period, governments and the private sector would have to make additional investments of $45 trillion in energy, or 1.1 percent of the world's gross domestic product, the report said. <br><br>That would be an investment more than three times the current size of the entire U.S. economy. <br><br>The second scenario also calls for an accelerated ramping up of development of so-called "carbon capture and storage" technology allowing coal-powered power plants to catch emissions and inject them underground. <br><br>The study said that an average of 35 coal-powered plants and 20 gas-powered power plants would have to be fitted with carbon capture and storage equipment each year between 2010 and 2050. <br><br>In addition, the world would have to construct 32 new nuclear power plants each year, and wind-power turbines would have to be increased by 17,000 units annually. Nations would have to achieve an eight-fold reduction in carbon intensity — the amount of carbon needed to produce a unit of energy — in the transport sector. <br><br>Such action would drastically reduce oil demand to 27 percent of 2005 demand. Failure to act would lead to a doubling of energy demand and a 130 percent increase in carbon dioxide emissions by 2050, IEA officials said. <br><br>"This development is clearly not sustainable," said Dolf Gielen, an IEA energy analyst and leader for the project. <br><br>Gielen said most of the $45 trillion forecast investment — about $27 trillion — would be borne by developing countries, which will be responsible for two-thirds of greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. <br><br>Most of the money would be in the commercialization of energy technologies developed by governments and the private sector. <br><br>"If industry is convinced there will be policy for serious, deep CO2 emission cuts, then these investments will be made by the private sector," Gielen said.</p>

              <p>And please la...can some of you STOP following every bloody mistake the US make? Yes, the US is better than singapore in many ways does not mean the USA will not make any mistake.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Currently, the singapore government policy of restricting car ownership is a GOOD idea. Mainly because it can at the least reduce greenhouse gas emission. I mean come on, research has been telling us for god knows how long that private cars IS polluting the air like nobody's bussiness?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Restrict the amount of cars on the road, if it is necssary, don't ever let fuel cost go down, just to ensure people do not hug their beloved cars too much.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Cars IS a luxury item, and people can live without owning a damn car, the faster they let go of their love for luxury item, the better.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We don't have much time left in countering global warming.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Also, with peak oil around the corner, it will be wise to look at nuclear power for a change. After all, we have been told from young that singapore should always consider the long term advantage.</p>
              <p>The faster we adopt nuclear power, the better it is for us. When peak oil finally start to take a huge toll on the oil loving US economy, singapore will not be affected that badly.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And I want to ask, how anyone even read up on articles written by nuclear experts about nuclear powerplant, instead of saying nuclear power is unsafe just because greenpeace said so??</p>

              <p>The COE has NOT regulated the size of the car population because Singaporeans had been pressing the government over the right to own cars.

              <p>How do you know the COE did not work due to people pressing them over the right to own cars? You speak like you are them. Are you ?</p>
