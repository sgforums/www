            <div class='col-md body'>I'm not a big fan of school rulez anyway but i find them very unrealistic sometimes. What's so bad about having long hair or tucked out shirt? I mean, at least you are wearing clothes not being naked! And what's this on hair should be above eyebrows. It's practically unrealistic. So, it means those with wider forehead have longer fringes! What the heck is this! Anyway, i couldn't care less about any of these school rules. I'm practically breaking 80% of them anyway!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Breaking school rules require tatic. For example, I take off my school badge and name tag on the bus, so it is practically impossible to identify me from any school. I can use any vulgarities I want and I don't need to fear people going after me. That's partial compromise. I don't make the school lose face, the school doesn't get to come after me.

            <div class='col-md body'>HAhaha! Whats wrong with being naked?!<br>LoLZ.  Everybody should walk around naked. Duh.<br><br>Seriously, the topic of school uniform has always been an active debate.  Eg. wheres the logic in wearing school uniform, why?  Is it necessary? As well as many other questions.  I take a pro uniform stance.  Simply because, school is the first exposure a human life has to discipline.  Its the first time someone has the chance to wear a uniform.  It really teaches uniform life to an extent.<br><br>From a grizzly view, its easier to identify dead bodies wearing unforms also.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>School rules are there for a purpose. Mainly, I think, it's to maintain a proper image of Singaporean students. You may think "what image is there to uphold?" But when you get older, you'll see...    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Nothing's wrong with having long hair. But having short hair just makes you look smarter and brighter. Btw I don't mean smarter/brighter as in cleverer. When you look better, naturally more girls would want to be seen with you right? And shorter hair is easier to maintain.<br><br>Having everything so uniform in schools is probably also to make sure that the students don't waste time having to think about what to wear to school the next day, or how to wear their hair. The time wasted on this area can be put to better use if it's used on studying purposes.<br><br>School rules are made NOT meant to be broken. As I said, it's there for a purpose. If you don't like it, don't break it. Compromises can be made. I come from a school where certain rules which students felt were rather unreasonable were relaxed. For example, only school shoes were allowed, but after the change, track shoes were allowed too, provided they weren't too flashy and only had a maximum of three permitted colors. Another rule that was changed was that only blue/black bags were allowed, but now bags that don't have bright colors are allowed. These compromises have been made and both students and teachers are happy with them. Isn't that good?<br><br>In my school, we don't have a students' committee, but the prefectorial board represents the student body. After making those compromises, the teachers are happy with the new rules and so are the students, hence they follow them now. I agree with Puzzle_Siaoz, suggest something to your principal so that students' views can be voiced and heard.<br><br>Quoting Martin Luther King Jr... "Freedom is not free." If students were allowed to have things their way, think about what's going to happen. We have such fashionable teenagers in Singapore nowadays, that if there weren't school rules, the school would probably become a fashion show venue. Students would only be interested in outdoing their friends in wearing the latest fashion outfits. Hair would be dyed in every color of the rainbow, piercings would probably be seen on many teenagers, on the faces/ears... Many students, though not all, would probably lose their interest in pursuing their education.<br><br>Having school uniforms is good in a sense that you can identify who's from which school easily. When getting to know friends sometimes, it saves you the trouble of asking an additional question, "Which school are you from?"<br>Why do you remove your school tag and badge after school ends? Just because you can use all the vulgarities you want? I think that's pretty silly. Why for use so much vulgarities when you can use nice proper English and show people how cultivated you are? I personally feel that using so much vulgarities is simply uncouth and it turns people off.<br><br>Following the school rules show that you're disciplined, and it also shows that you're mature enough to think for yourself what's right and what's not. If you think that breaking school rules are cool, think again.<br><br>The government is promoting the "gracious society" thingy, so I think in a sense, following school rules, making yourself look neater is part of showing that you're civilized and cultivated.<br><br>------------------<br><span style="font-style: italic;">It is by tiny steps that we ascend the stars.</span><br><br>[This message has been edited by CheekyCow (edited 29 January 2002).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>in my personal experience, and i have kept long hair before, it is too hot in Singapore for long hair to be cool...after a while, it gets sweaty and for some (not me:-) ) stinky...<br><br>as for school uniforms, it is just to keep everyone on an equal footing and not make the well-off ones to proud or the less fortunate ones too self-conscious...<br><br>school rules, like most other rules, are planned for the good of the majority...it might cramp your personal style, but then they are there for a reason, usually to keep order...and if you think school rules are bad, wait till you get into NS...</div>
