              <p>have they thought about this to increase population?</p>
              <p>A tax scheme whereby:</p>
              <p>1) If a foreigner refuses to take up PR within 2 years of working, he's liable for tax which is otherwise not implemented on a citizen wage scale under the tax limits</p>
              <p>2) If a PR leaves the country to work overseas, he needs to pay the tax for the duration of time he was around locally.</p>
              <p>1.2 million foreigners and i think the revenue colleced will be a substantial amount</p>

              <p>because other countries already have social security in place and such a tax plan is not feasible for them.</p>
              <p>But Singapore has no welfare. But since she's so interested in earning dollars. she can generate such a scheme to have a constant flow of revenue at least</p>

              <p>Worldy, there is already such a scheme in place, called foreign worker levies.  This ranges from $50 for an S Pass holder up to $500 per month for labourers, with foreign domestic workers levy at $265.</p>
              <p>Let's say a maid takes home $300.  The employer has to pay $300 + 265, meaning that they're prepared to pay $565 per month, the market value of the maid's services.  She's effectively being taxed 47%.  By rights it should be moving in the opposite direction - higher minimum wage for maids at the expense of the maid levy.</p>
              <p>As for taxing skilled FTs at a higher rate, the only net effect will be fewer FT prepared to come to Singapore.  I'll assume then that this is your objective.</p>

              <p>its not what i am talking about. In this case the employer has to pay, and who are the employers, its us citizens! i mean tax the workers straight. And i am not only referring to maids and labourers, but white collar foreign workers as well.</p>
              <p>This scheme will bring about competitive wage if there is fixed taxation for various pay scales.</p>

              <p>I don't see the diffence.  Let's say the maid really had to pay 47% out of her salary (your new PR/FT tax scheme), and let's say $300 take home is the minimum that she is prepared to work for.  She'd need to find a job that paid $565 before taxes, and end up keeping $300.  The employer still pays $565.  The only difference between a levy and tax is how directly the money passes from employer to the government.</p>
              <p>If you want to talk about competitive wages then you'll lose a lot more jobs to foreigners. I'll assume by competitive you'll mean each worker competing on a fair level.  All of a sudden your $1500 FT labourer will cost you $1000 (simplified example of course), putting all your $1001 to $1499 salaried local workers out of the market.</p>

              <p>GST, road tax, utility levy, parking coupons, ERP, radio &amp; television tax, stamp duties, CPF money all these are contributions of the People Of Singapore to the Nation Building Project. You are misguided if you think that just become so-and-so earns enough to pay income tax so-and-so can suka-suka say rest of Singapore citizens have less rights and therefore illegally appropriate more privileges for his social class. What rights he earns by his own wealth is his to keep but he should not take away the rights of the people which is bought by consensual agreement. To break the trust of the people is to invite attack.</p>
              <p>Also, because I understand the kind of deluded elite mentality that goes with this kind of statement, I need to say that "YOU ARE A TRAITOR".</p>
