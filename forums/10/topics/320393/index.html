            <div class='col-md body'><p>Democracy is the best present a parent could ever give to his children. Before having a children, I was quite indifferent to the suffering of human rights activists and opposition supporters like Chee Soon Juan and his team-mates, who spend almost all their entire lives fighting a totalitarian hybrid regime. Few times I would see JBJ and Chee Soon Juan in the MRT or in the public selling their autobiography books to the public. I just merely look at them and didn't walk up to them to offer my support or shake their hands or to talk to them, knowning by doing that I will get into trouble.<br><br>But after all these years, I realized what my country has become, a country of increase income disparity, a society that becomes an increasing money worshipping population, people are becoming more selfish and divided and the injustice of the elites having a reign over the peasant populace. Furthermore, welfare benefits are not reaching out to the people needing it at the same time a country running huge budget surpluses and have poured investments into countless overseas foreign corporations. <br><br>For me, the trends my country is heading is rather unhealthy for any children to grow up. Frankly, who would want your children to grow up in a country where the worship of power and money take precedance over principles and values? Who want any children to grow up in a society where is purpose is to serve the elites and are merely treated as digits in society. Who wants any children to live in a society where freedom of speech and expression are curbed when principles and values cannot be fully expressed and uncensorely curtailed? Who wants a children to live in a society where one is not concerned about the welfare of his/her fellow citizens? Certainly not mine! Where have our society's values and principles gone to?<br><br>One could argue escape as the best solution for my children, but unfortunately, if we see a problem but we use an escape as a solution, we will carry the same problem to anywhere to go to. The problems remained. It is the devil within ourselves we have to fight.<br><br>Looking at the adorable facial expression of any children, will give you hope for the future, that you want your children to grow up in a country where the principles and values have a strong foundation and has a place for them in future.<br><br>By actively involved in the causes of Chee Soon Juan and his teams, one may be jailed and separated from loved ones, its it then worth it? I would say yes, because I think it is the best present any parent could give to his children. Why? just because of your children future is at stake.<br><br>A Concerned Singaporean Parent</p></div>

              <p>I believe that a lot of people supported the incumbent party and its policies at one time or another in the past.</p>
              <p>However, it seems like more and more of these supporters are starting to become disillusioned by the direction the country is heading, be it their own livelihood or the future of their children.</p>
              <p>The perception by the general public, whether true or otherwise, is that the people at the top seem more interested in making money, than actually focusing on the general welfare of Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>In another thread, people are already asking how to give up their citizenship and take up PRship instead because of perceived benefits over the Singaporean citizen.</p>
              <p>Which country you know has its citizens asking such questions? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Over the last one year, if you have the gall to press home your insulting views towards CSJ, why will you not hit the headlines by doing it in his face at a Public Forum ?</p>

              <p>Against your own advise, you will occassionally inject some hypocritical dosage of anti-establishment remarks that you hope will keep your image as a political neutral.</p>

              <p>In the 1992 GRC By-Election at Marine Parade - CSJ led the SDP in increasing the popular vote to 27.8% - {the PAP GRC took 72.9%} - when in the 1991 General Election the SDP had only received 22.8%, and the PAP took 77.2%}.</p>
              <p>This startling result from Goh Chok Tong's constituency was seen as a potential threat if a University Lecturer can destabilise the constituency of a PAP Stalwart - and if more lecturers or similar professionals should follow CSJ in taking a political plunge.</p>
              <p>This 1992 By-Election shock started the wheels in motion to cut CSJ down to size, with his NUS Faculty Head - Dr Vassoo, {who is a PAP elite and whom CSJ decline an invitation from Vassoo to join the PAP} - digging up a one year old transport claim for taxi fare reimbursement to CSJ's field trip as part of his NUS research work.</p>
              <p>Dr Vassoo had already approved the reimbursement one year earlier, but after the 1992 By-election - took issue with the amount that CSJ had claimed in his travel voucher, with the disputed amount being less then $2.00 - between the amount paid and the amount that Dr Vassoo claimed should have been the correct fare.</p>
              <p>One will have to question the brilliance in Dr Vassoo retracting his approval one year later to dispute a fare difference of less than $2.00 - which in all circumstances will have to be different fares considering the taxi route taken, the condition of the traffic at different times of the day, or different days of the week.</p>
              <p>Still the charges of dishonesty was pushed, and Dr Vassoo sued CSJ for libel - from his statements that suggest Vassoo was dishonest in making the charges at CSJ.</p>
              <p>The second charge of dishonesty levelled at CSJ was also from an reimbursement already paid some time prior to the 1992 By-Election, when CSJ claimed for postage costs in mailing his dissertation to an approved US University that had also included research papers done by his wife - which CSJ claimed is partially contributing to his total work - and was approved by the receiving US university as this was common practise at that tertiary level of research work.</p>
              <p>The dispute was over Dr Vassoo claim that he was not advised of this matter by CSJ, and resulted in the charges of dishonesty being raised for spending NUS funds to mail his wife dissertation for assessment overseas.</p>
              <p>As a neutral observer, one need only ask 'how did Dr Vassoo come to know of the contents after the 1992 By-Election, when the parcel had already left Singapore, and CSJ had already been reimbursed for the postage costs ?</p>
              <p>The rest is history as printed in the Wikipedia, and Chiam See Tong has all the rights to make amendments if he has any dispute with the recorded events.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>With the picture straightened, one will need to ask what your agenda as the Bear - in consistently maulng CSJ dead body, as well as sabotaging the efforts of everyone by pouring cold water on any efforts to widen the political experience in this SC ?</p>
              <p>Have you contributed anything of substance when you have been observed to be devoid of any thoughts, except to sneakily shoot your silent torpedoes and lay your contact mines to disparage others who have more courage than you in speaking their minds openly.</p>
              <p>A whore has at least done a more honest service, what have you done except to become a political carpet beggar.</p>

              <p>Look Ms Chua, I know you are trying your darnest to bring down that
                  man, but do you really believe that thinking people will buy into this
                  old refrain any longer?<strong> For one, Mr Chiam was not ousted from SDP by Dr
                  Chee. He voluntarily engineered his own exit, contrary to what the
                  state media would have us believe.</strong></p>
              <p><a href="http://www.sgpolitics.net/?p=243">http://www.sgpolitics.net/?p=243</a></p>
              <ol>
              <li id="comment-1007"> <strong>Blurred by spin</strong> Said,
              <p>“For
              one, Mr Chiam was not ousted from SDP by Dr Chee. He voluntarily
              engineered his own exit, contrary to what the state media would have us
              believe.” Ng E-Jay, you are absolutely correct. If one reads the 1994
              Volume 1 of the Singapore Law Report at page 278, the following
              sequence of events were established:</p>
              <p>(1) On 17/5/1993, at a Cenral Executive Committee (CEC) meeting of
              the SDP, Chiam tried to introduce a motion to censure Chee SJ for his
              hunger stike. NOBODY (not even his 2 favoured party members (I’m not
              referring to CSJ) brought into SDP by him) supported him. Not being a
              team player, he wrote out a resignation note on the spot. (During the
              trial Chiam famously declared - and this was reported in the Straits
              Times - that he was like a General; when he gives an order everyone
              must charge!)</p>
              </li>
              <li id="comment-1007">
              <p><br> (2) For the next few weeks, several attempts were made by CEC members
              to ask Chiam to withdraw his resignation. He refused and instead
              started making demands. Meanwhile, the CEC tried to keep a tight lid on
              Chiam’s resignation.</p>
              </li>
              <li id="comment-1007">
              <p><br> (3) On 18/6/1993, when the local media started to sniff closer to the
              door, the CEC had no choice but to announce Chiam’s resignation and
              even then tried to put a positive spin to the event by praising Chiam
              for his contribution to opposition politics.</p>
              </li>
              <li id="comment-1007">
              <p><br> (4) On 16/7/1993, Chiam did the unthinkable, and, to me as an outside
              observer, an unforgivable thing: he went to the very core of the PAP
              propaganda machine, namely, the Times House (then at Kim Seng Road),
              and gave a talk denouncing his fellow CEC members.<br> (5) Events were then set in motion when the SDP CEC asked Chiam to
              appear before a disciplinary committee. Chiam was found guilty and
              expelled from SDP.</p>
              <p>Look, if you join a club with rules and you start bad-mouthing the
              leadership and your own members, the leaders really have no choice but
              to haul you up for discipline isn’t it? Although the judge found the
              disciplinary process against Chiam ineptly conducted - and there are
              some who do not quite agree with the reasoning of the judge -
              nonetheless it was Chiam who brought it upon himself. After the
              judgment, Chiam was reinstated as SDP member, but he chose to resign
              thereafter.</p>
              <p>So you see, the above sequence of events have been morphed, by a
              sleight of hand, assisted no doubt by the likes of Chua Lee Hoong, into
              Chee Soon Juan (the ingrate brought in by Chiam) having ousted Chiam
              See Tong.</p>

              <p>I do believe that you best ask around if civil servants are indeed restricted in their votes. This is a serious charge, for our precious votes are sacred and secret.</p>
              <p>As far as i know, all of my civil servant acquaintances had voted freely without fear or favour, irregardless of ruling or opposition party.</p>
              <p>Speak his mind, yes. But his mind best be rational, and backed up with facts and not mere speculations. I am sure you too wouldn't enjoy talking to fools.</p>

              <p><br>Thanks Poh for a very rare piece of gem that no one knew existed.</p>
              <p>It is amazing that CSJ can be labelled a cheat for a disputable taxi fare claim of $2 for a journey that can cost differently according to traffic conditions and route taken.</p>
              <p>It is all the more amazing that CSJ is labelled a liar for accusing his accuser of not telling the truth - when the accuser could not even explain his own knowledge that seems to appear after the event - {how did the accuser know what were the contents in a parcel that has already left Singapore, when he had orginally claimed no knowledge of ? }.</p>
              <p>Coming from the mouths of elite talents - {schemeing the fulfillment of their million dollar dream wages that they dependent on as crutches to prevent corruption in their ranks} - it is ironical that they will claim CSJ to be a liar and a cheat for a disputable taxi fare difference of $2; and parcel postage cost of below $50.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #008000;">now... think about this.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> What is it with you with your continuous effort - done with such consistent diligence - to perpetuate a lie about CSJ, CST and the SDP - even when you have been debunked  on at least two previous occassions in 2007 ?</p>
              <p>Did CSJ backstabbed CST and hijacked the SDP from CST ?</p>
              <p>Was CST acting as a mentor to CSJ - and groomed CSJ - or was CSJ recruited by SDP Chairman Ling How Doong in 1991 as a result of being pushed by the general dissatisfaction from the SDP Execo with CST's lack lustre performance - in being reluctant and ineffective - in Parliament since he won his first election in 1984 ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In the 1992 GRC By-Election at Marine Parade - CSJ led the SDP in increasing the popular vote to 27.8% - {the PAP GRC took 72.9%} - when in the 1991 General Election the SDP had only received 22.8%, and the PAP took 77.2%}.</p>
              <p>This startling result from Goh Chok Tong's constituency was seen as a potential threat if a University Lecturer can destabilise the constituency of a PAP Stalwart - and if more lecturers or similar professionals should follow CSJ in taking a political plunge.</p>
              <p>This 1992 By-Election shock started the wheels in motion to cut CSJ down to size, with his NUS Faculty Head - Dr Vassoo, {who is a PAP elite and whom CSJ decline an invitation from Vassoo to join the PAP} - digging up a one year old transport claim for taxi fare reimbursement to CSJ's field trip as part of his NUS research work.</p>
              <p>Dr Vassoo had already approved the reimbursement one year earlier, but after the 1992 By-election - took issue with the amount that CSJ had claimed in his travel voucher, with the disputed amount being less then $2.00 - between the amount paid and the amount that Dr Vassoo claimed should have been the correct fare.</p>
              <p>One will have to question the brilliance in Dr Vassoo retracting his approval one year later to dispute a fare difference of less than $2.00 - which in all circumstances will have to be different fares considering the taxi route taken, the condition of the traffic at different times of the day, or different days of the week.</p>
              <p>Still the charges of dishonesty was pushed, and Dr Vassoo sued CSJ for libel - from his statements that suggest Vassoo was dishonest in making the charges at CSJ.</p>
              <p>The second charge of dishonesty levelled at CSJ was also from an reimbursement already paid some time prior to the 1992 By-Election, when CSJ claimed for postage costs in mailing his dissertation to an approved US University that had also included research papers done by his wife - which CSJ claimed is partially contributing to his total work - and was approved by the receiving US university as this was common practise at that tertiary level of research work.</p>
              <p>The dispute was over Dr Vassoo claim that he was not advised of this matter by CSJ, and resulted in the charges of dishonesty being raised for spending NUS funds to mail his wife dissertation for assessment overseas.</p>
              <p>As a neutral observer, one need only ask 'how did Dr Vassoo come to know of the contents after the 1992 By-Election, when the parcel had already left Singapore, and CSJ had already been reimbursed for the postage costs ?</p>
              <p>The rest is history as printed in the Wikipedia, and Chiam See Tong has all the rights to make amendments if he has any dispute with the recorded events.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>With the picture straightened, one will need to ask what your agenda as the Bear - in consistently maulng CSJ dead body, as well as sabotaging the efforts of everyone by pouring cold water on any efforts to widen the political experience in this SC ?</p>
              <p>Have you contributed anything of substance when you have been observed to be devoid of any thoughts, except to sneakily shoot your silent torpedoes and lay your contact mines to disparage others who have more courage than you in speaking their minds openly.</p>
              <p>A whore has at least done a more honest service, what have you done except to become a political carpet beggar.</p>

              <p>When all the eyes, ears, and minds of the audience are shielded, diverted, and pounded by a single dominating 'sycophantic' sound that prevent all other sight, sound and ideas from competing for attention - will you not also attempt to compete and grab those attention for your own cause ?</p>
              <p>When the rules, regulations and laws are unfair and unreasonable, and designed to prevent anyone from challenging the new status quo - will you not go against such laws that even contradict the Constitution itself ?</p>
              <p>Have you read his plans in the books that he has written, or the issues that he has expressed in his blog ?</p>
              <p>Have you queried and challenged him on his ideas at his PUBLIC forums ?</p>
              <p>If you have not - how would you know that he is fighting for the wrong reasons ?</p>
              <p>If you are unaware of the present political situation that restricts the Politicians from the Alternative Parties in their ability to effectively exercise their political rights to serve Singaporeans - how would you know that his ways are the worst ways ?</p>

              <p>Try reading the following quote from Dr Toh Chin Chye - retired Chairman of the PAP</p>
              <p>:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>“I would say the generation of the ‘50s and ‘60s took the plunge into politics without ever calculating the costs of the risk and the benefits to be gained. They were driven by ideology.</p>
              <p>Today’s generation has no culture and averse to taking political risk.</p>
              <p>Really, an interest in politics is very necessary for the future.</p>
              <p>But I cannot blame the present generations, because they see the heavy-handed response by the government to dissenting views, even though they know that these matters involve their daily lives.<br><br>So the result is that we have produced a younger generation who are meek and therefore very calculating.</p>
              <p>They are less independent-thinking and lack in initiative.</p>
              <p>It does not bode well for the emergence of future leaders in politics and business.</p>
              <p>Robots and computers can be programmed or if you like, can be trained.</p>
              <p>But the trouble, of course, is that computers lack soul and what we need in Singapore is soul.</p>
              <p><strong>Because it is soul that makes society</strong>.”</p>

              <p>Do you wish your children to grow up as economic digits, to slave for the economy which returns little social, economic, or political benefits for a Life time of labor ?</p>
              <p>Or would you want your children to grow up in an environment where their contribution to society and country is one of unrestricted creativity - from minds that are given the space to question every aspects of Living that affect and govern their future ?</p>
              <p>Would you not wish for your children to be in an environment that has a resilience and tolerance for them to seek difficult answers that will allow them to be responsible for their own actions - and not having their lives being dictated by the political thinking from only one source ?</p>
              <p>In another forty years into the future, your children will have to compete even harder in a globalised world.</p>
              <p>Will they be able to fit themselve into a globalised economy that will require their maximum creativity, initiative, congnitive skills, analytical thinking - when they are required to modify their demands, to conform, to be less individualistic, to accept ''advise'' and ''instructions'' without questions ?</p>
              <p>Can their minds grow to be enquiring minds, that are familiar and tolerant to a variety of views and philosophies, or will they grow up to be timid and without imagination nor initiative, nor drive to face challenges ?</p>

              <p>I agree with Toh Chin Chye's words.</p>
              <p>I see a society where a culture has been weakened, people has been demoralised, depoliticised, turned naive and ignorant, a society where modern democratic institutions has been wiped out.</p>
