              </p><p class="MsoNormal">There are so much hullabaloo about the coming Presidential
              Election.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Even after the GE, why some people are still resenting the
              ruling party. As long as their basic fundamental needs such as education,
              housing, transportation and medical cost are not satisfactorily met, these
              people ,especially the middle income and low income group, will not listen to
              the anybody including the presidential hopefuls affiliated to the ruling party.
              As such, all the presidential hopefuls tried to distant themselves from the
              ruling party. How successful in their shaking off the PAP image remains to be
              seen.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Before GE 2011, many people were asked to take CPF cut and
              bite the bullet during economic downturn. When times were better, prices kept
              rising while their pay remained stagnant. Foreigners were welcomed with open
              arms. All their dreams of having affordable basic needs were shattered. The
              situation was aggravated when the parliament announced astronomical pay and
              bonuses for their ministers and president. That was the last straw that broke
              the camel’s back. Until now, this has been and will still be an issue even
              after the presidential election. The government tried to appease the people
              rage with workfare package just before the GE but the people were not
              persuaded. So who else did the people turn to for their plight: the opposition.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">These people started to depend on the opposition to speak up
              for their grievances. During the GE, upgrading of HDB flats was used as carrot
              and stick<span>  </span>to the chagrin of the people.
              The ruling party even redrew the boundaries of the GRC hoping to beat the opposition
              which the people deemed was their only hope and voice. By hook or by crook they
              must have the opposition to look into their welfare. Anybody that tries to
              stifle the opposition will be vehemently met with criticism as seen very
              recently between the clash of Paya Lebar CCC and Mr Chen Show Mao. They just
              want a level playing field in politics.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">To heal the social divide would take an enormous task. It is
              not as simple as overnight reverse engineering as most problems are deep
              seated. Like it or not, the opposition is here to stay.</p>

              <p>No humans are equal, equality is just part of human lying to another human. We are equal, but equal differently, the super rich are equal within themselves, the mid class and the poor are also equal within their own group, and that so call different in aspect.</p>
              <p>The ability of any govt who knows how to strike a good balance in social inequality is a smart one, but not necessary a good one. Like singapore, whereby the rich get rich and the poor either remain status quo or become poorer is an inequality in the distribution of wealth, this unequality is explained by meritocracy. Meeritocrcay in a way also give in to nepotism, favoritism and stagnation of believing that good education is the way to get rich and powerful. Amid that, people start to push for education and end up wearing the strait jacket kind of mentality that give way to a forever working class condition, and within the best of this working class, one become rich and powerful thru both ethical and unethical ways.</p>
              <p>There is no way to heal social divide, as there is no way to please everyone.</p>

In the midst of heated discussion, Ms Beguia made a few insulting and hurtful remarks about Singaporeans.<br><br>"She said: 'These moronic 'Singaporeans', their code, their morals, their 'loyalty' and 'patriotism'... all dropped at the first sign of trouble... just ask any of them if they want to be excused from serving NS and they will be the first to raise their hands... Require any of them to serve an extra month of NS and they will riot in Singapore... Ask them to fight a war, almost all will declare they are ready to pack up and run.'<br><br>"Is she trying to say all our NSMEN are cowards? On what grounds was she making such accusations?<br><br>"She further explained the followings to one of the Facebook users: 'But when foreigners like Bangladeshi, Thais and Indians come and provide labour for building flats and roads, you didn't seem to have complained about it...if tomorrow the government decides to hire foreigners to become soldiers and no more serving of NS for all men let's see if you will make the same comment...By the way, if foreigners can come and snatch your jobs and flats it only shows one thing.... how incompetent you are.'<br></p></div>

              Ruling party for so many years, surely arrogant mah.
              
              PAP is like a Tree deeply rooted in Singapore.

              <p>No, I studied in Taiwan under the kuo ming tan, they cannot afford to be arrogant, once a mayor's son in our town act very arrogant, peoples whack his driver and cars, in the end the mayor ask the town peoples to cool down and apologise on behalf of his son, who had run away. In return, the people tell the mayor, the driver is what we the people employed for you, the car is what the town people buy for you, so we are just destroying our own things which you do not know how to take care while under your care. Next year, the mayor could not even stand for election.</p>
              <p>Our PAP govt must understand that whatever you have today, high paid, nice mercede cars, good foods and so on are what the peoples give to you, in return, the peoples wish that you can bring peace, healthy and prosperity to the peoples of this country. Peace meaning harmony and able to settle issue amicably thru consultative approach from all walks of life.  Prosperity meaning, good paying jobs for everyone, increase productivity and live happily. But seem like they take your money and live arrogantly without consultating or check back with you on their policies, especially the foreign policy that end up low paid and poor get poorers, middle class get low pay and rich class hv to live with foreign indian workers</p>

              <p>That's painful indeed! Hope that it does not worsen. The government has to see long term survival of true peace and joys. Policy should never be overly market domiance as it is always within control - man-made policy need to enforce control to cushion one-sided interests, while transferring much more cash flow for the low-middle income people, though the rich still get richer, in real income policy.</p>
