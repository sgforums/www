            <div class='col-md body'>Salman, let me educate you on the legal definition of a wound:<br><br>Bouvier's Law Dictionary, Revised 6th Ed (1856) :<br><br>WOUND, med. jur. This term, in legal medicine, comprehends all lesions of<br>the body, and in this it differs from the meaning of the word when used in<br>surgery. The latter only refers to a solution of continuity, while the<br>former comprises not only these, but also every other kind of accident, such<br>as bruises, contusions, fractures, dislocations, and the like. Cooper's<br>Surgical Dict. h.t.; Dunglison's Med. Dict. h.t.; vide Dictionnaire des<br>Sciences Medicales, mot Blessures 3 Fodere, Med. Leg. Sec. 687-811.<br><br>2. <strong>Under the statute 9 Geo. IV. c. 21, sect. 12, it has been held in<br>England, that to make a wound, in criminal cases, there must be "an injury<br>to the person by which the skin is broken."</strong> 6 C. &amp; P. 684; S. C. 19 Eng. C.<br>L. Rep. 526. Vide Beck's Med. Jur. c. 15; Ryan's Med. Jur. Index, h.t.;<br>Roscoe's Cr. Ev. 652; 19 Eng. Com. L. Rep. 425, 430, 526, 529; Dane's Ab.<br>Index, h.t.; 1 Moody's Cr.

            <div class='col-md body'>Salman,<br><br>Here's an illustration so that you understand the legal meaning of 'battery':<br><br>In January of this year, a Jehovah's Witness, Julio Cordero, filed suit against a Florida hospital where he was treated after a car accident in May 2000. Cordero alleges battery, defined as "trespass against his body," and falsification of medical records.....<br><br>Cordero was injured in a car accident and brought to the Delray Medical Center in Delray Beach.<br><br>According to his complaint, Cordero was described by medical personnel as very alert, and in this condition, he repeatedly indicated that he did not agree to a blood transfusion under any circumstances. As a Jehovah's Witness, Cordero reads the Biblical prohibition against eating blood as including blood transfusions.<br><br>Despite his alleged refusal, however, Cordero apparently did receive a transfusion during surgery....<br><br>... As noted above, Cordero alleged battery based on the fact that blood had been transfused into his body without his consent. Under the law, the plaintiff asserted, this was a trespass on the body.<br><br>...<strong>a battery has historically been understood as an offensive and actionable touching, even in the absence of any physical harm. </strong>If you shove your neighbor, you commit a battery, even if the shove is not painful and leaves no mark or scar. That is because a person has a right not to be touched against her will - it is the violation of that right that represents the essential injury of battery, rather than any additional consequences.'<br><br>(http://writ.news.findlaw.com/colb/20040310.html)<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Here is something from the American legal perspective but is applicable to Common Law jurisdictions such as Singapore:<br><br>"American law initially considered issues of informed consent under the mantle of battery, which considers that any offensive and unconsented touching of another renders a person liable for damages. This law may still apply to patients under anesthesia and dates back to the early days of the Common Law.<br><br>Lack of consent is an issue of battery. When active misrepresentation is used to induce consent to surgery, perhaps by exaggeration of the surgeon's experience, the consent is invalid, and battery has taken place..."<br><br>( http://www.emedicine.com/ent/topic181.htm)<br></div>

Forcing someone to donate something is wrong in the first place. <strong>YOU</strong> yourself have the wrong set of values in your mind. What's wrong is wrong. There's no such thing as circumstances.<br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Salman:</div><div class="quote_body">We don't follow angmos blindly like you and end up with crime infested societies like they do.</div></blockquote>Then what/who do <strong>YOU</strong> follow?

Last time I also kanna like that. I got confinement but only til 5pm while everyone that donated got long weekend that Saturday. Why? Because I'm a selfish person? No...
