              <p><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>JB’s son steps up to do battle</strong></span><br> Insight: Down South<br> By SEAH CHIANG NEE<br> <br> <strong><em>More young professionals with good credentials are trickling
              towards the opposition camp, auguring well for the growth of democracy
              in Singapore.</em></strong><br> <br> SINGAPOREANS have long had an insipid sense of political apathy
              aggravated by many years of top-down government, but a small breeze may
              be blowing.<br> <br> Even among activists, few are ready to take the plunge of challenging the government in elections like in most other countries.<br> <br> Even the ruling People’s Action Party (PAP) has to offer rich incentives to attract them.<br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>But in these times of crisis, when the political
              life-span of the 85-year-old Lee Kuan Yew nears its sunset years, the
              ground may be starting to shift. </strong></span>With talk of a snap
              election by the year-end, more Singaporeans with good credentials are
              trickling towards the fledgling opposition camp.<br> <br> Their entry into politics augurs well for the growth of democracy in Singapore.<br> <br> The latest is a big catch for the opposition. He is the 50-year-old son
              of the late opposition icon JB Jeyaretnam, Lee’s erstwhile foe for
              decades.<br> <br> Kenneth has announced he has joined the new Reform Party, has been
              co-opted into its leadership and seeks to stand in the next election.<br> <br> The Reform Party was set up by Jeyaretnam before he died of heart failure, aged 82, seven months ago.<br> <br> Kenneth said the decision was to honour his father’s long struggle for
              a freer society, and he would inject his own economic ideas for
              Singapore’s future. He will not be the only opposition recruit. When an
              election date becomes clearer, more candidates may rise to the surface.<br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>Lee had predicted such a trend many years ago.<br> <br> He believes that after he leaves, a new breed of bright, well-educated
              youths – who hitherto shun politics – will emerge to challenge the PAP.</strong></span> <br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>These would be graduates from top foreign and local universities who would join opposition parties to contest in elections.</strong></span><br> <br> Secondly, Lee has also expressed confidence that the PAP will remain in
              power but only for two more elections (10 years); after that, anything
              goes.<br> <br> Thirdly, Lee doesn’t rule out a future PAP leadership splitting into
              two factions after he has left, perhaps along ideological lines.<br> <br> Well, the Minister Mentor is still around, relatively healthy (he’s now
              visiting Vietnam) and revealing no sign of wanting to go.<br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>However, his prophesy of an infusion of youthful talent in the opposition may be coming true, even while he is still in office.</strong></span><br> <br> Kenneth’s arrival on the scene is a case in point. He seems to have some political acumen despite his lack of experience.<br> <br> “Like the Prime Minister, I also have a double first (in Economics)
              from Cambridge,” he said. PM Lee Hsien Loong’s is in Mathematics.<br> <br> Academic qualifications rank very high among the Singaporean voter’s preferences in a candidate.<br> <br> When Hsien Loong entered politics, his Double First was a strong appeal
              among heartlanders, a card Kenneth is now using to good effect.<br> <br> Jeyaretnam’s son is married and has a 12-year-old boy. He worked in
              London’s financial sector for several years before returning with his
              family to Singapore last April.<br> <br> It has immediately raised a “Son versus Son” buzz among old-timers who
              still remember the old verbal battles between their respective fathers,
              Jeyaretnam and Lee.<br> <br> Most people, however, dismiss it as unlikely. Both men are very
              different from their fathers, possessing none of dad’s confrontational
              stances or propensity for heated debate.<br> <br> Even if Kenneth gets elected – a big if – the two men may face each
              other in Parliament in a more sombre, logical manner. At any rate,
              modern House rules will probably forbid any heated arguments. Both Lee
              and Jeyaretnam were lawyers and master debaters, while their sons are
              less aggressive by nature.<br> <br> In these days, when Singapore needs a new strategy for its future
              survival, Kenneth’s discipline as a trained economist (something
              Jeyaretnam lacked) may be more important.<br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>He is an important catalyst for the recruitment of professionals by his party and the opposition in general.<br> <br> It comes at a time when the government is facing its strongest public
              pressure in many years because of a number of unpopular policies and
              the severe economic downturn.</strong></span> <br> <br> Another potential candidate is Tan Kin Lian, former PAP elite and
              ex-CEO of NTUC Income (insurance giant of the National Trades Union
              Congress).<br> <br> Tan became a folk-hero of sorts when he organised weekly rallies to
              help Singaporeans recover their losses from being “misled” into
              investing in the defunct Lehmans structured notes sold by the local DBS
              Bank.<br> <br> An active blogger, he has not shown his hand yet, but says he may
              possibly contest as a candidate for an established opposition party.<br> <br> Meanwhile, the main opposition parties have reported an increase in their recruitment of younger potential candidates.<br> <br> The long surviving SPP leader, Chiam See Tong, who has recovered from a
              stroke, hopes to battle in a bigger pond, fighting in a group
              constituency, and to let his wife defend his strong turf at Potong
              Pasir.<br> <br> “I already have a team. We have one doctor, one accountant, two lawyers,” he told a reporter.<br> <br> The opposition Workers Party was recently hit by resignations of four cadre members, including two past candidates.<br> <br> Officials, however, say the loss is more than made up for by new
              recruits. “The process of renewal is on track,” said its leader and MP
              Low Thia Khiang.<br> <br> Its team is getting younger, with nine of 15 CEC members below the age
              of 40. For the PAP, however, the worry is voter reaction, rather than
              the opposition moves. That will decide its fortunes.<br> <br> ----------------------------<br> <span style="color: navy;"><strong>Latest news update at Singapore News Alternative:</strong><br> <br> 1.

              <p>As more and more s'poreans become better educated, they become knowledgeable and aware and this should not be taken as a rebellion. In such times, it is best not to offend this group of intellectually oriented voters as it has been shown to bring about collapse of whole governments.</p>
              <p>As with such intellectual population, the opposition may in fact have a easier job to gain votes than in the past and the ruling party may have a harder time. The cards on the table have been turned. But the cards have to carefully played the next time as the ruling party's strategies are being exhausted over the years.</p>
