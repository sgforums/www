            <div class='col-md body'>extracted from straits times forum.<br><br>EVERY day in the media we are exhorted to welcome the arrival next month of the representatives of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank with 'four million smiles'. I hope that the 16,000 delegates are greeted with the genuine warmth which I received when I arrived here 16 years ago.<br>Now I am married to a lovely Singaporean and have  two beautiful Eurasian children.<br><br>Singapore has been very kind to me: regular work, a nice home and, above all, safety.  I have great affection for this multiracial beacon of light in a terribly divided world.<br><br>However, something that happened recently in United Square makes me wonder if there isn't still a shadow to Singapore's bright welcome of foreigners.<br><br>I happened to hold a door open for a middle-aged man. Now, I don't expect cringing gratitude, bunches of roses or boxes of chocolate, but when the person looks straight at you from a distance and walks up, it would be nice if he registered something. The man simply stared at me and passed by.<br><br>'You're welcome!' I said. He hesitated for a moment and looked at me.<br><br>'You're welcome!' I repeated. He muttered something I didn't catch and carried on walking. Intrigued, I followed him into a cafe nearby.<br><br>'Sorry?' I said. 'I didn't hear what you said.'<br><br>'I don't have to thank you!' he said, quite worked up.<br><br>'Well, it would have been nice,' I replied.<br><br>'I don't have to bow down to you!'<br><br>'Well, I didn't expect that! It's just social politeness to say thank you and I thought maybe you might...'<br><br>'Why should I do that to you?'<br><br>The degree of dislike in his tone shocked me and I went back to my wife and children, who were having lunch at a table nearby.<br><br>While I was eating, I could see the man out of the corner of my eye. He was waiting for his takeaway order and staring over at me, obviously planning something.<br><br>When he came out, he shouted something at me. I didn't catch it and said, 'Sorry?'<br><br>'I'm xenophobic!' he shouted quite proudly, thumping his chest.<br><br>'Pleased to meet you!' I said, 'I'm Brendan!' He waddled off.<br><br>This was an obviously articulate and well-educated man, not some small-town redneck. Yet he seemed so proud to proclaim his racial prejudice in full view of 50 lunchtime diners. It quite spoilt my appetite. I had thought this kind of reaction to foreigners here  had gone out with the last millennium.<br><br>There are about 4.3 million people in Singapore. 'Four million smiles' leaves about 300,000 unaccounted for.<br><br>I wonder how many people feel like the man I met. I really do hope that when 'the world' arrives next month, it will be greeted by bright smiles and not by the dark scowl of Mr  Xenophobic.<br><br>Brendan Buxton<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>crazy,in every society,there are bound to be many types of people mah,just because we are a multi racial society does not means everyone is the same.It is not uncommon to meet someone who is rude and do not say thank you for your kind actions.And based on his one encounter,he has to write to the press about it?And i dun really think it is related to race,someone who is rude and not xenophobic is also as likely not to say thanks or whatever to appreciate your kind effort.<br><br>And i must say the writer has some damn attitude problem,if you just want to be helpful,why do you demand something in return? if the person is appreciative,fine.If not just go off with the good feeling that you have helped someone today and feel good just cause of it.His attitude is doing something must get a return,if this means trying so hard,then dun pretend to be helpful lah,do action only but not being truely wanting to be helpful in the first place.........</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, gd points u guys have noted but I can't help but feel that he doesn't understand our culture enough even though he has a S'porean wife. Also got to take into account the westernised environment he grew up in.<br><br>Just like S'pore.....our leaders. They don't know what it's like to earn $1,500/mth and have 2, 3 mouths to feed. That's why they are still asking the avg S'porean to make babies.<br><br>I really would love to see a "free public transport week" just to get cars off the road for a greener environment or whatever. This govt is too profit oriented.<br><br>Maybe we shd start a reality show featuring Mah Bow Tan or Lee Hsien Loong earning $1,500/mth, taking public transport and staying HDB etc.<br><br>Sorry for straying!!!
