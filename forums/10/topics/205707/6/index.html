The way I see it, all the information within the original article is pointed at Buxton's expressing his disgruntlement at Xenophobic Man's lack of manners and the resulting consequences.

Instead, it was Xenophobic Man's intransigent and recalcitrant attitude in unabashedly claiming, "I don't have to bow down to you".  What did bowing down have to do with the situation?  It appears that instead of Buxton putting himself in a superior position, Xenophobe placed himself in an imagined inferior position which he then tried to fight his way out of in the most Quixotic manner.</div>

Given that X-man already demonstrated a lack of manners, it is also entirely possible that he could have reacted in a hostile and manner to a situation that didn't call for it.  There's nothing that conclusively shows that Buxton was acting superior, even though we of course cannot exclude that possibility.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Atobe:</div><div class="quote_body"><span style="color: darkred;">What about <span style="font-style: italic;">X-Man's</span> side of this sorry episode ?<br><br>The fact that Buxton would make a 'mountain out of a molehill' towards <span style="font-style: italic;">X-Man's</span> unresponsiveness to an uncomplimented courteous effort from Buxton probably shook <span style="font-style: italic;">X-Man</span> up more then necessarily.<br><br>I am not making any excuse for <span style="font-style: italic;">X-Man</span>, as I would have felt shocked that someone will run after me, to elicit an acknowlegement of thanks for something which I thought my unexpressed appreciation was known to such a kind gesture and effort made - by someone who probably have done it as second nature without demanding acknowledgment in return.<br><br>It was definitely not Buxton's "You're welcome" remark that was the deciding factor, but it was Buxton's direct up-the-face confrontation with <span style="font-style: italic;">X-Man</span> over a very small issue.<br></span></div></blockquote>I disagree, Atobe.  X-man could have acted in a mature manner and acknowledged his mistake, but instead he acted like a petulant child and escalated the matter, to the extent that even after disengaging from Buxton, he came back and started things all over again.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Atobe:</div><div class="quote_body"><span style="color: darkred;">By writing to the ST Forum, is Buxton perhaps seeking redress in gaining public sympathy in which he felt peeved with the outcome of an unfinished confrontation ?</span></div></blockquote>Perhaps, but it's equally possible that he is simply pointing out a social issue that he sees for for the public to pay attention to.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Atobe:</div><div class="quote_body"><span style="color: darkred;">As third parties, we have only Buxton printed views to go by, and it is based on Buxton's version that we learn of <span style="font-style: italic;">X-Man</span> ability to pronounce clearly the word <span style="font-style: italic;">xenophobic</span> - said so clearly for Buxton to understand and presumably without any excited Asian accented stuttering, and through the heated emotion of being confronted over a small issue.<br><br>This is a remarkable achievement on the part of <span style="font-style: italic;">X-Man</span> who is a Singaporean, and whose mother tongue is not English.<br></span></div></blockquote>That's not quite accurate, is it?  Being Singaporean, X-man's mother tongue may not be English, but since it's so commonly spoken, why shouldn't we expect him to be realistically able to pronounce "xenophobic"?<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Atobe:</div><div class="quote_body"><span style="color: darkred;">You are definitely correct, and I sense a certain degree of inferiority and superiority on both sides - <span style="font-style: italic;">X-Man</span> reasserting his own superiority in being made inferior by the audacious and condescending attempt by  Buxton to teach some manners. A <span style="font-style: italic;">"kwai loh"</span> boosted by his own sense of superior righteousness in etiquette correctness in trying to teach an Asian about courtesy - <span style="font-style: italic;">in Public</span> ?<br><br>"Extreme Racism" aside, there exist fixxed attitudes of one race towards another even in this Twenty-First Century; and although not vividly expressed - as in Buxton's printed <span style="font-style: italic;">expose</span> - one's perception towards another behaviour can be colored by one's innate values and opinions towards others.<br><br>Will Buxton have taken the trouble to write such <span style="font-style: italic;">an expose</span> to the national paper in his original place of domicile - over similar incidents encountered with his own country men ?<br><br>Will his community have taken note of such a mundane incident that probably occur countless times on a daily basis ?<br></span></div></blockquote>The key issue here is X-man's lack of manners - after all, this is how the incident started.  How he felt about it and what other issues he associated with it are driven by nobody besides himself.  He apparently turned an issue about manners into a racial one, and from the looks of it, it was simply to draw attention away from his lack of manners.  I'd read that as him being simply irresponsible and childish.<br><br>As for what Buxton would have done in country of origin, who knows?  He certainly seems vocal enough, and in countries where speaking one's mind is encouraged, it's entirely possible he could have done exactly the same thing.  Chances are that someone would call him petty, but we don't have enough information to determine if that would have stopped him.</div>

Now, I don't expect cringing gratitude, bunches of roses or boxes of chocolate, but when the person looks straight at you from a distance and walks up, it would be nice if he registered something. The man simply stared at me and passed by.<br><br>'You're welcome!' I said. He hesitated for a moment and looked at me.<br><br>'You're welcome!' I repeated. He muttered something I didn't catch and carried on walking. Intrigued, I followed him into a cafe nearby.<br><br>'Sorry?' I said.
