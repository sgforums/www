Just a "thank you", that's all. Why be so upset that the "xenophobic" man did not say that? One gets the feeling that this "xenophobic" man said such a word to irritate our "kind" writer on purpose. As others have pointed out, "xenophobic" is not a usual term we use here. If you want to be kind, then don't be so keen on others' gratitude. Anyway, it is just helping to open a door, big deal.</div>

They panic, and the behavioural patterns of a panic attack do not encompass those of our xenophobe.  His behaviour, had it been a genuine phobia, would have been to do whatever it took to get away from Buxton.  Instead, he stopped and asked what Buxton said, when he would have scurried away had he really been phobic.  Later <span style="text-decoration: underline;">approached</span> him in order to tell him about the xenophobia after the first encounter had already been disengaged.  See the difference?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yeah.. very disgusting leh the 4 million smiles thing. Wonder who came up w the stupid idea.<br><br>It would have worked much better for me at least if they focused on the opportunity to get to know new people, to network, new biz opportunities, etc -&gt; as a result, people might feel more genial, friendly, sociable.<br><br>rather than this hypocritical campaign to make me bare my teeth. Which really shows someone up there DOESN'T GET IT.</div>

That's going a bit far, don't you think?  In any civilised society in the world, is it too much work to acknowledge a small favour done for you, regardless of the other person's ethnicity?<br><br>Speaking of ethnicity, what would our forefathers (be they Chinese, Indian or Malay) have thought of the civilisations that they founded degenerating into such animal-like norms?<br><br>If simply saying thanks is read by someone as "kissing ass", then it reflects more upon the person who thinks that way than the person who points out the problem.  Do people really need to be so small-minded as to turn a simple gesture of civility into an us-and-them issue?<br><br>I think we need to get a grip here.</div>
