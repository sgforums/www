Atobe, those are a few tenuous points you've made there.<br><br>Buxton isn't some expat who's just been assigned to Singapore by his parent company.  He's chosen to settle down in Singapore, so what makes you think he has an axe to grind?<br><br>Second, if Xenophobic Man is middle aged, he would have been attending school at a time where, attending the right school, he could easily have developed enough vocabulary to know what xenophobic means, or at least fidn the meaning out.  It's a bit of a stretch to rule out his being a Singaporean on this basis.<br><br>Finally, Buxton has settled down in Singapore and raised a family.  It stands to reason that he would have had enough exposure to the local population (especially seeing as how he married into it) to tell a local from a foreigner, doesn't it?</div>
