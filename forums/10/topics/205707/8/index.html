Every post that don't share your view sure get some sarcastic remark. Some want to  stop, you also must have the last snide remark.<br><br>Think you are our saviour? Ride around on your high horse looking down on everyone? I think that make you just the same pompus ass as that buxton.<br><br>What makes you so special that gives you the right to be sarcastic? You are rich? You had a very good education? Your parents so well educated that's why you like that ? You were a white horse in the army?<br><br>You are simi lan?

Unfortunately, of course, if someone decides to stay with the matter at hand instead of taking the spotlight off his inadequacies, then he's stuck and feels he has no recourse but to escalate the matter.<br><br>In fact, he's gone so far off the rails as to forget which side of the argument he claims to be on, instead supporting my point.  Atobe suggested that Singaporean English is not of a high enough standard to include the use of "xenophobic", and I pointed out that I hold a higher view of local English standards than that.  Our friend here seems to support the point, claiming that "We know how to use proper english too". <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Of course, he also shoots himself in the foot by claiming the moral high ground of speaking with respect, while the actual substance of what he says hardly reflects practice of that principle that he so sanctimoniously espouses. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>No, tqw, thank <span style="text-decoration: underline;">you</span> for illustrating my point so clearly. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

Rest assured, if Singlish is your normal mode of communication, I can accommodate you.<br><br>As for the insults, I let the other person set the level of communication.  If someone wants to get snide, I will respond in kind.  On the other hand, if you look at my exchanges with someone like Atobe, I don't engage in that sort of thing because he doesn't either.  It's not a case of someone disagreeing with me at all.<br><br>If someone makes a point I cannot rebut, I concede the point.  If the point is something I can rebut, I will do so.  Simple, isn't it?<br><br>I have no problem with any lack of respect you choose to employ.  After all, how you choose to conduct yourself says everything about you and nothing about me, so it's not my problem at all, is it?  I'm just pointing out your hypocrisy in espousing respect and then not practicing what you preach.</div>
