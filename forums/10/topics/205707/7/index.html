            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkred;">Gedanken, my apologies for taking a long break, as duties called and had to be attended to. It has been interesting that our views seems to co-incide up to the point where we get closer to understand the cause of this seemingly innocuous incident that has now been elevated to the point of <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>"typical ( ? ) Singaporean Rudeness" and "basic racial ineptitude"</strong></span></span>.<br><blockquote>Originally posted by Gedanken:<strong><br><span style="color: darkred;"><br>Original post by Atobe:<br>The fact that <span style="font-style: italic;">X-Man</span> had responded in the manner he did confirms my suspicion to this entire sorry episode as I have stated; and this is drawn from <span style="font-style: italic;">X-Man's</span> reported remarks - <span style="font-style: italic;">"I don't have to bow down to you"</span> - that was probably made in direct response to Buxton's body language, voice tone and pitch.<br></span></strong><br>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>That's conjecture, Atobe.  Given that X-man already demonstrated a lack of manners, it is also entirely possible that he could have reacted in a hostile and manner to a situation that didn't call for it.  There's nothing that conclusively shows that Buxton was acting superior, even though we of course cannot exclude that possibility.<br></blockquote><span style="color: darkred;"><strong>"Conjecture"</strong> depends too much on guess work, which is not the case with my statement made based on the purported remarks attributed to <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>X-Man</strong></span> - <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>"I don't have to bow down to you"</strong></span>.<br><br>This purported retort was supposedly made as a response to Buxton's  seemingly audacious move in demanding a "Thank You" from <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>X-Man</strong></span> for the door that was held opened by Buxton.<br><br>Granted <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>X-Man</strong></span> was <span style="font-style: italic;">"seemingly"</span> rude by not indicating his appreciation <strong>as perceived by Buxton</strong> - but we do not know the facts of the situation that transpired at that point in time - when both passed each other when the door was held open by Buxton. This is the critical moment, when something happened - eye contact or body language - caused Buxton to make his move, to chase <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>X-Man</strong></span> and demanded a "Thank You"  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation"><br><br>If someone was to pursue you for an apology to an <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>unknown "slight"</strong></span> that is seemingly insignificant to you, there are two possible ways in responding - (1) the petulant childlike response as you have stated of <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>X-Man</strong></span> resulting in his negative reaction to the perceived insolence of Buxton; (2) a more humourously sophisticated reply that can either be genuine, or pushed saguine sarcasm".  </span><br><blockquote>Original post by Gedanken:<br><br><strong><span style="color: darkred;">Original post by Atobe:<br>What about <span style="font-style: italic;">X-Man's</span> side of this sorry episode ?<br><br>The fact that Buxton would make a 'mountain out of a molehill' towards <span style="font-style: italic;">X-Man's</span> unresponsiveness to an uncomplimented courteous effort from Buxton probably shook <span style="font-style: italic;">X-Man</span> up more then necessarily.<br><br>I am not making any excuse for <span style="font-style: italic;">X-Man</span>, as I would have felt shocked that someone will run after me, to elicit an acknowlegement of thanks for something which I thought my unexpressed appreciation was known to such a kind gesture and effort made - by someone who probably have done it as second nature without demanding acknowledgment in return.<br><br>It was definitely not Buxton's "You're welcome" remark that was the deciding factor, but it was Buxton's direct up-the-face confrontation with <span style="font-style: italic;">X-Man</span> over a very small issue.<br></span></strong><br>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>I disagree, Atobe.  X-man could have acted in a mature manner and acknowledged his mistake, but instead he acted like a petulant child and escalated the matter, to the extent that even after disengaging from Buxton, he came back and started things all over again. </blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">The petulance in <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>X-Man</strong></span> was probably aroused by the indignant feelings at the seemingly audacious and ridiculous move by Buxton in publicly pursuirng for a <span style="font-style: italic;">"Thank You"</span>.<br><br>The manner in which Buxton had broached his demand is only drawn from his printed statement, and we do not know the <span style="font-style: italic;">actual circumstances</span> that transpired - the body language, the language used, the tone and pitch of voice applied in his demand - which led to <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>X-Man's</strong></span> retort : <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>"I don't have to bow to you"</strong></span>.<br><br>How else do we explain the arousing of the ire and indignant feelings in <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>X-Man</strong></span> - in reaction to Buxton's actions or reactions to an incident that in <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>X-Man's</strong></span> view was totally insignificant.<br><br>Could it not be perceived by <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>X-Man</strong></span> that Buxton was spoiling for a fight in pushing for a "Thank You" ?<br><br>I would have left it at that - if <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>X-Man</strong></span> had ignored my goodwill gesture.<br><br>Even if I was in <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>X-Man's</strong></span> shoes and had simply accepted the unsolicited goodwill gesture from Buxton - (or from anyone keeping the door open for me to follow through ) - and did not express my gratitude (not even with a nod or a smile, let alone a verbal acknowledgement), I would certainly be surprised and embarrassed, if someone would chase after me, demand a gesture of expressed appreciation, and made with an overbearing tone of teaching me some etiquette.<br><br>My reaction will be as spelled out in the two possible ways as stated in the preceding reply. </span><br><blockquote>Quoted by Gedanken:<br><strong><span style="color: darkred;">Originally posted by Atobe:<br>By writing to the ST Forum, is Buxton perhaps seeking redress in gaining public sympathy in which he felt peeved with the outcome of an unfinished confrontation ?</span></strong><br>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Perhaps, but it's equally possible that he is simply pointing out a social issue that he sees for for the public to pay attention to.<br></blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">We will never know, as this time it will depend on conjecture of his unstated thoughts buried in his own consciousness or otherwise.<br><br>Continued below </span><br></div>

Being Singaporean, X-man's mother tongue may not be English, but since it's so commonly spoken, why shouldn't we expect him to be realistically able to pronounce "xenophobic"?<br></blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">Yes, English is not the 'mother tongue' amongst even the most fluent English speakers from the English educated Singaporeans.<br><br>Even in the most calm circumstances, there are already instances in which one will struggle to find the most poignant word to express exactly the thoughts and feelings within oneself.<br><br>Can we expect any Singaporean to use this <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>"technical word"</strong></span> - (not in any engineering sense ) - <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>"Xenophobic"</strong></span> and in the circumstances of a confrontation in a public place ?<br><br>This <span style="font-style: italic;">"technical word"</span> is normally part of a professional lexicon from psychologist, psychiatrists, or some medical professions - and possible probability in the vocabulary of poets and verbal artistes.<br><br>Unless <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>X-Man</strong></span> is from such background, I will find it hard to believe that such a word will come forth from him, and spoken in clear pronunciation to be understood by Buxton - without any Asian accent, or slurred stuttering caused by heightened adrenalin from a confrontational excitement.</span><br><blockquote>Quoted by Gedanken<br><br><strong><span style="color: darkred;">Original post by Atobe:<br>You are definitely correct, and I sense a certain degree of inferiority and superiority on both sides - <span style="font-style: italic;">X-Man</span> reasserting his own superiority in being made inferior by the audacious and condescending attempt by  Buxton to teach some manners.

How he felt about it and what other issues he associated with it are driven by nobody besides himself.  He apparently turned an issue about manners into a racial one, and from the looks of it, it was simply to draw attention away from his lack of manners.  I'd read that as him being simply irresponsible and childish.<br><br>As for what Buxton would have done in country of origin, who knows?  He certainly seems vocal enough, and in countries where speaking one's mind is encouraged, it's entirely possible he could have done exactly the same thing.

            <div class='col-md body'>this could be viewed in different context. the ang moh was imposing his sort of 'western civilization' and what he believes to be good modern etiquette.  unfortunately, interpretations may not be universal. he was expecting something 'reciprocal' and he belives this to be a matter of his rights. in pursuing the matter, he also wants to examine his own fit or sense of belongingness. as usual he will be viewed as making a mountain out of a molehill, as this is not the first case and anything requring predictive responses is so outdated. and if it was truely a kind gesture, it should not be conditional or require any forms of acknowledgement. this is evident even in some cultures where people are thought to be very courteous like the thais. e.g. old folks and monks are treated with great reverence, so any youngster greeting an old man or holding a door for them does not expect any nod of the head or even a word of thanks. these are ingrained 'systems' in place that makes different societies unique. on the other hand, it shows that some singaporeans amongst us are probably evolving their own individuality, or asserting their cultural identity whatever that may be, but it is definitely not a case of being xenophobic. e.g. most are just too cowardly as the govt constantly drums into them the seriousness of race relations. sometimes, it is just being plain tired. in such tiny red dot with so many FT, who isnt? just take a look at the cram and smelly conditions of the mrt during rush hours, do you honestly have to treat everyone with an 'xcuse me' or 'sorry' when you bump into them? a nonchalent or rojak response to confuse is better.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Rock^Star:</div><div class="quote_body">That Buxton ang-moh is over zealous and does not understand our culture at all.<br><br>What is our culture?

This is the critical moment, when something happened - eye contact or body language - caused Buxton to make his move, to chase X-Man and demanded a "Thank You"<br><br>If someone was to pursue you for an apology to an unknown "slight" that is seemingly insignificant to you, there are two possible ways in responding - (1) the petulant childlike response as you have stated of X-Man resulting in his negative reaction to the perceived insolence of Buxton; (2) a more humourously sophisticated reply that can either be genuine, or pushed saguine sarcasm".<br></span></div></blockquote>Well Atobe, aren't we getting ahead of ourselves here?  From Buxton's description of the incident, he did not in fact follow X-man looking for an apology, he went to find out what X-man muttered.  This may seem like a trivial point, but it does change the setting because it shifts the focus from what Buxton to what drove X-man's behaviour.<br><br>As Buxton reports it, the exchange went along the lines of:<br><br>"I don't have to thank you"<br>"Well, it would have been nice"<br>"I don't have to bow down to you"<br><br>and of course, after a short break, X-man further escalated it into the "xenophobic" declaration.<br><br>Now how did an issue about failing to say thank you become a matter of xenophobia?  The progression, driven exclusively by X-man, seems almost Freudian.  Already being wrong, he made things worse by deliberately introducing a new problem into the situation.<br><br>As you have pointed out, there are two possible ways of having dealt with the situation.  X-man obviously chose the worse option.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Atobe:</div><div class="quote_body"><span style="color: darkred;">The petulance in X-Man was probably aroused by the indignant feelings at the seemingly audacious and ridiculous move by Buxton in publicly pursuirng for a "Thank You".<br><br>The manner in which Buxton had broached his demand is only drawn from his printed statement, and we do not know the actual circumstances that transpired - the body language, the language used, the tone and pitch of voice applied in his demand - which led to X-Man's retort : "I don't have to bow to you".<br><br>How else do we explain the arousing of the ire and indignant feelings in X-Man - in reaction to Buxton's actions or reactions to an incident that in X-Man's view was totally insignificant.<br><br>Could it not be perceived by X-Man that Buxton was spoiling for a fight in pushing for a "Thank You" ?<br><br>I would have left it at that - if X-Man had ignored my goodwill gesture.<br><br>Even if I was in X-Man's shoes and had simply accepted the unsolicited goodwill gesture from Buxton - (or from anyone keeping the door open for me to follow through ) - and did not express my gratitude (not even with a nod or a smile, let alone a verbal acknowledgement), I would certainly be surprised and embarrassed, if someone would chase after me, demand a gesture of expressed appreciation, and made with an overbearing tone of teaching me some etiquette.<br><br>My reaction will be as spelled out in the two possible ways as stated in the preceding reply.<br></span></div></blockquote>Atobe, you're assuming that Buxton was being overbearing, and that forms the basis of what you've said above.  If he was indeed overbearing, well and good, but as you have acknowledged, we don't know that he was for sure.  If he wasn't overbearing, then X-man's behaviour was a particularly immature reaction to a situation that he should have been embarrassed instead of indignant about.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Atobe:</div><div class="quote_body"><span style="color: darkred;">Yes, English is not the 'mother tongue' amongst even the most fluent English speakers from the English educated Singaporeans.<br><br>Even in the most calm circumstances, there are already instances in which one will struggle to find the most poignant word to express exactly the thoughts and feelings within oneself.<br><br>Can we expect any Singaporean to use this "technical word" - (not in any engineering sense ) - "Xenophobic" and in the circumstances of a confrontation in a public place ?<br><br>This "technical word" is normally part of a professional lexicon from psychologist, psychiatrists, or some medical professions - and possible probability in the vocabulary of poets and verbal artistes.<br><br>Unless X-Man is from such background, I will find it hard to believe that such a word will come forth from him, and spoken in clear pronunciation to be understood by Buxton - without any Asian accent, or slurred stuttering caused by heightened adrenalin from a confrontational excitement.<br></span></div></blockquote>Certainly "xenophobia" would not be an everyday term, but I don't think that we can reasonably extrapolate that to an assumption that it is exclusive to certain professions or levels of education.<br><br>On top of that, use of such a word would fit in perfectly with X-man's wish to be a smartarse, wouldn't it?<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Atobe:</div><div class="quote_body"><span style="color: darkred;">Unfortunately, the first question one need to ask :- is it Buxton's business to teach X-Man some social etiquette, and from an event which itself is an insignificant non-issue at that ?<br><br>It takes two hands to clap to make some sound, and it will also take two hands to clasp in friendly handshake to admit each other's mistaken perception and judgment, and submit to themselves to humility that will help prevent this matter from dragging on further.<br><br>There is sufficient evidence in Buxton's statements made to the ST Forum that reveal his position in pursuing the matter in the manner which he had made; but we have no way to understand the issue from the other side of the coin - which is X-Man's position.<br><br>From the various key statements purported to be made by X-Man and the statements attributed to Buxton, that is enough to make some intelligent speculation to determine the events that had occurred.<br><br>In my worksheet, it is not pretty for Buxton - as much as X-Man is to be blamed for the present sitatuon - and I will hold Buxton responsible for pursuing his own agenda in public, which caused unprovoked alarm and offense to X-Man<br></span></div></blockquote>That's a matter of interpretation, isn't it?  Was Buxton's intention to teach X-man manners, or was it to object to X-man's lack thereof?  If it's the latter, it's not a case of Buxton taking a superior position - it's a case of him standing up for himself.</div>
