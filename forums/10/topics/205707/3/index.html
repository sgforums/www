            <div class='col-md body'>I'm not sure how many here have lived overseas, but if you have you would notice the difference between Singapore and a lot of other countries.<br><br>In places like England and Australia, if you're walking down the street and you make eye contact with a stranger, the customary response would be to greet the other person.  In Singapore, a similar situation would result in either people averting their gazes or one party going, "what are you staring at" and proceeding to massage the other party with his knuckles.<br><br>Have a think about this and see what it says about Singapore.<br><br>What's all this crap about "We are Singapore, Singaporeans" that gets dusted off and dragged out once a year?  If society is operating in such a fashion and the government wants to build a sense of nationhood after a measly 41 years, you've got to really wonder what those guys are smoking.<br><br>Sense of nationhood my arse - two strangers from the same country can't even go down the street without getting into a fight, and we want to talk about Singapore as "one united nation, regardless of race, language or religion"?!  It's not a nation - it's a badly-mixed hodgepodge of individuals.<br><br>Pull the other leg - it's all a bloody bad joke.</div>

Who is to know?<br><br>We have all been to other big metropolis in the world like London or New York. My experience of London is worse. People push and shove each other out of the way in busy streets. Face it, life in big cities is like that. It is more impersonal, and in an unforgiving city like Singapore, where healthcare is not subsidized and failing can have grave consequences for yourself and your family, people are more uptight.<br><br>Anyway, so the guy did not say thank you, it's not perfect, but is that SUCH a big deal?</div>

Moral and civic lessons are totally absence in schools, and at homes.<br><br>If we have bad experience in London, New York, it does not make our bad behaviors at home legitimate. On the contrary, lets not let this happen in our country.<br><br>There is no need to argue for or against what Mr. Buxton said, just "Sorry for the bad encounter, Mr. Buxton, hope you meet better Singaporean the next time."

I am more concerned at the demand of a "thank you".<br><br>What I was taught in primary school is that when you hold a door open for others, give up your seat for others, you do not expect a thanks. You do not demand a thanks. You do not write a letter of complaint to the local newspaper to demand a thanks.<br><br>When others hold doors for you, give up seats to you or generally do something nice for you, you must thank them for it.<br><br>But is it really good manners when you demand gratitude back in return for a nice gesture?<br><br>If a friend drives down to pick me up in the middle of the night with not a word of complaint, that is nice. I'll thank that friend.<br><br>When a taxi driver picks me up and sends me home, after paying him, I thank him.<br><br>When a taxi driver bitches and whines about everything under the sun in the middle of the night, do I thank that person for the Hell he put me through?<br><br>Before alighting from a bus, do I have to squeeze my way to the front of the bus to thank the bus captain?<br><br>Similarly, although the xena-man was very rude (no question there), the other person was just as rude to DEMAND a word of gratitude by going up to him saying loudly to him "YOUR WELCOME" twice.<br><br>Sometimes people are not very bright (as seen by the xena-gorilla), sometimes they are downright rude. But does being courtest mean forcing courtesy out of those around us? To the extent of being intolerant?<br><br>Once again, I have no quarrel with you that mr xena and most singaporeans are rude. I also have no issue about the 100 plus years of culture many westerners have to develope their social skills and courtesy.
