              <h1>Israel’s Lies</h1>
              <h2>Henry Siegman</h2>
              <p>Western governments and most of the Western
                  media have accepted a number of Israeli claims justifying the military
                  assault on Gaza: that Hamas consistently violated the six-month truce
                  that Israel observed and then refused to extend it; that Israel
                  therefore had no choice but to destroy Hamas’s capacity to launch
                  missiles into Israeli towns; that Hamas is a terrorist organisation,
                  part of a global jihadi network; and that Israel has acted not only in
                  its own defence but on behalf of an international struggle by Western
                  democracies against this network.</p>
              <p>I am not aware of a single
                  major American newspaper, radio station or TV channel whose coverage of
                  the assault on Gaza questions this version of events. Criticism of
                  Israel’s actions, if any (and there has been none from the Bush
                  administration), has focused instead on whether the IDF’s carnage is
                  proportional to the threat it sought to counter, and whether it is
                  taking adequate measures to prevent civilian casualties.</p>
              <p>Middle
                  East peacemaking has been smothered in deceptive euphemisms, so let me
                  state bluntly that each of these claims is a lie. Israel, not Hamas,
                  violated the truce: Hamas undertook to stop firing rockets into Israel;
                  in return, Israel was to ease its throttlehold on Gaza. In fact, during
                  the truce, it tightened it further. This was confirmed not only by
                  every neutral international observer and NGO on the scene but by
                  Brigadier General (Res.) Shmuel Zakai, a former commander of the IDF’s
                  Gaza Division. In an interview in <em>Ha’aretz</em> on 22 December, he accused Israel’s government of having made a ‘central error’ during the <em>tahdiyeh</em>,
                  the six-month period of relative truce, by failing ‘to take advantage
                  of the calm to improve, rather than markedly worsen, the economic
                  plight of the Palestinians of the Strip . . . When you create a <em>tahdiyeh</em>,
                  and the economic pressure on the Strip continues,’ General Zakai said,
                  ‘it is obvious that Hamas will try to reach an improved <em>tahdiyeh</em>,
                  and that their way to achieve this is resumed Qassam fire . . . You
                  cannot just land blows, leave the Palestinians in Gaza in the economic
                  distress they’re in, and expect that Hamas will just sit around and do
                  nothing.’</p>
              <p>The truce, which began in June last year and was due
                  for renewal in December, required both parties to refrain from violent
                  action against the other. Hamas had to cease its rocket assaults and
                  prevent the firing of rockets by other groups such as Islamic Jihad
                  (even Israel’s intelligence agencies acknowledged this had been
                  implemented with surprising effectiveness), and Israel had to put a
                  stop to its targeted assassinations and military incursions. This
                  understanding was seriously violated on 4 November, when the IDF
                  entered Gaza and killed six members of Hamas. Hamas responded by
                  launching Qassam rockets and Grad missiles. Even so, it offered to
                  extend the truce, but only on condition that Israel ended its blockade.
                  Israel refused. It could have met its obligation to protect its
                  citizens by agreeing to ease the blockade, but it didn’t even try. It
                  cannot be said that Israel launched its assault to protect its citizens
                  from rockets. It did so to protect its right to continue the
                  strangulation of Gaza’s population.</p>
              <p>Everyone seems to have
                  forgotten that Hamas declared an end to suicide bombings and rocket
                  fire when it decided to join the Palestinian political process, and
                  largely stuck to it for more than a year. Bush publicly welcomed that
                  decision, citing it as an example of the success of his campaign for
                  democracy in the Middle East. (He had no other success to point to.)
                  When Hamas unexpectedly won the election, Israel and the US immediately
                  sought to delegitimise the result and embraced Mahmoud Abbas, the head
                  of Fatah, who until then had been dismissed by Israel’s leaders as a
                  ‘plucked chicken’. They armed and trained his security forces to
                  overthrow Hamas; and when Hamas – brutally, to be sure – pre-empted
                  this violent attempt to reverse the result of the first honest
                  democratic election in the modern Middle East, Israel and the Bush
                  administration imposed the blockade.</p>
              <p>Israel seeks to counter
                  these indisputable facts by maintaining that in withdrawing Israeli
                  settlements from Gaza in 2005, Ariel Sharon gave Hamas the chance to
                  set out on the path to statehood, a chance it refused to take; instead,
                  it transformed Gaza into a launching-pad for firing missiles at
                  Israel’s civilian population. The charge is a lie twice over. First,
                  for all its failings, Hamas brought to Gaza a level of law and order
                  unknown in recent years, and did so without the large sums of money
                  that donors showered on the Fatah-led Palestinian Authority. It
                  eliminated the violent gangs and warlords who terrorised Gaza under
                  Fatah’s rule. Non-observant Muslims, Christians and other minorities
                  have more religious freedom under Hamas rule than they would have in
                  Saudi Arabia, for example, or under many other Arab regimes.</p>
              <p>The
                  greater lie is that Sharon’s withdrawal from Gaza was intended as a
                  prelude to further withdrawals and a peace agreement. This is how
                  Sharon’s senior adviser Dov Weisglass, who was also his chief
                  negotiator with the Americans, described the withdrawal from Gaza, in
                  an interview with <em>Ha’aretz</em> in August 2004:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>What
                  I effectively agreed to with the Americans was that part of the
                  settlements [i.e. the major settlement blocks on the West Bank] would
                  not be dealt with at all, and the rest will not be dealt with until the
                  Palestinians turn into Finns . . . The significance [of the agreement
                  with the US] is the freezing of the political process. And when you
                  freeze that process, you prevent the establishment of a Palestinian
                  state and you prevent a discussion about the refugees, the borders and
                  Jerusalem. Effectively, this whole package that is called the
                  Palestinian state, with all that it entails, has been removed from our
                  agenda indefinitely. And all this with [President Bush’s] authority and
                  permission . . . and the ratification of both houses of Congress.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Do
                  the Israelis and Americans think that Palestinians don’t read the
                  Israeli papers, or that when they saw what was happening on the West
                  Bank they couldn’t figure out for themselves what Sharon was up to?</p>
              <p>Israel’s
                  government would like the world to believe that Hamas launched its
                  Qassam rockets because that is what terrorists do and Hamas is a
                  generic terrorist group. In fact, Hamas is no more a ‘terror
                  organisation’ (Israel’s preferred term) than the Zionist movement was
                  during its struggle for a Jewish homeland. In the late 1930s and 1940s,
                  parties within the Zionist movement resorted to terrorist activities
                  for strategic reasons. According to Benny Morris, it was the Irgun that
                  first targeted civilians. He writes in <em>Righteous Victims</em> that
                  an upsurge of Arab terrorism in 1937 ‘triggered a wave of Irgun
                  bombings against Arab crowds and buses, introducing a new dimension to
                  the conflict’. He also documents atrocities committed during the
                  1948-49 war by the IDF, admitting in a 2004 interview, published in <em>Ha’aretz</em>,
                  that material released by Israel’s Ministry of Defence showed that
                  ‘there were far more Israeli acts of massacre than I had previously
                  thought . . . In the months of April-May 1948, units of the Haganah
                  were given operational orders that stated explicitly that they were to
                  uproot the villagers, expel them, and destroy the villages themselves.’
                  In a number of Palestinian villages and towns the IDF carried out
                  organised executions of civilians. Asked by <em>Ha’aretz</em> whether he condemned the ethnic cleansing, Morris replied that he did not:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>A
                  Jewish state would not have come into being without the uprooting of
                  700,000 Palestinians. Therefore it was necessary to uproot them. There
                  was no choice but to expel that population. It was necessary to cleanse
                  the hinterland and cleanse the border areas and cleanse the main roads.
                  It was necessary to cleanse the villages from which our convoys and our
                  settlements were fired on.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>In other words, when Jews
                  target and kill innocent civilians to advance their national struggle,
                  they are patriots. When their adversaries do so, they are terrorists.</p>
              <p>It
                  is too easy to describe Hamas simply as a ‘terror organisation’. It is
                  a religious nationalist movement that resorts to terrorism, as the
                  Zionist movement did during its struggle for statehood, in the mistaken
                  belief that it is the only way to end an oppressive occupation and
                  bring about a Palestinian state. While Hamas’s ideology formally calls
                  for that state to be established on the ruins of the state of Israel,
                  this doesn’t determine Hamas’s actual policies today any more than the
                  same declaration in the PLO charter determined Fatah’s actions.</p>
              <p>These
                  are not the conclusions of an apologist for Hamas but the opinions of
                  the former head of Mossad and Sharon’s national security adviser,
                  Ephraim Halevy. The Hamas leadership has undergone a change ‘right
                  under our very noses’, Halevy wrote recently in <em>Yedioth Ahronoth</em>,
                  by recognising that ‘its ideological goal is not attainable and will
                  not be in the foreseeable future.’ It is now ready and willing to see
                  the establishment of a Palestinian state within the temporary borders
                  of 1967. Halevy noted that while Hamas has not said how ‘temporary’
                  those borders would be, ‘they know that the moment a Palestinian state
                  is established with their co-operation, they will be obligated to
                  change the rules of the game: they will have to adopt a path that could
                  lead them far from their original ideological goals.’ In an earlier
                  article, Halevy also pointed out the absurdity of linking Hamas to
                  al-Qaida.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>In the eyes of al-Qaida, the members of
                  Hamas are perceived as heretics due to their stated desire to
                  participate, even indirectly, in processes of any understandings or
                  agreements with Israel. [The Hamas political bureau chief, Khaled]
                  Mashal’s declaration diametrically contradicts al-Qaida’s approach, and
                  provides Israel with an opportunity, perhaps a historic one, to
                  leverage it for the better.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Why then are Israel’s
                  leaders so determined to destroy Hamas? Because they believe that its
                  leadership, unlike that of Fatah, cannot be intimidated into accepting
                  a peace accord that establishes a Palestinian ‘state’ made up of
                  territorially disconnected entities over which Israel would be able to
                  retain permanent control. Control of the West Bank has been the
                  unwavering objective of Israel’s military, intelligence and political
                  elites since the end of the Six-Day War.<a href="http://www.lrb.co.uk/v31/n02/print/sieg01_.html#footnotes">[*]</a> They believe that Hamas would not permit such a cantonisation of
                  Palestinian territory, no matter how long the occupation continues.
                  They may be wrong about Abbas and his superannuated cohorts, but they
                  are entirely right about Hamas.</p>
              <p>Middle East observers wonder
                  whether Israel’s assault on Hamas will succeed in destroying the
                  organisation or expelling it from Gaza. This is an irrelevant question.
                  If Israel plans to keep control over any future Palestinian entity, it
                  will never find a Palestinian partner, and even if it succeeds in
                  dismantling Hamas, the movement will in time be replaced by a far more
                  radical Palestinian opposition.</p>
              <p>If Barack Obama picks a seasoned
                  Middle East envoy who clings to the idea that outsiders should not
                  present their own proposals for a just and sustainable peace agreement,
                  much less press the parties to accept it, but instead leave them to
                  work out their differences, he will assure a future Palestinian
                  resistance far more extreme than Hamas – one likely to be allied with
                  al-Qaida. For the US, Europe and most of the rest of the world, this
                  would be the worst possible outcome. Perhaps some Israelis, including
                  the settler leadership, believe it would serve their purposes, since it
                  would provide the government with a compelling pretext to hold on to
                  all of Palestine. But this is a delusion that would bring about the end
                  of Israel as a Jewish and democratic state.</p>
              <p>Anthony Cordesman,
                  one of the most reliable military analysts of the Middle East, and a
                  friend of Israel, argued in a 9 January report for the Center for
                  Strategic and International Studies that the tactical advantages of
                  continuing the operation in Gaza were outweighed by the strategic cost
                  – and were probably no greater than any gains Israel may have made
                  early in the war in selective strikes on key Hamas facilities. ‘Has
                  Israel somehow blundered into a steadily escalating war without a clear
                  strategic goal, or at least one it can credibly achieve?’ he asks.
                  ‘Will Israel end in empowering an enemy in political terms that it
                  defeated in tactical terms? Will Israel’s actions seriously damage the
                  US position in the region, any hope of peace, as well as moderate Arab
                  regimes and voices in the process? To be blunt, the answer so far seems
                  to be yes.’ Cordesman concludes that ‘any leader can take a tough stand
                  and claim that tactical gains are a meaningful victory. If this is all
                  that Olmert, Livni and Barak have for an answer, then they have
                  disgraced themselves and damaged their country and their friends.’</p>

              <p>It was not even meant to be constructive but a statement on the facts. While I will not bother to deny that there's bad faith on Israel's side, the same can be said of the Hezbollah, Hamas and everyone around them.</p>
              <p>The fact remains is that extremist elements on both sides of the equation have no interest in peace, and in peace there is defeat. While that mentality exists and exists in the higher echelons of both sides, all this talk of peace is an ideal that will never happen. Better to nuke the area and kill everyone really.</p>
              <p>One more tip: Egypt was offered Gaza as part of the peace deal decades ago. They didn't want it.</p>

              </span></p><p> </p>
              <p class="body"><span class="body"><span class="body">Israelis
                  and their American supporters claim that Israel learned its lessons
                  well from the disastrous 2006 Lebanon war and has devised a winning
                  strategy for the present war against Hamas. Of course, when a ceasefire
                  comes, Israel will declare victory. Don’t believe it. Israel has
                  foolishly started another war it cannot win.</span></span></p>
              <p class="body"><span class="body">The campaign in Gaza is said to have two objectives: 1) to put an end
                  to the rockets and mortars that Palestinians have been firing into
                  southern Israel since it withdrew from Gaza in August 2005; 2) to
                  restore Israel’s deterrent, which was said to be diminished by the
                  Lebanon fiasco, by Israel’s withdrawal from Gaza, and by its inability
                  to halt Iran’s nuclear program.</span></p>
              <p class="body"><span class="body">
              </span></p><p class="body"><span class="body"> But these are not the real goals of Operation Cast Lead. The actual
                  purpose is connected to Israel’s long-term vision of how it intends to
                  live with millions of Palestinians in its midst. It is part of a
                  broader strategic goal: the creation of a “Greater Israel.”
                  Specifically, Israel’s leaders remain determined to control all of what
                  used to be known as Mandate Palestine, which includes Gaza and the West
                  Bank. The Palestinians would have limited autonomy in a handful of
                  disconnected and economically crippled enclaves, one of which is Gaza.
                  Israel would control the borders around them, movement between them,
                  the air above and the water below them. </span></p>
              <p class="body"><span class="body"> The key to achieving this is to inflict massive pain on the
                  Palestinians so that they come to accept the fact that they are a
                  defeated people and that Israel will be largely responsible for
                  controlling their future. This strategy, which was first articulated by
                  Ze’ev Jabotinsky in the 1920s and has heavily influenced Israeli policy
                  since 1948, is commonly referred to as the “Iron Wall.”</span></p>
              <p class="body"><span class="body"> What has been happening in Gaza is fully consistent with this strategy. </span></p>
              <p class="body"><span class="body">Let’s
                  begin with Israel’s decision to withdraw from Gaza in 2005. The
                  conventional wisdom is that Israel was serious about making peace with
                  the Palestinians and that its leaders hoped the exit from Gaza would be
                  a major step toward creating a viable Palestinian state. According to
                  the <em>New York Times’</em> Thomas L. Friedman, Israel was giving the
                  Palestinians an opportunity to “build a decent mini-state there—a Dubai
                  on the Mediterranean,” and if they did so, it would “fundamentally
                  reshape the Israeli debate about whether the Palestinians can be handed
                  most of the West Bank.”</span></p>
              <p class="body"><span class="body"> This is pure fiction. Even before Hamas came to power, the Israelis
                  intended to create an open-air prison for the Palestinians in Gaza and
                  inflict great pain on them until they complied with Israel’s wishes.
                  Dov Weisglass, Ariel Sharon’s closest adviser at the time, candidly
                  stated that the disengagement from Gaza was aimed at halting the peace
                  process, not encouraging it. He described the disengagement as
                  “formaldehyde that’s necessary so that there will not be a political
                  process with the Palestinians.” Moreover, he emphasized that the
                  withdrawal “places the Palestinians under tremendous pressure. It
                  forces them into a corner where they hate to be.”</span></p>
              <p class="body"><span class="body"> Arnon Soffer, a prominent Israeli demographer who also advised Sharon,
                  elaborated on what that pressure would look like. “When 2.5 million
                  people live in a closed-off Gaza, it’s going to be a human catastrophe.
                  Those people will become even bigger animals than they are today, with
                  the aid of an insane fundamentalist Islam. The pressure at the border
                  will be awful. It’s going to be a terrible war. So, if we want to
                  remain alive, we will have to kill and kill and kill. All day, every
                  day.”</span></p>
              <p class="body"><span class="body"> In January 2006, five months after the Israelis pulled their settlers
                  out of Gaza, Hamas won a decisive victory over Fatah in the Palestinian
                  legislative elections. This meant trouble for Israel’s strategy because
                  Hamas was democratically elected, well organized, not corrupt like
                  Fatah, and unwilling to accept Israel’s existence. Israel responded by
                  ratcheting up economic pressure on the Palestinians, but it did not
                  work. In fact, the situation took another turn for the worse in March
                  2007, when Fatah and Hamas came together to form a national unity
                  government. Hamas’s stature and political power were growing, and
                  Israel’s divide-and-conquer strategy was unraveling. </span></p>
              <p class="body"><span class="body"> To make matters worse, the national unity government began pushing for
                  a long-term ceasefire. The Palestinians would end all missile attacks
                  on Israel if the Israelis would stop arresting and assassinating
                  Palestinians and end their economic stranglehold, opening the border
                  crossings into Gaza.</span></p>
              <p class="body"><span class="body"> Israel rejected that offer and with American backing set out to foment
                  a civil war between Fatah and Hamas that would wreck the national unity
                  government and put Fatah in charge. The plan backfired when Hamas drove
                  Fatah out of Gaza, leaving Hamas in charge there and the more pliant
                  Fatah in control of the West Bank. Israel then tightened the screws on
                  the blockade around Gaza, causing even greater hardship and suffering
                  among the Palestinians living there.</span></p>
              <p class="body"><span class="body"> Hamas responded by continuing to fire rockets and mortars into Israel,
                  while emphasizing that they still sought a long-term ceasefire, perhaps
                  lasting ten years or more. This was not a noble gesture on Hamas’s
                  part: they sought a ceasefire because the balance of power heavily
                  favored Israel. The Israelis had no interest in a ceasefire and merely
                  intensified the economic pressure on Gaza. But in the late spring of
                  2008, pressure from Israelis living under the rocket attacks led the
                  government to agree to a six-month ceasefire starting on June 19. That
                  agreement, which formally ended on Dec. 19, immediately preceded the
                  present war, which began on Dec. 27.</span></p>
              <p class="body"><span class="body"> The official Israeli position blames Hamas for undermining the
                  ceasefire. This view is widely accepted in the United States, but it is
                  not true. Israeli leaders disliked the ceasefire from the start, and
                  Defense Minister Ehud Barak instructed the IDF to begin preparing for
                  the present war while the ceasefire was being negotiated in June 2008.
                  Furthermore, Dan Gillerman, Israel’s former ambassador to the UN,
                  reports that Jerusalem began to prepare the propaganda campaign to sell
                  the present war months before the conflict began. For its part, Hamas
                  drastically reduced the number of missile attacks during the first five
                  months of the ceasefire. A total of two rockets were fired into Israel
                  during September and October, none by Hamas. </span></p>
              <p class="body"><span class="body"> How did Israel behave during this same period? It continued arresting
                  and assassinating Palestinians on the West Bank, and it continued the
                  deadly blockade that was slowly strangling Gaza. Then on Nov. 4, as
                  Americans voted for a new president, Israel attacked a tunnel inside
                  Gaza and killed six Palestinians. It was the first major violation of
                  the ceasefire, and the Palestinians—who had been “careful to maintain
                  the ceasefire,” according to Israel’s Intelligence and Terrorism
                  Information Center—responded by resuming rocket attacks. The calm that
                  had prevailed since June vanished as Israel ratcheted up the blockade
                  and its attacks into Gaza and the Palestinians hurled more rockets at
                  Israel. It is worth noting that not a single Israeli was killed by
                  Palestinian missiles between Nov. 4 and the launching of the war on
                  Dec. 27. </span></p>
              <p class="body"><span class="body"> As the violence increased, Hamas made clear that it had no interest in
                  extending the ceasefire beyond Dec. 19, which is hardly surprising,
                  since it had not worked as intended. In mid-December, however, Hamas
                  informed Israel that it was still willing to negotiate a long-term
                  ceasefire if it included an end to the arrests and assassinations as
                  well as the lifting of the blockade. But the Israelis, having used the
                  ceasefire to prepare for war against Hamas, rejected this overture. The
                  bombing of Gaza commenced eight days after the failed ceasefire
                  formally ended. </span></p>
              <p class="body"><span class="body"> If Israel wanted to stop missile attacks from Gaza, it could have done
                  so by arranging a long-term ceasefire with Hamas. And if Israel were
                  genuinely interested in creating a viable Palestinian state, it could
                  have worked with the national unity government to implement a
                  meaningful ceasefire and change Hamas’s thinking about a two-state
                  solution. But Israel has a different agenda: it is determined to employ
                  the Iron Wall strategy to get the Palestinians in Gaza to accept their
                  fate as hapless subjects of a Greater Israel.</span></p>
              <p class="body"><span class="body"> This brutal policy is clearly reflected in Israel’s conduct of the Gaza
                  War. Israel and its supporters claim that the IDF is going to great
                  lengths to avoid civilian casualties, in some cases taking risks that
                  put Israeli soldiers in jeopardy. Hardly. One reason to doubt these
                  claims is that Israel refuses to allow reporters into the war zone: it
                  does not want the world to see what its soldiers and bombs are doing
                  inside Gaza. At the same time, Israel has launched a massive propaganda
                  campaign to put a positive spin on the horror stories that do emerge.</span></p>
              <p class="body"><span class="body"> The best evidence, however, that Israel is deliberately seeking to
                  punish the broader population in Gaza is the death and destruction the
                  IDF has wrought on that small piece of real estate. Israel has killed
                  over 1,000 Palestinians and wounded more than 4,000. Over half of the
                  casualties are civilians, and many are children. The IDF’s opening
                  salvo on Dec. 27 took place as children were leaving school, and one of
                  its primary targets that day was a large group of graduating police
                  cadets, who hardly qualified as terrorists. In what Ehud Barak called
                  “an all-out war against Hamas,” Israel has targeted a university,
                  schools, mosques, homes, apartment buildings, government offices, and
                  even ambulances. A senior Israeli military official, speaking on the
                  condition of anonymity, explained the logic behind Israel’s expansive
                  target set: “There are many aspects of Hamas, and we are trying to hit
                  the whole spectrum, because everything is connected and everything
                  supports terrorism against Israel.” In other words, everyone is a
                  terrorist and everything is a legitimate target.</span></p>
              <p class="body"><span class="body">Israelis
                  tend to be blunt, and they occasionally say what they are really doing.
                  After the IDF killed 40 Palestinian civilians in a UN school on Jan. 6,
                  <em>Ha’aretz</em> reported that “senior officers admit that the IDF has
                  been using enormous firepower.” One officer explained, “For us, being
                  cautious means being aggressive. From the minute we entered, we’ve
                  acted like we’re at war. That creates enormous damage on the ground … I
                  just hope those who have fled the area of Gaza City in which we are
                  operating will describe the shock.” </span></p>
              <p class="body"><span class="body">One might accept that Israel is waging “a cruel, all-out war against 1.5 million Palestinian civilians,” as <em>Ha’aretz</em> put it in an editorial, but argue that it will eventually achieve its
                  war aims and the rest of the world will quickly forget the horrors
                  inflicted on the people of Gaza.</span></p>
              <p class="body"><span class="body"> This is wishful thinking. For starters, Israel is unlikely to stop the
                  rocket fire for any appreciable period of time unless it agrees to open
                  Gaza’s borders and stop arresting and killing Palestinians. Israelis
                  talk about cutting off the supply of rockets and mortars into Gaza, but
                  weapons will continue to come in via secret tunnels and ships that
                  sneak through Israel’s naval blockade. It will also be impossible to
                  police all of the goods sent into Gaza through legitimate channels. </span></p>
              <p class="body"><span class="body"> Israel could try to conquer all of Gaza and lock the place down. That
                  would probably stop the rocket attacks if Israel deployed a large
                  enough force. But then the IDF would be bogged down in a costly
                  occupation against a deeply hostile population. They would eventually
                  have to leave, and the rocket fire would resume. And if Israel fails to
                  stop the rocket fire and keep it stopped, as seems likely, its
                  deterrent will be diminished, not strengthened.</span></p>
              <p class="body"><span class="body"> More importantly, there is little reason to think that the Israelis can
                  beat Hamas into submission and get the Palestinians to live quietly in
                  a handful of Bantustans inside Greater Israel. Israel has been
                  humiliating, torturing, and killing Palestinians in the Occupied
                  Territories since 1967 and has not come close to cowing them. Indeed,
                  Hamas’s reaction to Israel’s brutality seems to lend credence to
                  Nietzsche’s remark that what does not kill you makes you stronger. </span></p>
              <p class="body"><span class="body"> But even if the unexpected happens and the Palestinians cave, Israel
                  would still lose because it will become an apartheid state. As Prime
                  Minister Ehud Olmert recently said, Israel will “face a South
                  African-style struggle” if the Palestinians do not get a viable state
                  of their own. “As soon as that happens,” he argued, “the state of
                  Israel is finished.” Yet Olmert has done nothing to stop settlement
                  expansion and create a viable Palestinian state, relying instead on the
                  Iron Wall strategy to deal with the Palestinians.</span></p>
              <p class="body"><span class="body"> There is also little chance that people around the world who follow the
                  Israeli-Palestinian conflict will soon forget the appalling punishment
                  that Israel is meting out in Gaza. The destruction is just too obvious
                  to miss, and too many people—especially in the Arab and Islamic
                  world—care about the Palestinians’ fate. Moreover, discourse about this
                  longstanding conflict has undergone a sea change in the West in recent
                  years, and many of us who were once wholly sympathetic to Israel now
                  see that the Israelis are the victimizers and the Palestinians are the
                  victims. What is happening in Gaza will accelerate that changing
                  picture of the conflict and long be seen as a dark stain on Israel’s
                  reputation.</span></p>
              <p class="body"><span class="body"> The bottom line is that no matter what happens on the battlefield,
                  Israel cannot win its war in Gaza. In fact, it is pursuing a
                  strategy—with lots of help from its so-called friends in the
                  Diaspora—that is placing its long-term future at risk. </span><span class="body"><span style="color: black;"><img src="http://www.amconmag.com/article/2009/jan/images/dingbat.gif" alt="" width="10" height="10" align="bottom"></span></span><span class="body"> <span style="color: black;"> __________________________________________

              <p><strong>'US and Iran Share an Equal Monopoly on Violence'</strong></p>
              <p>by Omid Memarian</p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-size: xx-large;">"O</span></strong>bama
                      is going to have continuous pressure from Israel to attack Iran and, in
                      some way, their nuclear facilities, and this is going to be tied up
                      with Gaza and Lebanon," according to Robert Baer, a former top Central
                      Intelligence Agency operative and the author of <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Devil-We-Know-Dealing-Superpower/dp/0307408647/antiwarbookstore">The Devil We Know: Dealing with the New  Iranian Superpower</a></em>.</p>
              <p>In an interview with IPS, Baer discussed the regional implications
                      of the Gaza conflict and his take on Iran's Revolutionary Guard, Hamas,
                      and Hezbollah, three major groups in the Middle East which have been
                      called terrorist organizations.</p>
              <p>Excerpts from the interview follow.</p>
              <p><strong>IPS:</strong> Some analysts believe that attacking Hamas in Gaza,
                      two years after the 34-day war between Israel and Hezbollah, is a part
                      of a bigger plan which will end with attacking Iran's nuclear
                      facilities. Is Israel walking this path?</p>
              <p><strong>Robert Baer:</strong> No. I think that there is a military veto in attacking Iran. It's just not possible.</p>
              <p><strong>IPS:</strong> Why is that impossible?</p>
              <p><strong>RB:</strong> Well, for one thing, we know there will be an Iranian
                      reaction in the Gulf. Iran will not be attacked like Hamas and just
                      respond locally. It will respond internationally. It has no choice.
                      This is their deterrence power. In Iran, it is very important to
                      understand a lot of lessons.</p>
              <p>If you look on the IRGC [Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps]
                      website, you see the lessons they learned from the Iran-Iraq War. These
                      wars are wars of attrition; they go on forever. You just can't win
                      them, especially against the United States. So they have developed
                      secondary asymmetrical warfare ability, guerrilla warfare, which is
                      very effective.</p>
              <p>You know some of the best minds in Iran went into the Pasdaran
                      [Revolutionary Guards], and they weren't necessarily fanatics. In a
                      sense, they were much more nationalists. And in my experience, these
                      people in the Pasdaran, in the operational level, are probably the most
                      capable, intelligent/guerrilla force/political thinkers in the Middle
                      East, including Israel and Jordan. And they knew exactly what they were
                      doing. And they do not clearly fit in to any political definitions in
                      Iran.</p>
              <p><strong>IPS:</strong> Is the possibility of a limited attack on Iran's
                      nuclear facilities by Israel also out of question? Especially given
                      what we learned in a recent <em>New York Times</em> article that last
                      year, Israeli leaders asked President Bush to carry out such an attack,
                      though the president did not accept.</p>
              <p><strong>RB:</strong> Totally out of the question. Even Bush understood  this. The <em>New York Times</em> is right when it says that Bush vetoed an Israeli attack, simply
                      because there is a balance of power in the Middle East between the U.S.
                      and Iran, and it's a fairly even balance of power. I mean not in terms
                      of aircraft tanks or submarines, but in a monopoly of violence, there
                      is equality.</p>
              <p>There is no question there is equality. We could bomb Tehran, but
                      what does that get you? Nothing. It's sort of like bombing the U.N.
                      compound in Gaza by Israel. What does that give the Israelis? Nothing.
                      Yeah they could destroy it, but what does that give them? Hamas still
                      is going to exist.</p>
              <p>You can bomb all military bases in Iran over a period of two weeks,
                      but Iran is still there – it still has the ability to project power,
                      project its will and maybe even come out of that type of conflict even
                      stronger. And Iran's power is so economical, the price of oil is not
                      going to make any difference, simply because the idea of arming
                      Hezbollah or supporting Hamas in Damascus is nothing in terms of money.
                      I mean the price of oil could go down to 10 dollars, and it's still an
                      affordable defense for Iran.</p>
              <p><strong>IPS:</strong> Obama has repeatedly mentioned talking to Iranian
                      leaders and bringing change to U.S. foreign policy. How could the
                      designation of Dennis Ross as a key advisor on Iran policy contribute
                      to his promises?</p>
              <p><strong>RB:</strong> Dennis Ross – the important thing is the Israelis are
                      comfortable with him. If a dialogue with Iran occurs, they know he
                      won't betray them. I mean they have had years and years of testing this
                      guy. He's Jewish, he's been honest with the Israelis; he's gone along
                      with their projects, even the crazy ones. If a dialogue is open, the
                      Israelis know they won't be surprised. If Obama had brought someone new
                      in, some professor from Harvard that the Israelis didn't know, they
                      would immediately freeze him out and there would be huge political
                      blowbacks.</p>
              <p><strong>IPS:</strong> Regarding Ross's positions on certain issues in the
                      Middle East and particularly Iran over the past decade, how will Obama
                      be able to adopt a new foreign policy path in the region?</p>
              <p><strong>RB:</strong> Well, he [Obama] needs the backing of the Democratic
                      Party to get these things through politically, and that's why he has
                      brought in people like Dennis Ross and Denny Blair, the Director of
                      National Intelligence, simply because he needs that political backing.
                      He cannot bring in untried people and run them against the Democratic
                      Party, because if there is an opening with Iran, there will be a
                      connivance of Israel, maybe a silent one, simply because the Israelis
                      have to go along.</p>
              <p>In American politics, you can't do anything in the Middle East
                      without the approval of Tel Aviv, at least on some level. It's
                      impossible. I mean, I cannot think of a country that is so beholden to
                      a small country like this, even a superpower, in all of history. I
                      can't even think of it.</p>
              <p><strong>IPS:</strong> And why is that?</p>
              <p><strong>RB:</strong> Look at New York City. Look at the major newspapers.
                      They have a Zionist agenda. They do. I'm not Jewish. I'm not anything.
                      I don't care about the Israelis. And I'm not anti-Semitic. It's just a
                      fact. I suggested to my publisher writing a book on Israel, and he said
                      forget it. You can't talk about the reality of Israel. The only place
                      you can talk about the reality of Israel is in Israel. They tell you
                      things you will never hear in the United States.</p>
              <p><strong>IPS:</strong> Like what?</p>
              <p><strong>RB:</strong> For instance, why are people in Gaza so unhappy?
                      Well, if you had to live in a prison, wouldn't you be unhappy? You
                      would never get that in the <em>New York Times</em>. Look at the <em>New York Times</em>; it's almost an  extension of Israel.</p>
              <p><strong>IPS:</strong> What is the impact of the Gaza conflict on the
                      future of Iran-Israel and United States relations? Have the recent
                      attacks destroyed Hamas entirely?</p>
              <p><strong>RB:</strong> No, it's impossible. Hamas is an idea. Hamas is not
                      an organization. Hamas is an idea, and unless the Israelis go in and
                      force 1.5 million people into Egypt, they will never subdue Gaza. They
                      can go in and they can slaughter the leadership and put 10,000 people
                      in jail, and Hamas will come out stronger. The losers in this will be
                      Fatah.</p>
              <p><strong>IPS:</strong> What are the main characteristics of Hamas and Hezbollah's military and political behavior?</p>
              <p><strong>RB:</strong> They redefined the idea of warfare in geography. The
                      fact that Hezbollah dug into caves or the fact that they use fiber
                      optics to communicate shows enormous sophistication and primitive
                      warfare in combination. I mean, what army in the world uses fiber
                      optics except Hezbollah? You can't intercept fiber optics. There is
                      nothing you can do.</p>
              <p>You look at [Hezbollah leader Hassan] Nasrallah, and he has
                      redefined Islamic politics because he's gone into an alliance with
                      Christians. Bin Laden wants to kill Christians; I'm going to reduce it
                      to that. Nasrallah is looking at them as allies.</p>
