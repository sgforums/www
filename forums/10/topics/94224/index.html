            <div class='col-md body'>Years back some smart one has suggested that Singapore should have more than one TV station to compete and so that viewers have more choice and thereby produced efficiency and cut cost. SPH just jumped into the bandwagon and started mediaWork and has 2 Channels, chen.  I&amp;U without even conducting a survey to check the viability of such venture, it bleeds profusely year after year because of the tiny market Singapore provides!Similarly Media Corp ventures into the newprint arena by starting Today newspaper and its earning nosedived.Now they merged after seeing stars for so many years!<br><br>In Singapore those in power uttered anything as they like and the masses just followed without doing their homeworks and took their own stands. The same incident happened in the transport sector where someone has retorted that Singapore should have more bus and Taxi providers so that they could compete and bring down prices and enhanced efficiency,but before you see any result Comfort merged with Delgro to go back to square one, and lately due to economic downturn, more taxi companies are flooding the road with more taxis driven by some highly over qualified jobless retrenched workers, zooming in and out of all the lanes driving as if the roads belong to them!<br><br>Many new car parallel importers are in the same straits and only a few are still kicking!Will this happen to the telecommunication sector and many other sectors in Singapore?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Taken from <a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/107277/1/.html" rel="nofollow"> CNA </a>.<br><br>SINGAPORE: Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong says the Government's policy on keeping the Singapore media industry open remains unchanged, despite the largest shake-up in the sector since competition was introduced in 2000.<br><br>PM Lee also said the decision by MediaCorp and the Singapore Press Holdings to merge some of their operations was one of commercial viability and taken entirely by the two media giants themselves.<br><br>He was responding to questions on the MediaCorp-SPH deal to merge their mass market television and free newspaper businesses.<br><br>PM Lee feels that the Government was right to open up the media industry, adding that if a new player comes in and wants to start a newspaper or a new TV channel, the proposal will be examined.<br><br>He said: "It's not possible to say that you are not allowed to compete. It's like low-cost carriers. There are many players now.....one says $1 air ticket, another 49 cents and now it is 29 cents. Who are we to say $1 is alright and 29 cents is too cheap? We haven't made any U-turn, we've opened, the companies have tried, they haven't succeeded, so they are making an adjustment. It's not the status quo and it's not they are going back to where they were before."<br><br>PM Lee added: "It is not back to where we were before because you will still have TODAY newspaper with Streats in some form. You still have Channel U, they've said they are going to keep it. Channel i, I'm not sure."<br><br>The media industry was liberalised in 2000 when conditions were quite different from now and the expectations of both MediaCorp and SPH were that they would be able to grow the business.<br><br>But it proved too costly for the two companies and they have been 'bleeding'.<br><br>So, MediaCorp and SPH decided to merge their bleeding businesses to stem losses and improve shareholder value.<br><br>PM Lee said: "It's a recognitition of the market test, this is the outcome. You can't keep on bleeding. After 4 to 5 years, you have to make a hard-headed commercial assessment. So, the companies have decided, the Government did not interfere. We have to approve it and in principle we have agreed to it." - CNA</div>

There may be errors of judgment but acceptance of fallibility is important part of governance - accountability and transparency. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

Policy wise, if it had brought down birth rate, that policy might be successful in itself but can it claim success in the context of the national longer term interest?<br><br>Obviously our acclaimed insightful and foresightful leaders did not foresee a different world ahead - ageing populations and corresponding drop of economic competitiveness - and had to reverse its earlier 2-child policy. Can we say that such governance is one of foresight or insight as claimed if the leaders could not foresee future problems of such critical importance.<br><br>I attended a seminar by Spring once and asked whether after 20-30 years of workers' training programs, has Singapore become more competitive or productive. The answer given by Spring was : no.<br><br>If Town Council and HDB today after incurring two to three times its former pre-town council running cost cannot make the estates cleaner, can we say that the clean campaign  is successful not to mentioned the loss of competitiveness in running of estates. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"></div>
