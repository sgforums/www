            <div class='col-md body'>Looks like F-16, twin-tails?<br><br>Might be Hornets, they look slim enough... Tomcats are too broad-shouldered to look like Fighting Falcons, and I can't think of any reason why other non-carrier US fighter planes would be hanging around our region.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think they were F-15s, because now that I think about it, the fins were vertical and not diagonal as in the case of the Hornet. Also, they looked quite angular and beefier than the F-18. The USAF does have a few detachments at our airbases and the planes that I saw were in the process of landing or taking off, thus indicating that they were land based aircraft. I didn't see them too clearly. The Merdeka bridge was in the way. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>My first thought was that they were MiG-29s and we were being invaded, heh heh.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This is very common. I have seen F/A-18s, F-15s and C17s on numerous occasions, especially during exercises and when US aircraft carriers are in the region. PLAB is used as a "detachment base" for US aircraft stopping over.</div>

The guys at the Dutch aviation society Scramble seem to have no problem doing this at any airport in Singapore...and with a 300mm lens...problem solved</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>actually the area 4000ft above sembawang airbase is open for flying training to rsaf and local flying clubs and college. although its restricted to take photos, its so easy for any pilot to fly over sembawang and take photos of it. you could see the chinook hangar and the new fighter runway, in fact any aircraft departing seletar airport can get a good view of sembawang air base. the only airbase thats difficult to photo is tengah.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Lets not discuss about photographing RSAF bases anymore ok... I won't like the idea of some pepping-toms or less than friendly characters photographing Singapore air force bases to be sent to some foreign ministry/department of defence or some terror cell groups who think they can hire private planes and crash into RSAF bases because there are US AF jets there. I would hate to see that our friendly discussion thread here are used as source of information other suss characters could use to damage Singapore.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yeah, i think so too. i never intended to dwell into photography issue. anyway back to commando sling, many years ago when commando sling just started. i was able to talk to an F-16A pilot on the exercise, he told me that they would win on dog fights but at medium range they were disadvantaged by lack of vbr missile. i heard him telling a F-5 pilot how a F-15 turn on burners and zoom to 40 thousand ft when he got behind it. a logistics officer ever told me that during such exercises, rsaf was trashed by usaf and they were learning lessons from them, that was 5,6 yrs ago. I dun know about the standard of rsaf against usaf nowadays.</div>
