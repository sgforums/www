Women will no longer be safe on the streets. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Anyway, is prostitution illegal in Singapore? I thought they are legal, that's why all 'legal' prostitutes have to be certified and made to undergo annual physical examination at Kelantan Road STD clinic.. only those illegals are arrested.<br><br>But loansharks are a different matter altogether. Previously they were treated only as illegal moneylenders or at most, vandals.. but now the govt is going to take a very serious view of them as i've mentioned in my earlier reply, to deter potential Ah Longs from jumping in and profiteering from those who are going to borrow money to gamble at the casinos.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>VIEWS ON CASINO DEBATES:<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>The figure 35,000 jobs predicted to be created by casino is doubtful. Read the reasons given below:-<br><br>The debate has not been presented objectively with proper evaluation of both pro- and anti- casino views. Before any studies have been made on potential job losses due to negative impacts and social problems, the government has invited casino operators to present their proposals and release the figure that 35,000 jobs will be created. Thus, the debates have missed something very critical. The debates were biased not objective or balanced.<br><br>The government should have presented the full survey results regions by regions of not just job creation but job losses due to negative impacts from casino. The social problem i.e. 2% supposed pathological gamblers given by the ministers appears under-stated.<br><br>Many existing casinos in UK were not doing well and have to be upgraded or regrouped to make them viable. Has the government considered this fact? It was revealed unwittingly by the ministers that the existing pathological gamblers were already 2 %. Once the casinos were set up, by proximity factor, surely the pathological gamblers will be higher or much higher than 2 % lah. Has the minister Dr. V considered told the complete fact?<br><br>The onus is on the government making the decision to build casino to prove its case to build casinos. The worse decision has been made with people being asked to try it out to see what happens. Such an attitude verges on downright irresponsible - 72,000 lives in danger of being destroyed !!!<br><br>We have not evaluated on potential job losses due to negative impacts of casinos and yet, we jump to the conclusion that casino will create 35,000 jobs. The negative impacts, include business bankruptcies etc due to addictions in gambling over say 5 years. For all anyone knows, casino may lose its attraction after a while as tourists decide that our casinos are stale not that attractive after all. There is also the question of how many jobs will go to the locals.<br><br>Many people have asked: is the government running out of ideas how to run the economy? Clearly, it desperately needs an economic master planner or plan to show how it will create a more competitive economy. Such a master plan can be used to show how casino coupled with our excellent location advantages (as compared with other casinos) to stimulate overall economic growth.<br><br>I cannot see integration to tourism in passing as an economic master plan at all. Without a total master plan to integrate casino to all major business sectors or show our economic direction or strategy, how can the MM claim in parliament : "without casino, our economy will be worse off"? Such utterances were obviously without basis.<br><br>A belief that a casino will benefit Singapore economy is only a belief. The government should substantiate the decision with facts from objective and balanced study not just beliefs or assumptions. Since it was not substantiated objectively, with proper facts, the casino decision will remain a poor decision - 35,000 jobs will be created without quantifying long-term potential job losses and social problems.<br></div>
