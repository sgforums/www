              <p><strong>Singapore's disgraceful judges.</strong></p>
              <p>Ladies and Gentlemen,<br><br>You have read the bad news. The Singapore
              legal profession is shrinking. Students are not choosing a career in
              law. And lawyers are leaving the profession.<br><br>One major reason for this is the unpleasantness in appearing in Lee's courts.<br><br>One
              cannot help but feel extremely uncomfortable the moment one walks into
              a Singapore court room. For one, the judge seems so unhappy, so angry
              or so stern, hard to say which; almost as if he is suffering from a
              severe bout of indigestion or because someone had just insulted his
              mother!<br><br>No smile on his face at all, does not even look at the
              lawyer or his client, going about his work with unnecessary solemnity
              and seriousness. No good mornings, no pleasantries; not even a passing
              smile. It is as if, the judge was not human at all; like as if he was
              some God, who finds it demeaning even to look you in the eye!<br><br>As
              if this arrogance due to fear or for whatever reason was not enough;
              you are required in addition; to further rub salt in your wounds; to
              address them "Lords" or "Your Honor", in the British courtroom lingo.<br><br>Every
              lawyer knows that these so called judges are not judges in the true
              sense of the word at all, but merely agents of Lee Kuan Yew, placed
              there to do his bidding. This makes addressing them with these terms of
              respect unbearable.<br><br>Their job routinely includes tailoring false
              charges and false judgments and awards to impoverish bankrupt and
              imprison Lee's political opponents shamelessly; in total disregard for
              the law which they are sworn to uphold. They do this for money and job
              security. There is a word for it and it is corruption.<br><br>With the
              Singapore judges and the courts, having lost all credibility and
              respect; any young man with any prospects in life and looking forward
              to a respectable career would stay a mile away from the Singapore legal
              profession. Thus the shrinking Singapore Bar.<br><br>For an example of
              the dirty work these judges routinely do, a good example is a recent
              case before Judge Belinda Ang. Not too long ago, Lee Kuan Yew, as it is
              his normal practice of using the law to silence his dissenters; sued
              Dr. Chee Soon Juan, Secretary General of the Singapore Democratic Party
              with his favorite cause of action, defamation of character; since Chee
              was beginning to be a threat and had to be silenced. So the order was
              promptly given out to this woman to punish Chee by finding him guilty
              and bankrupting him.<br><br>She did her dirty work with great
              efficiency. Without even getting off her chair in chambers and not even
              permitting Dr. Chee to say a word in his defense, with lightning speed
              of no more than 30 minutes or so, she not only delivered judgment of
              one half million dollars against him, but also took the opportunity of
              calling him names, thinking that this will please her master Lee even
              more!<br><br>I have heard many lawyers tell me during my time in
              Singapore that they never appear in Lee's courts preferring rather to
              do commercial paper. At the time, I did not understand why but I do
              now. They find it distasteful appearing in courts for which they have
              no respect at all!<br><br>Most Singapore judges are young and
              inexperienced in life, having been specially chosen for their
              obedience, submission and willingness to act dishonorably; not their
              independence, wisdom, maturity or experience.<br><br>It is quire
              different in California where I have been practicing for more than 11
              years, since leaving Singapore. Here it a joy to practice law.<br><br>For
              one thing, the judges here are judges in the real sense. They are not
              beholden to anyone but the law. Regardless of who you are, when
              stepping into any courtroom, you know you have an equal chance as your
              opponent in the matter. If justice is on your side, you will win.
              Unlike in Singapore where you win just because your name is Lee Kuan
              Yew. Here one respects the courts and their judges, unlike in Singapore
              where there is only derision, ridicule and contempt for the law and its
              judges, Belinda Ang being a prime example.<br><br>With a population of
              about 27 million, California has more than 200,000 lawyers and law
              continues to be a very popular career choice among the young, with ever
              increasing numbers wanting to pass the Bar Exams. In Singapore, with
              total population of about 4.5 million, it has only 3,400 lawyers, the
              same number as in 1997, 10 years ago! And what is worse this serious
              lawyer shortage in Singapore is worsening, with increasing numbers
              leaving the profession. This inability to attract the young to enter
              the law comes as no surprise; since the profession and its judges have
              lost all modicum of respect. It is seen as an instrument of tyranny and
              oppression; Lee's tool to silence and destroy political dissenters.<br><br>The
              Singapore legal system destroys the spirit of Singaporeans and instead
              of doing any good, it alienates and intimidates them into submission,
              instilling hate and defiance into them. Anyone who spends any time in a
              Singapore courtroom will see what I am talking about. Firstly, the
              judge treats the accused with total disrespect, not even looking at
              him, as if he was nothing more than dirt. The police show no respect
              whatsoever to the accused. If he pleads guilty, he is promptly
              handcuffed and sent off to prison without a word.<br><br>There are no
              words of advice from the judge. No words of encouragement. No kindness
              at all. No attempt to treat him as a fellow citizen, even a human
              being; no attempt is made at all to speak to him, to improve him; so he
              can be a better citizen than he now is.<br><br>California courtrooms
              are different. In California the defendant is treated at as a human
              being. Quite often the judge himself greets the defendant with the
              usual "Good Morning Mr. Smith". The defendant is seated next to his
              counsel. The lawyers say what they want. Then the judge speaks to the
              Defendant like a father who would speak to his son. He has advise for
              the man or woman who had gone astray. You see a genuine attempt by the
              judge to help the Defendant better his ways, with the hope that he will
              never see this defendant in court again. After the court session, you
              respect the judge for his sincerity and his wisdom and the Defendant
              himself begins to realize that committing crimes is not the best thing
              to be doing.<br><br>This is the good feeling that I have in courts in
              California USA everyday that I appear before these courts. I respect
              these judges because they are worthy of respect. They are real judges.
              They are honorable men of integrity. And the judges in their turn show
              me the courtesy that I deserve as an officer of the court, and
              especially as a human being.<br><br>At the end of the day, in
              California courts, you feel wanted. You feel respected. And you realize
              that we are all in it together and we improve and advance and become
              better citizens. This is something that Singapore judges are unable to
              understand, since after all, they are only interested in their work of
              pleasing their master Lee Kuan Yew and bending the law as and when
              called upon.<br><br>In these circumstances, should we be surprised why Singaporeans do not want to be lawyers!<br><br>Gopalan Nair</p>

              <p>It is possible that he goes for that.    A doctor did mention this is possible but is cruel.    To a dictator who is selfish, self serving tyrant cruelty is not in his dictionary.</p>

              <p>LKY had initially tied Singapore's Legal System to the British Legal System with the intention of maintaining a semblance of high judicial standards, and with the House of Lords forming the Privy Council to oversee such standards in the Singapore Legal System.</p>
              <p>LKY had even challenged J.B. Jeyaratnam that if J.B.J was successful in winning his appeal in the Privy Council, LKY will see that he get a J.B.J's get a similar clearance from the President of Singapore.</p>
              <p>Sadly, after the Privy Council ruled in J.B.J's favor - absolving him of any wrong doings, and even chastised the errorneous judgment made against him, LKY renegaded on his word - and moved the Singapore Parliament to sever the Privy Council as the final avenue of appeal in the Singapore Legal System.</p>
              <p>LKY gave the reason that as an independent and sovereign country, the Privy Council in UK do not share the same values as that practised in Singapore.</p>
              <p>With a single sweeping act, LKY had forgotten his stated intention of maintaining high judicial standards through an umbilical cord link with the Privy Council.</p>
