              <p><strong>Leong Sze Hian</strong> –</p>
              <p><em>After adjusting for historical inflation of about two per cent, 
              the annual real wage increase may only be about 0.6 per cent.<ins datetime="2010-07-17T12:20"></ins></em></p>
              <p><ins datetime="2010-07-17T12:20"> </ins></p>
              <p><a href="http://theonlinecitizen.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/stgrow320240.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-25263" title="stgrow320240" src="http://theonlinecitizen.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/stgrow320240.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="240"></a>I refer to the articles “Economy 
              set to grow 13% – 15%” and “100,000 foreign workers needed: PM” (ST, Jul
               15)On 15 July, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said,“If we don’t allow 
              the foreign workers in, you are going to have overheating (in the 
              economy)”.</p>
              <p>I am somewhat confused by this. Wouldn’t allowing such a large influx
               of cheap foreign labour contribute to overheating the economy even 
              more?</p>
              <p>With all the good news about a booming economy and job market, the 
              fact remains that for the last nine years, from 2001 to 2009, real wages
               increased by only 1.4 per cent per year.</p>
              <p>In a Straits Times report on the same day, NTUC Deputy 
              Secretary-General Halimah Yacob said “wage increases of between 3 and 4 
              per cent are being anticipated”. (“Higher growth but not higher wages 
              yet”, ST, Jul 15).   .</p>
              <p>With inflation running at a 14 month high now at 3.2 per cent in May,
               we could end up with a third consecutive year of decline in real wages,
               As I understand it, wages do not include the employer’s CPF 
              contribution. The employer’s CPF contribution rate was decreased from 16
               per cent to 13 per cent in October 2003, which was partially restored 
              to 14.5 per cent in July 2007.</p>
              <p>After factoring this in, does it mean that in effect, the increase in
               real wages may even be less than the 1.4 per cent per annum, from 2001 
              to 2009?</p>
              <p><img class="alignright" title="straits times" src="http://i140.photobucket.com/albums/r19/theonlinecitizen/Pictures%20Posted%20on%20TOC/Employment/stgrowB.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="187">According to the Ministry of Manpower’s
               Singapore Yearbook of Manpower Statistics 2010 – Active CPF Members By 
              Monthly Wage Level, there were, in 2009:</p>
              <p>-       65,141 people earnings less than $400</p>
              <p>-       146,080 earning less than $800</p>
              <p>-        74,568 less than $1,000</p>
              <p>-       128,611 less than $1,500.</p>
              <p>Taken together, this means that there were a total of 464,400 or 
              almost 30 per cent of all active CPF members, earning less than $1,500.</p>
              <p>As the data excludes self-employed persons and inactive CPF members 
              (those who did not have at least one employment CPF contribution paid 
              for him for the current or any of the preceding 3 months), if we include
               these excluded persons, how many in total earn less than $1,500 in 
              Singapore?</p>
              <p>One of the targets of the Economic Strategies Committee (ESC) is to 
              raise the wages of the average Singapore worker by one-third in the next
               decade, from a median wage of $2,400 today to about $3,100 in 10 years.</p>
              <p>The Finance Minister said that to achieve this, Singapore must have 
              workers with top quality skills and make the island one of the top 
              liveable cities in the world. He also said Singapore has never had it as
               good as now, and for the next five to ten years.</p>
              <p>Even if workers heed Mr Tharman’s call to “raise our game”, the 
              targeted reward of a median wage of $3,100 in 10 years time only works 
              out to an annual increase of 2.6 per cent.</p>
              <p>After adjusting for historical inflation of about two per cent, the 
              annual real wage increase may only be about 0.6 per cent.</p>
              <p>This is even lower than the 1.4 per cent per annum real wage increase
               from 2001 to 2009, according to the Ministry of Manpower’s Labour 
              Market Q1 2010 report.</p>
              <p>Speaking at the same dialogue session with the Finance Minister, the 
              Manpower Minister said “productivity is also a partnership. It’s not 
              just about a company making efforts, it also involves the workers, so 
              workers must take responsibility for their own skills upgrading”.</p>
              <p>I would like to suggest that the ESC sets it sight higher for wage 
              increase. Otherwise, why would workers want to upgrade their skills, be 
              more productive, aspire to higher standards, and make Singapore one of 
              the top liveable cities in the world, when the reward at the end of the 
              day, is just a 0.6 per cent increase in real wages?</p>
              <p>In light of the last two years of negative real wage growth and 
              current inflation running at a 14-month high of 3.2 per cent in May, 
              workers may direly need a moral boost in the form of higher expected 
              wage increases in the future.<br> ———–</p>

              <p>GDP is a economic term, from what i understand during my school days, 1% is quite equivalent to 1 billion in earning from export. By stating 15% would mean a 15 billions growth in singapore, and that divided by the citizens here will give you the per capital. So you got 4 millions, just calculate how much each will be earning at an average.</p>
              <p>It is an indicator of the economy condition and also a figure for the world to access us. The high GDP result in good public servants paid hike and good bonuses, so, ministers are going to get higher paid, it also represent that all Singaporeans are earning well, and therefore less perks will be given out, however, Gst rebate may increase.</p>
