              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">Not only that they are like businessmen but worse.  I see the PAP MP as heartless and cruel men and women.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">My family case is like this- </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">Couple of years ago, my HDB flat received the en-block notice. It so happen that my sister has her name as co-owner with my parent. Few weeks prior to the HDB notice, she got married. <span> </span>Her husband lives in a condominium, so automatically HDB treats my family as rich. <br><br>No new flat subsidy was granted to my family. This being the case, my family has to fork out more for the new flat than the rest of my neighbours’. <br><br>Both my parents are in their 80s, with my father coming to 90. My father has not been working since he retired at 58.<br><br>I went to HDB to appeal. A total waste of time. The people working in HDB are, what Robert called iron-rice bowl robots,- heartless and deaf. <span> </span>The officer told my family to sell my house on the open market and make a big bundle of profit.<span>  </span>Easy for him to say. <br><br>When I got an agent to market my flat, I can’t even get a single offer, even when I was willing to lower my price to HDB compensation’s. Why? Because, I not be getting the subsidy, the person who purchases from me will also not be getting a subsidy. In such case, who would buy from me on the open market? <span> </span>Especially, when there are flood of offers besides mine.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">I appeal to my MP. What he said really infuriated me. <span> </span>He called my case a green-eye syndrome. In other words, that my family is jealous of others getting subsidy and mine don’t. I pointed out to him my family poor income and my not working and aged parents. He shook my hands, patted me on my back and sent my off. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">The longer I live in this country, the more I feel that this country has no heart and soul. <span> <br><br>I forget to add this point. If I have sold my HDB flat on the open market, regardless whether I made profit, lost or even at HDB compensate rate, I would be treated as being 'consuming the subsidy of the new flat'.</span></span>  Regardless of whether we have or have not made a profit. <br><br>The funny thing is that HDB has all along made it very clear to my family that there would not be no subsidy granted to my family. So where this 'consuming the subsidy of the new flat'?<br><br>Everything don't make any sense to me at all. </p>

              Sad to hear your story.....There is a Western proverb saying:"Every man for himself".But this only apply in a critical situation.Does our PAP leaders live in a life-threatening situation?
                  
              I believe they live in their own fantasy world,drifting themselves further and further away from us and the reality.

              <p>I believe this to be true, since only in Singapore and only Singapore are ministers paid millions.</p>
              <p>PAP regime really needs to wake up from their dream world.</p>
