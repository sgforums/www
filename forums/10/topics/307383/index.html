              <p><span class="postbody">If we have the right leaders who know how to motivate people from the begainning we should have done better or much better than now.</span></p>
              <p>Just look at our own neighbourhood shops. How many of them are doing well?</p>
              <p><span class="postbody">Our leaders were not truly caring for the people. They were only concerned with their own limited and narrow self-serving glorifications and claims of success.</span></p>
              <p>If they have practised <span class="postbody">full-scale promotion or encouragements of practical talents in every field we could have upgraded our economy long ago. </span></p>

                                                      whole economy with increasing taxes and fees and withholding services

                                                      brands of products due to their business vibrancy through motivating its own talents we are only able to depend on some MNCs to produce
                                                      certain items which are easily overtaken by China and India due to
                                                      their cheaper labor costs.
                                                      <br> <br>Our whole economic performance today is very still shallow largely dependent on economic cycle play using share markets and property to give an superficial appearance of success due to international economic
                                                      recovery.
                                                      <br> <br>There is nothing original in our economic management like upgrading to a truly 
                                                      value-adding manufacturing or saleable products which we can claim as
                                                      our own.</span></p>

Instead we are losing our own practical talents to many other countries and now have to resort to importing many mundane foreigners here called foreign talents who are neither here nor there.</span></p>
              <p><span class="postbody">In another downturn these foreign companies and foreign talents will be deserting us once again as has happened too often in the past.<br></span></p>
              <p><span class="postbody">Singapore is not a successful economy. It is a make-belief economy which claims to be successful during economic upturn while most of the time it is in down turns while other economies are doing well.<br> <br>The most important question one always forget to ask is "could we
                                                      have done better if our economic management is not so shallow and
                                                      superficial" as has happened for years.
                                                      <br> <br>Will we have lost so many talents to other countries because of the
                                                      general negative impact caused by such wrong approaches in economic
                                                      management.
                                                      <br> <br>If only from the 1970s, we have a government which truly respected
                                                      its own talents and not have treated them so badly with heavy direct
                                                      and indirect taxes and back charging for all kinds of basic services in
                                                      the name to avoid welfare which actually is a clever excuse to make more and more monies with profiteering schemes of all kinds, we would have reached a higher
                                                      standard of living for ordinary citizens by now.<br> <br>By increasing costs of living with over-paying the entire
                                                      government from ministers down to the civil servants while withholding
                                                      services and hoarding taxes as government's surpluses our government is actually running
                                                      down the whole economy which will easily fumble again and again in any
                                                      downturn.
                                                      <br> <br>I disagree that that we are having a first-world economy which our
                                                      MM Lee wants the citizens to believe. It is part of his
                                                      self-glorification and nothing more. He should have done better from 1970s by changing his many policy errors if he wants to be respected as a truly great leader</span></p>

              <p>Dear Robert,</p>
              <p>I sympathize with your feelings. I keep certain things in mind when I look at these things.</p>
              <p>Firstly, running a government and a country isn't easy. I'd assume that most times we'd try to look for other models and policies to follow rather then shape our own because we may not have sufficient confidence and expertise to shape our own.</p>
              <p>We're also constrained by having to choose policies from other countries that may be fundamentally different from our own and such policies may not have their intended effect or have unplanned effects. Some would include the unexpected social impacts of economic policies.</p>
              <p>You brought up many good examples of policies that can be improved. Do you have suggestions for policies to address these issues?</p>

              <p>"Hello...since when all civil servants are over paid.....your statement is pretty sweeping here...</p>
              <p><br>Back up with proof ..."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I would say that iron rice bowl or bill collector jobs have been over-glamorised in our civil service with every new recruits without proven track records of the elite groups enjoying super-speed promotions and regarded as CEOs comparable to Sim Wang Hoo who are only bureaucrat people who pass law and put up controls of all sorts to levy funds and use public monies to provide expenditures like happening in any clubs or management corporations.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Such iron rice bowl people have been wrongly treated as talents with ability to restructure our economy to world class standards or solve our many problems.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The fact is have they all these years done so and have they even been talented enough to lower citizens' burdens in paying everything from A to Z created by all the profiteering schemes to suck monies from them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So under such conditions, the $400K - $600K salaries paid to top civil servants and $80K-$150K paid to middle executives like senior teachers or senior assistants in schools are therefor grossly overpaid.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Furthermore many civil servants are nowadays having lesser job scopes and responsibilities as compared with before with many traditional duties being taken off them due to more laws being passed to protect their own enclave.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Our Policemen nowadays do not have such major responsibilities like apprehending certain crimes happening with private estates because they  have passed such duties to private security agencies or the management corporation.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Even in immigration offences or assaults the police men would come and take down particulars and would normally tell victims to be his own policemen and investigate the wrongs and file their own private summons on the excuse that these are not seizable offences.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If they say we need to restructure the economy to value-adding and technology or knowledge driven model, have they actually done that?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>With only excuses they keep postponing solutions to problems.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>marketing or inventions or innovations to be worth millions.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Propagandas and self-glorifications through the controlled media have resulted in many of us believing our leaders and top civil servants are that talented.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>They cannot even solve certain urgent problems faced by people which lower-paid outsource private companies have been solving.</p>

Look at america and tat is a better example than singapore. Similarly, I can also say u r completely useless. If u r better, than u will become bill gates and set up a good product tat can sell overseas and make billions for our economy. Then u can also conclude singaporean r lousy. Because if they r good, they will become damn rich, set up many companies with international brand, replace LKY long time ago with a better leader and singapore become the paradise of the world</p>
              <p>U know just go behind, comment the others r lousy, then finding a better example to back up your argument is totally lame. U just have the benefit of hindsight and comment how others had failed, when during tat time nobody know wat is going to happen in future. U r living now. Tell me wat policies should we implement NOW not wat should we implement in the past. If I got the benefit of hindsight, I win 4D every week.</p>

              <p>With a rigid education system, propaganda media and regimental lifestyle and regime supporting FTs, combined with a hostile political environment, all creativity, innovation spirit and business acumen has been killed off.</p>

              <p>the way i see things,</p>
              <p>although I must say sg is super bombastic,</p>
              <p>i cannot in anyway not consider migrating as an alternative to retirement. This means, its more likely I will not migrate but it will always be a backup plan waiting to be used because there is stil l substantial chance I will have to.</p>

              I believe if time can turn back,those ppl who voted LKY n his party PAP will vote other politicians and parties instead.
              
              Reason?They now know that LKY is not such a good leader after all.They now know that LKY can screw up so many things when he gets old and his "Never-retired attitude" bring disaster to this nation.Just like Mao Ze Tong did to Communist China in the past.
