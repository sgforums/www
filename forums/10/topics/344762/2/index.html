              <p>It is with sadness that i have to admit Hamas 'won'. Not for myself, but for the palestinian people.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Once the Israelis leave, the terrorist ideological propaganda begins. Twisting, spinning and pushing blame starts. Indoctrination of 'death to infidels' proceeds further.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Terrorist Hamas would be played up as the heroes, many of these same ones who had caused thousands of deaths and wounded/crippled to their fellow country men, women and children.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Islamic radicals in charge of societies elsewhere in the world will hail and laud these 'heroes' whom stood up against the might of infidels, when the actual truth was that they only crept behind their countrymen using innocent unarmed people as shields.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The palestinians who dare oppose terrorist 'elected' Hamas ideology and propaganda after this debacle will be mercilessly cut down, as was their Fatah political opponents.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hamas carries weapons, and the unarmed palestinian intellectuals or villager will have no other choice but to scream in support of 'death to jews and infidels' or they will be screaming for their own lives when Hamas guns are pointed at them or their loved ones in the middle of the night in their homes.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>They have no leader brave or strong enough to stand up to the atrocities of Hamas. Being religious, their radical extremists clerics are of no help to them except to accept their advice of being sacrifice for their mis-guided twisted religion as condemned by worldwide muslims.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hamas had won.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But i refused to be a pessimist like some for the sake of my fellow humans of the palestinian citizenship. <strong>There is hope.</strong> And that hope lies with <span style="text-decoration: underline;">religion</span> whom they profess to worship.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Fellow moderates muslims</strong> outside of Palestine must bear pressure upon palestinian muslim clerics to correct the misinterpretations. Genocide and suicide is absolutely unacceptable in this day and age.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>No one is the Caliph (commander of the faithful)today. Sanctified Mosques, funds and religious materials must not be used or misused by combatants. Women have intelligence as men and should have a right to be educated so as to be able to contribute to society.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Once religion is taken out of the equation, Hamas will become nothing more than resistance fighters they profess to be, and face the enemies themselves or make peace to better the life of their countrymen.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>They will have no funds or brainwashed new recruits from the muslim world.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Modern intelligent and educated moderate muslims</strong> around the the world must lead to defend the Koran and religion from being subverted by evil men. The only way to fight a regressive ideology is with a progressive ideology, not by bullets alone.</p>

              <p>I do not think the Israelis will accept the Syrian offer. The solution is for Israel to return to its <a href="http://whatreallyhappened.com/WRHARTICLES/mapstellstory.html">1967 borders</a>. It's not very much of a compromise even isn't it (look at map) but if it does so, the Arab leaders not hesitate to give Israel security guarantees and give themselves the title of "Heros of the Arabs and Guardians of Islam".</p>

              <p>as long as they still remain in fractions and wouldnt see eye to eye how can they ever defeat the enemy. hizbolla, hamas, fatah, if ever they understand chinese " to have a great achievement, must put small differences aside".</p>

              <p>It comes as a shock that UN and humanitarian agencies targeted ONLY Israeli for the war in Gaza.</p>
              <p>What about Hamas? Why are there no demands of justice for their genocidal atrocities and murderous intimidation of the israelis with their average 90 missiles per day for months?!</p>
              <p>Are only palestinians humans and the jews lesser beings, deserving death? What is disportionate when a rock that kills or a nuke that wipes out still destroy lives, precious lives so called 'humanitarian' organisations weep crocodile tears over?</p>
              <p>Why is there no international humanitarian pressure and demand for Hamas or the palestinian head of state by default - President Abbas - to answer for the deaths of innocent jews as well innocent palestinians?</p>
              <p>Is it because Jews are good to bully and Hamas, a terrorist organisation is to be feared and respected, even by faithful muslims whom these animals had blasphemed?</p>
              <p>Humanitarian organisations watch over humanitarian affairs, but who keeps a watch on these flawed humans whom claim to be humanitarians?</p>

              <p>they only won psychologically and in the media. In terms of attrition, they lost 100 times more than the Israelis. Israel should do what they have done to Hamas or Black September leaders in the past. Rocket them from a far like Sheikh Ahmed Yassin or send Kidon units to assasinate them overseas. This would lessen civilian collateral damage.</p>
              <p>For the record, i am all for the creation of a Palestinian state, but lead not by an organisation like Hamas.</p>
