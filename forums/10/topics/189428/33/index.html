I can't believe how this forum has been inundated with so much bitterness and bile against our government of 40 over years.  I'm a post 65-er myself and has travelled extensively in Asia, Europe and States to realise what a gem our small island is in terms of standard of living, amenities, security and comfort.  Most of the complaints brought up by the forum writers are petty and insignificant in the larger context of our country's survival on the world global stage and a possibly impending flu pandemic and terrorist attack.  Do u honestly think that any of those novice wet-behind-the ear  opposition candidates have one iota of ability to even conceive of the major problems we have facing us as a nation on the world stage on a daily basis?  Sure, give them a chance to perform but what is at stake?  Your home, your security, your job and all u have including the computer u are reading this message on.  And there u are, all these forum participants, safe and secure in your ivory tower, incidentally built for your comfort by our 40yr old government, pontificating and condemming all u survey with so much hatred and bitterness as if the government has raped and pillaged your home and hearth.  Wake up and smell the coffee!  No country can be first world without BOTH first world citizens and government.  So stop griping like spoilt brats who had everything too easy in life and voice some constructive comments which would be even vaguely constructive instead of indulging in your own little cesspool of cynicism, paranoia and bitterness.<br></div></blockquote>You cannot believe how this forum has been inundated with so much bitterness and bile against our government. Then I guess you would not be able to believe how MANY other forums are similar to this in terms of what forumners are saying about the govt. Maybe you should start believing in some things than continue to live in your perfect, dainty, make-belief world.<br><br>And using your sentences for a reversed effect, most of the complaints brought up by forum writers are petty and insignificant in the larger context to YOU, because you do NOT have even one iota of ability to conceive the problems many poor Singaporeans face. The problems and complaints are insignificant to YOU because YOU are safe and secure, high in YOUR ivory tower, pretending there is nothing happening to the poor minority from our nation.<br><br>Ah, and so our homes, security and jobs are at stake if we give the opposition a chance to perform. I see. I should expect to read about 23,752 residents in Hougang and 15,879 residents in Potong Pasir being homeless, jobless and being targets of suicide attacks in the near future, then. That is, if they haven't already been targets of "upgrading sanctions" for refusing to vote for the imcumbents.<br><br>I think the person who needs to wake up and smell the coffee is none other than YOU.<br><br>Oh and yes, I'm just being straightforward. Please don't be like your "great forefathers". Please dont sue.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Are we talking about replacing the current PAP government in the next several years? This is not a good option. Realistically, the opposition are still weak in terms of talent and depth. In the next several years, however, a few good opposition MPs can be a good check on the government by raising the level of debate in Parliament on proposed government policies.<br><br>But in the long term, I would like to see the opposition attract people of talent, who can be ministers. I am willing to give the opposition my vote now if this is what it takes for them to get a breakthrough in recruitment. A political scene dominated by one party is not good for Singapore because we can't be sure that the current government will always deliver. When they don't or can't deliver, how? What's Singapore's backup plan?</div>

I agree the government has done good for us from 1959-1986, but since then (or at least since I was born) I'm unsure of what good it has done for Singaporeans.<br><br>2) It's "sanitation", not "sanity". Hmm, all you have stated are economic benefits. Economic benefits are not necessarily popular benefits. Opportunities for foreign investments benefit foreign investors, but they only benefit Singaporeans insofar as Singaporeans get jobs, which don't seem to be the case. Changi Airport, Great Tourism Spots and PSA benefit tourists and Singaporeans who are tourists. They don't benefit Singaporeans who are not tourists. And anyway, we don't need to build I(C)R if we were that great a tourism spot. Though I grant, top places in these industries make good platforms for electoral advertising.<br><br>Top education facilities? Define what you mean by "top". Why didn't Warwick set up campus here? Because - whatever Straits Times reports - Singapore has insufficient academic freedom. Students can't speak up, can't organize, can't really do much. ANd anyway, our stress rate is pretty high: student suicide and depression rates are on the ascent; even ST can't miss that out in its "objective" reporting. I'm a student myself, and from the student's perspective, I can tell that students aren't enjoying school much at all, even neglecting the almost-useless NE.<br><br>3) I'm always baffled at why Singapore leaders and their lackeys - like you - always look downwards, instead of upwards. Why do we always look at Africa and India? Why not look at USA or Switzerland or Scandinavia? And we say we aren't resting on our laurels...<br><br>4 &amp; 5) Stop quoting proverbs. I realized a while ago that many proverbs contradict each other. I can easily find proverbs to counter yours, if I bothered to.  But anw, for the sake of it:-<br><br>4) Leopards cannot change their spots; loaves of bread to not change their intrinsic characteristics as loaves of bread dependent on who looks at them.<br><br>5) "Among three people, at least two are my teachers." Confucius the Master<br><br>Cheers,<br>Don't be so brainwashed,<br>the pikamaster (who is a student studying at a "top" education facility)<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I always hate it when people call those who thinks the PAP is doing a good job as brainwashed. Everyone has their political afflications, and some of us just prefer the current way of life, and the current leadership. And why should those who prefers the current way of life be slammed or even criticised? This is all a matter of personal choice.<br><br>Of course, PAP does have its faults(the upgrading carrot, and the harping on the Gomez saga way too much), but compare that against the opposition and u will realise that it is the lesser of 2 evils. Look at SDP. What have they done during the campaigning period? They promise 2 talk about the NFK saga, but 90% of the time just ask people to vote for them without really talking about the issues at hand. Then u have the SDA who is centred around 1 man, and his efforts to keep his ward. And of course, u have the WP, an up and coming party, but could screw up an nomination form, without giving much of an explaination.<br><br>And i seriously don't think Warwick not even setting up a campus here is much of an issue. Its not as if they are Harvard or Oxford. They can claim that  the lack of freedom of expression here is a primary factor, but in actual fact, do Singapore really need an second class University to be set up here?</div>
