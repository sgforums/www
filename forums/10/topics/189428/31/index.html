            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by nanren4ever:</div><div class="quote_body">firstly, rpm, welcome to this forum. Secondly, just wanna point out my views regarding some of the things u write here.<br><br>I think the opposition here will relish the chance, if they are voted into Parliament by a sizable number. They will purposely ask questions that are irrevelant, and doesn't really concern about the people at all. Sure, LTK, and CST are working hard for their parties, and their respective wards. But that's because they are in the minority. There's only two of them, what can they do? Give them 10-20 seats, and i can assure u, our opposition parties will have a field day trying to oppose just for the sake of oppose, and then claim that they are asking these questions on behalf of the pple.<br><br>As for the upgrading carrot, nothing is fair in this world. In a country, there will always be rich and poor, handsome and ugly, tall and short, fat and slim. There will always be a divide. Hougang and Potong Pasir obviously thinks that they have enough facilities in their wards, that they do not need upgrading to bite the upgrading carrot. Its their own choice. Why should the PAP pay for 2 wards that refuses to accept their mandate, and proceed on with upgrading?  The PAP have the money and machinery to make upgrading part of their campaign, what's wrong with it? We(those who vote for the PAP) will benefit from it, even if it comes out of our own money. Hougang and Potong Pasir majority decides that they want to stay that way, just too bad.<br><br>As for the Gomez affair, PAP is wrong in making it their top topic for almost the entire rallies period, save for the last 2 days. But they have a point. If Gomez make a such boohah out of a form, then how can he run a Constituency? Its an integrity issue. Its like u make a mistake, yet u turn around and point the finger at someone else. U just keep on saying sorry, but u cannot give a proper explaination as to why u did it. Do u expect people to forgive u that easily?</div></blockquote>thanks for the welcome.<br>You said that 'Give them 10-20 seats, and i can assure u, our opposition parties will have a field day trying to oppose just for the sake of oppose, and then claim that they are asking these questions on behalf of the pple.'<br>How do you know this will happen? Has it been proven in Singapore?<br>If this happen, you can still vote them out at the next election,right?<br><br>For the upgrading affair, you said nothing is fair in this world. Does that mean that we have to accept it? Is like when you see someone got rob or beaten, you say...yeah, nothing is fair, so have to accept it.<br><br>Hougang and potong pasir i am sure will welcome the upgrading....<br>If the money comes from PAP pocket, I have no issue. But...It is the PEOPLE' money!!!! In that case, can they dont pay taxes if their area is not upgraded?<br>I am happy that they have the courage to say no to this carrot.<br><br>The Gomez affair....integrity over a form????....pleeeese....<br><br></div>
