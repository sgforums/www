            <div class='col-md body'>interesting night.<br><br>Was rather satisfied with the results, except for silly SDP. I think they should disband the SDP. If not for SDP, PAP wouldn't even get an avg of 66%. Everywhere I see the % of votes for PAP dropping substantially. Most were below 70%.<br><br>Kudos to Chiam See Tong, the one who has done so much for the people, who endured the attack on him for so many years when he was the only opposition in the parliament. If he had lost, I would be really disappointed by Singaporeans.<br><br>SM Goh has to go. He has done his part, but he should go. Since that was his statement to Chiam See Tong that Chiam should go, but the people proved him wrong, then be a good loser and retire from politics on his own accord. Don't be thick-skinned.<br><br>I laughed at LHL's statement that he has a strong mandate in AMK. When I saw he was about 60+%, I laughed non-stop. That silly minister Lim Boon Heng furthered embarassed him by saying before the result that he believes LHL will get &gt; 80% votes. I think in LHL's heart, he was VERY angry, but he could not say anything negative <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> 6 youngsters could actually wallop him to 60+%, he should dig a hole and bury his head in <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>Finally, don't worry about the silly people whom vote PAP coz they think votes are tracable. Every 5 years, more and more youngsters join the battle arena, and youngsters don't take this sort of crap. PAP party is for the elites, but the majority of us are average people. Elites can never understand the average people, no matter how hard they try to.<br><br>And to all of you PAP supporters out there, I will end my post with just a final say on MM Lee. He may be the founding father of Singapore, but he can NEVER be the founding father WITHOUT the older generation folks whom bled and sweated for him. Now go around and look. Are these folks enjoying the retirement life that they deserve to have? Shouldn't they be rewarded for building up Singapore from scratch?<br><br>NO, I See many of them cleaning toilets, becoming security guards, cleaning hawker centres, etc. Whole life labouring for Singapore, when they should have retired and enjoy the life they DESERVE. So is Singapore a good country to be in? I leave it to you to think thru.<br><br>And finally, I see MM Lee ENJOYING the fruits of everyone's labour, having a superb pay of 1+ million per year, living in super big house when we all live in boxes. Don't tell me he deserves respect. He has taken back from us many times over. He can NEVER be compared to the likes of Mother Theresa, people whom REALLY sacrificed for others.<br><br>But he SHOULD continue to enjoy life. Enjoy more in fact, so that more and more of us gets more disgruntled with his attitude, and arrogance. More and more of us will vote for the opposition. In fact, he is a great magnet for opposition votes <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>I end my post on GE. Life goes on. You PAP supporters chose higher transport costs, higher costs of living. Let's see what happens when they review the DELAYED transport cost 3 months later. Let's see how they start to take back the Progress Package.</div>
