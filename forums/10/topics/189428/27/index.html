            <div class='col-md body'>As much as have said from the Oppositions we should also give SM Goh credits for the plans he had came about regarding lift upgradings. 9-day campaigms are too short for a former presentation of the actual costs require to upgrade lifts. It may even cost less to build lifts prior to a flat's construction works completion than upgrading (integrating) lift systems within an old flat! Upgrading requires demolishing of part of an existing old block of building and many safety and resident securities aspects to look into. Testing and/ replacement of the lift (if need to) may even be required.<br><br>Singapore built their first flats without lifts stopping at every level of the flats in the old days. And it is good for us to build newer flats with lifts stopping at every level later. Say that is "good for the old and the handicapped" but i say the young and able citizens will get lazier with too much welfare and care.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
