I think they should disband the SDP. If not for SDP, PAP wouldn't even get an avg of 66%. Everywhere I see the % of votes for PAP dropping substantially. Most were below 70%.<br><br>Kudos to Chiam See Tong, the one who has done so much for the people, who endured the attack on him for so many years when he was the only opposition in the parliament. If he had lost, I would be really disappointed by Singaporeans.<br><br>SM Goh has to go. He has done his part, but he should go. Since that was his statement to Chiam See Tong that Chiam should go, but the people proved him wrong, then be a good loser and retire from politics on his own accord. Don't be thick-skinned.<br><br>I laughed at LHL's statement that he has a strong mandate in AMK. When I saw he was about 60+%, I laughed non-stop. That silly minister Lim Boon Heng furthered embarassed him by saying before the result that he believes LHL will get &gt; 80% votes. I think in LHL's heart, he was VERY angry, but he could not say anything negative <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> 6 youngsters could actually wallop him to 60+%, he should dig a hole and bury his head in <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>Finally, don't worry about the silly people whom vote PAP coz they think votes are tracable. Every 5 years, more and more youngsters join the battle arena, and youngsters don't take this sort of crap. PAP party is for the elites, but the majority of us are average people. Elites can never understand the average people, no matter how hard they try to.<br><br>And to all of you PAP supporters out there, I will end my post with just a final say on MM Lee. He may be the founding father of Singapore, but he can NEVER be the founding father WITHOUT the older generation folks whom bled and sweated for him. Now go around and look. Are these folks enjoying the retirement life that they deserve to have? Shouldn't they be rewarded for building up Singapore from scratch?<br><br>NO, I See many of them cleaning toilets, becoming security guards, cleaning hawker centres, etc. Whole life labouring for Singapore, when they should have retired and enjoy the life they DESERVE. So is Singapore a good country to be in? I leave it to you to think thru.<br><br>And finally, I see MM Lee ENJOYING the fruits of everyone's labour, having a superb pay of 1+ million per year, living in super big house when we all live in boxes. Don't tell me he deserves respect. He has taken back from us many times over. He can NEVER be compared to the likes of Mother Theresa, people whom REALLY sacrificed for others.<br><br>But he SHOULD continue to enjoy life. Enjoy more in fact, so that more and more of us gets more disgruntled with his attitude, and arrogance. More and more of us will vote for the opposition. In fact, he is a great magnet for opposition votes <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>I end my post on GE. Life goes on. You PAP supporters chose higher transport costs, higher costs of living. Let's see what happens when they review the DELAYED transport cost 3 months later. Let's see how they start to take back the Progress Package. </div></blockquote>an intelligent opinion. I support u.</div>

If I vote for PAP, I take the risk that I'll not get opposition in. But if I vote for the opposition, what if too many of them get in and the above scenario takes place? Big question is I don't know how many other people are voting for PAP or opposition... so the safer path might be to vote for PAP.<br><br>Ok, now I'm ready for flames  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br></div></blockquote>Hey, I am also newbie here.<br>I tend to think differently. I feel that, currently looking at the political situation, Singapore will benefit more if we have more opposition.<br>If we have more opposition,<br>1) The government will have to work harder knowing they have competition.<br>2) They will have to think very hard before they increase things such as taxes, fares, etc<br>3) They will have to account and justify to the people how they intend to use OUR money.<br>4) the increase of opposition will allow our people to air more views and have more say, instead of being afraid.<br><br>I do not think for a moment people will work less hard if we have more opposition. I dont think Singapore will go worse too....<br>The opposition will contribute to Singaopre by questioning, debating and challenge issues things which they feel is not good for Singapore. LTK and CST are very good examples that they have contributed to Sinagpore.<br><br>Also, I am not happy on the way PAP has handled the election, the upgrading carrot, Gomez affair, .....</div>

Secondly, just wanna point out my views regarding some of the things u write here.<br><br>I think the opposition here will relish the chance, if they are voted into Parliament by a sizable number. They will purposely ask questions that are irrevelant, and doesn't really concern about the people at all. Sure, LTK, and CST are working hard for their parties, and their respective wards. But that's because they are in the minority. There's only two of them, what can they do? Give them 10-20 seats, and i can assure u, our opposition parties will have a field day trying to oppose just for the sake of oppose, and then claim that they are asking these questions on behalf of the pple.<br><br>As for the upgrading carrot, nothing is fair in this world. In a country, there will always be rich and poor, handsome and ugly, tall and short, fat and slim. There will always be a divide. Hougang and Potong Pasir obviously thinks that they have enough facilities in their wards, that they do not need upgrading to bite the upgrading carrot. Its their own choice. Why should the PAP pay for 2 wards that refuses to accept their mandate, and proceed on with upgrading?  The PAP have the money and machinery to make upgrading part of their campaign, what's wrong with it? We(those who vote for the PAP) will benefit from it, even if it comes out of our own money. Hougang and Potong Pasir majority decides that they want to stay that way, just too bad.<br><br>As for the Gomez affair, PAP is wrong in making it their top topic for almost the entire rallies period, save for the last 2 days. But they have a point. If Gomez make a such boohah out of a form, then how can he run a Constituency? Its an integrity issue. Its like u make a mistake, yet u turn around and point the finger at someone else. U just keep on saying sorry, but u cannot give a proper explaination as to why u did it. Do u expect people to forgive u that easily?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>On carrots, I think there must be "something to gain or lose" at the constituency level, or else it makes no sense to vote by constituencies. And I do think there is reason to have constituencies... so that MPs can reach out more readily to the people, and be more focused in doing so.<br><br>But should lift upgrading be the carrot? I somehow feel that there are carrots that should be given out impartially (in which case they no longer remain carrots... but that's separate issue), especially those given out by stat boards and government ministries directly, such as lift upgrading.<br><br>Within a constituency, the voted in political party may then compete on fair grounds against other constituencies and political parties... using the resources they can gather (perhaps by adjusting conservancy fees, fund raising activities, etc.) and provide upgrades / improvements to the areas specific to within that constituency (including lift upgrading if they want, but that decision should not be due to "HDB did not approve our application, because we are SDA not PAP", but perhaps because they simply want to do more for the people).</div>

I am with PAP on that and i hope JG be closely monitored both by the rulin party and WP herself. The other WP members are okay just that with JG as their fellow wing member they have to speak up for him. The same goes for SDP.
