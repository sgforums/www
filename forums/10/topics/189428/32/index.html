A country has 3 impt things, Education, Transport and Healthcare. These are the 3 pillars of a country's well-being, and in my opinion should not be outsourced to private companies (though it is all humbug in my opinion, since Temasek controls most of them anyway), and should not be made a profiteering tool<br><br>Let's take transport for example since you talk about bus fares. Public transport should remain affordable to the average Singaporean since this is the MUST-HAVE thing in the country. With public transport, rightfully there should be no profits out of it, coz it conflicts directly with the affordable objective.<br><br>Why the people are so upset with bus fares, etc, is coz private companies want to improve on their bottomline. By doing so, they raise prices. Now, this is in direct conflict with keeping public transport affordable. Here you are, the govt saying that must keep bus fares low, there you have, the private companies increasing their profits. This signals to the people that the bus fares aren't as low as what they should have been.</div>
