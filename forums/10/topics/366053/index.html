              <h2 class="cN-headingPage prepend-5 span-11 last"><span class="BHL">Honduran president overthrown, new leader voted in</span></h2>
              <p><span class="BDL">June 28, 2009</span></p>
              <p><span class="BDL"><br></span> <span class="BTX"> Honduran troops ousted President Manuel Zelaya
                      Sunday and flew him out of the country, ending a bitter power struggle
                      with the military as parliament swiftly voted in a new leader. </span></p>
              <p>Zelaya insisted as he arrived in regional neighbor Costa Rica that he
                      remained the president of his Central American nation, but just hours
                      later the Congress voted in the parliamentary speaker as the country's
                      new leader.</p>
              <p><span class="BTX">
              </span></p><p>The first such major upheaval in several decades in the impoverished
                      country was triggered by a tense political standoff between Zelaya and
                      the country's military and legal institutions over his bid to secure a
                      second term.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">"I will never give up since I was elected the president by the people,"
                      Zelaya said from San Jose, accusing Honduran troops of kidnapping him
                      and denouncing what he called a "political conspiracy."</span></span></strong></p>
              <p>But Congress said it voted unanimously to remove him from office for
                      his "apparent misconduct" and for "repeated violations of the
                      constitution and the law and disregard of orders and judgments of the
                      institutions."</p>
              <p>In his place they appointed speaker Roberto Micheletti as the new
                      leader to serve out the rest of the term, which ends in January. New
                      general elections are planned for November 29.</p>
              <p>Zelaya, elected to a non-renewal four-year term in 2005, had planned a
                      vote Sunday asking Hondurans to sanction a future referendum to allow
                      him to run for reelection in the November polls.</p>
              <p>The planned referendum had been ruled illegal by the country's top
                      court and was opposed by the military, but the president said he
                      planned to press ahead with it anyway and ballot boxes had already been
                      distributed.</p>
              <p>The Supreme Court said Sunday that it had ordered the president's
                      ouster in order to protect law and order in the nation of some seven
                      million people.</p>
              <p>"Today's events originate from a court order by a competent judge," the
                      country's highest court said in a statement read by spokesman Danilo
                      Izaguirre.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The drama unfolded just about dawn on Sunday when some 200 troops
                      swooped on Zelaya's home. He was bundled away in his pyjamas and flown
                      out of the country.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p>A leading government official, Armando Sarmiento, told AFP that at
                      least eight cabinet members were also detained including Foreign
                      Minister Patricia Rodas.</p>
              <p>As planes and helicopters overflew the capital, several hundred Zelaya
                      supporters ignored warnings to stay home and flooded onto the streets
                      of Tegucigalpa shouting out, "We want Mel," the president's nickname.</p>
              <p>But the demonstration was halted in front of the presidential palace
                      when the way was barred by a cordon of troops and armored vehicles.</p>
              <p>US President Barack Obama said he was deeply concerned about the events
                      in Honduras, as US officials said they recognized Zelaya as the
                      country's legitimate president.</p>
              <p>"We recognize Zelaya as the duly elected and constitutional president
                      of Honduras. We see no other," the Obama administration official told
                      reporters on condition of anonymity.</p>
              <p>UN chief Ban Ki-moon said he wanted Zelaya to be reinstated and human rights in the country to be fully respected.</p>
              <p>"The Secretary-General... expresses his strong support for the
                      country's democratic institutions and condemns the arrest today of the
                      constitutional President of the Republic," a UN statement said.</p>
              <p>Sunday's dramatic events were the culmination of a tense political standoff over the past several days.</p>
              <p>Last week Zelaya sacked the country's top military chief, General Romeo
                      Vasquez and also accepted the resignation of Defense Minister Edmundo
                      Orellana, after military commanders refused to distribute ballot boxes
                      for Sunday's vote.</p>
              <p>The heads of the army, marines and air force also resigned.</p>
              <p>The Honduran Supreme Court then unanimously voted Thursday to reinstate
                      Vasquez and hundreds of troops massed late last week in the capital
                      Tegucigalpa.</p>
              <p>Zelaya, who was elected as a conservative, has shifted dramatically to the left during his presidency.</p>
              <p>He is the latest in a long list of Latin American leaders, including
                      Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, to seek constitutional changes to
                      expand presidential powers and also ease term limits.</p>
              <p>Chavez also denounced Sunday's arrest as a "coup d'etat" and alleged that the United States had a hand in Zelaya's overthrow.</p>
              <p>And he warned that if Venezuela's envoys to Honduras were harmed he
                      would be prepared to intervene militarily. Cuba's ambassador to
                      Honduras, Juan Carlos Hernandez, said he had been briefly detained and
                      hit by troops.</p>

              <p>It concerns whether the latin american militaries supported by oligarchic forces can still succeed in securing their interests through coups to topple leaders who threaten their position and powers.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>...Manuel Zelaya came to office in January 2006, following a highly
              contested election in November 2005. He is a long-time member of the
              Liberal Party, one of the main establishment parties of Honduras. He
              ran on the basis of a law-and-order program, narrowly defeating the
              equally right-wing candidate of the National Party of Honduras,
              Porfirio Pepe Lobo.</p>
              <p>After coming to power, however, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Zelaya
              initiated populist measures and developed a close relationship with
              Venezuela’s president, Hugo Chavez. This policy alienated the country’s
              wealthy elite and political establishment, including leading figures in
              Zelaya’s own party. Since he was elected, Zelaya has come into periodic
              conflict with the corporate elite, which is the principal social force
              behind the military.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p>In January,<span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> Zelaya increased the country’s
              minimum wage from 157 to 280 dollars, excluding special export zones.
              Corporations responded angrily and initiated mass layoffs.</strong></span></span> Honduras is
              an impoverished country, with a poverty rate of about 70 percent.</p>
              <p>The
              United States, the European Union, the Organization of American States
              and United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon declared their
              opposition to the coup. President Barack Obama said the US government
              did not recognize Micheletti and called for Zelaya to be returned to
              Honduras.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The United States has a long history of involvement in
              Central and South America, including support for a series of military

              ties have become strained under Zelaya.</p>

              <p>A statement by US President Barack Obama just sent out by the White House:</p>
              <blockquote><br>"I am deeply concerned by reports coming out of
              Honduras regarding the detention and expulsion of President Mel Zelaya.
              As the Organization of American States did on Friday, I call on all
              political and social actors in Honduras to respect democratic norms,
              the rule of law and the tenets of the Inter-American Democratic
              Charter. Any existing tensions and disputes must be resolved peacefully
              through dialogue free from any outside interference."
              <p> </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>As Kristin Bricker has been reporting the past few days here on <a href="http://narconews.com/">Narco News</a>,
              there have been mounting threats of military coup d'etat against
              democratically elected Honduran President Manuel Zelaya (photographed
              above with Obama at the April Summit of the Americas in Trinidad).
              Today is a national election day and the bone of contention is Zelaya's
              placement of a non-binding referendum that asks the Honduran people if
              they want another referendum in November to decide whether to reform
              the Constitution.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Truth is, Honduras has long been run by an oligarchy (rule by a
              select wealthy class) and the popular Zelaya has had to contend with a
              military brass, a judiciary and a legislature (and its corrupt
              political parties) that is openly hostile to his center-left
              government. </strong></span></span>While reasonable folks can disagree over whether the
              non-binding referendum should have gone to ballot today over the
              objections of the country's Supreme Court, the oligarchy lined up
              against that vote has just reportedly overplayed its hand by <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-honduras-coup29-2009jun29,0,2480224.story">kidnapping the President</a>:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Honduran army troops seized President Manuel Zelaya early today and
              sent the leftist president into exile in an apparent coup, reports from
              the Central American country said.</p>
              <p>Troops moved through the Honduran capital, Tegucigalpa, and
              surrounded the presidential palace and other government buildings. The
              state television network was off the air as hundreds of angry Honduran
              citizens poured into the streets and shouted support for Zelaya. "The
              fact is, this is a coup d'etat and the president of Honduras has been
              kidnapped and beaten up," Honduras' ambassador to the Organization of
              American States, Carlos Sosa Coello, told CNN's Spanish-language
              network.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>When similar events occurred in 2002 in Venezuela, the Bush White
              House blamed the kidnapped president for his own abduction and gloated,
              cheering the coup d'etat. (Over the following three days masses of
              Venezuelan citizens overpowered the coup, took back the public
              television station and broadcast to the people that their president had
              not resigned but had been abducted. Venezuelan President Chavez was
              brought back to power by a nonviolent civil resistance movement.)</p>
              <p>What is happening in Honduras, though, has got to be the most
              boneheaded coup attempt in Latin American history: to kidnap a
              president <em>on an election day</em>, and without the support that
              Washington historically gave past military coups from Santiago to
              Caracas, is not likely to work out as planned for today's coup
              plotters. Presuming that Zelaya is still alive and not critically
              wounded, it's a good bet that he'll be back in a matter of days, if not
              hours, more popular than before.</p>

              <p>Before rushing to condemn the oligarchy for ousting the Honduran President - have you studied the background events that led to his ouster ? </p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://article.feeds4all.nl/Crisis-in-Honduras-This-Weekend/1718892920.aspx">If the Oligarchs of Honduras are the Judiciary and Congress and defended by the Army - </a>then Honduras is surely safer than Singapore ?</p>
              <p>Unlike the situation in Honduras, for 52 years - Singapore has experienced a single political party dominating Parliament - where the candidates selected to be Members of Parliament are vetted by the Central Committee of the Political Party to stand for election, while the election system is subjected to the manipulation of the Political Party, which will also not keep the sacred Constitution intact but will bastardised it beyond the original spirit of the carefully selected language used.</p>
              <p>With the legislative process in Parliament under the overwhelming control of a single dominated Poltiical Party, its supreme dominance has extended into the Judiciary that is subjected to careful 'management' by the Political Party.</p>
              <p>The Singapore situation is so severely unbalanced that it has resulted in the non-existence of separation of the Executive Powers from the Legislative, and subjected to the Judiciary oversight.</p>
              <p>All power in Singapore is concentrated and emanates from the Political Center.</p>
              <p>Every aspect of Singapore economic, political, military, social and cultural affairs are dominated, manipulated, and controlled from the Political Center.</p>
              <p>Is Honduras subjected to such overwhelming influence from one source ?</p>
              <p>The Honduran President who was ousted was limited by Legislation to only one term, and Honduras was supposed to be kept safe from the type of politics that is seen in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Yet the Honduran President had attempted to change the Constitution to extend his one term into a two term, and may even follow the abuses practised in Venezuela where it has now seen the Venezuelan President entrenching himself permanently in the Presidency.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Do Singaporeans have to wait for the SAF to act to kidnap the President or the PM - or will the current MM activate his lines of control to have the SAF to act and prevent any election outcome that sees an Alternative Political Party chosen by Singaporeans to lead Singapore ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>• "Without the elected president and if there is a freak result, within two or three years, the army would have to come in and stop it" -- MM Lee Kuan Yew on what would happen if a profligate opposition government touched Singapore's vast monetary reserves</p>

              <p>Is this the kind of Mentor that Singaporeans need ?</p>
              <p>If Singapore is pushed into similar circumstances as in China, will he shoot 200,000 young Singaporeans to save Singapore from another 52 years of disorder ?</p>

              <p id="story_byline">KEEBLE MCFARLANE</p>
              <p id="story_date">Saturday, July 04, 2009</p>
              <p id="story">Democracy is something outsiders never associated with
              governance in Latin America until quite recently. The typical Latin
              country was one where the thin layer at the top of the demographic pile
              lived as well as the rich in the most developed countries, while the
              vast depressed masses lived in the most squalid conditions.</p>
              <p>Elections were held like clockwork, but no politician ever dared
              introduce policies that would benefit the majority. Those who did were
              quickly ejected by the military, which existed not to uphold the
              constitution or to defend the nation against external adversaries, but
              rather to protect the interests of the wealthy and provide bullet-proof
              careers for the officer corps. Looking over their shoulders was the
              giant from the north, Uncle Sam, who kept them all in line by economic
              coercion, political blackmail or failing that, actual military
              intervention.</p>
              <p>One country, Panama, was practically a creation of the
              United States, which just over a century ago encouraged a dissident
              region of Colombia to secede and form a new country. The new nation
              ceded an important portion of its territory to the US to build a canal
              joining two oceans and dramatically reducing the time it takes a ship
              to travel from the Atlantic to the Pacific. The US occupied a strip of
              land bordering the canal and relinquished its hold only as the century
              came to a close.</p>
              <p id="story">"Banana republic" was one of the pejorative terms used to
              describe some of those countries, and the archetype was the central
              American country, Honduras. The term was the creation of the noted
              American author, O Henry, who spent a year in Honduras at the end of
              the 19th century. His stay produced a book of linked short stories in
              1904 titled Cabbages and Kings using characters and situations he
              observed there.</p>
              <p id="story">Three American companies - United Fruit, Standard Fruit
              and Cuyamel - controlled the country's banana business. They owned the
              plantations, packaging operations, railways and ports. They also owned
              politicians, who arranged matters to smooth their operations regardless
              of how it affected the people.</p>
              <p id="story">The United Fruit Company, which older Jamaicans remember
              - not necessarily fondly - earned the nickname El Pulpo (The Octopus)
              because its tentacles extended into many aspects of Honduran politics,
              sometimes violently.</p>
              <p id="story">The owner of Cuyamel, Sam Zemurray, hired a bunch of
              armed bully-boys from New Orleans a century ago to help stage a coup in
              order to secure favourable treatment from the new rulers. A couple of
              decades later Zemurray succeeded in a hostile takeover of the notorious
              United Fruit, and in the 1930s he was the man from whom Norman Manley
              had to wrest concessions for banana workers. In the 1950s, United Fruit
              was among the organisations which persuaded the US presidents Truman
              and Eisenhower to overthrow the government of Jácobo Arbenz in
              Honduras's neighbour, Guatemala, because his policies proposed fairer
              treatment for workers.</p>
              <p id="story">Honduras fit the template with regular military coups to
              depose governments the generals or their friends in the oligarchy
              didn't like. But in 1982, the country produced a new constitution -
              backed by the US - to increase democratic activity. The quid pro quo
              for American support was to act as host for the so-called contra rebels
              from next-door Nicaragua.</p>
              <p id="story">The havoc they wreaked persists in the memories, as well as the bodies of Nicaraguans.</p>
              <p id="story">Political turbulence continued in the 1990s, as Honduras
              received loans from the World Bank and the IMF, whose priorities, as we
              know from painful experience, hardly ever coincide with those of
              national governments. And as they say, bad luck is worse than obeah -
              in the middle of all this, hurricane Mitch struck in 1998, adding to
              the misery. Yet the democratic trend continued, with regime after
              regime chosen freely through the ballot box.</p>
              <p id="story">But now, it appears, the country has defaulted to old
              ways. Honduras is in the midst of a military coup, which began early on
              Sunday when soldiers entered the home of President Manuel Zelaya and
              rousted him out of bed. They didn't even allow him to change out of his
              pyjamas and whisked him off to Costa Rica. The plotters produced a
              letter of resignation purportedly signed by Zelaya, and upon receiving
              it the Congress chose the Speaker, Roberto Micheletti, to succeed
              Zelaya. He immediately ordered a night-time curfew and blocked radio
              and television stations from carrying anything but the most innocuous
              programming. This hasn't prevented Zelaya's supporters from protesting
              in the streets. As is their custom, the security forces have responded
              in force, using tear gas and batons liberally.</p>
              <p id="story">Zelaya became president by a close margin at the end of
              2005 and his term expires next January. According to the constitution,
              he is allowed only one term. The coup leaders accused him of
              undermining democracy because he had called for a plebiscite on whether
              to begin a process to rewrite the constitution. He was asking his
              fellow citizens to put a question on the ballot during the presidential
              vote in November with a view to establishing a constituent assembly to
              examine constitutional options. What could be more democratic than that?</p>
              <p id="story">Among the ideas he was floating was to abolish the
              one-term provision and let a president run again. It is true that this
              effort resembles similar successful exercises in other Latin American
              countries.</p>
              <p id="story">Venezuela, Bolivia and Ecuador recently re-wrote their
              constitutions, generally enshrining the rights of hitherto marginalised
              people and putting in measures to protect their economies from the
              effects of corporate freebooting and free trade.</p>
              <p id="story">Zelaya, a wealthy landowner, is not a natural fit for the
              club of left-leaning leaders who have taken power across Central and
              South America in recent years. But after he was installed in office, he
              began taking on the business community with its sweat-shop mentality.</p>
              <p id="story">He increased the minimum wage by 60 per cent, declaring that it would "force the business oligarchy to pay what is fair".</p>
              <p id="story">His politics have stirred up the ire and resistance of
              the political class, including those in his own Liberal party, at the
              same time garnering support among the underprivileged, popular
              movements and groups promoting a civil society. As his popularity
              increased in these sectors, the establishment worked to undermine him,
              leading to the coup.</p>
              <p id="story">Zelaya has been erratic, divisive and reckless, but it is
              those who oppose him who are undermining their country's fragile
              democracy. This is why their effort has attracted no serious support
              from abroad, and why the Organisation of American States, the United
              Nations, the European Union and even the old bad boy of the region, the
              United States, have condemned the plotters and are working behind the
              scenes to restore a normal state of affairs.</p>
              <p id="story">At bottom, the problem with Honduras is the same as many
              countries of the region: it is very poor, with 70 per cent of its seven
              and a half million people living below the poverty line. What the
              perpetrators of the coup fear is that a constitutional assembly would
              erode or eliminate their power and bring in radical changes to the
              political system, breaking up the comfortable old dolly-house they have
              controlled for generations.</p>
              <p id="story">Hugo Chávez, Evo Morales and Rafael Correa have managed
              to achieve considerable change in the power structures of Venezuela,
              Bolivia and Ecuador through their understanding of the need for
              widespread participation and direct appeals to those who have been
              ignored and overlooked in the past. The questions that are unclear is
              whether Manuel Zelaya is that kind of leader and whether Honduras is
              ready for that kind of change.</p>

              <h1>The Right Strikes Back!</h1>
              <p>by Immanuel Wallerstein</p>
              <p><span class="norm">The presidency of George W. Bush was the moment of
              the greatest electoral sweep of left-of-center political parties in
              Latin America in the last two centuries. The presidency of Barack Obama
              risks being the moment of the revenge of the right in Latin America.<br><br>The
              reason may well be the same -- the combination of the decline of
              American power with the continuing centrality of the United States in
              world politics. At one and the same time, the United States is unable
              to impose itself and is nonetheless expected by everyone to enter the
              playing field on their side.<br><br>What happened in Honduras? Honduras
              has long been one of the surest pillars of Latin American oligarchies
              -- an arrogant and unrepentant ruling class, with close ties to the
              United States and site of a major American military base. Its own
              military was carefully recruited to avoid any taint of officers with
              populist sympathies.<br><br>In the last elections, Manuel ("Mel")
              Zelaya was elected president. A product of the ruling classes, he was
              expected to continue to play the game the way Honduran presidents
              always play it. Instead, he edged leftward in his policies. He
              undertook internal programs that actually did something for the vast
              majority of the population -- building schools in remote rural areas,
              increasing the minimum wage, opening health clinics. He started his
              term supporting the free trade agreement with the United States. But
              then, after two years, he joined ALBA, the interstate organization
              started by President Hugo Chavez, and Honduras received as a result
              low-cost oil coming from Venezuela.<br><br>Then he proposed to hold an
              advisory referendum as to whether the population thought it a good idea
              to convene a body to revise the constitution. The oligarchy shouted
              that this was an attempt by Zelaya to change the constitution to make
              it possible for him to have a second term. But since the referendum was
              to occur on the day his successor would have been elected, this was
              clearly a phony reason.<br><br>Why then did the army stage a coup
              d'état, with the support of the Supreme Court, the Honduran
              legislature, and the Roman Catholic hierarchy? Two factors entered
              here: their view of Zelaya and their view of the United States. In the
              1930s, the U.S. right attacked Franklin Roosevelt as "a traitor to his
              class." For the Honduran oligarchy, that's Zelaya -- "a traitor to his
              class" -- someone who had to be punished as an example to others.<br><br>What
              about the United States? When the coup occurred, some of the raucous
              left commentators in the blogosphere called it "Obama's coup." That
              misses the point of what happened. Neither Zelaya nor his supporters on
              the street, nor indeed Chavez or Fidel Castro, have such a simplistic
              view. They all note the difference between Obama and the U.S. right
              (political leaders or military figures) and have expressed repeatedly a
              far more nuanced analysis.<br><br>It seems quite clear that the last
              thing the Obama administration wanted was this coup. The coup has been
              an attempt to force Obama's hand. This was undoubtedly encouraged by
              key figures in the U.S. right like Otto Reich, the Cuban-American
              ex-counselor of Bush, and the International Republican Institute. This
              was akin to Saakashvili's attempt to force the U.S. hand in Georgia
              when he invaded South Ossetia. That too was done in connivance with the
              U.S. right. That one didn't work because Russian troops stopped it.<br><br>Obama
              has been wiggling ever since the Honduran coup. And as of now the
              Honduran and U.S. right are far from satisfied that they have succeeded
              in turning U.S. policy around. Witness some of their outrageous
              statements. The Foreign Minister of the coup government, Enrique Ortez,
              said that Obama was "un negrito que sabe nada de nada." There is some
              controversy about how pejorative "negrito" is in Spanish. I would
              translate this myself as saying that Obama was "a nigger who knows
              absolutely nothing." In any case, the U.S. Ambassador sharply protested
              the insult. Ortez apologized for his "unfortunate expression" and he
              was shifted to another job in the government. Ortez also gave an
              interview to a Honduran TV station saying that "I don't have racial
              prejudices; I like the sugar-mill nigger who is president of the United
              States."<br><br>The U.S. right is no doubt more polite but no less
              denunciatory of Obama. Republican Sen. Jim DeMint, Cuban-American
              Republican Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, and conservative lawyer Manuel A.
              Estrada have all been insisting that the coup was justified because it
              wasn't a coup, just a defense of the Honduran constitution. And
              rightwing blogger Jennifer Rubin published a piece on July 13 entitled
              "Obama is Wrong, Wrong, Wrong About Honduras." Her Honduran equivalent,
              Ramón Villeda, published an open letter to Obama on July 11, in which
              he said that "This is not the first time that the United States has
              made a mistake and abandoned, at a critical moment, an ally and a
              friend." Meanwhile, Chavez is calling on the State Department to "do
              something."<br><br>The Honduran right is playing for time, until
              Zelaya's term ends. If they reach that goal, they will have won. And
              the Guatemalan, Salvadorian, and Nicaraguan right are watching in the
              wings, itching to start their own coups against their no longer
              rightwing governments.<br><br>The Honduran coup has to be placed in the
              larger context of what is happening throughout Latin America. It is
              quite possible that the right will win the elections this year and next
              year in Argentina and Brazil, maybe in Uruguay as well, and most likely
              in Chile. Three leading analysts from the Southern Cone have published
              their explanations. The least pessimistic, Argentine political
              scientist Atilio Boron, speaks of "the futility of the coup." Brazilian
              sociologist Emir Sader says that Latin America faces a choice: "the
              deepening of antineoliberalism or conservative restoration." Uruguayan
              journalist Raúl Zibechi entitles his analysis "the irresistible
              decadence of progressivism." Zibechi in effect thinks it may be too
              late for Sader's alternative. The weak economic policies of Presidents
              Lula, Vazquez, Kirchner, and Bachelet (of Brazil, Uruguay, Argentina,
              and Chile) have strengthened the right (which he sees adopting a
              Berlusconi style) and split the left.<br><br>Myself, I think there's a
              more straightforward explanation. The left came to power in Latin
              America because of U.S. distraction and good economic times. Now it
              faces continued distraction but bad economic times. And it's getting
              blamed because it's in power, even though in fact there's little the
              left-of-center governments can do about the world-economy.<br></span></p>
              <p><span class="norm">Can
              the United States do something more about the coup? Well, of course it
              can. First of all, Obama can officially label the coup a coup. This
              would trigger a U.S. law, cutting off all U.S. assistance to Honduras.
              He can sever the Pentagon's continuing relations with the Honduran
              military. He can withdraw the U.S. ambassador. He can say that there's
              nothing to negotiate instead of insisting on "mediation" between the
              legitimate government and the coup leaders.<br><br>Why doesn't he do
              all that? It's really simple, too. He's got at least four other
              super-urgent items on his agenda: confirmation of Sonia Sotomayor to
              the Supreme Court; a continuing mess in the Middle East; his need to
              pass health legislation this year (if not by August, then by December);
              and suddenly enormous pressure to open investigations of the illegal
              acts of the Bush administration. I'm sorry, but Honduras is fifth in
              line.<br><br>So Obama wiggles. And nobody will be happy. Zelaya may yet
              be restored to legal office, but maybe only three months from now. Too
              late. Keep your eye on Guatemala.</span></p>

              <h1>The Right Strikes Back!</h1>
              <p>by Immanuel Wallerstein</p>
              <p><span>The presidency of George W. Bush was the moment of the greatest electoral sweep of left-of-center political parties in Latin America in the last two centuries. The presidency of Barack Obama risks being the moment of the revenge of the right in Latin America.<br><br>The reason may well be the same -- the combination of the decline of American power with the continuing centrality of the United States in world politics. At one and the same time, the United States is unable to impose itself and is nonetheless expected by everyone to enter the playing field on their side.<br><br>What happened in Honduras? Honduras has long been one of the surest pillars of Latin American oligarchies -- an arrogant and unrepentant ruling class, with close ties to the United States and site of a major American military base. Its own military was carefully recruited to avoid any taint of officers with populist sympathies.<br><br>In the last elections, Manuel ("Mel") Zelaya was elected president. A product of the ruling classes, he was expected to continue to play the game the way Honduran presidents always play it. Instead, he edged leftward in his policies. He undertook internal programs that actually did something for the vast majority of the population -- building schools in remote rural areas, increasing the minimum wage, opening health clinics. He started his term supporting the free trade agreement with the United States. But then, after two years, he joined ALBA, the interstate organization started by President Hugo Chavez, and Honduras received as a result low-cost oil coming from Venezuela.<br><br>Then he proposed to hold an advisory referendum as to whether the population thought it a good idea to convene a body to revise the constitution. The oligarchy shouted that this was an attempt by Zelaya to change the constitution to make it possible for him to have a second term. But since the referendum was to occur on the day his successor would have been elected, this was clearly a phony reason.<br><br>Why then did the army stage a coup d'état, with the support of the Supreme Court, the Honduran legislature, and the Roman Catholic hierarchy? Two factors entered here: their view of Zelaya and their view of the United States. In the 1930s, the U.S. right attacked Franklin Roosevelt as "a traitor to his class." For the Honduran oligarchy, that's Zelaya -- "a traitor to his class" -- someone who had to be punished as an example to others.<br><br>What about the United States? When the coup occurred, some of the raucous left commentators in the blogosphere called it "Obama's coup." That misses the point of what happened. Neither Zelaya nor his supporters on the street, nor indeed Chavez or Fidel Castro, have such a simplistic view. They all note the difference between Obama and the U.S. right (political leaders or military figures) and have expressed repeatedly a far more nuanced analysis.<br><br>It seems quite clear that the last thing the Obama administration wanted was this coup. The coup has been an attempt to force Obama's hand. This was undoubtedly encouraged by key figures in the U.S. right like Otto Reich, the Cuban-American ex-counselor of Bush, and the International Republican Institute. This was akin to Saakashvili's attempt to force the U.S. hand in Georgia when he invaded South Ossetia. That too was done in connivance with the U.S. right. That one didn't work because Russian troops stopped it.<br><br>Obama has been wiggling ever since the Honduran coup. And as of now the Honduran and U.S. right are far from satisfied that they have succeeded in turning U.S. policy around. Witness some of their outrageous statements. The Foreign Minister of the coup government, Enrique Ortez, said that Obama was "un negrito que sabe nada de nada." There is some controversy about how pejorative "negrito" is in Spanish. I would translate this myself as saying that Obama was "a nigger who knows absolutely nothing." In any case, the U.S. Ambassador sharply protested the insult. Ortez apologized for his "unfortunate expression" and he was shifted to another job in the government. Ortez also gave an interview to a Honduran TV station saying that "I don't have racial prejudices; I like the sugar-mill nigger who is president of the United States."<br><br>The U.S. right is no doubt more polite but no less denunciatory of Obama.
