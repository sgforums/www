There could be numerous doubts in our minds. And then how about the decision to stay-in purely as "insurance" that you may need the donation one day? I think it is not a good attitude like that..... Like being :forced" to stay-in....<br><br>One point of concern is that how many who stay in actually know they can opt out? Those who receive mailers and can read - yes. How about the others?<br><br>I have no ready solution to the problem but I cannot accept it at face value when they say that they will ensure zero mistakes. How many times zero mistakes situations have given rise to problems? More than once is already intolerable. Do we claim a zero mistake medical industry right now? I doubt so....</div></blockquote>Say today you are a manager in charge of promoting one staff from a pool of ten. All things being the same, 5 staff always stays back half hour more everyday to settle the ongoing projects, while the other 5 always leave on the dot. Would the former 5 have a higher chance of the latter?<br><br>Say today u are the bugger holding one organ in your hands. There are three people requiring this organ to save themselves. All things being the same, except for one, who on top of what the other 2 do, helps out in his spare time at the old folks home. Who will u give this organ to?<br><br>I'm sure u make mistakes. Me too. I'm sure nobody can say they had never made a mistake in their life, and nobody can say they will never make a mistake in future. Since u know that, then why are u denying others a chance to be save? Perhaps I myself will be on the deathbed, and the people responsible mis-diagnoised me. I'm taken off life support, innocently killed because of a mistake, but at least my organs can save someone else.<br><br>Nothing is fair in this world. Sometimes we get the good stuff while others get the bad. If we get the bad stuff, perhaps we should stop worrying about it and move on. In this case, if we're mis-diagnoised, at least when we look down from heaven we see someone else granted a 2nd chance in life.</div>

One must understand that opting out of HOTA DOES NOT MEAN you are against ORGAN DONATION. It simply means that you retain CONTROL over who and what you choose to donate.
