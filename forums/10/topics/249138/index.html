            <div class='col-md body'><strong>No, I won't donate<br>But do you know what you're doing?<br>HUMAN ORGAN TRANSPLANT ACT: MOH data shows that young are opting out<br>April 18, 2007<br></strong><br><br>THIS is the time of year when those turning 21 will be told that they are old enough to decide whether they want to donate their organs.<br><br>They will get a letter from the Ministry of Health via registered mail.<br><br>Those who are 21 are also in the age group (21 to 29) which has the highest number of people opting out of the Human Organ and Transplant Act (Hota).<br><br>An MOH spokesman said that of the more than 10,000 people who opted out between 1 Jul 2004 and 31 Mar 2007, over 4,400 were in the 21 to 29 age group. (See table.)<br><br>But do they know that by doing so, they are kicking themselves down to the bottom of the class?<br><br>Those who opt out will be given lower priority for donor organs if they ever need one.<br><br>Do they also know that they will deprive another person of a chance at life if the unexpected were to happen to them?<br><br>Today, there are more than 600patients waiting for an organ transplant in Singapore.<br><br>The demand for cadaveric organs for transplant continues to increase rapidly.<br><br>About 15 patients die each year waiting for a liver and about three patients die each year waiting for a heart.<br><br>In July 2004, Hota was amended to state that kidneys, livers, hearts and corneas suitable for transplant may be removed from all Singaporeans and permanent residents upon their death, unless they have opted out.<br><br>Only Muslims are exempted. They must opt in if they want to donate their organs.<br><br>In a New Paper poll of 150people aged 21 to 29 years, 25 said they would opt out.<br><br>They were asked the following questions:<br><br>1. Would you opt out now? Why?<br><br>2. Have any of you opted in before the age of 21? Why?<br><br>3. Do you talk about it among your friends?<br><br>4. What is the main concern you have?<br><br>Of those who said that they would opt out, the main reason was that they were just not comfortable about the idea of giving away their organs.<br><br>None of them opted in before the age of 21. And only 32 had discussed the issue with friends and family.<br><br>Mr Benny Tan, an undergraduate who is turning 21 this year, said: 'I will opt out because I do not know how my organs will help others, whether it will be beneficial to the right people.<br><br>'There is the possibility that my organs may land up in a bad person's body.'<br><br>Ms Jennifer Chew, 26, a business consultant, said: 'I don't think of the issue a lot because I'm still young and have no health problems.<br><br>'If I need an organ, I would probably travel overseas and buy one or get a loved one to donate.'<br><br>She argued that if she was really at death's door, no one would 'jian si bu jiu' (Mandarin for seeing someone dying and refusing to help).<br><br>But isn't that exactly what she's doing to others by opting out?<br><br>'I will probably be more willing to donate one kidney to someone dear to me than sign away my organs to strangers,' she said.<br><br>One of her concerns, which was echoed by many others, was that their organs might be harvested before they are really dead.<br><br>Ms Chew said: 'If I stay in, doctors might be more willing to declare me dead in order to harvest my organs in the optimum time. What if I'm not really dead? I can't get over that.'<br><br>Ms May Yeo, 27, an accountant, said: 'I just don't feel it's right for me. In the old system, I would be one of those who would not opt in.<br><br>'Now, I have to be one of those who would opt out. Things would have been easier for me in the old system.<br><br>'It's a decision that I've recently made because I don't like the idea of my body being incomplete and cut up when I die.'<br><br>Among those who would not opt out - thankfully still the majority - a top reason for most was apathy.<br><br>Said Mr Boh Xun Hui, 21, a student: 'From the way they implement it, it is troublesome to opt out of the scheme.<br><br>'Anyway, I don't mind donating my organs. If you need organs one day, you would also hope people will donate them to you.'<br><br>Mr Lim Lian Kiat, 21, a student, is worried that he might change his mind.<br><br>He said: 'I have yet to reply the letter. My main concern currently is the inability to change my decision should something happen, like if I end up in a coma after an accident. (Then) it will be too late.'<br><br>Mr Bernard Tan, 28, a research analyst, also has fears - about going into the hospital and not coming out alive.<br><br>He said: 'I recently had a procedure done in hospital. In the middle of the night, when I was in a bit of pain, the thought occurred to me that if something were to happen, and I had not opted out, doctors might not fight so hard to save me in order to harvest my organs.'<br><br>An MOH spokesman said that a person who is brain dead is truly and unequivocally dead.<br><br>'A person who is brain dead will never wake up nor regain consciousness. And there are extremely stringent safeguards in place to ensure mistakes don't happen,' said the spokesman.<br><br>'The Ministry's theme for Hota has always been that it's a 'gift of life', because we recognise that it is a gift by the individual who has the potential to save lives.'<br><br>The question for those who opt out remains: What to do if you are at the bottom of the list for donor organs when you most need one?<br><br>Not everyone will be able to go abroad to buy an organ.<br><br>Not everyone will have a loved one willing to donate a kidney or part of a liver.<br><br>Mr Bernard Tan said: 'Would it be too late for me to opt back in then?'<br><br>It might well be.<br><br>'So I'm damned if I do and damned if I don't? Maybe I will think about it a bit more. If I can get over my fear, I will stay in,' he said.<br><br></div>

There could be numerous doubts in our minds. And then how about the decision to stay-in purely as "insurance" that you may need the donation one day? I think it is not a good attitude like that..... Like being :forced" to stay-in....<br><br>One point of concern is that how many who stay in actually know they can opt out? Those who receive mailers and can read - yes. How about the others?<br><br>I have no ready solution to the problem but I cannot accept it at face value when they say that they will ensure zero mistakes. How many times zero mistakes situations have given rise to problems? More than once is already intolerable. Do we claim a zero mistake medical industry right now? I doubt so....</div></blockquote>That's essentially what's wrong with our country. Everything is run on an all-or-nothing basis. I do not trust and will not trust a ministry spokesperson or even the minister to say that there are zero mistakes. They have not inspired trust in me at all.<br><br>I will decide where my organs go to, not any stat board. You cannot have your cake and eat it. The current media blitz in the New Paper by the MOH is simply a result of an increasing number of people opting out. One must understand that opting out of HOTA DOES NOT MEAN you are against ORGAN DONATION. It simply means that you retain CONTROL over who and what you choose to donate. We cannot use the language of efficiency when we deal with dying patients. It is anathema to the Hippocratic Oath.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Its fair isnt it? Cmon dun tell me you opt out and still expect to be first in the queue?So many people needs organs every day and since you choose not to be in the policy, and they inform you while you are healthy that you will not be prioritised and you made your choice, why complain? Its like you buy the cheapest ticket and expect to sit in the most expensive seats?</div>
