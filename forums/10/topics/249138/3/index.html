Sometimes we get the good stuff while others get the bad. If we get the bad stuff, perhaps we should stop worrying about it and move on.

I feel coerced into this situation whereby my human rights are hinged slightly towards being eroded. Humans, emotions are not clear cut issues that can be easily dictated.<br><br>The innocent man jailed for a crime he did not commit, years later, upon release, have no future and nothing much to look forward to, after years of wrongful imprisonment... does he not have a right to feel sore? But does he have any proper recourse? Nope. This issue was brought up and it is of the view that if there were recourse for such instances... it would put enormous pressure on the courts during trial etc....<br><br>I am just saying that when dealing with people, we all have our rights and it is simply difficult to reconcile that our rights are like "removed" by statue. I did not say that the Act has no merits BUT more like that its merits are not so easily achieved by merely making it a part of law. The true merit in the system must be equitable and accountable. We do not yet have the "accountable" side of their story except that they say they will be vigilant. Now we all know that vigilance is not 100% prevention.<br><br>I am saying that in situations where we cannot be guaranteed results, we should be treated fairly too. It is not without cause that people worry about the program and how it will implemented. The voice of the masses should be heard.<br><br>If we all accepted the logical reasons put forth to us by our government without thought, it just seems that our nation has forgotton how to think. Therefore there will always be opposing views. Especially when it boils down to matters concern delicate people lives and health.<br><br>I for one am not an uncompassionate person, I dare say so. But that does not mean that I donate to every single tissue paper peddler.... I just feel that a law like that is like a leaky cauldron.

            <div class='col-md body'>actually there is something i want to voice out...<br>why is the government obliged to help people with organ failure? there are old people on the streets who doesnt receive aid and suffering. so does it make sense to draft out an act just to aid those with organ failure? is it simply because there is more money in this enterprise, so they enacted HOTA? For the deceased's family, do they receive money for the organs? Do the recipients of the organs pay for the organ?<br><br>well i read some rather dark articles in sbf suggesting that much of the organs obtained from HOTA goes to those wealthy one who came singapore for transplant and are willing to pay good money for them. But honestly, i hate to think that some person out there is profiting from the organs they obtain for free</div>
