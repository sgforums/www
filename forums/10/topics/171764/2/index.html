Because SMRT does not have any overseas biz, making it limited for any growth<br><br>SBS drivers going across JB? Well, it is all because new player Handal Indah needs new drivers, so they tried to give higher wages which ended up them charging most ex fares in JB in between 4 operators</div>

It's like david trying to broker a deal with the giants and goliaths. Ultimately, if the private bus companies refuse to negotiate, what can they do? Issue a meaningless statement? There are two sides of the fence they are aiming to please. It's an almost impossible task, given the huge demands on both sides.<br></div>
