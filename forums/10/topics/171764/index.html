            <div class='col-md body'>extracted from ST forum.<br><br>I REFER to the article, 'School bus fares going up by $5 to $10 next month' (ST, Dec 2<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">.<br><br>Being a secondary school student, I get to enjoy the convenience of taking a school bus every day only because an affiliated primary school shares my school's premises.<br><br>However, the bus pick-up time is set according to the dismissal time of the primary school, and I have to take public transport home because my school day ends much later.<br><br>Nonetheless, I still pay a hefty $80 a month for just the one-way trip to school. This is the same as what the primary school pupils pay for a two-way trip.<br><br>I see no valid reason to raise bus fares for secondary school students like myself, who have been paying twice as much all this while.<br><br>I understand that as an industry body, the School Transport Association is concerned about rising operational costs. However, raising fares serves only to shift the problem to the families of affected students.<br><br>Perhaps $5 may not seem like a substantial amount, but it adds to the financial burden of average income earners.<br><br>I would also like to highlight the poor condition of some school buses.<br><br>While the majority I see on the roads are new and spacious, some, like the one I take every day, are old and in need of constant repair. In this case, I do not think it is fair to charge students taking these buses the same fare as those taking the new ones.<br><br>The School Transport Association should first focus on providing good service, and that includes charging reasonable fares, before thinking about raising them.<br><br>Gloria Cheng Hui Min (Miss)<br></div>

I don't think so..<br><br>No fare increase....how to increase pay of drivers especially when fuel prices are going up? If we want cheap fares despite rising fuel and maintenance costs, we will have to cut salaries.

Such increases by business cartels e.g. insurances are actually subjected to supply and demand equations or market conditions.<br><br>However, since minister has for some unfathomable reason already sided with SBS fare increases earlier including preemptive  fare increases soon after recessions now he will naturally want to let private transport companies increase their own fares as such increases especially on the ground of oil price hikes can in a way justify his earlier SBS preemptive fare increases. (despite making good profits)<br><br>This is a justification exercise Singapore style - to cover for earlier mistake instead of solving problems proactively to justify earlier SBS fare increases as not wrong.<br><br>If private transport companies are to lose monies normally it was not the minister's business to step in the past to intervene. Now because of his earlier strange support for SBS fare increases, he would have to try some way to justify private transport increasing fares as that move will justify his own earlier SBS fare increases.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The issue comes to how much profits are they making right?<br><br>Let's put it frank, they have raised the fares, yet their profit has dropped... Why?<br><br>Partly is the higher diesel coses, another issue is govt making a din...<br><br>They want to reduce Malaysian drivers driving SBS bus, so to get more ppl, they increased the wages by 100%, creating higher cost for bus ops...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I would rather think that the reason why minister will intervene in supporting transport fare increases is to protect GLCs like SMRT to make profits. Temasek has a lot of clout in such matter or decision because of government being into business. It is no longer a localized issue like SBS bus drivers going across to work for Johore transport companies.</div>
