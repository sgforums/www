              <p>In the 1963 GE, LIE KY cheated again. The Barisan was leading by a
              landslide in the counting, in &gt;30 constituencies out of the ~50.
              Then, PM LIE KY caused an electricity ‘blackout’ around the City Hall
              counting centre, ordered everyone out, and changed the votes. After 6
              hours, when electricity was ‘restored’, LIE ‘won’ by a landslide. Go to
              the National Library and check the microfilms of all the Chinese and
              English newspapers then...</p>

              <p><br>5. Some may think cheating elections or stealing elections dont
              matter as long as Singapore is a ’success’. Is it? All that SG is, is a
              Huge Bubble that will burst one day, probably in this Recession.
              Property bubbles are deadly, as proven throughout the world in many
              countries. Japan lost a dozen years. The US is now collapsing.</p>
              <p>Our own
              property bubble, since the so-called Asset Enhancement Policy, saw
              prices of HDB flats being inflated to unbelievable and unsustainable
              levels.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> HDB pays its contractors ~$30,000 to construct a 4-room HDB
              flat, as proven in newspaper tender notices, but charges nowadays some
              &gt;S$640,000 for a 4-room.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p>Can this énhancement policy’ continue
              indefinitely? The Americans will tell you not. So this decades-long
              bubble will burst. Maybe this Recession. And it will wipe out billions
              from the over-inflated property market. There will be no ásset
              enhancement’. No such thing as a free lunch.<br><br>6. All this
              unbelievable inflation of HDB prices is done simply by using the
              HDB-CPF nexus. A cunning arrangement in which firstly, the HDB
              monopolises the property market [in which 85% of us live] so can charge
              anything it wan<span style="text-decoration: underline;">ts. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Then, the CPF withholds ~35% of every paycheque and
              since we cannot use it for anything, we then sign it away for our HDB
              flat.</span> </strong></span>Clever, no? This means we get a flat but no money for retirement.</p>
              <p>As long as the ásset enhancment’ continues to raise prices, we can feel
              smug that our theoretical and paper HDB flat worth is rising. But at
              &gt;$640,000 for a 4-room now, the end is nigh. When the prices cannot
              be increased further, the music stops and everybody stops dancing.</p>

              <p>Cheating or not, let's show some proof, willya? Or can I claim that yer O level cert, diploma or degree whatever is fake too? Sheesh, what do you take Singaporeans for - fools?</p>
              <p>Next, if you ask a Malaysian if their properties should be worth $100,000 or just $10,000, they will tell you it is worth less than $10,000 and it is true. Don't even need to ask an american. You know why?</p>
              <p>Use your hate driven mind to think for once! Their bloody land is so big that if one developer attempts to sell higher price, the next developer will simply just buy up the land next door and sell just slightly lower. THEY HAVE SO MUCH EMPTY LAND! DO USE YOUR BRAINS!</p>
              <p>Look at Singapore - so small, so popular, we had to build skywards! We are an entreport to boot as well, so we do need people for trade. What's more, with our rational economic policies to provide better paying jobs for our own citizens, we self created an industrial zone here on this tiny miraculous island to attract industries with cheap foriegn labour.</p>
              <p>So, all in all, if you expect the property bubble burst, i believe you will have better luck that Mt Everest being ice free today. Property corrections will occur, but no where even near where US, Malaysia, Australia will face.</p>
              <p>But enjoy fooling your fellow clowns whom thinks like you and hope HDB price will drop to $30,000 per 4 room unit. Believe me, if that happens, it will shoot right back to above $300,000 the next day with the amount of people clamouring to own one now.</p>

              <p>Two years later, in 1961, the left-wing of the People's Action Party, led by <strong>Lim Chin Siong</strong>,
              broke away, and established its own party, the Barisan Sosialis
              (Socialist Front).</p>

              after the split an agreement was announced, in August 1961, for the
              future merger of Singapore and Malaya. The Barisan Sosialis opposed
              merger and sought to test its strength in elections to be held in 1963.<br><br><em><span style="font-size: 85%;">(

              were leaders of the Barisan Sosialis including <strong>Lim Chin Siong</strong> and <strong>Dr Lim Hock Siew</strong> as well as newspaper editors, trade unionists and university students.
              Despite this the Barisan was still able to <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>obtain 33.5% of the votes</strong></span></span> in

              <p>Blackouts were common in the 60s right up till the 70s, thanks to the corrupt Brit and local administrators with their blind eye to shoddy workmanship and planning ( whom had sold our Christmas Island to Australia for a few measely bucks).</p>
              <p>Is that your 'proof' ?  C'mon..do we look like a bunch of kids to you?!</p>
              <p>What next proof you're gonna use? black spots in the liver of sacrificed fowls? Thunder and lightning signs after the elections? Shooting and falling stars seen post elections?</p>
              <p>How long more do you want to play with circumstantial allegations and be played back? But do have your mindless fun. Each uses his freedom of speech as seen fit i suppose.</p>

              <p><br>Was LKY such a small fry in 1963 - when he had stepped into political office in 1957 taking over the seat of Internal Self-Government from Lim Yew Hock ?</p>

              <p>It came as such a "'God-send' co-incidence" for the Singapore Government, when negotiations between HDB and the large squatter population came to a dead-lock.</p>
              <p>The fire cleared the squatters out without any compensations being given, and the 16,000 homeless were dispersed and resettled in recently completed HDB units located in Queenstown and St. Michael areas, and had to pay for their new first generation HDB units.</p>
              <p>Whether it was arson or an accident, it remained a mystery.

              <p>How did this electrical cable become a problem at such a co-incidental time when the squatter colony had to be cleared, and when compensation negotiations became deadlocked ?</p>
              <p>With the fire burning all evidence to ash and the fire investigators not having the many sophisticated tools available today, the fire continue to be a mystery due to disinterest from the government to pursue the matter.</p>

              <p>Again very sensational story to catch audience attention. </p>
              <p>For the 1997 GE, the heaviest fight took place in my school then, ITE Bishan.  Several of my Training Officers are invovled that day.   That night all the opposition supporters from Potong Pasir, Hougang joined forces &amp; assemble in ITE Bishan school field.  There are 2 entrance, the front gate is for PAP supporters while the side gate is for oppostion.  The 2 groups were divided into 2 lanes on the field.  There wre not enough Police Task Force (Riot Police) then.  The PTF stood in the middle of the 2 groups.  As the results were delayed then expected, the crowd got impatient &amp; the opposition started throwing missiles onto the PAP &amp; PTF.  The delay was caused by recount &amp; unexpected downtime of fax machine.  Recount is required to ensure that all the votes are counted correctly especially it is a hotly contested ward.  The counting agents from both PAP &amp; Opp were briefed, updated reqularly during the process.  In addition, the counting agents were inspecting the couting freely.</p>
              <p>The opposition know they are going to lose.  But is their supporter refused to accept the fact.  Their counting agents from Opposition told JBJ group that the PAP received more votes.  The opp supporters start to turn violent.  They took chairs from our canteen  &amp; started to throw at the PAP.  A couple of PAP supported bleed then.</p>
              <p>Several opp supporter were arrested on the spot but they were ordered to be release immediately to prevent a misconception that Police is siding with PAP.  I remeber when I returned to school the next day, it was a total mess.  Our school cafeteria changed all the chairs after the election,</p>
              <p>From then on, all election results were centralised controlled and will be released "Live" from Election Department.  Both PAP &amp; Opp supporter can only wait for results in prescribe sports stadiums.</p>

              <p><br>So what i'm getting is that since LKY is allegedly responsible for the fire(No charges, no evidence, not to mention that he didn't have anywhere near the amount of power he has now) and he would then, by logic be capable of committing vote fraud?</p>
              <p>Am i the only person that sees a couple of holes in the logic?</p>
