            <div class='col-md body'><br>It appears GMS and I are not the only persons raising the view that casino is a bad  idea  economically.  The following article from a Mr Yeoh raised some of the same issues we raised here.  A note is that the writer is Director of Economics and Strategy at the Government of  Singapore Investment Corporation (GIC) and Vice-President of the Economic Society of Singapore (ESS).<br><br>I hope the public will review this article carefully and rethink the economic benefit of having a casino.<br><br>Note:  This is an information post only, not a discussion thread.<br><br>=============================================<br><br>Dec 17, 2004<br>Casinos: Economic costs as big as any benefits<br><br>By Yeoh Lam Keong<br>For The Straits Times<br><br>THE integrated casino resort project (ICR) has been proposed<br>principally to re-energise Singapore's flagging tourism industry.<br><br>On its surface, the model looks seductive. Only 30 to 50 per cent of<br>the project is supposed to be centred on gaming. The bulk of the<br>revenues from the $2 billion investment, we are told, should, as in<br>Atlantis or Las Vegas, come from an alluring infrastructure of<br>high-end hotels, world-class entertainment, restaurants and convention<br>facilities that would also synergistically benefit tourism as a whole.<br><br>Surely, the argument goes, if through ingenious regulation we can<br>contain the worst excesses of the ICR's acknowledged social ills, we<br>should be willing to step outside the box of our traditional caution<br>and give it a spin?<br><br>The fact that Thailand, Korea and Macau are all planning to deregulate<br>and/or further attract investment in this area gives added urgency to<br>the project. Do we want to be left behind? Should we not, as Associate<br>Professor Winston Koh of SMU, and others, have argued, also establish<br>ourselves as serious players in the mega gaming/tourism sector?<br><br>Tempting<br><br>LIKE its high rolling namesake, the ICR project looks tempting. A much<br>darker picture, however, emerges if one looks at its economic costs.<br><br>First, while the benefits are potentially large (Prof Koh estimates<br>the ICR can add 0.3 to 1 per cent of GDP), the costs are equally big.<br>Cost benefit studies of Australia's experience in gaming estimate a<br>sum of between A$1.8 billion (S$2.3 billion) and A$5.6 billion on both<br>the benefits and costs sides of the ledger.<br><br>Australian Productivity Commission (APC) listed the following among<br>the main costs: Bankruptcy, loss of work productivity, job losses,<br>police incidents, court cases, divorce and violence. The impact on<br>family dysfunction and breakdown is obvious.<br><br>The APC found that 96 per cent of problem gamblers suffered from<br>depression, 58 per cent have considered suicide and 14 per cent had<br>attempted it. Half spent over 50 per cent of their income on their vice.<br><br>Problem gamblers may constitute only a tiny minority - typically, 1<br>per cent to 2 per cent of any population, according to Australian and<br>American studies. But the multiplier effects of their pathology can be<br>large. In Singapore, potentially 40,000 to 60,000 people may become<br>problem gamblers. But between 120,000 and 180,000 family members may<br>be indirectly harmed by their vice.<br><br>Economist call such impact 'negative externality'. The market is<br>ill-suited in valuing 'non-price goods' or in regulating the negative<br>social effects of certain kinds of economic activity. We know, for<br>example, that it cannot satisfactorily price the benefits of 'clean<br>air' or a 'green environment' or prevent pollution reaching excessive<br>levels without regulation.<br><br>Similarly, the market cannot adequately price or limit the impact of<br>gambling-related depression, poverty or suicide on a family. What is<br>the true cost of family dysfunction and breakdown? The counselling<br>charges paid by pathological gamblers hardly captures the full cost.<br><br>For this reason, economists who have done cost-benefit analyses of<br>gaming have argued that its costs have been badly understated. Most<br>analyses, using conservative estimates, have found the costs outweigh<br>the benefits.<br><br>Can regulation reduce these costs? Can limiting access to casinos to<br>high-rolling tourists or to rich citizens, for example, reduce the<br>number of problem gamblers? Can't Singapore have its cake and eat it too?<br><br>Unfortunately, the economics of the gaming industry work against this.<br><br>To begin with, the bulk of most casinos' clientele tend to be local<br>residents - usually 70 per cent to 80 per cent even in<br>tourist-intensive locations like Australia or Genting, in Malaysia.<br>Atlantis and Las Vegas, which rely principally on non-residents or<br>foreign tourists, are not at all typical examples.<br><br>In Singapore's case, the greater the regulation of locals, the greater<br>will be the implicit 'tax' on its ICR as compared to less regulated<br>regional gaming establishments. Over time, the more intense the<br>regional competition gets, the more financially unviable will local<br>regulation become. After sinking more than $2 billion into such a<br>project, there is likely to be increasing pressure to relax or dilute<br>restrictions on local clientele so the ICR can be competitive with<br>other casinos in the region, subject to fewer restrictions. The<br>financial viability of the local casino may require the acceptance of<br>high levels of local misery.<br><br>Unseen threat<br><br>IN ADDITION, the ICR, by its very nature, will pose an unseen threat<br>to the very tourism infrastructure it is designed to energise. This is<br>because ICR-type operations typically subsidise the hotel,<br>entertainment and other facilities attached to the casino. Often, such<br>facilities barely break even or may even lose money, but the project<br>as a whole is supported by the gaming profits from the clientele that<br>such facilities draw.<br><br>If the ICR is extremely successful, there may be a positive spillover<br>into nearby hotels, restaurants, pubs or entertainment venues. But<br>this would be the rare and lucky case. Statistically, 30 to 40 per<br>cent of gaming facilities fail, with a large proportion surviving, but<br>not very well.<br><br>It is in these more common cases that the ICR could become a Trojan<br>horse, with a potentially destructive impact on the local hospitality<br>industry because of its massive non-gaming infrastructure. Being<br>heavily subsidised, these facilities could damage surrounding hotels,<br>entertainment venues or convention places. Around Sky City, Auckland,<br>for example, hotel rates have fallen around 10 per cent due to<br>competition from the casino's cheap subsidised hotels.<br><br>In a booming hospitality industry with already high occupancy rates,<br>this negative impact might be small. But with significant excess<br>capacity, flagging tourist arrivals and already thin profit margins,<br>the effect could be a harmful diversion of trade, loss of existing<br>jobs and bankruptcies. Unfortunately, this is likely to be the<br>situation we face today.<br><br>More worryingly, the subsidised infrastructure of the ICR could act as<br>a distorting barrier to entry and investment in the high-end segment<br>of the hospitality and convention industry that Singapore is seeking<br>to develop further.<br><br>Such potential negative impacts typically do not feature in standard<br>cost-benefit analyses. They are, rather, hidden financial and economic<br>risks that are inherent in the nature of the ICR project itself.<br><br>Given these risks, to describe the ICR as an 'option' that Singapore<br>might like to buy, as some of its defenders have described it, may be<br>misleading. Instead, the project is perhaps more accurately<br>characterised, in financial market parlance, as the selling of an<br>'uncovered option'. Besides the certain social costs and the big<br>initial investment involved in purchasing this 'option', the total<br>losses to the economy as a whole could be unexpectedly large,<br>open-ended and extend over an indefinite time horizon, as in the case<br>of the sale of an 'uncovered option' gone wrong.<br><br>Considering these risks, the question of whether there are alternative<br>projects that could fulfil the same tourism objectives as the ICR<br>naturally arise.<br><br>Here, one cannot help but feel that Hong Kong has chosen a better<br>direction with its West Kowloon Cultural District (WKCD) development<br>project.<br><br>The proposed mega development will cost $5 billion and is designed to<br>enhance Hong Kong's position as Asia's premiere centre for the arts,<br>culture and entertainment. The WKCD is also expected to generate 8,500<br>permanent new jobs.<br><br>That is better than the 1,500 to 4,000 jobs that the Singapore ICR is<br>estimated to provide, with positive rather than negative social<br>effects and genuine benefit to related service industries.<br><br>Just as importantly, together with Disneyworld, the WKCD could help<br>brand Hong Kong as the leading family-friendly, sophisticated Asian<br>international tourist destination. By comparison, what impact on<br>Singapore's branding would the ICR have?<br><br>Would we not be diluting our tourism branding by moving closer to the<br>niches occupied by gaming cities like Las Vegas and Macau? Is this<br>what we want as a key part of our tourism strategy, let alone in<br>setting the tone for Singapore's social policy?<br><br>ICR proponents argue that gambling of all sorts is already rampant in<br>Singapore. Professor Peter Collins, Director of the Centre for the<br>Study of Commercial Gaming in Britain, estimates that gambling per<br>capita in Singapore is already among the highest in the world.<br><br>Establishing an ICR, its proponents argue, could capture some of the<br>business now lost to cruises and foreign casinos, and raise tax<br>revenues that can be used for social good as well as to rehabilitate<br>the worst effects of problem gambling.<br><br>Regulation<br><br>FRANKLY, I find this argument rather weak. The existing scale of<br>gambling is primarily determined by social policy and regulation<br>rather than dictated by local consumer taste.<br><br>In regulated France, for example, spending on gaming forms only 1.3<br>per cent of GDP. Compare this to a similarly rich, but less regulated<br>country like Japan, where 'pachinko' gaming turnover alone forms a<br>whopping 6.7 per cent of GDP.<br><br>Unlike Japan, Singapore is not desperate for alternative fiscal revenues.<br><br>To my mind, the admittedly high existing per capita spending on<br>gambling in Singapore is not an argument for establishing yet another<br>gaming venue in the form of a legal high-end casino.<br><br>Rather, it is a much stronger argument for a careful review of<br>regulation of existing gaming facilities - including legal 4D,<br>'football clubs' with their gaming machines and illegal gambling - as<br>well as of the adequacy of counselling, education and community<br>support for existing problem gamblers.<br><br>Although superficially compelling, the ICR project, with its dark and<br>hidden costs, is a Faustian bargain. And as with most such bargains,<br>the devil lurks in the details.<br><br>The writer is Director of Economics and Strategy at the Government of<br>Singapore Investment Corporation (GIC) and Vice-President of the<br>Economic Society of Singapore (ESS). The views expressed here are his<br>own and do not represent those of either the GIC or the ESS.<br><br>The integrated casino resort project: Weighing the scales<br><br>PROS:<br><br># Only 30 to 50 per cent of the project is centred on gaming. The bulk<br>of the revenues from the $2 billion investment should come from the<br>supporting infrastructure of hotels, entertainment, restaurants and<br>convention facilities.<br><br># Since gambling of all sorts is already rampant in Singapore, setting<br>up an ICR could capture some of the business now lost to cruises and<br>foreign casinos, and raise tax revenues that can be used for social<br>good as well as to rehabilitate the worst effects of problem gambling.<br><br>CONS:<br><br># While the benefits are potentially large, the costs are equally big.<br>There could be bankruptcy, loss of work productivity, job losses,<br>police incidents, court cases, divorce and violence.<br><br># The subsidised infrastructure of the ICR could act as a distorting<br>barrier to entry and investment in the very high-end segment of the<br>hospitality and convention industry that Singapore is actively seeking<br>to further develop.<br><br>Copyright Â© 2004 Singapore Press Holdings.
