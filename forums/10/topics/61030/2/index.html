            <div class='col-md body'>The crux of the issue is not so much that SIA diverted a plane to "rescue" the wife of SM Lee but rather that she was given preferential treatment while in london.<br><br>It is pretty obvious that she jumped the queue for a CT Scan otherwise 10 downing street won't have to come out strongly and explain anything. And frankly, if i were a brit, so would i. How come my own govt is extending special treatment to an outsider rather than help their own citizens?<br><br>On the other hand, it's obvious that any head of state or thereof would be given red carpet treatment if an identical incident were to happen in a foreign nation.<br><br>It's the perk of being a former leader. We should instead acknowledge the fact that SM Lee WILL BE paying for all the medical expenses (and SIA's compensation i expect)<br><br>If you need an example, just look at all the ex-presidents of the United States - they are still given a small cadre of secret service guards after they leave office for protection.</div>

However, they are not doing it for free. They are rewarded handsomely for their job.   In fact, a Singapore minister or even an MP's pay is one of the highest in the world!  The rationale? to erradicate corruption!  So there, it is a fair transaction. One gets paid for a  job well done. One should also pay for a good service rendered, full stop!</div>

He is like an icon for singapore, a lengendary person. Maybe u guys feel he doesn't deserve it etc, but u got to agree he is one of the most, if not the most famous person in singapore now. After many years when he is gone, people will still remember him. And he indeed had done a lot of things. U may say he had also made a lot of lousy policies or anyone taking over his shoes will perform better. However one will never know wat will really happened if some other person take over his job. We cannot disclaim all his credit away.<br><br>Thus now her wife got a stroke, which is a very serious matter. Thus now I pose this question<br><br>1) Shall we treat them like normal citizens, not giving them any special priviledges or rights even if he is a minister<br><br>2) We give him some additional powers and priviledges due to his status.

Although his portfolio now is minister, however he is not just any minister.
