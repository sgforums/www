            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by snow leopard:</div><div class="quote_body">you want everyone to report graffitti on toilet doors? that is a serious problem for our authorities to attend to? come to think about it, there is so much less graffiti here (racial or otherwise) compared to those in the western countries, so even when comparing toilets, you can say racism is so much milder here</div></blockquote>actually, to be very honest? I've seen more graffiti on the back of Sg cubicle doors than UK. So i don't think u can say that..<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by snow leopard:</div><div class="quote_body">it is robotic to stick to definitions without understanding meaning and context. racism of the kind we commonly think of, that leads to assault and savagery is miles apart from racist attitudes manifested in toilet graffitti. and as far as i can see, interaction within our society is thankfully devoid of the kind of racist savagery you see in the west.<br><br>you don't get it. no one's reading from the newspapers. we're speaking from experiences and experiences tell us that that the unfriendly stare you mentioned is virtually non-existent here but are perhaps more prevalent where you are now.</div></blockquote>without definations, how can u even classify what is racism? We need definations or anything can be racism and anything can also not be racism. Perhaps we need to remember that the problem with UK, one which I definately find a problem, is that crime rate is higher, especially violent crime. When within a society, violent crime is more common, so does this become a manifestation not only for racism, but also for sexism, religionism, homophobia, and other discriminatory attitudes.<br><br>The bottomline is, as long as there are such racist attitudes within people, whether they manifest themselves as cases of violence where u can easily identify a victim and a culprit, or as cases of "mild" action where its hard to identify a victim and culprit, and thus harder to act on, people WILL be affected by it, their quality of life lowered, and hurt will happen. It doesn't matter HOW racism is manifested. As long as it is manifested in some way, it must be treated with the strictest authority.<br><br>And that unfriendly stare u are talking about? Its prevalent in Singapore alright. U just need to know where to go. Any non-malay who got stared at by a gang of Malay teens late at night walking along HDB void decks, or non-chinese who got "tiao" by a bunch of chinese ah bengs n lians, can testify to.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by snow leopard:</div><div class="quote_body">i disagwee, you should reinterpret what you are reading. firstly, the explanation racism is divided into 1 and 2. normally that means there are two meanings or two levels to look at it. hence while a belief of racial superiority is indeed racism it exists only at a very basic level. item 2 is what we normally would consider racism, the kind that makes up the 400 figure. so contrary to what you're saying, i think i correctly apply context and meaning to subtle differences in the meaning of the word.</div></blockquote>Sorry I disagree as well. I do not think the definations are mutually exclusive. They are mutually inclusive. And if u agree that a belief or attitude is racism, then no matter how basic a level u believe it to be, it still counts as racism. Item 2 is not what I normally consider racism. I consider racism as inclusive of both 1 and 2. And I don't tolerate either. I don't see why we should have to tolerate one and not the other. As long as 1 exists, 2 will always be manifested in some severity.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by snow leopard:</div><div class="quote_body">even so, by how much do they count? does scribbling on the wall count nearly as much as racial assaults?</div></blockquote>Ok while I agree with u that based on an individual case level, comparing ONE case of wall scribbling to ONE case of assault would make an assault more serious. But if u look at it from a wider social pt of view, an assault is actually easier to crack down on, as there are definative victims and culprits. In the case of scribblings, they are not only more widespread, it is harder to identify AND quantify the number of victims AND culprits, and it is virtually impossible to act on it. In fact because there is virtually no way we can act on the scribblings, they end up foistering more covert racist hatred. I have to wonder why racist hatred simmering quietly under the surface can be said to be any better than racist hatred sporadically bursting into the open. Just like forest fires, what u can see, u can fight. What u can't see, such as underground peat fires, not only u can't fight, it can burst into life at the least expected moment, and cause more damage than anyone ever imagined.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by snow leopard:</div><div class="quote_body">please lah, the dictionary merely defines words, it does not assign gravity to different meanings of the same word nor is smart enough to apply them in context. so you're quite off the ball on this subject really.</div></blockquote>I hold the view that be it racist attitudes, or racist actions, both are VERY damaging, and in fact, as a racist attutude is the bedrock of racist actions, we should be wary more of racist attitudes more than racist actions, regardless of what is defined by the dictionary.<br><br></div>

From young we are taught we cannot fight or hit others. And we are stricter with discipline. Thats what makes a difference, with regards to all violent crime, racially motivated or not. I bet if the people here were stricter with their kids, the number of racial assaults would go down too. But does that mean racism is really lowered? I don't think so. So neither do I think that a lack of racial assaults means there is no racism in sg.</div>

This shows that racism is also existing amongst the minorities. Surely this is not a good thing.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by snow leopard:</div><div class="quote_body">that's strange, i always make an attempt to say things like berupper or chukop when buying food at malay stalls. does my single non-racist annecdote negate those of the writer's? in other words, does he represent the experiences of every other minority?<br></div></blockquote>maybe maybe not. while i do question what he said about hawkers, because i haven't see that happen either, what he said about "Another thing obnoxious about the Chinese Singaporean is their absolute lack of sensitivity toward the minority races. When the conversation is in English, one person will just cut in and start speaking Mandarin so as to deliberately exclude minorities from the conversation." is true, because I have observed this quite a few times before. Of course many times others will remind the offender that there are non-chinese speakers around and remind them to be sensitive and use a common language. This is something that makes me feel heartened about the prospects of improvement of racism within singapore.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by snow leopard:</div><div class="quote_body">[/quote]wait a minute, didn't you say earlier that the UK govt encourages reports on racism? so we can't be crying racism too easily can we? easier than facilitated by the UK govt?<br></div></blockquote>yes we can. These are private grieviances, not proper official reports. If they think that they have been subject to racism, why not make a report? Perhaps they have an inkling that they don't actually have a case? I don't know.<br><br>Oh incidently I had my 1st slightly "racist" encounter yesterday. I was invited to a karaoke session by some HK people. The whole time it was cantonese songs and they all spoke cantonese except my friend who spoke english to me. How ironic that Chinese people can feel excluded by other Chinese, but I just choose to see it as due to them feeling uncomfortable conversing in English. Of course when you look at it, when even a fellow chinese feels excluded and "cliqued" out, u don't expect the whites to feel all warm and fuzzy about them. Then its easy for them to think that the whites are being racist against them.<br><br>To be honest, perhaps the problem in UK is more one of national identity, not racism.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by snow leopard:</div><div class="quote_body">from what was written, i have doubts about this guy's experiences and also wonder about his own racial attitudes. as such i would take it with a pinch of salt. racism is not serious here especially when there are better things to worry about like retrenchments, medical bills, cost of living ...<br></div></blockquote>Never underestimate the power of racism. I'm not actually saying its serious. I'm saying we should be concerned about it because its more serious than we think. To put this into perspective, for eg, I will say on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being most serious, Singapore's racism is not serious, meaning lower than 5. Lets say theoratically, its actual rating is 3. Most people in Singapore think its rating is only 1. This is what I mean by more serious than people think. Sure on an absolute scale, it might not be that serious, but it shouldn't be underestimated. And like I said, as long as the bedrock for racist actions exist, we should always be wary. Complacency is always one of the 1st factors leading to downfall.</div>

Whoever chooses to say thay I left as the grass is greener or that I am a quitter like the rest is so one-track.<br><br>Whatever it is, racism abounds everywhere and we all have to make do with it and focus on more important things in life. Just like there is good and bad in every country, there is also the downside in sillypore that we just have to bear with....<br><br>I will still have to work hard in the country I have pledged my allegiance to where there is wide open spaces, cheap cars and houses.

US Newyork then already had the state empire building in "which year was that"??? when sg were still a kampong island..<br><br>the differences were just too great.<br><br><blockquote><br>but Philips could never grow out of fluoresent lights and lost terribly against Matsu@&amp;$!a in the war for VCRs. now that oil prices are going sky high and energy conservation is becoming important, fluorescent lights may give way to LED lights. what then for Philips?<br><br>but germany wasn't the only country exposed to steam engines and planes. what about the country that invented steam engines? why wasn't great britain as successful as germany in heavy industry? opportunity isn't the only thing, character of a nation and its people matters more.<br><br>but Motorola and IBM were already giants before intel came along. surely it was more than just being there that led Intel to succeed where Motorola and IBM have failed?<br><br>Bill Gates and Steve Jobs were at a place and time when microprocessors were being introduced to the world.<br><br>so too were Word Perfect and Novell. yes bill and steve were at the right place and time but they were also the right persons.<br><br>nokia did not seize the GSM opportunity, it created it. conditions in finland were just right for mobile telephony to take root.<br><br>you can mention Nestle and ABB. all of europe is by and large expensive (from a SGD perspective not from a EURO perspective).<br></blockquote>agree.

Is Singapore being used here as a stepping stone to other western countires by this third world country immigrants to singapore??? what loyalty is there towards singapore among this 'Part Time Singaporeans'??? any statistics available on the number of this new' Part Time Singaporeans' moving on to other countires after receiving their Singapore citizenship???? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>any comments????<br><br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>what happened to the song we use to sing when we were kids...<br><br>This is my country<br>This is my land<br>This are my people<br>This are my friends<br>We are Singaporeans......<br><br>It saddens me greatly that I do not see those good old singaporeans around....what i see are new faces that i dont recognise....Do they have a place in the hearts and minds of us true singaporeans???...these new 'Part Time Singaporeans' are just prostituting our singapore passports in foreign countries for their own selfish gains!!!!<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>what struck me the most since my return to Singapore is that the various communities seem to be gradually drifting apart. There was a time one used to see lots of interaction among the various communities be it the chinese, malays and the indians. But now it seems to be the other way around. there are clear signs of communities drifting apart. I suspect it has greatly to do with the governments immigration policies. In their rush to bring in all this foreign nationals into singapore the government has failed to see the negative social impact on the local population such large number of migrants bring. Lets be honest most of the migrants from china and india come from societys where they've probably never been to school with students from different cultures. i doubt chinese nationals from china have ever had indians or malays living in their towns or cities or even having gone to school with students from different cultures. The same goes for the indians that are moving in from india to singapore. i doubt any of these 'new indians' ever had chinese or malay friends in their neighbourhoods and communities back in india.<br><br>so how do we expect these foreign nationals who migrate here and take up our singapore citizenship to integrate overnight into our original vibrant and multicultural community here in singapore??? its taken us an entire generation to bond the various communities together. do we seriously expect these 'New Part Time Singaporeans' to integrate and understand the dynamics of our various communities overnight? </div></blockquote></div>
