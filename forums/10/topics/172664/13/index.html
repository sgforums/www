            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by snow leopard:</div><div class="quote_body">yes you are right, i forgot about that. if you are consciously aware of people of different races beating one another up, then surely the ugliness of racism is pretty much severe there. the fact that i left out interracial abuses goes to show how unheard of racism amongst races occurs here. thus to include your new perspective, racism is extra mild here compared to those in UK.</div></blockquote>We do have a case here and there. The thing is, how do u classify a case where someone white is beaten up by an asian gang, but not because of race but because of robbery? There are many cases where asian gangs which roam the neighbourhood pick out lone victims at night to beat and rob them. These asian gangs don't form because everyone's of the same race, they form because geographically an area is settled with mostly asian families. If their victim happens to be white, we can only suspect racial motives but we cannot say for sure its main motivation is racial and not robbery. I am using such cases as an example of what MAY be seen as racial incidents, but even then they are not hard evidence of racism. For a matter of fact, if u want to use singapore as a comparism, how many gangs to begin with roam the streets at night? Any gathering of more than 4 is already illegal, I doubt if racists can band together to roam the streets at night if they wanted to. 2ndly, Uk's population is 20 times bigger than singapore's. U can't realistically expect not to hear about one or 2 such cases, its absurd to expect otherwise. So yes u can say that racism in Sg compared to UK is almost non-existant, but its circumstantial evidence, not hard evidence, due to the interferance of other factors making a fair comparism, at best unsuitable.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by snow leopard:</div><div class="quote_body">no it does not. a very mixed population (rojak in terms of foreigners, blacks, whites, browns, yellows whatever you like to include) will all else being equal, have a much higher incidence of racism compared to one that is relatively homogeneous. the fact that we're talking about a small english town that ought to be relatively homogeneously white suggests that 400 might be a tad too high a figure, regardless its per population figure.<br><br>rather than foreigner, since you like to include different races, minorities might be a better word then. </div></blockquote>actually, 1stly Plymouth is not exactly a small town. Its a fairly large and important costal city. 2ndly its a myth that today, most english cities are homogeneously white. In fact its safe to say a large percentage of each city are Asian/Indian. So according to your own logic, 400 in a city that is very rojak, is not a figure that is a tad too high. And yes minorities might be a better word, but its hard to classify what is considered a minority nowadays because the minorities are not "minority" anymore.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by snow leopard:</div><div class="quote_body">on the other hand, given all the alternative scenarios possible, your interpretation that it is not worse than it actually is, is also equally not evident.<br><br>if we include (if we're free enough to actually find out) the racial mix of that particular town (which i'm confident is pretty homogeneous) we actually have a better case to say that racism is indeed much uglier there than say here in singapore.</div></blockquote>In this case, the argument is that UK is extremely racist, so of course there must be hard evidence to support the argument. The hard evidence we have now supports the fact that there IS racism in UK(as there is of some sort in most countries), but the evidence does not support an "extremely racist theory" If we were to argue something new against an established base reason, then it calls for hard evidence to support the new hypothesis put forward, not for hard evidence to support what's already considered "the norm" because evidence has already been taken to extrapolate what we think and know now.<br><br>We must also understand that in a tiny authoritarian state such as Singapore, not only is it easy to have a "zero tolerance" policy towards racism, it is also very easy to enforce it. In fact, like I mentioned earlier, it is very easy to stamp out on many forms of racism because they effectively fall into subgroups under the main groups of illegal activities, such as illegal gatherings etc. Other illegal acts which are harder to enforce, such as vandalism, do show some racism exist in Singapore. I name one of the most common acts: scrawling behind toilet cubical doors. There have been many racial ep and insults written on the back of many a toilet door in Singapore before. Especially common in kopi tiams. Often combined with heterosexist and homophobic attitudes too. A generic example would be where someone writes "Indian/chinese boy looking for indian/chinese boy to suck c**k" and someone else would write below it "Who want to suck smelly chinese/indian c**k?" Lets admit it. This is one thing most of you guys have seen before. You of course won't expect such incidents to make it into the newspapers, therefore it doesn't stick in the mind of a media-centric modern society of today, but its there and its staring many of you in the face. Just because UK has a few well publicized incidents does not mean racism is extreme here.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by snow leopard:</div><div class="quote_body">in other words you're saying there may well be a lot more hidden racism cases here than in the UK. that may well be but observations suggest otherwise. racism on minorities is so unheard of i didn't even include it in the first place. there was a recent racial debate on the internet that eventually led to two chinese jailed. shows our govt stamps out racism much more strongly than in the uk (or the west in general), where you constantly hear abuses of iraqi soldiers.</div></blockquote>Racism on minorities is unheard of but only because there is no media exposure on minor incidents. For example, do u remember the file making it sway around where an ah beng calls a bangala and abuses him on the phone? Did that make it into the media? Did anyone report it to the police? Was there an investigation? I doubt it. Like I mentioned above, today's society is media-centric. If the media doesn't jump on it and publicize it, people don't notice it. Public opinion should be more than a matter of what makes it into the news and what doesn't. People should open their eyes and notice the small things which says more about the real state of affairs than a few major incidents. Remember your observations leading to your suggestions are based on publicized incidents, not no careful observation of the real world. I mean, think for a moment about what I said, about the toilet doors, and u have to admit it is quite true. How many of you would have even thought about it if I haven't raised the point though? We have to be careful not to let what we think be dictated by the media alone. It does a society no good to become lazy in forming our own opinions and just let the media feed us what they want us to hear. Afterall, we are all intelligent beings and are capable of our own observations. Sometimes, I will give u the understanding that perhaps each and everyone's daily grind can numb us to certain telling things in everyday life. Thats why I think its very interesting to do what I do. Find a nice place, like a cafe or a bench in the mall, sit down with a drink, and observe the way people behave around u. It is very interesting. Or, heh, read the vandalism written on the back of the cubicle door the next time u use it. Or if u sit at the back of the bus, read what the vandals have carved into the seats. U might notice a few more deep rooted sentiments Singaporeans dare not express openly.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Finally I will make the point again that Singapore is so small that it is easy to police effectively. Its not a case of "our govt stamps out racism much more strongly than in the uk"  because if u honestly look around on government sites, while racial harmony is a policy, u seldom see any campaigns encouraging people to report cases of racially-motivated crimes. We have raical harmony day once a year, sometimes its talked about, and people know the government's stand on it. But you don't see a campaign to encourage reporting of racist incidents. In the UK, u get that. So how do we compare which government stamps out racism much more strongly when you don't have a fair base for comparism? If ou follow UK news(watch the BBC, itv, Channel 4, and Five news daily, u will realise the Uk govt clamps down strongly on racism as well. Its easy to do a search on the net and find reports online, of racist incidents, but since you don't often look for the follow up because it takes a few months from the occurance of the incident to the trial and conviction, the general view, especially if you're not physically here, is that of the racial crimes committed, not many are actually closed with an arrest and conviction. But the reality is, there are arrests, there are convictions, more than u would realise because you're not here now, u don't get the exposure to the news here, and thus u miss out on critical bits of information. If we go by outright number of convictions for racial crimes, UK would actually beat Singapore, but of course its as unfair a comparism as it is to compare how tough a country is based on the widely publicized conviction of TWO people in a numerically small country. At best, I would say that both countries are very dedicated to stamping out racism and proper social education. It is impossible to say which one is more stringent on racial crimes due to too big a difference in population figures, as well as government types(authoritarian singapore and more liberal uk). We can be sure though, that both governments hold the view(publicly at least) of anti-racism, because afterall, it would be political suicide otherwise.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Anyways talking about racism in Singapore, another thread seems to have sprung up supporting my view that Singaporeans' opinions about racism tends to be dictated by what is publicized by the media than by what they can personally observe if they looked around more carefully. If u think about it, games played amongst friends such as "what colour is the turban" where u pinch a friend's arm until he says what colour the turban of the Sikh who is passing by is.<br><br><a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=180172" rel="nofollow">http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=180172</a><br><br>I must say I enjoy debating with you.

Have you yourself ever done anything against the govt for what you believe in? Have you put yourself at personal risk for what you believe in? Not all of us leave purely by choice. Sometimes, the only way to continue the battle for what one believes in, is to uproot yourself and leave. If Charles de Gaulles did not leave France and got himself killed at the hands of the Nazis, the French resistance might not have been so effective and the liberation of France might have come later. The point is that sometimes, for the greater good of one's nation, you have to move to a place where your opponents do not hold much power over you, and thus more able to easily silence you. Its easy for you to talk about being proud to be Singaporean, but for you, does being proud to be Singaporean means u meekly follow the government lines, or does it mean u stand up and do something about the things u believe in, for the good of the nation, even if that means u have to oppose the government, and put yourself at personal risk?</div>

The hard evidence we have now supports the fact that there IS racism in UK(as there is of some sort in most countries), but the evidence does not support an "extremely racist theory" If we were to argue something new against an established base reason, then it calls for hard evidence to support the new hypothesis put forward, not for hard evidence to support what's already considered "the norm" because evidence has already been taken to extrapolate what we think and know now.<br></strong><br><br>nope that wasn't my argument, perhaps it was with someone else.  i started off by saying it is pointless to say a country is or is not racist without some form of benchmark.  i chose singapore as the benchmark and the new evidence reinforces the notion that singapore's racist situation is so much milder compared to those in the uk.<br><br><strong><br>We must also understand that in a tiny authoritarian state such as Singapore, not only is it easy to have a "zero tolerance" policy towards racism, it is also very easy to enforce it. In fact, like I mentioned earlier, it is very easy to stamp out on many forms of racism because they effectively fall into subgroups under the main groups of illegal activities, such as illegal gatherings etc. Other illegal acts which are harder to enforce, such as vandalism, do show some racism exist in Singapore. I name one of the most common acts: scrawling behind toilet cubical doors. There have been many racial ep and insults written on the back of many a toilet door in Singapore before. Especially common in kopi tiams. Often combined with heterosexist and homophobic attitudes too. A generic example would be where someone writes "Indian/chinese boy looking for indian/chinese boy to suck c**k" and someone else would write below it "Who want to suck smelly chinese/indian c**k?" Lets admit it. This is one thing most of you guys have seen before. You of course won't expect such incidents to make it into the newspapers, therefore it doesn't stick in the mind of a media-centric modern society of today, but its there and its staring many of you in the face. Just because UK has a few well publicized incidents does not mean racism is extreme here.</strong><br><br>what you're saying is that overt racism is perpetually non-existent in singapore because it is being clamped down hard but covert racism exists in our toilets.  i have no qualms with this statement and in fact it supports my notion that racism is a lot less serious here than in the uk, given it only exists as harmless scribbles in toilets and not ugly or even painful experiences on the streets.<br></blockquote></div>

The thing is, how do u classify a case where someone white is beaten up by an asian gang, but not because of race but because of robbery? There are many cases where asian gangs which roam the neighbourhood pick out lone victims at night to beat and rob them. These asian gangs don't form because everyone's of the same race, they form because geographically an area is settled with mostly asian families. If their victim happens to be white, we can only suspect racial motives but we cannot say for sure its main motivation is racial and not robbery. I am using such cases as an example of what MAY be seen as racial incidents, but even then they are not hard evidence of racism. For a matter of fact, if u want to use singapore as a comparism, how many gangs to begin with roam the streets at night? Any gathering of more than 4 is already illegal, I doubt if racists can band together to roam the streets at night if they wanted to. 2ndly, Uk's population is 20 times bigger than singapore's. U can't realistically expect not to hear about one or 2 such cases, its absurd to expect otherwise. So yes u can say that racism in Sg compared to UK is almost non-existant, but its circumstantial evidence, not hard evidence, due to the interferance of other factors making a fair comparism, at best unsuitable.</strong><br><br>yes you're right, cases of racism could actually have been nothing more than simply robbery.  similarly, cases deemed as robbery could also be racially motivated where taking the money is just dessert and not the main course.  so adding robbery cases that were actually primarily racially motivated would boost up the figures even more.<br><br>yes, you're right, policing is strict in singapore and people are generally more obedient too.  these may have contributed to milder racism here but whatever the reasons, racism is nevertheless milder here compared to the uk.<br><br>uk's population is certainly much larger than ours but we're talking about a small english town here.  bet their population couldn't be more than 2 million, perhaps 1 million.  one quarter our population with 400 racism cases compared to 0 here.  that's a lot worse isn't it?<br><br><strong><br>actually, 1stly Plymouth is not exactly a small town. Its a fairly large and important costal city. 2ndly its a myth that today, most english cities are homogeneously white. In fact its safe to say a large percentage of each city are Asian/Indian. So according to your own logic, 400 in a city that is very rojak, is not a figure that is a tad too high. And yes minorities might be a better word, but its hard to classify what is considered a minority nowadays because the minorities are not "minority" anymore.<br></strong><br><br>your definition of small town may be different from mine.  a so-called city with only a million population is considered small town in today's world of megalopolis cities.  so in my opinion, plymouth ought to be a small town (can't be bothered to find out the population).  so yes a small town as such with a grave 400 figure is not a very safe place for minorities.<br><br>anything that can be used to differentiate people from the rest can be used to identify minorities - skin colour, language, religion ...<br></blockquote></div>

For example, do u remember the file making it sway around where an ah beng calls a bangala and abuses him on the phone? Did that make it into the media? Did anyone report it to the police? Was there an investigation? I doubt it. Like I mentioned above, today's society is media-centric. If the media doesn't jump on it and publicize it, people don't notice it. Public opinion should be more than a matter of what makes it into the news and what doesn't. People should open their eyes and notice the small things which says more about the real state of affairs than a few major incidents. Remember your observations leading to your suggestions are based on publicized incidents, not no careful observation of the real world. I mean, think for a moment about what I said, about the toilet doors, and u have to admit it is quite true. How many of you would have even thought about it if I haven't raised the point though? We have to be careful not to let what we think be dictated by the media alone. It does a society no good to become lazy in forming our own opinions and just let the media feed us what they want us to hear. Afterall, we are all intelligent beings and are capable of our own observations. Sometimes, I will give u the understanding that perhaps each and everyone's daily grind can numb us to certain telling things in everyday life. Thats why I think its very interesting to do what I do. Find a nice place, like a cafe or a bench in the mall, sit down with a drink, and observe the way people behave around u. It is very interesting. Or, heh, read the vandalism written on the back of the cubicle door the next time u use it. Or if u sit at the back of the bus, read what the vandals have carved into the seats. U might notice a few more deep rooted sentiments Singaporeans dare not express openly.<br></strong><br><br>the fact that scribbles on the back of toilet doors does not translate into outright abuses and victimisation on the streets goes to show that racism is well capped here.<br><br>do not be mistaken, it is not that i've not used a public toilet or heard a racist joke from a friend.  these are insignificant compared to the audacity of the racists there and the severity of the acts they commit.<br><br><strong><br>Finally I will make the point again that Singapore is so small that it is easy to police effectively. Its not a case of "our govt stamps out racism much more strongly than in the uk" because if u honestly look around on government sites, while racial harmony is a policy, u seldom see any campaigns encouraging people to report cases of racially-motivated crimes. We have raical harmony day once a year, sometimes its talked about, and people know the government's stand on it. But you don't see a campaign to encourage reporting of racist incidents. In the UK, u get that. So how do we compare which government stamps out racism much more strongly when you don't have a fair base for comparism? If ou follow UK news(watch the BBC, itv, Channel 4, and Five news daily, u will realise the Uk govt clamps down strongly on racism as well. Its easy to do a search on the net and find reports online, of racist incidents, but since you don't often look for the follow up because it takes a few months from the occurance of the incident to the trial and conviction, the general view, especially if you're not physically here, is that of the racial crimes committed, not many are actually closed with an arrest and conviction. But the reality is, there are arrests, there are convictions, more than u would realise because you're not here now, u don't get the exposure to the news here, and thus u miss out on critical bits of information. If we go by outright number of convictions for racial crimes, UK would actually beat Singapore, but of course its as unfair a comparism as it is to compare how tough a country is based on the widely publicized conviction of TWO people in a numerically small country. At best, I would say that both countries are very dedicated to stamping out racism and proper social education. It is impossible to say which one is more stringent on racial crimes due to too big a difference in population figures, as well as government types(authoritarian singapore and more liberal uk). We can be sure though, that both governments hold the view(publicly at least) of anti-racism, because afterall, it would be political suicide otherwise.<br></strong><br><br>maybe uk needs to vigorously promote or encourage people to report on racism because racism is indeed a real big problem there?  maybe singapore does not vigorously report on racism because there is hardly anything to report on?<br><br>there are more arrests in the UK and therefore UK is doing a better job?  is that better compared to here where there no incidents in the first place let alone anyone to be arrested?  be it because we're smaller, or our govt's more efficient at stamping out racial discord or simply because our people have got better things to worry about, racism is milder here compared to there.<br><br><strong><br>Anyways talking about racism in Singapore, another thread seems to have sprung up supporting my view that Singaporeans' opinions about racism tends to be dictated by what is publicized by the media than by what they can personally observe if they looked around more carefully. If u think about it, games played amongst friends such as "what colour is the turban" where u pinch a friend's arm until he says what colour the turban of the Sikh who is passing by is.</strong><br><br>can't be bothered, not very passsionate about this side issue either.  frankly harmless racist jokes cannot compare with outright racism in broad daylight that leads to abuse and suffering.<br><br><strong><br>I must say I enjoy debating with you. Things are argued on purely logical grounds and reasoning-based. Its good mental sparring, helps keep the mind keen.<br></strong><br><br>same here though i prefer arguing about something more meaningful or interesting.<br></blockquote></div>

As I said before, Singapore is easy to police, hence overt cases don't occur. The same laws are in effect in UK, but due to UK being much bigger, effective policing is harder. If UK had a smaller population, or a larger budget for the police, then overt racism would be perpetually non existant as well. The only problem is the sort of police budget needed to make crime virtually 0 in UK would be so huge to be untenable.<br><br>Racism is, a problem, whether it manifest itself as an assault in the street, or a scribble in the loo. Why? because the underlying attitudes are the same, only the actions are dictated by the crime rate of a nation. Mentally, a racist in Singapore doesn't think much differently from a racist in UK, actionwise, the racist in Sg is more restricted because there is a higher chance of getting caught for ANY crime in Singapore. This difference in the level of manifestation of a person's racist views is not down to a difference in racism in either nation. Its down to a difference in effective policing in both nations, and that in turn is affected by population and physical geographical size.<br><br>If of course your referance to racism's seriousness extends only to actions taken, then yes it is a more serious problem here, but if we talk about it being a serious problem on a base level of an individual's thought processes, then its equally serious, whether UK or Sg.</div>

I do hope that as you charge yourself with the mission of providing an alternate voice in the political discourse in Singapore, you will also undertake the responsibility to edit these very materials.<br><br>"Singaporeans for Democracy"? The remarks posted by KS Lim involves the very people who are Singaporeans, and I for one do not think that racism should be confused with democratic ideals.<br><br>Leslie Wee<br><br>Note: SFD agrees entirely with Leslie that racism and democratic ideals do not go hand in hand. We apologise if we have unintentionally offended any fellow Singaporean and would like to reiterate that our posting a reader's letter/s hardly means that we agree in total with his or her views. Thank you.<br><br>In reply to Leslie:<br><br>Dear SFD,<br><br>I refer to Leslie Wee's over-reaction to the letter on May 8th<br><br>He displays the typical PAP paranoia by calling the author of the article racist and accuses the SFD of endorsing the author's view. He took one sentence and blew it out of proportion and hurls an accusation? Racism!? I am reminded of the recent general elections where Tang Liang Hong was concerned about the erosion of the Chinese culture and the PAP labelled him 'Chinese Chauvinist'!?.<br><br><strong><span style="color: red;">Kindly look at the article in its totality. If you had bothered to think, Mr Leslie Wee, the author was merely play-acting what the PAP would be debating on how to raise more money to cover up its losses. The collateral remark about Malays is actually what the PAP thinks of the Malay community. The PAP are racist against the Malays. They are kept out of key positions in government and have only 1 Malay pilot in the Airforce. This view that the PAP is racist towards the Malay community is also supported by remarks from the former Indonesian President BJ Habibe. If I am not mistaken, Malaysian PM Mahatir also made similar remarks of the PAP's treatment of Malays.</span></strong><br><br>So do understand the context of the article before jumping to any wild conclusions. I showed the article to some Malay acquaintances and they found it quite amusing. They didn't take offence to the article. So Mr. Wee, if a Malay does not take offence to it, why should you? The Malays can fight their own battles without you taking offence on their behalf.<br><br>Ramesh K<br><br>while leslie may have overreacted, the next letter no doubt shows that racism is not only a serious problem in Sg, it is also an unofficial govt policy! Racism does not have to manifest itself as serious crime to threaten the standard of living of minorities. It can also manifest itself thru other things such as career restrictions etc.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Letter to SFD June 3, 2000<br>More on racism in Singapore<br><br>Having read Leslie Wee's allegation of the author's racism and the reply to his post, <strong><span style="color: red;">it is apparent that the Chinese population in Singapore are largely ignorant of the issue of racism in Singapore.</span></strong><br><br><strong><span style="color: green;">They are born in a country where they are the majority and face no racism. Their first experience of racism is when they leave for foreign soil. And when they are not given special treatment, they cry racism. </span></strong>As a non-chinese, I have lived with racism all my life and when I hear of such trivial transgressions occurring in foreign soil, I just shake my head.<br><br>What they experience there is only the fraction of the racism that minorities experience as a citizen in their own country.<br><br>I have professional skills. And whenever I call to make appointments for a job interview, I get enthusiastic responses when the prospective employer is told of my qualifications and experience. But when they find out my ethnic identity through my name, the tone in their voice changes and almost always give the same reply: 'I'm sorry, we are looking for someone who can speak Mandarin'.<br><br>So it comes as no surprise to me that Leslie Wee's charge of racism was the intensity that it was. And I am sure that Malays are not offended by remarks that they are 'multiplying like rabbits' as the rebuttal to Leslie Wee's article suggests. They have heard much worse said about them. This is but a trivial remark.<br><br>The Chinese are very quick to cry racism when on foreign soil but I would urge my fellow Chinese Singaporeans to take a good look at themselves before they accuse others of being racist. Consider the following stereotyping of the ethnic minorities by the Chinese:<br><br><span style="color: red;">1) Malays are lazy; They have no ambition and easily contented; Prone to substance abuse<br><br>2) Indians are liars; They are smooth talkers; I'd rather trust a snake than trust an Indian; Indians have one kind of smell and they are very unhygenic.<br><br>3) Eurasians are lazy; they are philanderers.</span><br><br>These remarks cut to the heart but the Chinese are uttering such remarks frequently. What are these remarks compared to 'Malays are multiplying like rabbits'".<br><br>Another thing obnoxious about the Chinese Singaporean is their absolute lack of sensitivity toward the minority races. When the conversation is in English, one person will just cut in and start speaking Mandarin so as to deliberately exclude minorities from the conversation. Another frequent event that happens to me is when I go to the food court or hawker center. I do not resemble a Chinese person remotely, but when I purchase the food, they nonetheless quote the price to me in Mandarin 'it is not that these people are monolingual, they can speak English but choose not to' a bad side-effect of the PAP's chauvinist Speak Mandarin campaign. This I find very offensive and downright racist.<br><br>It is high time that Chinese Singaporeans look at themselves and see their own inadequacies before accusing others of the same.<br><br>A Singaporean Too<br><br>The words in green reflect exactly what I think about Singaporean students or workers overseas who simply cry racism too easily. It is what I've been saying all along early in my debate with NuLife.<br><br>The rest in red demonstrates how racism is serious in Singapore. While the author of this letter hasn't been beaten up, the racist attitudes prevalent in Singapore clearly has hurt him on a personal level, affected his career opportunities, and made his quality of life lower than it has to be. And worse still, these sort of racist crimes are not the sort easily reported, and thus not easily weeded out. They can cause just as much damage and cannot be easily gotten rid of. In my view, they cause even more widespread damage to a greater number of people than a single case of someone getting beaten up due to race. How can anyone call this a mild problem? 5 years down the road UK might succeed in getting the number of racial assaults down to virtually 0, but do u think 5 years down the road we can get stop people in Singapore from holding such views about minorities? I doubt so. In fact the view held by the Sg govt that there is no need to encourage reporting of incidents because there is nothing to report, is disturbing. there is obviously too many things to report, but often, they are so minor that to report them would make the victim seem silly and oversensitive. And yet over time, the build up of such racial abuse and attitudes in Singapore can have a detrimental effect on the mental health of individuals in Singapore. And like I said, this sort of racism is almost impossible to stamp out. If you think racism in Sg is mild compared to UK, u need to re-assess the threat in another light, to see the danger as it actually is.</div>

Why? because the underlying attitudes are the same, only the actions are dictated by the crime rate of a nation. Mentally, a racist in Singapore doesn't think much differently from a racist in UK, actionwise, the racist in Sg is more restricted because there is a higher chance of getting caught for ANY crime in Singapore. This difference in the level of manifestation of a person's racist views is not down to a difference in racism in either nation. Its down to a difference in effective policing in both nations, and that in turn is affected by population and physical geographical size.<br></strong><br><br>strictly speaking an attitude is just that - an attitude.  you fantasize about someone but you don't go to bed with her, you've not committed adultery have you?  so racial attitudes and racism are really miles apart so we really should not elevate the seriousness of one to that of the other.  to do so would've been to belittle the seriousness of the latter while making a mountain out of the former.<br><br>effective policing may have been an effective deterrent but it doesn't explain why few as they are, there are still murders, rapes, thefts here but virtually no incidents of racism.  something more than simple policing is at work here - social conditioning, we're simply not that violent towards minorities.<br><br><strong><br>If of course your referance to racism's seriousness extends only to actions taken, then yes it is a more serious problem here, but if we talk about it being a serious problem on a base level of an individual's thought processes, then its equally serious, whether UK or Sg.</strong><br><br>individual thought processes do not count as racism much like fantasies do not equate to adultery or hatred equals to murder.  individual thought processes can be overidden by good moral upbringings so while you may have a distaste for certain groups of people, because of your moral or even religious bindings, you would never bring yourself to hurting them, as much as you feel disgusted about them.  in such case, racial attitudes never get evolved into racism and that i think is what we have here.<br></blockquote></div>

And whenever I call to make appointments for a job interview, I get enthusiastic responses when the prospective employer is told of my qualifications and experience.

When the conversation is in English, one person will just cut in and start speaking Mandarin so as to deliberately exclude minorities from the conversation. Another frequent event that happens to me is when I go to the food court or hawker center. I do not resemble a Chinese person remotely, but when I purchase the food, they nonetheless quote the price to me in Mandarin 'it is not that these people are monolingual, they can speak English but choose not to' a bad side-effect of the PAP's chauvinist Speak Mandarin campaign. This I find very offensive and downright racist.<br></strong><br><br>that's strange, i always make an attempt to say things like berupper or chukop when buying food at malay stalls.  does my single non-racist annecdote negate those of the writer's?  in other words, does he represent the experiences of every other minority?<br><br><strong><br>The words in green reflect exactly what I think about Singaporean students or workers overseas who simply cry racism too easily.

While the author of this letter hasn't been beaten up, the racist attitudes prevalent in Singapore clearly has hurt him on a personal level, affected his career opportunities, and made his quality of life lower than it has to be. And worse still, these sort of racist crimes are not the sort easily reported, and thus not easily weeded out. They can cause just as much damage and cannot be easily gotten rid of. In my view, they cause even more widespread damage to a greater number of people than a single case of someone getting beaten up due to race. How can anyone call this a mild problem? 5 years down the road UK might succeed in getting the number of racial assaults down to virtually 0, but do u think 5 years down the road we can get stop people in Singapore from holding such views about minorities? I doubt so. In fact the view held by the Sg govt that there is no need to encourage reporting of incidents because there is nothing to report, is disturbing. there is obviously too many things to report, but often, they are so minor that to report them would make the victim seem silly and oversensitive. And yet over time, the build up of such racial abuse and attitudes in Singapore can have a detrimental effect on the mental health of individuals in Singapore. And like I said, this sort of racism is almost impossible to stamp out. If you think racism in Sg is mild compared to UK, u need to re-assess the threat in another light, to see the danger as it actually is.</strong><br><br>from what was written, i have doubts about this guy's experiences and also wonder about his own racial attitudes.  as such i would take it with a pinch of salt.  racism is not serious here especially when there are better things to worry about like retrenchments, medical bills, cost of living ...<br></blockquote></div>

U are mistaken in saying that racist attitudes evolves into racism, because racism INCLUDES, BY DEFINATION, racist attitudes.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> And because we now know FOR CERTAIN that racism includes racist attitudes, that indesputable fact means racism IS not milder in Singapore just because there is a lack of reported cases.
