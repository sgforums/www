My flatmate is an englishman. he speaks gurjurati (or something. not sure how to spell it).

If you talk about learning the local cutures, you were in UK studying in a UK universities, the angmoh here send their children to the american schools, the french schools, the australian schools; many angmohs even got hardship allowance for having to stay in china or some asian countries.

Heck I was only in the UK for a few months and they gladly allowed me to vote. Honestly I think some people here are just making mountains out of molehills because they've had a couple of racist incidents. I mean, many of us overseas have never had encounters like that. And we're not just here for a short stay, we're here for the long term, I think we are more likely to be the ones considering carefully if where we've choosen to migrate to is a good place than you would? U might think u've observed more, but hey, maybe because u weren't staying for long, u just let a few incidents colour your views. The truth is that most western countries are just less racist than most of you think. So sorry that u've maybe had some bad encounters but to label those of us who can handle ourselves well in new societies as having life's honeymoon, is downright unfair. Its not like we moved in here easy peasy. The point is, we made a big effort to mix with the locals and find acceptance downright forthcoming. Which is more than I can say for a lot of people.<br><br><strong><span style="color: red;">And im going to point out very nicely that it was YOU who said this:<br><br>"It is very rare to find americans or the brits who speak a different language. Ever saw an englishman who speak tamil or hindu??"<br><br>So yup im telling you yes, a lot of them in fact. And now u tell me its no big deal. So if it was no big deal, I wonder why u even brought it up in the 1st place. Try not to shoot yourself in the foot, its not a nice sight.</span></strong><br><br>Yes the real world is more complicated indeed. more complicated than you simply saying UK, US and Australia are racist countries. I hope u realise the irony of your own words</div>

Over here, she was a joke, and of the minority that voted for her, many (if not most) did it to tell the existing government to wake up their ideas.  As for the recent Cronulla riots, it was a case of two obnoxious mobs going against each other, starting with a pair of Lebanese blokes beating up a white lifeguard on the beach.  Neither was a particularly big deal once you filter out the media's sensationalism.<br><br>Lesson of the day: if you're going to work on secondhand information, it's wise to consider the motivations of the news source.  In terms of migration, Singapore's bleeding like a stuck pig, or at least enough for the former PM to address the issue and call migrants quitters.  In light of this, could the Singapore media not reasonably be expected to make other countries look as unappealing as possible?<br><br>You can swallow what's being pumped out by the media lock, stock and barrel, or you can take the trouble to find things out for yourself.

            <div class='col-md body'>... I have said it once, I will say it again, In myopinion, the UK is definitely not what one could call a rascist country. The kids are a handful ...yes. But they are obnoxious little pricks period.<br><br>I once went for a ride in the countryside on my scooter. Unfortunately, my bike chose to break down in the countryside miles from the nearest garage. In the 6+ hours I had to wait for the recovery vehicle to come pick me up, no less than 7 people stopped their vehicles to ask me if I needed help. All this w/o me flagging anyone down. One guy even stopped to chat with me (he did his national service in Signapore and was married in Singapore) and came back to check on me when it got dark. I dare say this would not happen in Singapore.<br><br>I would say that many people are migrating because Singapore is too small a country to cater to everyone. There just aren't enough opportunities in SIngapore for the young man. I want to get on the property ladder, I want to not have to take public transport to work. I want to be able to raise my kids in a country where they are not automatically entered into bondage on birth. I want to have some say in governemnt. . I do not like my tax dollars to be used to feed LKY and Co. I don't want to pay my ministers millions of dollars to do a job that quite frankly, anyone with commonsense and responsiblity can do.I want to actually choose my own prime minister, and not have one chosen for me. I want my kids to be able to choose his path in life and still make a decent living.<br><br>That is why many Singaporeans are migrating. At least that is what i think.<br><br></div>

If there were 15 millions foreigners among the 60 millions brits, we will see how they are accepting to the reality.<br><br>When you travel in the region to places where english are not spoken widely, then you will see how the angmohs behave, then decide if their behavior are racists or not. Staying in the comfort of their own home, they can expect everybody coming to their countries to speak english. If they don't, the visitors are racists but not the hosts. When they are overseas, if locals cannot accept their cultures, the locals are racists. This is western superiority mentality, not just racists.<br><br>It is not a fact that when you travel in UK, any language other than english are not understood, this is different from going even to paris, they understand english, in german they understand more languages, may be not asian languages. so a few englishmen who speak indian or chinese is not big deal, there are chinese or asian studies in many of the UK universities.<br><br>The right to vote means nothing, here in singapore, mainland chinese, indian, pakistani, thai can all vote once they become citizens.
