So Lets put it this into perspective.<br><br>Plymouth has 0.17% of its population racist, and that to you makes UK one of the most racist countries ever, in the world. Right. I see your logic. What percentage would make a country be considered "not so racist"? Hmmm?<br><br>Oh yea have a look here:<br><br><a href="http://www.plymouth.gov.uk/homepage/communityandliving/racismandhomophobia.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.plymouth.gov.uk/homepage/communityandliving/racismandhomophobia.htm</a><br><br>Plymouth's City Council is planning on stamping out racism AND homophobia from, I quote: <span style="color: red;">"from all aspects of our work and to ensuring we contribute to making Plymouth a safer place for minority communities. If you have experienced or witnessed a racist or homophobic incident we want to hear about it. Incidents may include: assault, vandalism, harassment, damage to property, name calling, graffiti, phone calls. This is not a full list - other things may be offensive to you."</span><br><br>So now the defination of what constitutes a racist incident has been expanded to include a lot more things. Of course we would expect the number of reported cases to increase. And that is actually a good thing, because if it's not reported, the authorities can't do anything about it can they?<br><br>So anyways, now I know why u keep screaming that UK is VERY racist. less than 1% of the population of a country is racist, u will consider that country very racist. Ok loh but u can focus less on the racist people and more on the non-racist people in a country. Its a pity u choose to live the other way.<br><br>As for thinking with head n ass, just think about this: whos the one who couldn't get the point to begin with, who's the one who had to resort to cheap blows and who's the one who simply dug up some headlines as evidence without even crunching the numbers or checking out other important statistics 1st? Like a number alone for racist cases reported gives me an idea of how good or bad the situation is, without the population number. Now I wonder if you didn't set out deliberately NOT to tell me the population of plymouth. Afterall, a 0.17% racist incident rate in plymouth alone makes your case looks sooooo much the weaker doesn't it?</div>

There was definately going to be a backlash against the Muslim/Asian community. No country is free from racism, but most people won't go out and slash car tyres. There will always be a few extremist in anything, be it religion, racism, homophobia or sexism. One case of car tyres being slashed in a country with about 60 million people, puts everything into perspective. Besides, for everyone one racially motivated tyre slashing, there are countless cases where vandalism to cars are non-racially motivated, or profit orientated. Sure in this case it might be a racist attack, but that doesn't mean UK is a racist country. In indonesia, during the race riots they went about raping and chopping the heads of the chinese off, but I don't hear u say they are racist either. Just because they're part of Asia? Who knows, u might be the racist one here. Now thats a scary thought.<br><br>As for stabbings and abuse on public transport, lets put things into perspective too. Last month a white lawyer and an asian chef were robbed on the underground late at night while they were going home. By the same gang. All in the gang were white people. In this case, they killed the white lawyer but didn't kill the asian chef. Now if it were the other way around, this case could SO easily be classed as a racially motivated attack. In a country where large numbers of coloured and white people have to interact closely on a daily basis, sure there will be racist cases, but there will be a lot more incidents which are non-race related. Personally I'm telling you I've never faced any cases of racism towars myself, which might mean im lucky, which might mean more. I can tell you that I am blinded by my own biasednessed(because there is none) and I'm not living in my own world. I am living in UK's world, which means if UK is very racist (wow like 0.17% racist) then that is something I would want to experience as well. I am here, afterall, to experience UK as a resident would, not as a tourist, and if there is A LOT of racism here, then yes racism is part of the experience. Thus far I have not experienced any, though I don't doubt in future I might experience some, the point is it is not extremely racist here and I think most people would think so, unless like nulife, 0.17% racist is considered extremely racist for you.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by HENG@:</div><div class="quote_body">nulife nulife...<br><br>when u look at the increase in cases in plymouth alone, did u stop to consider other factors?<br><br>such as the increase of plymouth's population from 241,500 to almost 250,000?<br><br>thats an increase of 8500 people. with a corresponding increase in cases of racism reported, thats 1.35% of the increase in population.<br><br>even considering the number of racist incidents in accordance to its population in 2005, the number of cases per 100 population is only 0.17%(rounded UP) and racist incidents are likely to be committed by the same people over and over again. So Lets put it this into perspective.<br><br>Plymouth has 0.17% of its population racist, and that to you makes UK one of the most racist countries ever, in the world. Right. I see your logic. What percentage would make a country be considered "not so racist"? Hmmm?<br><br>Oh yea have a look here:<br><br><a href="http://www.plymouth.gov.uk/homepage/communityandliving/racismandhomophobia.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.plymouth.gov.uk/homepage/communityandliving/racismandhomophobia.htm</a><br><br>Plymouth's City Council is planning on stamping out racism AND homophobia from, I quote: <span style="color: red;">"from all aspects of our work and to ensuring we contribute to making Plymouth a safer place for minority communities. If you have experienced or witnessed a racist or homophobic incident we want to hear about it. Incidents may include: assault, vandalism, harassment, damage to property, name calling, graffiti, phone calls. This is not a full list - other things may be offensive to you."</span><br><br>So now the defination of what constitutes a racist incident has been expanded to include a lot more things. Of course we would expect the number of reported cases to increase. And that is actually a good thing, because if it's not reported, the authorities can't do anything about it can they?<br><br>So anyways, now I know why u keep screaming that UK is VERY racist. less than 1% of the population of a country is racist, u will consider that country very racist. Ok loh but u can focus less on the racist people and more on the non-racist people in a country. Its a pity u choose to live the other way.<br><br>As for thinking with head n ass, just think about this: whos the one who couldn't get the point to begin with, who's the one who had to resort to cheap blows and who's the one who simply dug up some headlines as evidence without even crunching the numbers or checking out other important statistics 1st? Like a number alone for racist cases reported gives me an idea of how good or bad the situation is, without the population number. Now I wonder if you didn't set out deliberately NOT to tell me the population of plymouth. Afterall, a 0.17% racist incident rate in plymouth alone makes your case looks sooooo much the weaker doesn't it?</div></blockquote>heng heng,<br>are u going to find detail abt Every single news which i quoted<br>in just a few seconds from a list of 200+ pages of search results?<br>dun forget that is only Jan/Feb 2006 news, i had even read cases in manchesters etc.<br><br>ur going into details of each news really make one feel<br>you are just trying to win an argument or being too baised towards ang moh.<br><br>like i said b4, i was wondering if uk was still as racist as when<br>i was in uk..(let me remind again, it was not just my personal experiences)<br>and was appalled to find such news in a simple search on bbc...<br>again, i wasn't trying to use just personal experiences.<br>personal experiences really isnt that accurate when compared with reported facts/news.<br><br>im not trying to just compare UK with sg or other asian countries.<br>And if its just based on personal experiences like you do,<br>my personal experiences to various european countries, US and australia,<br>really make me find UK the most racist "Among the western countries".<br><br>i understand ur argument trying to see from a diff perspectives,<br>but i cannot agree, because, the fact that we see a country as more or less racist,<br>is not based on just people/students ard us. (like i had said b4)<br>Just because one can mix with one or 2 groups of angmoh friends,<br>does not mean angmoh on the whole are less racist.<br>Its quite an illogical perspective.<br><br>Honestly, if you want to see them based on people you mix with<br>and if you have gone to work in US and other europeans countries<br>then compare with UK, you will see the big difference.<br>I had and i see it the difference.<br><br>Anyways, I just felt that many young sporeans have the mis-perception that UK/English<br>is really that great. I suspect its becos of the widely popular English league.<br>Honestly, IMO, the US and some european countries's people are really alot more worthy<br>of respect and admiration and of learning value, compared to UK.<br><br>..not going to go into details now...been rather busy lately.<br><br>ps:<br>and pls differentiate between discussion about pts<br>to the real reason why i make those remarks abt you.<br>so i really think you are the one who cant get the pts straight.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>However, these said,<br>I DO expect UK to be less racist in the future.

            <div class='col-md body'>I just need to say one thing<br><br>Nulife, YOU just WANT to think UK is racist, period.<br><br>I don't need to win an argument or be biased towards ang moh. Why? I believe I stand toe to toe with them as far as ability is concerned. Thats why I feel I can be more objective towards anything they can throw towards me instead of standing from an inferiority complex viewpoint and whining that people are being racist towards me.<br><br>The bottomline is, reports report something that happen, they don't report something that does not happen. From reports alone its easy to think a place is very racist, but do a proper check of number of cases against the entire population of a nation and the picture becomes clear. Unless of course, you just REFUSE to entertain even the notion that racism is not as extreme here as u think, and why? Because like I pointed out earlier, u have an inferority complex. BTW, I didn't spend a "few seconds" I spent a good half an hour getting my facts right before posting, something which I'm afraid we cannot say the same of you. How long did YOU spend before u came to the "fact" that I only spent "a few seconds"?<br><br>And to point out to you, I don't think angmoh are less racist just because "one can mix with one or 2 groups of angmoh friends,<br>does not mean angmoh on the whole are less racist." No. On the contary, I base it from my experience of people whom I don't know but whom I have to interact with, such as bus drivers, tube station staff, police, shopkeepers, other uni students, etc. Yet again I see u've made your own assumptions about where my point of view comes from.<br><br>Personally, I think many of the poorer and less educated english are louts, which is why they behave the way they do towards anyone, regardless of race. Towards an oriental, they call them chinks. Towards blacks, maybe nigger, but towards the whites, they have degradory terms too, such as scouse, mackem, garyboy, essex girl etc. U name it, they've got it. Personally, if you wish to view loutish behaviour as racism, you're welcome to. Like I said, I choose not to stand in a inferiority complex POV.<br><br>No indeed. You are the master of reasonless, logicless, baseless statements. I can hardly hold a candle to you. I wonder what reason logic or solid facts u based your deduction that I spent "a few seconds" looking up facts. Or how about your "genius" deduction that my view that UK is not EXTREMELY racist is "just based on just people/students ard us" ? We can all look back thru the pages and find even more such statements of wonderful "logic and reasoning" if we want to.<br><br>And finally, please don't make me laugh. US's people are worthy of admiration? Say that to ANY european, be they french, german, english, welsh, irish, scot, spanish, italian, greek, polish, swiss, portugese, and I can guarantee you, they will LAUGH in your face. It's downright funny you condemn the Brits as racist and then do your best to suck up to the Americans. the Americans are so in their own little world they can be misled into thinking that Australia and New Zealand are North and South Korea and accordingly want to nuke Australia. Or say things like "nuke the French because they are annoying" when interviewed on the streets by what they think is CNN. If only you knew the number of Americans who are embaressed by the "I'm the center of the world" mentality of majority of their fellow Americans, you wouldn't even say something as farcial as:<br><br>"Honestly, IMO, the US's people are really alot more worthy of respect and admiration and of learning value..."<br><br>If you actually look up to them then I guess that would also explain why u realy think the Brits are extremely racist. It all really smacks of an inferiority complex doesn't it?</div>
