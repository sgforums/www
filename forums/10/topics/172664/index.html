            <div class='col-md body'>I've recently returned from London after spending 6 years there as a student/working....what surprised me the most was the number of changes in our population within a short period of time....It also saddened me greatly to see that a number of my friends were thinking of leaving singapore or had already migrated to another country for good. On the other side of the fence, in London, I met a ' Part Time Singaporean' who was born in a third world country and had migrated to Singapore and was now living in London....<br><br>There are two issues of concern here:<br><br>a) Why isn't the singapore government openly addressing the issue of the number of singaporeans leaving Singapore??? we seemed to be more concerned about upgradings and building shelters around our flats then addressing a serious problem of large number of singaporeans migrating....This are the 'Real Sons' of singapore who were born here, went to primary, sec and college here, who even served 2-2.5 years of their national service...this are the same people who are now wanting to leave singapore for good and who are unhappy with the economic circumstances here....why isn't there any open public debate about their concerns and the reasons for them living??? any statistics available on the number of people leaving Singapore yearly????? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>b) A number of this so called 'Part Time Singaporeans' who migrate here mainly from third world countries like China and India are using Singapore as a stepping stone to move to other western countires once they have received their Permanent Residency and Citizenship here....In the case of this individual whom i met in london was from china, and had moved to singapore a few years ago...once he had received his Singapore citizenship he applied to migrate to the UK using his Singaporean passport....he also does admit that his chances of migrating to the UK using a chinese passport would have been slim..... Is Singapore being used here as a stepping stone to other western countires by this third world country immigrants to singapore??? what loyalty is there towards singapore among this 'Part Time Singaporeans'??? any statistics available on the number of this new' Part Time Singaporeans' moving on to other countires after receiving their Singapore citizenship???? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>any comments????<br><br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>what happened to the song we use to sing when we were kids...<br><br>This is my country<br>This is my land<br>This are my people<br>This are my friends<br>We are Singaporeans......<br><br>It saddens me greatly that I do not see those good old singaporeans around....what i see are new faces that i dont recognise....Do they have a place in the hearts and minds of us true singaporeans???...these new 'Part Time Singaporeans' are just prostituting our singapore passports in foreign countries for their own selfish gains!!!!<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>what struck me the most since my return to Singapore is that the various communities seem to be gradually drifting apart. There was a time one used to see lots of interaction among the various communities be it the chinese, malays and the indians. But now it seems to be the other way around. there are clear signs of communities drifting apart. I suspect it has greatly to do with the governments immigration policies. In their rush to bring in all this foreign nationals into singapore the government has failed to see the negative social impact on the local population such large number of migrants bring. Lets be honest most of the migrants from china and india come from societys where they've probably never been to school with students from different cultures. i doubt chinese nationals from china have ever had indians or malays living in their towns or cities or even having gone to school with students from different cultures. The same goes for the indians that are moving in from india to singapore. i doubt any of these 'new indians' ever had chinese or malay friends in their neighbourhoods and communities back in india.<br><br>so how do we expect these foreign nationals who migrate here and take up our singapore citizenship to integrate overnight into our original vibrant and multicultural community here in singapore??? its taken us an entire generation to bond the various communities together. do we seriously expect these 'New Part Time Singaporeans' to integrate and understand the dynamics of our various communities overnight?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>They want to migarte because they have received a good education and want to go for greener grass whether it exists or not.<br>Same for Thailand, Taiwan, Korea, Philippines, Holland, Canada or Turkey.

            <div class='col-md body'>Government did their best. The issue was solved by :<br><br>1. Calling people who left : quitters. Surely, that would "inspire" people to turn back ... then what do they call people who stick around?  Stupid Slavers ?<br><br>2. Importing more 3rd world immigrants or buying in more Ang Moh foreign "talents" to fill in the gaps and take the jobs of locals. Never mind, there will always be another 3rd world country waiting to use Singapore as a "passport" to a better life..<br><br>3. By maintaining social equilibrium by paying "peanuts" to select elites and really paying peanuts to the rest who drive the economy forward, thereby making us all forever hungry (but not staved to death - otherwise no workers ) so that we have no other choice but to slog through another day. Then, there was once I heard another message from the government stating we are not creative people and only think of break and butter. Well dang! I have to be a monkey and a clown..<br><br>4. Our next and greatest idea :  2 casinos! isn't it exciting! We will be the gambling den of the South East Asia.<br><br>Now, if you have a job or a better chance of survival over in UK or any country for that (unless you are part of the elite and this next piece of advice would not apply cause you would be living off the blood and sweat of the common people). I would strong advice going back there and carving out a life over there - at least you do not need to think about working till the day you die for the next meal, next donation drive or money to pay the debt you didn't know you owe the government.<br><br></div>
