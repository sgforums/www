Nobody can stop u from being the brainwashed product the PAP wants u to be. But before u want to come onto us n call us quitters and say things like <span style="color: red;">"you and the rest of your kind who have left or are leaving are not considered part of "our" anymore you are a foreigner here or soon to be one and maybe even a second class citizen in your new country."</span> u better think twice.

It's like saying how things should be done but at the same time not being there to do it so if things go wrong you can say "it's an honest bad call" but you are shielded and the people here suffer for it, if you  don't even want to improve the system when you are here why would want to do it when you become a foreigner what is that? Should singaporeans listen to foreigners?

We still have loved ones, friends stuck back in sg, and we are qualified to be concerned for them and to be concerned about the society they're still trapped in. as for qualified folks, think again. the only way u get that job is to be born into a ruling family, or one with connections to them.<br><br>call us foreigners, but like it or not, we'll always be singaporeans in a way, and there is not damn thing u can do about it.</div>

On the other side of the fence, in London, I met a ' Part Time Singaporean' who was born in a third world country and had migrated to Singapore and was now living in London....<br><br>There are two issues of concern here:<br><br>a) Why isn't the singapore government openly addressing the issue of the number of singaporeans leaving Singapore??? we seemed to be more concerned about upgradings and building shelters around our flats then addressing a serious problem of large number of singaporeans migrating....This are the 'Real Sons' of singapore who were born here, went to primary, sec and college here, who even served 2-2.5 years of their national service...this are the same people who are now wanting to leave singapore for good and who are unhappy with the economic circumstances here....why isn't there any open public debate about their concerns and the reasons for them living??? any statistics available on the number of people leaving Singapore yearly????? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  /b]</blockquote>Since the beginning of this millienium there has been a sharp rise in migration by Singaporeans because there are not enough jobs for them here.<br><br>The MNCs which we have been so dependent for jobs have moved to other countries, such as China and India, as the cost of doing business there is very much lower than Singapore.<br><br>On top of this, Singaporeans also have to compete for jobs with foreigners whom the government is actively recruiting to boost Singapore decline birth rate.<br><br>You mean you don't know that our government never has the habit of discussing any issue with us? It always believes that it knows best and has the mandate to decide everything for us.<br><br>The government has also stopped publishing the number of people leaving Singapore for several years.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Analogy:<br><br>My company reorg and my job is like a call center... just that it was given a better name, but still its the same sh!t.  When I wanted to look for another position in another company. People tell me to fear the other new, unknown job and new unknown company. That I might never make it and I would get a even worse deal out of my current place. So the work agencies also come and tell me how inadequet I am, and they really can make you feel really small and stupid. Some even suggest I go start my business - forgetting the fact my request to look for a job through them helps them make money. So many people telling me to be fearful, that current, unbearable situation of being a shadow call center to be hounded by rude users and all sorts of demands is what I can look for till the end of my working life or perhaps when I get booted out. But actually I had heard that story before ... in my previous companies. I feel that I need to change to grow and to grow I need to change. Its like the Ying and Yang diagram. And there will always be those "chicken little" people who try to use fear to manipulate your thinking telling you the world outside is very scary...  But I take it in my stride and I am a person who is willing to work hard for my salary.  (PS: anyone want to hire a hard worker??? )<br><br>I think its good that Singaporeans are venturing out to try other things.<br>But its sad to see what is happening to what we once call home. Even though I am physically in Singapore... I do not feel connected to this country.  I also tend to feel that local people are not very open, mature people nor very civil...and that makes living here even more difficult when our own people make it difficult for our own local born sons and daughters to succeed - you can see it by the local employers and the choice of people they choose to hire or how our service industry treats local customers.  In every place, there are pull and push factors at work. However, instead of addressing the problem, the government aggrevated the issue by relaxing the foreign policy and then calling local people quitters. I don't know about others, I already been made to feel small in the eyes of the elites ... now I feel like second class to the foreigners especially to the PRC. Singapore Was my home<br><br></div>
