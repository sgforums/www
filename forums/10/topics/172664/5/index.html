            <div class='col-md body'>Agree totally with two posts above about kids and work. For front line operations jobs in Oz for example, criteria for entry is high, but then again, jobs are seen as professions and skillsets rather than work many would "just settle for". Pay is also commensurate and any work is seen as a positive skill.<br><br>In regards to kids, its just a matter of values I suppose. If you feel comfortable with the system whereby a kid grows up in, there, might not be a reason to look elsewhere but we have realised that many new families are disagreeing with the pressures and expectations which are placed on kids. Many seek pastures elsewhere so that their kids can at least lead a reasonable childhood, one which gives them time to <strong>really be kids</strong>, as well as families to take time out to <strong>really be families </strong>as well and most importantly, for parents to <strong>really be parents</strong>.[/quote]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Good question. Singaporeans who work overseas experience things that they can never experience in Singapore as long as the current party is in charge. For eg, the press freedom in Singapore is ranked 140/160 in the world. That suggests a heck lot of things about life in Singapore and maybe that is one reasons along with others that encourages people to migrate out of Singapore. Another reason might be NS, some fathers hated their experience in NS and they would not want to see their sons serving if they can afford to leave... Aferall, if they can afford to leave... I am pretty sure they can raise their sons in an enviroment as good or even better than Singapore.</div>

Local talents are not being recognised for their contribution or potential, despite being the citizens, when they should be at least on par with foreign talents. So much for the "meritocratic" work culture in Singapore.. LOL.. Moreover, foreign countries are willing to pay more for our local talents. I am sure you all remember the PSC bond-breaker incident years ago. What goes unreported that the bond-breakers' compensation fee was paid by American headhunting firms. The hunt for talents is indeed more than ferocious. At least PSC is now smarter - they discourage their scholars to study in America.<br><br>Mr KumSioJui's post demonstrated his frustration with the system in Singapore, yet he still appluases for the system adminstrator (aka gahmen) for fighting for his interest and making Singapore a safe place. A safe place where no Singaporeans will be robbed by theives. If the system administrator fulfill the theives' economic needs, the theives no longer need to rob anybody. However, Singaporeans, being Singaporeans, won't go and rob the ex-theives despite their lack of jobs, and struggling daily to make ends meet. So the people in need won't become theives, and the theives no longer need to be thieves to meet their material needs. Not surprising Singapore is a safe place. The government really did a good job.<br><br>BTW, does anybody here actually know the optimum pension rate is 30%? Singapore pension (CPF) is less than half the optimum rate. It is hardly surprising to see old people working at McDonald's - a job used to be done by youngsters. Even old people now must contend with the young for such menial jobs to survive. What quality of life is there if you must work until you die? YES, we have been duped about our CPF right from the beginning.<br><br>Moreover, the fact that a Singaporean migrate abroad is not sufficient to label him as a quitter. Even the government recognises this now, with the recent implementation of overseas voting. Although the revised parliamentry act is faulty, it at least in principle acknowledge that Singaporeans abroad are still Singaporeans, not foreigners.<br><br>Mr KumSioJui, Singaporeans abroad are not quitters. We know we can't change the Singapore system now. We also acknowledge we don't want to suffer with it. We have the resources and the intellectual capability such that we would be in demand abroad. Our ability to leave for greener pastures is also the result of the meritocratic culture in Singapore. Although you may be envious, I must tell you that foreign countries who take us in are no charity too. We have to work for it, to prove our worth.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Letter from a reader in Today's online forum page.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Can you blame them for leaving?<br>From young to old, life here doesn't get easier<br><br>Letter from Jimmy Ho Kwok Hoong<br><br>I REFER to the letter, "Puzzle of migrating Singaporeans" by Lim Boon Hee (Feb 2). Let us rationally analyse the "quitter" problem from the perspectives of different age groups.<br><br>Our educational curriculum deprives us of a proper childhood from a tender age. Judging from the proportion of students wearing spectacles here, it is not difficult to tell they have been overexposed to textbooks. Parents who cannot bear to see their kids live with the need for regimental "mugging" may consider migration.<br><br>On the next level, a hopeful graduate, fresh from his victory in the educational system, may be in for a rude shock when he discovers that the job market Â— with its plentiful supply of foreign talent Â— is not prepared to pay him enough for a decent lifestyle.<br><br>It may be worth mentioning that our definition of the words "foreign talent" has changed from its initial meaning of highly-paid expatriates and cheaper IT staff to include the foreign worker who clears the dustbin. Although these foreigners may be needed to reduce the overall costs of operations in Singapore, have we gone too far in welcoming them by being reluctant to control their impact on local rice bowls?<br><br>When setting up a family, most couples will learn that the house they buy will probably cost them a lifelong mortgage.<br><br>When a Singaporean reaches 40 years old, he should realise that his shelf life in the workforce is only about 10 years, upon discovering that he is considered "obsolete" at that age Â— even after having acquired a Masters' degree at 30.<br><br>The middle-aged professionals, when they are retrenched, will have to decide whether to "upgrade" themselves Â— taking up menial jobs despite their immense experience in white-collared posts Â— or to throw their savings into entrepreneurship, for which the chances of success are slim.<br><br>Unemployment fell to a low of 2.5 per cent last quarter. However, wages have yet to recover to the level they were at in the previous cycle. In other words, jobs were created but at lower value added as a whole.<br><br>The private sector has been asked not to discriminate based on age when hiring, yet public organisations continue to recruit based on age limits.<br><br>Older folks in their "golden years" are also not spared. They are expected to slog for their livelihoods to a ripe old age, while their peers elsewhere happily rely on welfare and healthcare provided free of charge by their governments.<br><br>The biggest issue may be the refusal to acknowledge that the problems exist Â— let alone working on solving them. Given such an environment, is it any wonder that some Singaporeans choose to migrate? As I hear someone saying in a coffeeshop say: "Stayers are people who do not have the means to quit!"<br><br><a href="http://www.todayonline.com/articles/99388.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.todayonline.com/articles/99388.asp</a><br><br></div>
