            <div class='col-md body'>Patriotism is a virtue of the vicious!<br><br>All this national education crap dosent settle in with the common singaporean.  I think we only tend to form a bond with our country when those of us who dont Kheng in the army sweat together in the forests. Thats when we build and strenghten out singaporean brotherhood. For this reason i never think for one moment that NS is a waste of time. However it seems all is lost once we ord.....Cuz then we realise we are infested with forigners who dont sacrifice what we have and enjoy singapore as we do.<br>Nationalistic emotions take root here.!</div>
