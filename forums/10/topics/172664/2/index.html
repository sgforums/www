            <div class='col-md body'>We all like to reiterate the govt's propaganda about how singapore is our home, our country, and how we should die for this place...<br><br>Can anyone tell me, what are the perks of being a Singaporean? Is there an advantage being a citizen over a PR or FT? Why?<br><br>While NS is a very good training ground for guys to develop useful life skills like leadership and the ability to socialise, many guys do not see the necessity of serving the military, hence have a lack of pride in the service.<br><br>Many people have told me that the advantage of a citizen is the ability to vote. That becomes a moot point in the view of the too many walkovers. What elections?<br><br>Does the country value the "real" sons and daughters of sg? Are we being held in a better light than FTs and PRs? What constitutes a "real" son or daughter of sg? Apparently, as long as you get a NRIC, you become a "real" son or daughter of sg.<br><br>I have a rudimentary understanding of coporate and political governence, but I do know that a country has to be run a little different from a company.<br><br>While a coporation's aim is to mazimize profits and shareholder value, a country also has to directly cater to ensuring the general well being of their citizens and voters. This, amongst other reasons, contributes to a citizen's loyalty to a country.<br><br>There is no such thing as loyalty to a company anymore.<br><br>Some contridictions that I've noticed after living here for so long:<br><br>Outsourcing high paying jobs to FT using the excuse that there is not enough skilled workers in sg to take on such positions.<br><br>Complaining that sg has too many skilled workers that demand a too high a pay and hence low level yet essential jobs are left vacant. Even more FT are needed to fill those positions.<br><br>Telling citizens to be more politically aware, to speak up and play a bigger role in the local political scene.<br><br>Suing and ruining those that oppose the ruling class. Putting miles of red tape that hinders potential opposition members.<br><br>Telling citizens to enter politics out of a love of the country, not for money.<br><br>Blackmailing themselves for high pay by claiming that if they can get a higher pay elsewhere, they will leave. Also, if they are not paid enough, they wil start embezelling and turning corrupt.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My brother and his girlfriend are planning to migrate to australia in 1-2 years time. As a young Singaporean, i find it sad to see so many Singaporeans in 20s-30s who are thinking to migrate. The only reason my brother wants to retain Singapore Citizenship is because of the low tax rates so he is trying to work something out.<br><br>The goverment must be secretly happy with the replacements. They do not  complain about Singapore. These replacements are too glad to have the Singapore Citizenship to complain. In return they can get million dollar salaries without anyone to question them. These new citizens will not bother to question the goverment on why OTC was denied the books of the reserves, or why GIC traders that are caught for insider trading are let off lightly because they are busy planning to make their exit. Its a win win situation!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i would not be too worry of singaporeans migrating or part time singapore PR or citizens,  afterall those left behind are equally good. There is no need for the gov and citizens to fear.<br><br>UNLESS they think otherwise.<br><br>Its good we singaporeans have the means to get a life and career overseas or even a home.  Only GCT try to use the word "quitters" to gain some publicity foothold here.  he just try to make those here feel a little better.  i am sure in his family circle sure got some stay on and so go for greener pasture or new jobs.<br><br>which is better , hold back or let go?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes, take home salary is more than what you would get in Singapore. The Aussie dollar is strong now so if you earn AUD and send back money your dollar will go further. Of course it varies by industry but on average that's how it is. It's just that if you want to lower tax even more, register your own business as a sideline and claim business expenses through there as it will reduce your overall taxable income.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well those that complain that old people have to lift trash bag at food courts or life is too fast here for an educated young graduate maybe you like to suggest  how we can earn our living when we don't have any oil or natural resources instead of complaining and complaining non stop.<br><br>I seem to remember those old friends and neighbours who left for "greener pastures" in 83 to australia or canada during a bad recession only to realise that   the place the went are good only if you are white and I'm not being prejudiced here, and sure you can make it if you willing to work hard taking any job like a bus driver, cleaner or working in macdonalds, jobs that white people don't want. They realise just how difficult it was and many sent their daughters back here to find work or send their sons back to do national service just so to get the citizenship, So what was the point to leave in the first place then?<br><br>Those that want to go it's up to you, it's your life, it's your choice but if you have the balls to talk big and want to go in the first place please don't ever come back here begging for work when things turn bad for you over there because you will be competiting for the local jobs with the true sons of this country who didn't cut tail and run.</div>
