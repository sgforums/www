Im living here now and I certainly haven't met any discrimination due to my race so far. Last I looked, I'm certainly not living like a rat. Sometimes YOUR own prejdices are what makes u think other people are racist. Hey I look at other Chinese people here, or even Singaporeans here, and sometimes I wonder: Whats the point of coming here to study if u're going to refuse to mix with the locals and just stick yo your little chinese communities and cliques?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  So if u're going to be one of those annoying "I refuse to mix with other communities" sort of person i think its best u stay where u were born, because u will feel 2nd class no matter where u go, be it china or uk.</div>

I don't just mix around with Singaporeans only and my social circle here is not just limited to my uni's singapore society like many other singaporeans here I know. Actually maybe it wa a good thing my university has no singaporeans because that means i started mixing with local people right from the start.

And yes, I agree that Singaporeans are one of the most racist people I've encountered. Just look at the number of threads which appear here on forusm where chinese slag off indians, indians slag off chinese, or both slag off malays. Its distressing to see. As a society, Singapore is rapidly turning into one where its people just cannot accept anyone else who is different from themselves in anyway. And honestly this has probably been the result of a government which, to have a proper career in politics, u cannot challenge their views or belong to any party other than their own.<br><br>Philosophically, how different is this from Communist USSR or Communist China in the 70s? Sure our government doesn't kill dissidents but the theory is still there: To ruin the lives of anyone who disagrees with u, and they've done this quite well with some prominent opposition members who've  raised some more questionable issues with the government. They use arcane laws to either sue or arrest them and make their lives uncomforbale, make them bankrupt and force them into exile by giving them no other option than to flee or stay and be destroyed. They don't kill dissidents, no at least not that we know of, but they certainly are very good at ruining their lives thru other means.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>what struck me the most since my return to Singapore is that the various communities seem to be gradually drifting apart. There was a time one used to see lots of interaction among the various communities be it the chinese, malays and the indians.

In their rush to bring in all this foreign nationals into singapore the government has failed to see the negative social impact on the local population such large number of migrants bring.  Lets be honest most of the migrants from china and india come from societys where they've probably never been to school with students from different cultures. i doubt chinese nationals from china have ever had indians or malays living in their towns or cities or even having gone to school with students from different cultures. The same goes for the indians that are moving in from india to singapore. i doubt any of these 'new indians' ever had chinese or malay friends in their neighbourhoods and communities back in india.<br><br>so how do we expect these foreign nationals who migrate here and take up our singapore citizenship to integrate overnight into our original vibrant and multicultural community here in singapore??? its taken us an entire generation to bond the various communities together. do we seriously expect these 'New Part Time Singaporeans' to integrate and understand the dynamics of our various communities overnight?</div>

Never had any problems myself, and yes I have been to the smaller villages etc. In a country of 60 million, there are bound to be a few cases. Remember, this is not the strraits times. They actually have journalists that write news stories.<br><br>Tbh, and many would disagree with me, Singapore is one of the most rascist countries I have been in. Look at the way we refer to bangeldeshis (or rather, small, dark skinned people) as bangalas. For your info, quite a number of these people are Singaporeans. Yes, shocking but true. They are not all foreigners. Look at the widely circulated "Ah beng vs Bagala" mp3 file. Not much consternation among singaporeans there huh.<br><br>edit: Not saying that The UK is perfect. Of course rascism exists, but it is not much more than to be expected of a democratic country where people are free to express their views.<br><br>You have to remember that just because someone was not nice to you does not mean he is a rascist. He might be an arrse hole period. Just look athe the happy slapping phenomenon. Seems to be perfectly non-discriminatory to me: They treat everyone with equal contempt.<br><br>My bike almost got stolen by a couple of kids. I certainly dun class that as a rascist attack because i know bikes are susceptoble to be stolen by kids.<br><br>By the way, what rascist incidents have you encoutnered?<br></div></blockquote>I understand what u meant.<br>But i really wonder how is it that almost every sporean<br>from my uni thinks so.<br><br>Its not that we stick to asian friends only,<br>we do have mix around with angmohs and other europeans.<br>i would say, incidents that happened usually involved<br>the angmoh youngsters and some older adult groups.<br>Those of college/uni students are fine.<br><br>Just one thought on Australia,<br>there is this MP famous for racist remarks isn't it???<br>Just how open and non-racist can a government be with such MP??<br><br>My concern is really, not wanting to be a second class citizen<br>in another country.<br>I have also read/heard of ABCs complaining of racism in US.<br>Even an immigrant country like US is like that.<br>Of cos not that serious i think.<br><br>On the Bangla case, i personally do not despise the race.<br>But for the troubles that some of them have brought to spore,<br>i do see a geniune problem particularly with the group of less<br>educated bangla, who perhaps have little moral education at all.<br>When so many people from such group create problems here,<br>how do u expect others to see them?<br><br>To me, they are the ah bengs from bangla.<br>The former are only harmless troublemakers.<br>The latter, from recent events, are alot worse bcos<br>they dun even have basic moral values.<br>On those numerous NYE incidents, it is not racism,<br>it is humanity, moral and even potential criminal issues.<br>(betw i refer to the lower-educated bangla in construction industry)<br>Have we imported a group of potential criminals???<br>Is it a case of geniune social problem disguised/misinterpreted as<br>racism issue???<br><br>Though on that bangla vs ah beng mp3 thing...its racism i must agree.<br>in some sense worse since it happened before those recent NYE incidents.<br>however, perhaps, that is an individual ah beng problem?<br>beside only verbal fights were involved.<br>can't compare with those NYE incidents.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In regards to racism in Oz, I agree with LazerLordz.<br><br>If we keep adopting our point of view in every circumstance with our interaction with other cultures, of course we will be misunderstood and it will be very easy to assume that a harmless piece of interaction has racist overtones.<br><br>We do this in Singapore as well with other cultures. Its pretty universal. People get along with others who act, speak and relate in similar means. This means that migrants need to assimilate to be understood and accepted.<br><br>We've been in Oz for almost 2 years now and are totally glad we moved. People are different truly, that is to be expected, and assimilating takes time but eventually, the aussies will accept you for who you are.<br><br>At work or at other casual interactions with neighbors or colleagues, its how willing we are to understand their point of view. Sure, they banter in pretty "crude" overtones, but that requires us to be witty enough to banter back to them.<br><br>I'm not suggesting its a more superior culture , but when one migrates, one has to expect that cultural assimilation is necessary to get along at work, with neighbors, casual colleagues and new friends here.</div>
