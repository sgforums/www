That choice is open to EVERYONE. But if someone WANTS to be cliquish, for WHATEVER reason, then if people think they're unfriendly and avoid befriending them, its because they appear UNFRIENDLY, its got NOTHING to do with their race. So before they want to accuse people of being racist, think if they THEMSELVES are making people avoid them for OTHER REASONS.<br><br>And now for the killer blow to your argument:<br><br>Its quite funny that people are selectively racist and befriend some asians while avoiding others isn't it? Thats the BIG GAPPING FLAW in whatever logic u have. <span style="color: red;"><strong>Racism is an irrational dislike of anyone of a certain race. If someone is racist against say, chinese people, it doesn't matter if i speak fluent english or not, or whether i fit in well or not.</strong></span> they will still be nasty to me. So whats the reason SOME asians aren't treated favourably in UK? well i've already said it over and over again, its too bad if u still cannot get it. Smart people here like Ged n Lazerlordz can definately understand what I'm saying</div>
