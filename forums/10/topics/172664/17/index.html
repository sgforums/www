Its elusive and u cannot put a finger on it, or on the culprit. Socially, its even more dangerous than clearly defined cases of assault.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by snow leopard:</div><div class="quote_body">however, your judgement of what other people thinks is merely a function of your own biasedness. someone thinks like you, you say he thinks alright. someone doesn't think like you, you say there's something he doesn't realise. how do you make yourself to be the authority of judgement that everyone else has to be benchmarked against?</div></blockquote>well, would u prefer me to gloat in everyone's face and say "i told u so" or would u prefer people just take it a bit more into regard and nip things in the bud? The problem is, it IS there, there are signs of a problem, u can't just attribute someone's denial to simple basis of different perception. The point is im not benchmarking people's judgement against mine. i gain nothing from that. however, i AM trying to wake people up to the fact that things are not what they seem, and hope to prevent the preventable, and improve things.<br><br>How does denial help, even if I were to allow for difference in perception and judgement? When someone tells me UK is extremely racist, I don't say "there is no racism in uk" I agree that there is racism but its not on the level of "extremity", and that its heartening that that effort is being undertaken to further reduce this, whereas when i point out racism exist in sg, the instinctive reply from people like u are to say "there is no racism in sg" which is definately not true. however, if u were to say "yes there is, although there is a cause for social concern, it is currently within manageable levels" then there wouldn't be a need to carry this discussion further. instead, u choose outright denial any racial sentiments in sg.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by snow leopard:</div><div class="quote_body">if your basis for argument is again based on your belief that there are more toilet graffiti in singapore than in UK, I suggest you show some proof first. before you say i'm ignoring toilet graffiti, show me that you're not ignoring toilet graffiti in UK.</div></blockquote>my basis on this agument is based not only on the toilet doors, which is just one example within sg, but also based on what i observe based on how races interact. for eg, when amongst themselves, chinese make less than favourable observations and comments about the indians. Their racist nature, and the fact that they're not 'mild jokes' becomes very clear when u consider that no chinese in their right mind would utter them in front of indians, except when they are out to offend. And I have personally seen the racial epithets used by many singaporeans, which are bodering on the offensive.<br><br>As for toilets, u might want to claim this is ridiculous, but I have been to lots of toilets in UK and Sg, and honestly, I do encounter much less toilet graffiti in UK. The main sort of graffiti prevalent here are the wall type, such as that by banksy, more a form of free art, and tagging, than of the toilet graffiti type. And thus far, I have not seen street graffiti of a racial nature. No doubt there are some, but I have not seen any yet. As for toilet graffiti in SG, u could argue that I remember more because I've spent a longer time in SG, but it is the fact that I have not personally seen any in the UK thus far, despite having visited a myraid of major and minor towns and cities both North and South. Ok yes u can argue that what I personally encounter does not account for the absolute truth, but my stand remains that although racism might be more common in uk than sg, sg's racism is not non-existant, and should be something we constantly keep in mind, as a problem to be solved.</div>

This had been acknowledged outside Singapore for a long time already.<br><br>Moreover, the article also mentioned that the employer contribution to our CPF is less than half the optimum rate. It's 45% in the UK, and 55% in USA, while Singapore's a tiny 13% (I think). No wonder retired Singaporeans still have to get menial jobs to survive. According to economists, the optimum CPF rate is 30%, so as to compensate for inflation and fluctuating interest rates over the years.<br><br>We had been duped for so long!!!<br><br><strong>Singaporeans deserve to migrate!!!</strong></div>
