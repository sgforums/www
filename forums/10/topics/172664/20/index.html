Surely there are differing views on what is a good life and don't think only you know what it is. We are also enjoying ourselves here in singapore, if not many of us are even more qualified to migrate to other places, but now those places are holidays destinations to us, singapore remains our home.<br><br>Luxurous lifes are more than just differing views, you got to be able to afford it. In places like UK with supplies short luxuries are even less affordable. In singapore we can do without maids and maintain our own little privacy, or can choose to have a maid so that we can have dinner at home then go out for a drink and a movie while the maid does the cleaning up, you don't have that choice. If we have old parents we can choose to employ a maid to help her AT HOME, you can only send them to old folk homes. We have a choice here in luxuries, the choice in itself is a luxury, is the power, so don't talk to me about shallow physical luxuries. There are also many people living in luxuries in UK, are those shallow physical luxuries to you, or just sour grapes?<br><br>We choose our lives and you choose yours, if you need to run down singaporeans just to find meaning in your own life, you are pathetic.</div></blockquote>Are u?

Maybe u think its something to be proud of, the ability to employ cheap maids, but I'm glad that I'm in a country where I can pay someone a wage they are deserving of as a FELLOW HUMAN BEING, rather than trample all over the rights of others for as cheap a reason as a choice in luxuries. U want to talk about luxuries? Why don't we compare the price of housing and the price of cars? Why don't u tell me what brand new car u can buy for under S$20,000? How about a luxury apartment u can buy that sits within district 10 for uder S$300,000? Luxuries indeed. When it comes to the real luxuries, the big money ones, Singapore can't even begin to compare. Don't make me laugh. An underpaid a luxury? Sour grapes? Not even close!<br><br>I don't need to run down Singaporeans to find meaning in my life. I just like to call it as it is. On the other hand tho, I see u need to boast about having the choice to contribute to unfair employment practices just so u can sound smug and accuse me of sour grapes. Lets just say u speak as though I've never lived in Sg. Been there, done it, don't like it. And the need for u to resort to this? Now that might fit the bill of 'pathetic' better. I sure hope not tho.

What is the cause and what is the effect?  </div></blockquote>ok noted yr last post<br><br>going on to the next point...<br><br>Migrating to UK means u're invariably exposed to a whole host of European languages. Everyone here I know knows French, German or Spanish in addition to English. When everyone knows some other language other than english, u actually find yourself wanting to pick one up too. Additionally, although cantonese is not quite a seperate language in itself, im trying to pick it up so I can understand my hong kong friends so they don't have to speak in english for my benefit. Finally, I'm getting to practice my mandrin a lot more, which I didn't really have a chance in Sg because we speak so much in english n singlish, and im being forced to practice to speak it more in a manner as pure mandrin should be spoken, instead of mandrin with a smattering of singlish. Why? Interaction with the PRCs of course.<br><br>In USA, I can point out a similiar reason why people are exposed to other languages.<br><br>Canada? French is widely spoken there. I would love to make sure I learn French should I ever end up there.<br><br>As for Oz n NZ, just their accent alone is enuf to classify it as another language!!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>I disagree about the reason your friends gave not being absurd. Uprooting oneself should be done with a higher ideal in mind, not something as biase as one's offspring not being able to cope with their native language. Maybe its commendable that they love their children so much, but as a reason its quite absurd. Imagine if the French moves to England because their kids can't deal with French. Its just a shame that they have to forsake Mandrin. Spoken correctly it's as beautiful as French any day.<br><br>And while hundreds of students go overseas to study, how do u know them all well enough to say ALL of them go overseas to study only and had no thoughts of migration beforehand? I'm one of the hundreds u refer to, and I came here with the aim of migration in mind. So already I disprove your statement that 'They did not go there because they thought they might want to migrate.' Afterall, I did say that many already have a rough aim of settling elsewhere, hence the decision to go overseas for studies. I didn't say ALL, while u seem to be speaking for that hundreds of us who choose to go overseas. I sure as hell didn't see u starting your sentence with "SOME of them did not go there because...."<br><br>so whats the cause and effect? for MANY, as i have stated in my previous post, the cause is the need to migrate, and the effect is studying overseas.</div>

Remember, I only said that they CAN earn up to 6000 pounds a week. It depends on how hardworking they are. Emergency jobs in the middle of the night etc pays more. Thats how those who earn that much make their money.<br><br>Lets say we take vito's number of S$10,000 pcm.<br><br>in a year they make $120,000.<br><br>that makes a weekly wage of S$2037.70 (rounded up)<br><br>as plumbers don't do 5 day weeks, we can assume a daily wage of S$329.70 (rounded up again)<br><br>assuming working hours of 8 to 5 for them, although many of them do 24 hour calls, thats 9 hours a working day. 5 jobs a day is an underestimate. I've seen how hard these guys work. They eat a quick lunch in their vans, something like 20 min. They would easily do 6 or 7 jobs a day, even more if the areas are close together. Lets assume 6 jobs. It comes up to S$54.95(rounded up again) per job. Gee that doesnt seem too bad compared to your S$40 does it? For S$15 per job, I get to live in a place where I would spend approx S$60,000 less on a car of the same model in both countries. I think thats a good bargain really.<br><br>of course, im not really using this as a judgement of how good it is to live here. no that would be kinda silly. however, i hope to show u that its silly to think that everything must be much more expensive than in Sg.</div>

I live my life you live yours, what is there to justify? I was just responding to some stupid one sided biased views on Singapore. I have gone through life as a full time student. I am now a husband and a father. I no longer depend on others but people are depending on me now, my children, my parents who have just retired. What I do with my life not only affect me but also several people around me. As a student, you have long long way to go. I certainly don't have to justify my life to you.<br><br>There are 4 millions people living in Singapore, our conscience is clear in what we like and what we don't, doesn't matter what you see. Really, why is this of any concern to you? With a head hit against the wall 9999 times, what that head thinks is really questionable to us. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>I din't say I was proud of having a maid. I said I was glad I could have that choice. Foreign workers including maids employment in this part of the world provide for the thousand of poor families in some countries. How well you treat your maid at home are different stories. Don't give me that crap about human rights. If you haven't been out on a full time job don't talk to me about unfair employment practice. Just make sure the UK companies don't come here and employ cheap labour in the name of outsourcing.<br><br>You want to compare singapore with london or with UK? I may have to pay for expensive cars but my alternative is taxis besides buses and MRT, can you afford to take a cab in london? What kind of apartment can you get for S$300,000 at mayfair, knightbridge or kensington? let me tell you this, for 250,000 lbs you probable can't even get a decent studio apartment! don't talk about something you have hardly any idea!! you certainly don't know anything about everything in the places where you live, your "been there" is not very credible.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>In what way are we sucked in our system?? Actually,  I will be flattered if the government of singapore don't want me to migrate. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br>I don't know about america or UK, I can easily migrate to australia and canada as economic migrants. It is my choice that I do not exercise, may be I have too many good friends here, I have relatives with whom I have strong bond here, that's what I call home, and my ideal is to have a happy home.<br>I don't want to accuse you of anything, enjoy your life there. It would be bad if I start telling you the ugly sides of UK. If you don't believe in anything good in singapore, care to share some good things in UK? I don't remember reading any.<br></div>

Try talking to those friends of mine who were forced to do something else other than what they really want to do in school, because they were deemed "not good enough" and then see if u and those 4 million others can come and talk to me about having a clear conscience.

House help is available to anyone who wants to hire one. the only catch is, u have to treat them like human isn't it? Yea that choice is available here too, so whats there to be glad about? Its not exclusive to Singapore. Unless u're of course, talking about being glad that is CHEAPER in sg. Hey if not, good. U're glad the choice exists in sg, im glad the choice exists in UK, everybody has that choice. So whats your point? U speak as tho its illegal to hire househelp in UK lidat.<br><br>And oooo oooo oooo.... getting touchy are we? Why not human rights? My dad does ISO stuff. I know on the inside, just how strictly working safety standards are enforced both in UK and Sg. His company happens to be a UK company with a branch in Sg. Ya? And I'll talk about unfair employment practices as much as I want to. How is it that McDonalds here will pay me over 7 pounds an hour while McDonalds Sg will only pay S$3.50, and thats if they decide to hire me at all? burgers only cost twice as much here so how come im being paid almost 7 times more? should I be paid 3 times more only?<br><br>Hey, think about it, sg's living standards are about 2 and a half times lower on average. So if they come to sgand employ "cheap labour" according to your standard of living, how is that being dirty? But if they brought u over to UK to work for them, do they still pay u according to sg living standards or UK standards? I know a guy who's only 18 yrs old and only just started his uni yea? for one year, ONE year, before he started uni, he went to work for a civil eng firm, just one year. He's chinese. U know how much they paid him? 18,000 pounds a year. For a non-uni grad. THATS how workers are treated in UK. U want to blame someone when they come to sg to outsource? Blame yr own govt for making all of u cheap labour.</div>

The whole education system in singapore is a mental conditioning process. it conditions u to think u won't make it if u leave the singapore system. it conditions u to think that singapore's system is the best, and that there is nothing better out there in the world. it conditions u to think that patriotism equals supporting the PAP. No doubt u will be flattered if they don't want u to migrate, but the truth is, they don't give a damn. Because they know most of u can't migrate. Doesn't have to be for monetary reasons. Sentimental reasons, social reasons, anything. Thats why I say so many people have been sucked in deep. Just to consider leaving Singapore is a very scary thought.<br><br>Anyways, yes u have your reasons. But to refuse to recognise that Singapore has too many undemocratic angles, too many instances of refusing to treat humans as humans and treating humans like cogs in a machine, is to allow something that is bad to continue to propagate. This thread afterall, is about reasons for migration. So it would be within the topic to talk about Singapore, and why people want to migrate. If someone started a thread on why people choose to migrate to UK, I'll talk about what I find good and what I find bad here, as well as what I feel is a fair trade-off in exchange for freedom and acceptance.<br><br>The problem is, like u, my ideal is to have a happy home as well. IF i ever choose to have kids, I don't want them to suffer the same system I did, which never did anything to encourage me to pursue my ambitions, a system which laughed in my face for daring to dream and be different, a system which told me im not living in reality if I decide that I want to exercise my rights as an individual and not mindlessly serve as just another manufacturered human clone cog in the system machine. I want them to learn that great things are possible within each and every human being, and that there are no boundries to what they can achieve. I can't do that with a system that, at every turn, punishes them for daring to be themselves and be different. I don't think I can forgive myself if, IF i ever had kids and subjected them to that. And perhaps, the reason I come down so hard on sg is so that maybe, maybe someday, it can become a place where I can raise my children content in the knowledge that they won't face discrimination and discouragement for being different. Maybe I won't have to permanently become another victim of the system designed to serve a few ruling families in Sg.</div>

There is a Sporean lady migrated to Australia n met with a racist. She went to comment sometimes she cannot understand there is some local already migrated to Australia n had the audacity to complain the local in Australia not hardworking, in Spore in almost every company, the local need to work until late at night sometimes as late as ten.<br>In Australia, as soon as five, they knocked off already. Isn it Sporean migrated to Australia cause of the laid back lifestyle?</div>
