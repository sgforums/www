So i don't think u can say that..<br></strong><br><br>so your annecdotal evidence gives you the right to deny what i said based on my anecdoctal experience?  if you can say what your experience tells you, then why can't i say what my experience tells me?<br><br><strong><br>without definations, how can u even classify what is racism? We need definations or anything can be racism and anything can also not be racism. Perhaps we need to remember that the problem with UK, one which I definately find a problem, is that crime rate is higher, especially violent crime. When within a society, violent crime is more common, so does this become a manifestation not only for racism, but also for sexism, religionism, homophobia, and other discriminatory attitudes.<br></strong><br><br>yes but we also need to understand deifnitions properly.  many words have double meanings, including racism.  racism the mentality is very distinct from racism the deed.  yes you're right, crime rate in general is higher in the UK, including violent crime, sexism ... and racism.  that's why racism is indeed more common in the UK, as are most other crime types.<br><br><strong><br>The bottomline is, as long as there are such racist attitudes within people, whether they manifest themselves as cases of violence where u can easily identify a victim and a culprit, or as cases of "mild" action where its hard to identify a victim and culprit, and thus harder to act on, people WILL be affected by it, their quality of life lowered, and hurt will happen. It doesn't matter HOW racism is manifested. As long as it is manifested in some way, it must be treated with the strictest authority.<br></strong><br><br>dun agwee.  on the one hand, toilet graffitti is simply good for laughs, on the other hand outright racial abuse in broad daylight inflicts real pain and suffering.<br><br>it does matter.  racist attitudes existing in people's minds but subjugated by higher human influences like conscience, religion, upbringing or education means racism never becomes manifested in real life.<br><br><strong><br>And that unfriendly stare u are talking about? Its prevalent in Singapore alright. U just need to know where to go. Any non-malay who got stared at by a gang of Malay teens late at night walking along HDB void decks, or non-chinese who got "tiao" by a bunch of chinese ah bengs n lians, can testify to.<br></strong><br><br>what i more commonly hear of is malays beating up malays and chinese beating up chinese ...<br><br><strong><br>Sorry I disagree as well. I do not think the definations are mutually exclusive. They are mutually inclusive. And if u agree that a belief or attitude is racism, then no matter how basic a level u believe it to be, it still counts as racism. Item 2 is not what I normally consider racism. I consider racism as inclusive of both 1 and 2. And I don't tolerate either. I don't see why we should have to tolerate one and not the other. As long as 1 exists, 2 will always be manifested in some severity.<br></strong><br><br>no problems.  many words have double or triple meanings.  since the dictionary bothers to differentiate the definitions into 1 and 2, 1 and 2 are indeed distinct from each other so while they are both classified under the umbrella term racism, racism the thought is distinct from racism the act, much like flashing and rape are both sexual offences but are entirely different.  1 is one component of our composite rationality that includes other influences good and bad.  given we're no saints, 1 is merely a component of the imperfection we are as human beings.  2 is a manifestation of 1 that has reared its ugly end and let loose uncontrollably.  so while you have fantasies about someone, the fact that you're controlled and do not commit acts of sin doesn't make you a criminal.  you may be no saint, but neither are you as deplorable as a criminal.  that distinction has to be maintained, otherwise everyone would be in jail by now.<br><br><strong><br>Ok while I agree with u that based on an individual case level, comparing ONE case of wall scribbling to ONE case of assault would make an assault more serious. But if u look at it from a wider social pt of view, an assault is actually easier to crack down on, as there are definative victims and culprits. In the case of scribblings, they are not only more widespread, it is harder to identify AND quantify the number of victims AND culprits, and it is virtually impossible to act on it. In fact because there is virtually no way we can act on the scribblings, they end up foistering more covert racist hatred. I have to wonder why racist hatred simmering quietly under the surface can be said to be any better than racist hatred sporadically bursting into the open. Just like forest fires, what u can see, u can fight. What u can't see, such as underground peat fires, not only u can't fight, it can burst into life at the least expected moment, and cause more damage than anyone ever imagined.<br></strong><br><br>your entire argument rests with your single annecdoctal evidence that toilet scribblings are more prevalent here.  since your annecdoctal evidence is as good as mine and mine counters yours, you really do not have much weight except your own opiniated judgement in saying that the underground peat fire here is burning much more strongly.  truth is, just about every square inch of underground real estate here has already been converted to tunnels, malls, ammo dumps and bomb shelters.  if there's any peat fire glowing from beneath, its where you're standing right now.<br><br><strong><br>I hold the view that be it racist attitudes, or racist actions, both are VERY damaging, and in fact, as a racist attutude is the bedrock of racist actions, we should be wary more of racist attitudes more than racist actions, regardless of what is defined by the dictionary.<br></strong><br><br>racial attitudes, if they're not deeply entrenched and are overidden by stronger influences like conscience, religion, upbringing will not in any way damage anything.  racist actions directly cause harm and damage.  they are very different.<br></blockquote></div>

From young we are taught we cannot fight or hit others. And we are stricter with discipline. Thats what makes a difference, with regards to all violent crime, racially motivated or not. I bet if the people here were stricter with their kids, the number of racial assaults would go down too. But does that mean racism is really lowered? I don't think so. So neither do I think that a lack of racial assaults means there is no racism in sg.</div></blockquote>both.  if racism is as rife as you say, then within any category of crime, we would find higher incidences of interracial crimes as opposed to intra-racial crimes.  but do we find that in practice here?  we don't.  therefore social and other influences not only suppresses crime rates, they also suppress racism.  in other words, UK can become stricter but if they don't teach racial tolerance, even if their overall assault cases go down, the proportion of assaults attributable to racism will not.<br><br>so yes, lack of racial assaults when assaults do happen suggests racism is not rife here.</div>

When the conversation is in English, one person will just cut in and start speaking Mandarin so as to deliberately exclude minorities from the conversation." is true, because I have observed this quite a few times before. Of course many times others will remind the offender that there are non-chinese speakers around and remind them to be sensitive and use a common language. This is something that makes me feel heartened about the prospects of improvement of racism within singapore.<br></strong><br><br>the only reason why the british do not "cut into" a conversion amongst different races using their own language is because english is the only language they speak.  try going out with a group of French, Spanish, Italian, they cut in just the same.  why label us racists on such harmless charge when in fact every human species is guilty of the same act?<br><br><strong><br>yes we can. These are private grieviances, not proper official reports. If they think that they have been subject to racism, why not make a report? Perhaps they have an inkling that they don't actually have a case? I don't know.<br></strong><br><br>you can because you are encouraged by the UK govt to report anything, even private grievances.  hence you are crying racism only as easily as the authorities would allow or encrouage you to, not as easily as you would want to.<br><br><strong><br>Oh incidently I had my 1st slightly "racist" encounter yesterday. I was invited to a karaoke session by some HK people. The whole time it was cantonese songs and they all spoke cantonese except my friend who spoke english to me. How ironic that Chinese people can feel excluded by other Chinese, but I just choose to see it as due to them feeling uncomfortable conversing in English. Of course when you look at it, when even a fellow chinese feels excluded and "cliqued" out, u don't expect the whites to feel all warm and fuzzy about them. Then its easy for them to think that the whites are being racist against them.<br></strong><br><br>strangely, you're understanding towards hongkies being 'racist', understanding towards angmohs being 'racist' yet you cannot tolerate your fellow singaporean being 'racist', when in actual fact they are all the same?  what is wrong?<br><br><strong><br>To be honest, perhaps the problem in UK is more one of national identity, not racism.<br></strong><br><br>why such a nicely worded term for the UK and not for Singapore?  are you completely unbiased?<br><br><strong><br>Never underestimate the power of racism. I'm not actually saying its serious. I'm saying we should be concerned about it because its more serious than we think. To put this into perspective, for eg, I will say on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being most serious, Singapore's racism is not serious, meaning lower than 5. Lets say theoratically, its actual rating is 3. Most people in Singapore think its rating is only 1. This is what I mean by more serious than people think. Sure on an absolute scale, it might not be that serious, but it shouldn't be underestimated. And like I said, as long as the bedrock for racist actions exist, we should always be wary. Complacency is always one of the 1st factors leading to downfall.<br></strong><br><br>you think it's 3, other people thinks its 1, so be it.  there are other things that are 9 or 10, like being retrenched at 40, both parents forced to slave long hours so much so that kids are neglected and ending up delinquent ...<br></blockquote></div>

And that attitude is often seen, even if you don't see it much. Ok fine u can think its not serious at all. But like I said, underestimating a problem is often the 1st step to encouraging it to flare up even more. Whether u like it or not, racism is obvious enough to many of the younger generation who, thanks to the govt's efforts in promoting racial harmony, tend to see the small signs that are the tip of the iceberg. Im not just the only one who feels there is more racism in Sg than there should be for such a small country. And being Singaporean, I do wish that the situation would improve, regardless of where I choose to settle. Lack of assaults just mean policing is better in Singapore. It doesn't prevent people from being disallowed to go on overseas community charity work just because they're Malay, or from Singaporean studenrs in NUS making discriminatory remarks agains the PRCs or from Singaporeans looking at Filipinos as nothing better than paid slaves. It wouldn't prevent Malays from having a smaller chance of going to OCS, it wouldn't prevent a lot of racism that has so become our daily life that perhaps u no longer consider them worth noticing or worrying about.</div>

And that attitude is often seen, even if you don't see it much. Ok fine u can think its not serious at all. But like I said, underestimating a problem is often the 1st step to encouraging it to flare up even more. Whether u like it or not, racism is obvious enough to many of the younger generation who, thanks to the govt's efforts in promoting racial harmony, tend to see the small signs that are the tip of the iceberg. Im not just the only one who feels there is more racism in Sg than there should be for such a small country. And being Singaporean, I do wish that the situation would improve, regardless of where I choose to settle. Lack of assaults just mean policing is better in Singapore. It doesn't prevent people from being disallowed to go on overseas community charity work just because they're Malay, or from Singaporean studenrs in NUS making discriminatory remarks agains the PRCs or from Singaporeans looking at Filipinos as nothing better than paid slaves. It wouldn't prevent Malays from having a smaller chance of going to OCS, it wouldn't prevent a lot of racism that has so become our daily life that perhaps u no longer consider them worth noticing or worrying about.</div></blockquote>i know by now toilet scribblings are just as bad to you as broad daylight assault.  you should also know by now they are worlds apart not only to me but to many other people as well.  assaults do happen but the proportion of interracial assaults is too low to sugggest there is racism here.  there may be a thousand and one reasons why one is rejected if only we had asked.  one discriminatory remark suggests the inmmaturity of that particular student but does not represent the rest nor suggest that the student population in general are racists.  filipinos treated like slaves is really no different from us being treated like slaves, hence is not discrimination but nationwide exploitation.  fewer malays go to OCS is just like there are no ethnic chinese soldiers in the malaysian armed forces.</div>
