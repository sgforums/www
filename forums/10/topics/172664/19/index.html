(He was about 40 years then). Oversea, the payment for service work is very much more then here. That is mainly because there don't allow "foreign talent" for such jobs. They are paid very well which I do agree.<br><br>However, one needed to take note the places can be very far away for some residential to find a plumber, some might be just county and not even a town.<br><br>The customer there are also more professional enough to pay as charge instead of asking for discount because they respected their professional work provided. You needed to be licensed by the authority.<br><br>Please don't ask me why the market for such job is so bad here. I don't wish to speculate. Anyway I only believe engaging local singaporean to perform such tasks which is also killing my business due to undercutting by other player.

            <div class='col-md body'>Just look at the mrt trains nowadays. There are so many commuters filling up the trains leaving with no seats and cabin full of people... where do all these people come from...wonder why all of sudden it is so crowded?

Generally employer or interviewer may have a better thinking of you when you are a officer when you applying for jobs later.

I have so far not heard of any people immigrate because of NS. What so frightening about NS?

Its as simple as that.<br><br>To think that people who migrate do so because they 'cannot tahan' 2nd language is absurd. Often those who migrate pick up a lot more languages. Also, many people who migrate usually don't do so simply because they studied there. If one gets a job after studying overseas, one must already have gone overseas for studies with an eye towards a future overseas. If u don't plan on having a future overseas, whats there to stop u from returning home and getting a job back home? The reasons it SEEMS that many people who migrate study overseas 1st, is a simple case of cause and effect. The cause being the want to migrate, and the effect being studying overseas. I'm afraid u might have mixed it up and exchanged the cause for the effect and vice versa.</div>

Surely there are differing views on what is a good life and don't think only you know what it is. We are also enjoying ourselves here in singapore, if not many of us are even more qualified to migrate to other places, but now those places are holidays destinations to us, singapore remains our home.<br><br>Luxurous lifes are more than just differing views, you got to be able to afford it. In places like UK with supplies short luxuries are even less affordable. In singapore we can do without maids and maintain our own little privacy, or can choose to have a maid so that we can have dinner at home then go out for a drink and a movie while the maid does the cleaning up, you don't have that choice. If we have old parents we can choose to employ a maid to help her AT HOME, you can only send them to old folk homes. We have a choice here in luxuries, the choice in itself is a luxury, is the power, so don't talk to me about shallow physical luxuries. There are also many people living in luxuries in UK, are those shallow physical luxuries to you, or just sour grapes?<br><br>We choose our lives and you choose yours, if you need to run down singaporeans just to find meaning in your own life, you are pathetic.</div>
