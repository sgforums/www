Just do like 2 or 3 websites or software packages a year to make it seem like you are "in business". Otherwise, my primary job is still working for a corporation. Moonlighting is acceptable in Australia, so long as it doesn't affect your performance. You are not required to declare other jobs with the employer, only the tax office will know. If you register a business, whatever income that you obtain from that business will be added to your taxable income. Similarly, whatever net losses you make are deducted from your taxable income.<br><br>There is a lot more stuff, if you are interested you should find out more from the ATO (www.ato.gov.au). There are certain rules like if you buy certain assets you are only allowed to depreciate them over a period of time and not claim it as an expense immediately, unless you claim it under "cost of goods sold". There's a lot of reading to do, but if you can master it and still stay legal, you have effectively "played the system".</div>

Of course there'll be the odd case where the singaporean migrant may encounter some of the less educated type but this to me seems to be the exception rather than the norm. At a guess I'd say the singaporean living in australia receives no less hassling than the australian living in singapore.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Problems that we faced is nothing new. Since early 1980s, the first batch of sg elites began to move out of the country. As the global economy structure matures, together with the digital age tech revolution, alot of Singaporeans find their personal space for development overseas (some in first world countries like US and UK, while others find it in our neighbouring countries Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand or China / HK / Taiwan).<br><br>Why?<br>Singapore is a small country running very effectively using a set of rules and regulations, together with a lot of top-down "monitoring". This type of typical Sg system thrive in city state like Singapore, it encourages mass consensus over personal innovation.<br><br>Hence, alot of younger gen Singaporeans decided to have their own style of living - this is absolutely nothing wrong or shame of. We as human beings need to have our own unique development paths. And in Sg, the paths available for Singaporean seems to be too limited or constraint due to some out-dated social values and contradiction with the conventional Sg model.<br><br>When time are good, all the under grad in our university just take up Business studies or Accountacy. When biotech is in the heat, u see all go towards the bio sector. I still have a large pool of friends from Civil Engg were forced to change their job after our property bubble burst in 1999-2000. many are good engineers, some went overseas and found their second spring in China / Vietnam. Those who stayed, are switching to new jobs like finance consultants and insurance agents, tution teachers or school teachers. This add-on to many agonies as they found mismatching expection between their job and their personal goals. As pressure build up, more singaporeans decided to move on to other places for opporunities.<br><br></div>
