Since Singapore can attract foreign talent why wont our talent migrate in the first place. This is a result of globalisation friend. Everyone strive for a better environment. People cant keep in pace and cant tolerate the policies in Singapore will surely migrate. Ask them why and they will surely give u a list of sonvincing reasons.</div>

Even their triad (ganster) member also the same in foreign countries. (You don't see any angmo or asian inside). They give a helping hand to their fellow country man when they are in needs. (Especially hongkee and taiwanese, malaysian too).  Most owner of the restaurants are Hongkee and malaysian as chef for some. You don't try it with singaporean, very few will help you out.<br>I had experienced both good and bad, considered very lucky to met some offering helping hands. Thanks to those who lifted me when I am in needs.<br><br>The problems that singaporean no taking services job is mainly due to the pay, long working hours, no nice uniform and maybe pride for some. This not entirely their faults, it is the way that they were brought up. For a foreigner to work in singapore, the amount received to him or her can be multipled depends on when he came from<br>a) Malaysia - 2.3 times<br>b) China - 5 times<br>Then we compare their pay to those of the same line back in their own countries which could be even more. For your information, a production worker in Zhejiang may be only 1500 RMP (lodging, meal clothing and washing included) about S$300. And in Singapore, he may get a $1000 including overtime = 5000 RMP and with control spending and some sidelines. He is earning like a assistant manager back home. Tell me why no?

You can try the Australia which I am qualified. If I sell my house here and withdraw all CPF, the amount exceeded. My qualification and working experience is relevant to their and there is a demand for it.

I think the same for uncle in Indonesia wated to immigrate to Australia cause Indonesia is a not a stable country many problem like corruption or rampant crime. He is a married person n he still planned to go to Australia. Local young chap here never realized sometimes they think life is easy outside of Spore n to tell u one thing, met with<br>a Sporean n he worked as taxi driver in NZ in one of the small cities. Coming back to HK n Taiwanese people, they willing to work in America or Canada for eight to<br>twelve hour at the dim sum restaurant. I wonder if our local young chap can tahan this kind of thing in America or Canada.</div>
