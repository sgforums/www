Thanks<br><br>u've made a small mistake there. B is not saying racism in uk is a lot more worse than racism is in sg. B is telling A racism is a lot more serious, period. A is saying its a lot less than B claims. So in effect, what B feels can be a function of his own experience too. But when there have been similiar experiences? Such as experiences thru interaction with bus drivers, tube staff, people on the streets, store owners? 1stly B made a false claim that A's experiences are only limited to A's circle of friends, without bothering to check if that is true.<br><br>2ndly, it IS easier to assume by yourself that u've encountered racism, when the encounter may entirely be because the other party was drunk, the other party is impolite by nature, or other factors. Unless u actually go and ask if the other party is seemingly discriminatory towards u due to your race, it is totally improper to simply lay the blame for all disfavourable encounters on racism alone. Don't u agree? <strong><span style="color: red;">&lt;-- If this doesn't contain any logic or sense at all, please tell me. But if it does make sense and logic, even if you disagree, please don't dismiss it. Either find a counterargument, or if you can't, let it stand.</span></strong><br><br>Of course, if u want to do a comparism about UK and Sg, then i will tell u that I've more often seen Singaporeans, in your own words "barge right up to a person for no reason whatsover in the world and shout profanities into his face" Yes I've seen Singaporeans do that to foreign Bangladeshi/Pakistani/Indian construction workers quite a few times. I've seldom seen any white people do the same here. Of course I will declare again that because I've not seen it doesn't mean it doesn't happen. I'm sure it does, but again, not on a large scale as some people keep claiming here. Like I said again, if the cases of racist incidents reported is only 0.17% of the entire population of a city, does than mean the entire city is extremely racist?<br><br>Lets not forget we're using intelligent logic and reasoning to support our arguments here. You cannot deny the fact that although NuLife raised the fact that there was 400+ cases of racism in Plymouth in 2005, The population of Plymouth is factually 250,000. While I did not disregard his fact that there WERE 400+ cases of racism in Plymouth, when I raised the fact that Plymouth alone has a population of 250,000 and that means there was only a 0.17% racist incident rate, he tried to dismiss it as though it is not a fact. U really should think twice before labelling who is abusive and who is not. If u read properly, the discussion with NuLife turned ugly when he started the personal insults 1st. I don't dismiss his facts, to remind you. I take his facts, and I find out what he missed out, what he did not represent, or what alternative views might have led to the occurance of his facts. The only thing I don't do is to simply dismiss them. This, unfortunately, is not something I can say for many here. when they see a counter-argument they cannot debate against, they simply dismiss it with attacks on a person's personal honour, such as saying that they spent "a few seconds" looking up facts. Even more surprising are the number of people who think this is acceptable.<br><br>with KSJ, that was another matter, and I usually tend to stay civilized with people. There are more people here on forums who can testify to that fact then there are those who think otherwise. I don't suffer fools gladly, and its apologetic that I might tred on their toes, but sometimes they bring it upon themselves by not sticking purely to using reason and logic to argue.</div>

May be they better stay at home. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> </div></blockquote>look, im sorry if you've only been here for 4 days and had bad experiences in a short stay. maybe u would care to tell me what happened?<br><br>And how is it ridiculous to compare the relative population? That is the way everything is calculated in this world, from GDP, GNP, to crime rates. You can't possibly tell me a village with 20 people in total and all of them are racist is a better place to live than a village with 500 people and 40 of them are racist? That is just absurd. While there might be a higher absolute number of racists, the physical location is bigger, there are more non-racists as well, and as such, not only is the chance of meeting a racist lesser, the social attitude is that racism is not acceptable due to there being a higher number of non-racist people. <strong><span style="color: red;">&lt;-- If this doesn't contain any logic or sense at all, please tell me.

            <div class='col-md body'>to make a small summary:<br><br>Nulife says in Plytmouth alone there have been 400+ cases of racism. I agree, because this is a fact. However, I will also point out that Plytmouth has a population of 250,000 and this means that there is only an approx 0.17% of racist incidents in Plytmouth. Assuming that every case was commited by a different indivudual, this means only 0.17% of Plytmouth's population are racist. Even supposing that every case involved 2 different persons, only 0.34% of the population are racist. When we consider the fact that some cases have the same offenders, it balances out, so lets take 0.34% as the arbitary figure for % racism of Plytmouth's population. Isn't 0.34% a very small figure to be honest? It would mean that out of every 100 people you meet, the chances that you will meet even 1 racist is very small. <strong><span style="color: red;">&lt;-- If this doesn't contain any logic or sense at all, please tell me. But if it does make sense and logic, even if you disagree, please don't dismiss it.

            <div class='col-md body'>Another point I would like to point out would be that a large portion of racially motivated crime in UK is carried out by coloured people against white people. Bear in mind that when arguing that UK whites are extremely racist, a large portion of racial crime commited AGAINST white people will have to be discounted, thus lowering the validity of the argument for UK whites being extreme racists. <strong><span style="color: red;">&lt;-- If this doesn't contain any logic or sense at all, please tell me.

I've seldom seen any white people do the same here. Of course I will declare again that because I've not seen it doesn't mean it doesn't happen. I'm sure it does, but again, not on a large scale as some people keep claiming here. Like I said again, if the cases of racist incidents reported is only 0.17% of the entire population of a city, does than mean the entire city is extremely racist?<br></strong><br><br>your experience might be unique.  randomly go around the country, pick people and ask the same question, then see what answers you get.<br><br>is 0.17% a significant number?  is it even meaningful?<br><br><strong><br>Lets not forget we're using intelligent logic and reasoning to support our arguments here. You cannot deny the fact that although NuLife raised the fact that there was 400+ cases of racism in Plymouth in 2005, The population of Plymouth is factually 250,000. While I did not disregard his fact that there WERE 400+ cases of racism in Plymouth, when I raised the fact that Plymouth alone has a population of 250,000 and that means there was only a 0.17% racist incident rate, he tried to dismiss it as though it is not a fact.

I don't dismiss his facts, to remind you. I take his facts, and I find out what he missed out, what he did not represent, or what alternative views might have led to the occurance of his facts.<br></strong><br><br>like i said i have the slightest of interest in this side topic and couldn't be bothered with the discussion really.<br><br><strong><br>The only thing I don't do is to simply dismiss them. This, unfortunately, is not something I can say for many here. when they see a counter-argument they cannot debate against, they simply dismiss it with attacks on a person's personal honour, such as saying that they spent "a few seconds" looking up facts.

Racism is NOT confined to foreigners alone. A racist incident can be seen as one where an gang of local Asian people beating up a local white man as much as a gang of local white boys beating up a local Asian man.

So when you take the number of cases into context, u have to consider government policy as well. In the UK where government policy is to crackdown heavily on racism, and people are encouraged to report the cases, a higher number or even ratio of racist cases to population does not represent an extremely racist population. By contrast a lack of reported cases alone in another country does not represent low racist attitudes within a population. If you have a country which does not encourage reporting of racist cases, and the number of reported cases is still average or even high, then yes I would heartily agree that there is actually an extreme racism attitude amongst the population.<br><br>Based on the evidence at hand, therefore, the logical and reasonable thing to do is to conclude that the UK is definately not as extreme as has been put foward by some here.</div>
