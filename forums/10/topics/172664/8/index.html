In the case of the initial importation of Africans into America, or the Aborigines when Cook and his mob landed, there's the question of whether the non-whites were regarded as possessing enough culture to qualify as human.  Now this may be a fine point to argue, but it is important enough to be a key issue in Australia's land-rights cases and the matter of terra nullius.<br><br>As for colonisation, the agreements signed with the original rulers of the colonised countries set the conditions.  In other words, it wasn't the colonists who made the locals the underclass, it was the local leaders.<br><br>In short, you're oversimplifying things.

If there were 15 millions foreigners among the 60 millions brits, we will see how they are accepting to the reality.<br><br>When you travel in the region to places where english are not spoken widely, then you will see how the angmohs behave, then decide if their behavior are racists or not. Staying in the comfort of their own home, they can expect everybody coming to their countries to speak english. If they don't, the visitors are racists but not the hosts. When they are overseas, if locals cannot accept their cultures, the locals are racists. This is western superiority mentality, not just racists.<br><br>It is not a fact that when you travel in UK, any language other than english are not understood, this is different from going even to paris, they understand english, in german they understand more languages, may be not asian languages. so a few englishmen who speak indian or chinese is not big deal, there are chinese or asian studies in many of the UK universities.<br><br>The right to vote means nothing, here in singapore, mainland chinese, indian, pakistani, thai can all vote once they become citizens.

I am saying that, ASIANS not mixing with the locals and bunching up amongst their own cliques 1st is what contributes to THEM thinking UK is a racist country. I'm saying if they took the time to mix around more, and did not stick right to their own communities right from the start, they would realise otherwise. They THINK UK is more racist than it actually is, because of what they did. When u're behaving cliquish, people tend to find u harder to approach, and these ASIANS then perceive the locals as being racist.<br><br>U clearly lost the plot a long way back in this debate.</div>

People who are cliquish are harder to approach and befriend so the LOCALS don't bother, and then the singaporean students THINK the locals are being RACIST.

Afterall, if people here keep claiming that UK is racist, i use myself as an example to ask, why haven't i been treated racially?
