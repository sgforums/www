I found many angmohs in Asia racists. I found white australians in the cities racists but I met very friendly australian white farmers. These are our experience and we are entitled to our opinions.<br><br>You called singaporean supremacists and those who disagree with you hypocrite. It does not benefit me calling you or anybody racists. BUT, if your argument continues to blame the asians for not mixing around, and have no understanding about how some of these angmohs are behaving in some asian countries, then you are just defending the angmohs blindly against the asian, that I call racists.<br><br>I am learning nothing from your argument about how the locals in UK are accepting asians with very different cultures, how well are they accommodating asians who do not speak english. Is UK a racist country? no country is a racist country, not even Japan, but if you can't fit into any local cultures, and if you can't speak english, it is better to be in Burma than in UK.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>too bad some people still don't wanna read.<br><br>I said that racism involves race, so it shouldn't matter if i fit in or not, if i speak english or not, if people were racist. The point is that im chinese and I have not been discriminated against in any way in the past 1 and a half year i've been here. So either i am incredibly lucky, which, while given my name is "heng", is not really true, or the fact is that while racism exist, its not as exaggerated as some people here keep forcefully making it out to be. And I am offering an explanation why it might seem exaggerated to some people due to their own actions, I'm certainly not saying they themselves are racist.<br><br>Anyways I cannot help it if people here refuse to read and have something against white people. Its not that I particularly like them or anything but I just don't find them racist, and that has nothing to do with me fitting in or not. It just has to do with how willing I am to be social towards a wide range of communities, which, if you don't try, u wouldn't know how NON-RACIST people actually are.
