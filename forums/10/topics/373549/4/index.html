              <p>In 1825, raffles invited the arabs, jewish and armenian traders to set up shop in singapore. It was a very important move as these traders were given land concessions as incentives. Till today there is arab street, armenian street and a host of jewish named streets in singapore. They are the unsung minority heroes, they are still here and have been here before the chinese or indians came... how come they are not part of the bigger scheme of things and instead fall under the 'others' category??? They were the true immigrant pioneers of singapore and probably responsible for creating the trading post that has evolved into what it is today.</p>

              <p><br>there are hatre until you see the good side of it, many peoples get hated and hate something or someone for the wrong reason because they fail to see the reason behind it, once enlighted, forgiveness will set in, and sometime, forgiveness may come too late.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Today, most people will hate LKY, yes, perhap in his early young days of struggle, he may offended alots of people, but that a part of struggle, who dare and who is stronger wins. Thereafter, he is not like other leaders, who after wining went on and corrupt the whole country bringing it into chao and total corruption. He worked hard for the best of Singapore, he knews the social laws of that the peoples must be satisfied before power can be attained, rather than most leader who go into reverse order, grabbing power first and then see what can be done but hardly get it done.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As no one last forever, one day, LKY will have to go, and somebody have to take over, and if because of that person who took over lack the foresight and capability that turns our country into Chaotic, at that very moment, peoples of Singapore would had completely forgave LKY and wanted very much of the days he ruled.</p>

Thereafter, he is not like other leaders, who after wining went on and corrupt the whole country bringing it into chao and total corruption. He worked hard for the best of Singapore, he knews the social laws of that the peoples must be satisfied before power can be attained, rather than most leader who go into reverse order, grabbing power first and then see what can be done but hardly get it done.</p>

              <p>to me, I don't hate anybody until they do something very bad to me, or the people I love, intentionally. There are other feelings, detest, dislike, ....that describe my disagreement to the actions, the appearance, ....but hatred is very strong and very personal.</p>
