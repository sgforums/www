              <p>The recently funded NIC will increase the official races of Singapore from 4 to 7 in 20 years' time. This destroys Singapore's heritage as a Chinese, Malay, Indian and Eurasian country.</p>
              <p>I'm afraid if this happens, genocide has to come in to prevent new official races from springing.</p>

              <p> I really want to be nice to you so dont let me bitch slap you ar.There is no such thing as official races of Singapore although the 4 races that you mentioned  made up most Singaporeans in the past.It is clear that they are still the majority except for the Eurasians who seems to be jumping ship.The only genocide I can think of right now is when rascist cum fascist people like you commit mass suicide deep in the Mandai forest.........Yesterday!</p>

              <p>In 1825, raffles invited the arabs, jewish and armenian traders to set up shop in singapore. It was a very important move as these traders were given land concessions as incentives. Till today there is arab street, armenian street and a host of jewish named streets in singapore. They are the unsung minority heroes, they are still here and have been here before the chinese or indians came... how come they are not part of the bigger scheme of things and instead fall under the 'others' category??? They were the true immigrant pioneers of singapore and probably responsible for creating the trading post that has evolved into what it is today.</p>
