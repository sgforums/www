              <p><br>Indians are also official race of Singapore. This is included under the Sedition Act.</p>
              <p>As long as the integration policy does not tear up the racial harmony among Chinese, Malays, Indians and Eurasians, it is still ok.</p>
              <p>I am very very against the heritage culture we had since 1965 to be messed up by the addition of another official race or language in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans are already fed up of jobs and housings stolen by them, still not enough ah?</p>
              <p>Filipinos, Burmese and Vietnamese becoming citizens of Singapore in future and represent parliaments, kanna sai lah!!!</p>

              <p>I have no objection of Filipinos,Burmese and Vietnamese becoming Singaporeans.But the thing is,do they want to stay n become Singaporeans or not?</p>
              <p>I believe many of them simply earn enough money n then they leave or migrate to other countries coz of the stupid PAP lousy management of this country.This country is a corporate now,not a country anymore.</p>
              <p>What the PAP concern is not the ppl,its Money,Money,Money!!!!</p>

              <p>If the PAP want ppl to really born more babies n really want to attract those ppl from other countries to stay in here,they should do the follow things:</p>
              <p>1)Abolish NS system.As the relationship between countries are getting closer n closer,with America n United Nations influence are growing everyday.I doubt that Singapore will be still needing of so many troops to defend our country.I believe no country will be stupid enough to invade our nation.</p>
              <p>Even if we have to maintain NS system,reservist n IPPT have to be abolished.Our country men are already lagging behind women  interm of stepping into the society to work.It will be worse if they have to constantly being called back to army camp n do reservist or IPPT test.Afterall,u dont see LHL n GCT doing reservist n IPPT test.So why must Singaporean male doing these stupid things?</p>
              <p>2)Our salary have to adjust drastically n living expenses have to go down.The cost of living n inflation in Singapore,i believe,is the highest in Asia countries.As a matter of fact,Singaporeans are the poorest ppl in Asia developed countries,except for the PAP ministers n their bootlickers.(I believe after these,those PAP bootlickers like angel7030 will come in here n say:"Rubbish,Singaporeans are still rich,the PAP government can still milk their money as long as we lived".)</p>
              <p>LOL,this is what those PAP bootlickers are capable of doing,that is to portrait a peaceful n rich fake environment for LKY,LHL n GCT to believe in.Afterall,if anything goes wrong,like a revolt or revolution occur,it wont be those bootlickers to suffer.Coz the angry crowds will only target LKY,LHL and GCT.</p>
              <p>P.S.Of coz,there are still many other things to do beside these 2 major things.But i am lazy to state it out.And no point telling so many things to those PAP losers when they act like big fuk,and i believe they also wont seriously accept other ppl suggestion.So i also dont want to waste my time.</p>

              <p><br>As i said, it is for their decendants, the current Asian lots who become PR or Citizens, will create their family here, one of the most attraction to them, is Singapore education, we have a high standard class in education, even PRC mothers are bringing in their children, Malaysians and indonesians are bringing their childrens to study here. The childrens are their decendents, with years in our local school, they will have a fond memories of here, work here and stay here to contribute both to our social and economy values.
