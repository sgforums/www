              <p>I don't begin hating everybody until I see the good side of them. in fact, I used to love everybody until they show the ugly side, sometimes that is a little naive, to think of it.</p>
              <p>My be we have diff definition of the word hatred.</p>
              <p>to me, I don't hate anybody until they do something very bad to me, or the people I love, intentionally. There are other feelings, detest, dislike, ....that describe my disagreement to the actions, the appearance, ....but hatred is very strong and very personal.</p>
              <p>funny you write 2 long para on LKY. I don't hate LKY, I disagree with many of his policies, but I don't hate him, and there is nothing there for me to forgive him.</p>

              <p>You hate a person who turn against you, why dun you hate yourself for getting to know this person without your eyes open. In a nutshell, everything you see and feel is YOU. You create your own world, own fanatasy and own desire, and if someone is to interfere into those territory, you get offended. By right you will kill him or he kill you, but because of civilisation, laws and orders, education and discipline, you dun do that anymore.</p>

              <p>So, before hating others, do some soul searching yourself first ya. Marriage couples alway come to me and say they hate each other, but my question to them is why you guys get married, dun you hate yourself.</p>

              <p>You should return to the post and count again, with one trick question for you to decide whether it should be included as a "hum".</p>
              <p>Have you been convinced that a "hum" is so useless as to cause diarrhea when eaten too much ?</p>
              <p>Obviously you are just a hopelessly boastful liar to claim to be managing your father's Bar, when you do not even know some of the horny potency that a "hum" has.</p>
              <p>We can understand the horny side of a Taiwanese "hum" to consistently return to this SgForum every morning and late afternoon to be lashed by every tongue that you do your level best to bait.</p>
