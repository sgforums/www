              <p><br>No, not really, i understand Singaporean very well, most wanted face...face ok, die die also want face, cannot downgrade one, taking these into account, the govt play their way in by saying most peoples are affordable and that the properties will increase by 10 folds in the years to come, so these people sold their house and buy thru loans and pay by CPF again, afterall CPF also cannot take out completely, what for keep inside, so you buy, he buys, she buys, they buy and so on...and when they see their friends or relatives or colleagues in this coming CNY, he will boost that i bought a 5 rooms HDB for $700k, then another one will boost i bought it at $750k and so on...very typical singaporean mentality, LKY knows them very well. He make them look proud, challenge each others and fear of shame in a way that he can manipulate them easily thru these weakness</p>
