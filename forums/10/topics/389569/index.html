              <p>Temasek Review - <span class="time">January 30, 2010</span></p>
              <p><strong>Written by Our Correspondent</strong></p>
              <p>Dr Tony Tan, the Deputy Chairman of Singapore’s giant sovereign wealth fund Government of Sinagpore Investment Corporation (GIC) has reassured Singaporeans that it is in “good shape” following some concerns and disquiet on the ground over the losses it incurred in its overseas investments lately.</p>
              <p>Speaking to the Straits Times at the World Economic Forum in Switzerland, Dr Tan said GIC’s move to cut its equity holdings before the 2008 crash and being buying stocks early last year is “paying off”.</p>
              <p><em>“We did an assessment in 2007 when markets were over-exuberant. We de-risked the portfolio, selling part of our equities. ‘We held it in cash throughout 2008 and in the early part of 2009, restored our equity values. At the present time,’we are in good shape and we are fairly liquid,”</em> he said without elaborating more on it.</p>
              <p>A Wall Street Journal article published in September last year reported that GIC may have suffered a loss around 59 billion Singapore dollars (US$41.6 billion) in the fiscal year ended March. (read article <a href="http://www.temasekreview.com/2009/09/29/singapores-gic-suffers-41-6-billion-loss/"><span style="color: #a91b33;">here</span></a>)</p>
              <p>A proportion of the losses come from its investments in UBS and Citigroup, made at the height of the crisis.</p>
              <p>Dr Tan said GIC had confidence in the long-term prospects of the two banks and would continue to hold them.</p>
              <p>“We monitor them,” he said, when asked about the huge losses reported by Citigroup in its latest quarterly statement.</p>
              <p>UBS plunged into more trouble with the U.S. government when the Swiss government backed off an agreement with the United States that required it to hand over the names of wealthy American clients of the Swiss bank UBS who were suspected of tax evasion this Wedesday.</p>
              <p>There is a likelihood that UBS will be indicted again by the U.S. Justice Department if no new agreements are reached.</p>
              <p>GIC was also hit by potential losses of more than SGD$1 billion dollars in another failed overseas investment, this time in an upscale apartment complex in New York – Stuyvesant Town. (read article <a href="http://www.temasekreview.com/2010/01/10/gic-faces-potential-losses-of-more-than-sgd1-billion-dollars-as-tishman-blackrock-default-on-stuyvesant-town/comment-page-3/"><span style="color: #a91b33;">here</span></a>)</p>
              <p>The loss was initially not reported in the mainstream media till the Temasek Review published an article on it.</p>
              <p>Founded in 1981 to manage Singapore’s budget surpluses accumulated over the years, it has been headed ever since by Singapore’s strongman Lee Kuan Yew, who is by a lawyer by training.</p>
              <p>His daughter-in-law Ho Ching heads Singapore’s other sovereign wealth fund Temasek Holdings.</p>
              <p>Both funds have come under intense public scrutiny and criticism in the last two years over their investment losses which amount to billions of dollars.</p>
              <p>Though Singapore is the second richest nation in Asia after Japan and its sovereign wealth funds can afford to lose billions of dollars overseas, Singapore citizens enjoy few social welfare benefits from their government.</p>
              <p>There is no opposition in Parliament to check on the all-powerful ruling party which continues to dominate and control every aspect of life in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Respected international NGO Human Rights Watch described Singapore as a “textbook example of a politically repressive state” while U.S.-based Freedom House reported that “Singaporeans are unable to change their government” under the present electoral system.</p>

              <p>Whether it is in ‘good shape’ or not is irrelevant. Sinkaporeans wants accountability!</p>
              <p>Even if GIC makes another 100b in 2011, Sinkaporeans would also want to know why it lost 50b in 2010. Making another 100b in the future DOES NOT negate the fact that GIC did lose 50b this year, an amount which if checked might NOT have been lost.</p>
              <p>Accountability and Transparency is VITAL and NON-NEGOTIABLE!</p>

              <p>Hahaha, so long as GIC continues to be my personal bank account and provide me and my famiLEE with billions to spare, then it is certainly in good shape! Who cares about sinkies in the streets? hahaha</p>

              <p>We don’t know the truth as to whether it is in good shape because Singaporeans have been kept in the dark for far too long by this repressive regime. Didn’t we have confidence in the long-term prospects of the Bank of America too??? High time the pap paid for all these losses, Tony!!</p>

              <p>Dear Dr Tony Tan,</p>
              <p>Please show us what is meant to be passionate, honest and dedicated.</p>
              <p>Explain and account for the losses.</p>

              What you would expect him to admit that it was not or is not in a good shape?
              Since when there's freedom of press his statements were made through govt controlled media and a totalitarian regimes are known to resort to lying especially when there are crises and or scandals to hide from the public.

              <p>in economic words, 1% of GDP is equivalent to 1 billion, so when the govt said GDP growth by 4%, it mean we make 4 billions. When you have  growth of double digits like 10% or 12%, mean 12 billions gained into singapore share among us.</p>
              <p>Since 2001 till now, the average GDP was at 6%, meaning 6billions per year gained, and for the whole decade till now, it is about 60 billions gained, and now we just lost that to Americans. So, in another words, we work hard, busy and stressed for nothing.</p>

Why did we pay milllions to these people to manage our money like a novice? did we not learnt from the mistakes of losing BILLIONS our hard earn money to the American in the Asian meltdown in 1997 ? Did we not again learnt from losing more billions to the Americans on the internet bubbles???? Every 10 years we gives our reserve to the Americans!

              <p><strong>Concerns about Portugal pushed the single euro zone currency toward a key $1.3900 figure, while the cost of insuring Portuguese government bonds against default rose to a record 196 basis points, according to CMA DataVision. For details, see [ID:nLDE6122GD]</strong></p>
