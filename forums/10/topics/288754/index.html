            <div class='col-md body'>In the press, Thio Li-Ann has spoken about one hate mail she has<br>received, regarding someone who wanted to 'defile her grave'.<br><br>*********************<br><br>From her Parliamentary Speech:<br><br>"This August, I had my own experience with this sort of hysterical<br>attack. I received an email from someone I never met, full of vile<br>and obscene invective which I shall not repeat, accusing me of<br>hatemongering. It cursed me and expressed the wish to defile my grave<br>on the day 377A was repealed.<br><br>I believe in free debate but this oversteps the line. I was<br>distressed, disgusted, upset enough to file a police report. Does a<br>normal person go up to a stranger to express such irrational hatred?"<br><br>From The New Paper:<br><br>'I have already been insulted and received hate mail, even harassment.<br><br>'But should we be a nation of cowed individuals, subjugated by fear<br>of being called hateful names?<br><br>[...]<br><br>Since her speech on Monday, she has been called terms<br>like 'homophobic', 'unenlightened' and 'prejudiced' on the Internet.<br>Some called her a 'fundamentalist'.<br><br>Many other profanies, vulgarities and four-letter words were hurled<br>at her because of her stand.<br><br>Prof Thio said: 'One person expressed the wish to defile my grave on<br>the day 377A was repealed. And I am conveying the sense of it in the<br>most polite way I know how.<br><br>'I don't believe in repeating obscenities.'<br><br>From TODAY:<br><br>Professor Thio herself was "shell-shocked" and made a police report<br>after receiving an abusive email in August from an unnamed stranger<br>who threatened to defile her grave on the day Section 377A was<br>repealed.<br><br>"If it was just a rude letter, I'd let it slip. But this really<br>overstepped things," the law lecturer told Today.<br><br>*********************<br><br>Some of you might be curious to know what was this mail that<br>was "full of vile and obscene invective", with "obscenities" she<br>could not repeat, that she had to censor by "conveying the sense of<br>it in the most polite way I know how".<br><br>I reproduce it here for you. I know what that email is because I<br>wrote it. And contrary to the TODAY report that said it was by 'an<br>unnamed stranger', I actually signed off with my name, and sent it<br>from my yahoo email account (the one I'm using here). This is the<br>email. It consists of four lines:<br><br>*********************<br><br>Date: Sun, 12 Oct 2007 05:03 +0800 (CST)<br>From: "Alfian Bin Sa'at" &lt;&gt;<br>Subject: a valentine<br>To:<br>Sunday, Aug 12, 5.03am<br><br>Subject: a valentine<br><br>Dear Dr Thio,<br><br>This is a personal note to you.<br><br>I think you are absolutely fucked up.<br><br>As long as you exist, with your hatemongering and your vicious<br>crusades against sexual minorities, I will never leave Singapore. I<br>hope I outlive you long enough to see the repeal of 377A and on that<br>day I will piss on your grave.<br><br>With love,<br>Alfian.<br><br>*********************<br><br>Thio Li-Ann has filed a police report, accusing me of 'Intentional<br>Harassment'. On 26 October, I sat for a two-hour investigation at the<br>Tanglin Division Police Station at Kampong Java Road. The<br>Invesigating Officer was a very friendly and helpful man. Those of<br>you with uniform fantasies, please restrain from asking me if he was<br>attractive, because I will not entertain that query. Anyway, he<br>wasn't in uniform. In my statement, I reported the following.<br><br>1) The mail was shot off one night after clubbing with friends (hence<br>the time). Before that, on the cab ride home, I had been told that<br>Thio was the 'member of the public' who called the police, resulting<br>in the cancellation of the 'Pink Picnic'. The officer asked me how I<br>felt when I wrote that letter and I said 'aggrieved, wounded and<br>helpless'. And then taking a cue from her Parliamentary speech, I<br>added, 'distressed, disgusted and upset'.<br><br>2) I had sent only that one email to her, which I did not think<br>satisfies the criteria of repetition and persistence that would<br>constitute 'harassment'.<br><br>3) The phrase 'fucked up', to my understanding,<br>meant 'dysfunctional'. I said I did not consider the term abusive.<br><br>4) I had not threatened her with bodily harm.<br><br>5) In fact I had not made any threats to her at all, unless she<br>thinks being a fellow citizen with me in Singapore constitutes a<br>threat.<br><br>6) As for 'cursing' her with death by talking about outliving her, I<br>said I was merely pointing out the obvious fact of her mortality. I<br>also said that since I was younger than her, I would naturally expect<br>her to die earlier, barring any misfortune. The sympathetic policeman<br>offered to change the word 'die' to 'pass on' in my statement.<br><br>7) On the part about pissing on her grave, I said that gesture was<br>meant to celebrate the repeal of 377A. I also said that a few lawyers<br>had told me it was not illegal to piss on graves.<br><br>As the interview went on, the incredulity of it all I think struck<br>the policeman. I told him that if what I sent her constituted<br>harassment, then it would set an impossible precedent. Anyone who has<br>received any message through whatever form of communication<br>causing 'emotional distress' can file a police report<br>alleging 'intentional harassment'.<br><br>I asked the policeman why he was even acting on her complaint, and<br>whether he had more urgent cases to attend to. I told him she was<br>wasting taxpayers' money and state resources. I said this was<br>precisely the kind of 'bully-boy tactics' that she spoke of in her<br>Parliamentary speech. I also said I considered her calling the<br>authorities about the 'Pink Picnic' to be an example of harassment,<br>and that I felt harassed listening to her Parliamentary speech.<br><br>I ended the statement by saying that I hoped she was aware that many<br>of her actions have affected and hurt other people. I said I did not<br>discount the possibility of her receiving other hate mail, but acting<br>on me specifically as I was a strategic target, having written plays<br>with gay themes.<br><br>I am posting the 'hate mail' here, knowing full well that there will<br>be those who will chide me for my hot-bloodedness and impulsiveness.<br>I apologise to those who think that my 'uncivil' four-liner has<br>somewhat sabotaged the repeal-377A cause. But I think the exposure of<br>this woman's pettiness, tendencies towards exaggeration, as well as<br>her wanton abuse of the legal system, far outweights the flak I will<br>inevitably receive.<br><br>Alfian. : )<br><br><strong>*Note - Post copied from ChrisLoup</strong></div>
