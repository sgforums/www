               as the system is having biodegradable  or weak pillars
              in place.as lky will be considered as justr one of those almost
              useless engineers in a factory where jobs and problems are
              mainly fixed by assistant engineers etc.he only says yes and
              no and if he cant make a correct decision,,,,his assistants in
              the past would  probably do it all and get problems fixed
              without any issues or losses or any illegal moves.</p>
              <p>in the past spore had dr winsemius and those that treasured
              money and made wise use of them.now spore having lost billions in
              investments overseas just keeps mum bout holes in a
              ship...prettysoon ship will end up as a submarine.</p>
              <p>who do we have as pillars in spore parliament now???</p>

              <p>5)dr ng eng hen???the one who dun seem to be doing much of a job
              since he was left in charge of spore work labour system and salary
              issues caused by his policies in the past as a result of past
              policies he made.he might even be the one responsible for the mass
              exodus of skilled sporeans out of spore due to the easy influx of
              foreign skilled workers.</p>
              <p>6)???mah bow tan????i wouldnt even buy a second
              hand bicycle from that dude for what he's worth so far with
              his past policies.</p>
              <p>7)admiral teo???what did he do so far??he even has a hard time
              keeping himself awake in parliament !!!!!some admiral he would make
              in a real war!!!!sleeping while piloting his ship and into some
              coral reef!!!i wouldnt even have him as my nco medic even in case
              he falls asleep while injecting something or selecting wrong stuff
              to be injected into me whilst he is half asleep.</p>
              <p>8)??????????no more pillars in spore as the other PAP

              <p>there u have it!!!the Top Ten in spore  to propel spore
              into the 21st century and beyond!actually from looks of it i think
              spore will not go far with the these 7 people as its
              pillars.....it would get worse in fact at your cost.sure they will
              have new spanking merc and ferraris and drive on new spotless roads

              <p>As i said many times, and now one more time, yes, you might be right that Singapore govt is not so capable, for they are only good in heydays of good economy but no good in handling crisis, which usually end up covered and buried. But are there people like you coming out to oppose them, no, our oppositions are also not that capable to move the masses. So if A is no good, B also no good, then Choose C, remain status quo. If i want a change, i make sure it is a change for the good and the best, not change for the same same or even worst.</p>
              <p>Nobody in this world dun blame their govt for these and that..you go around the world and when come to talking about politcs, peoples would said that their own govt faults. Such are the laymen and Lay women talk that everyone are getting used and tired of it from kopitiam to forums, but so far, what had been done, nothing, i am still waiting for my prince charming in full knight amour to charge and chiong, but no one is coming, all talk n talk only, u dun get tire, govt also get tired</p>

              <p>I agree with you, it's a team effort, so nobody should have more credit than the others.</p>
              <p>I don't know who are the "ourselves" that entitled to "more credit" than the govt. You are actually "obedient"?</p>
              <p>Many singaporean worked with the government because they agreed with the policy, saying that they were "obedient" discredit them. Those who didn't agree join barisan socialist, those who don't even believe in the future of singapore had migrated to oz, uk or canada.</p>
