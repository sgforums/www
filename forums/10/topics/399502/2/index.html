              <div>Dutch economist Albert Winsemius (Dr) <em>(b.1910, Netherlands d. 1996, The Hague, Netherlands)</em> was an economic advisor to the Singapore government for almost 25 years. During that time, he contributed greatly to Singapore's economic development. He was given several monikers by the local newspapers, such as "Singapore's Dutch Uncle", the "Republic's economic guru", the "Dutchman behind Singapore Inc", and the "Father of Jurong".<br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br>Early Life</span></strong></div>
              <div>Born in 1910 to a father in the cheese wholesale business, the young Winsemius soon became involved in the cheese industry, working as a cheese maker after school each day. However, the teenager soon realised, in his own words that, "working with your hands usually doesn't pay too well", and moved on to being a cheese salesman. Later, Winsemius decided he needed a university education, and at the age of 26, applied to Leyden University to do law as he thought that it was the easiest subject. However, he discovered he had to pass an examination in Latin, and skipped it, and thus failed to meet the entry criteria. He then applied for Delft University but was rejected because he was found lacking in his secondary school mathematics. Finally, he applied to Rotterdam University. At the time, in order to make ends meet, Winsemius had a job in The Hague, Netherlands, and so he told the dean of Rotterdam University that he would not be able to attend lectures. Despite having his own reservations, the dean allowed Winsemius to enrol in the school. The rest is history as Winsemius went on to become a leading economist.<br><br>One of his first jobs upon graduation just before the advent of World War II, was to be the price controller for the Netherlands. His main role was to freeze prices during food shortages. He remained in the job until 1943. After the war, he worked at the Ministry of Finance as the country's director-general of industrial development. There, his role was to repair the economy, which had been damaged by the war. From time to time, he also carried out assignments on behalf of the World Bank. Thus, he began to build his growing reputation as an expert in the field of Developmental Economics.  <br>   </div>
              <div><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Contributions to the Republic</span></strong></div>
              <div>In 1960, a year after Singapore gained its independence, Winsemius was asked by the United Nations to visit Singapore as part of the United Nations Development Programme team. They were tasked with conducting a survey to assess the Republic's potential for industrialisation. Winsemius arrived on 5 October 1960, and made his first report to the Singapore government the following year, advising them that Singapore's success was dependent on the elimination of Communism. He also suggested that the statue of Sir Stamford Raffles remain. In a tribute penned by Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew after Winsemius's death, he wrote "... investors wanted to see what the new socialist government in Singapore was going to do to the statue of Raffles. Letting it (the statue) remain would be a symbol of public acceptance of the legacy of the British and could have a positive effect". <br><br>Thereafter, Winsemius became the Chief economic advisor to the Singapore government in 1961-1984. He worked closely with Singapore's first generation leaders including Lee, Dr Goh Keng Swee, and Mr Hon Sui Sen. He would visit twice yearly during his term as an economic advisor, about 3 weeks each time, and would also get regular reports from the Permanent Secretary of Ministry of Trade and Industry. Winsemius was called upon again in 1965 when the economy suffered from the aftermath of Singapore's separation from Malaya, as well as from Malaya's confrontation with Indonesia from 1963 to 1965. During that time, he recommended Singapore to re-open barter trade with Indonesia, and to share a common market with Malaysia. However, the latter proved to be implausible. He also advised that Singapore should look to get more investment from abroad, and improved its ties with the West so that it would have access to their markets. <br><br>His advice on industrialisation saw the emergence of high-technological industries such as the production of electrical components by the end of the 1960s. Another significant landmark in Singapores industrialisation history was the construction of the industrial town of Jurong. In 1970, Winsemius then envisioned the next lap for a newly industrialized Singapore; that the Republic would be a fully developed industrialized nation within 6-8 years and should hence start preparations for making inroads into exporting brain services. Thus, he advised the government to invest money in a new university or technical institute, instead of using governmental funds to build more factories. <br><br>Winsemius played the role of advisor for nearly 25 years until December 1983. He was credited for Singapore's establishment as an air and sea transport hub, and the development of Singapore's public housing and the financial sector. For his contributions, he was awarded a Distinguished Service Medal in 1967, and in 1976, was bestowed the National Trades Union Congress' highest award, the May Day Gold Medal of Honour. In 1970, the then-University of Singapore also awarded him with an honorary degree. In 1997, he was posthumously honoured with the establishment of an Albert Winsemius Professorship at Nanyang Technological University. <br><br>Winsemius died of pneumonia on 4 December 1996. He passed away in  the Hague, the Netherlands. He was 86 years old then. He is survived by his wife, 2 daughters, a son and 8 grandchildren. <br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br>Family</span></strong></div>
              <div>Wife: Aly Winsemius-Schreiber</div>
              <div>He had two daughters and a son. One of his daughters, Ankie Averink, worked for the United Nations. She was once called upon to decipher his handwriting for the survey report that he did on Singapore in 1961. <br><br>Singapore success story is based on a group of bright economic team, with careful planning and well excueted and Mentor Lee Kuan Yew is just one of those many parts of a jigsaw that made up this beautiful picture </div>

              <p><br> Singapore attracted oil majors to build refineries here because of
                  its strategic location, and the government/people who are friendly
                  to foreign investment. as a result, related industries
                  such as shipping industries boom and unconventional cargo
                  tonnage goes up, financial institution prosper,
                  and hundreds of singaporean are gainfully employed.</p>
              <p>in the final refining process,  waste gas is burnt
                  off, bottom of the barrel goes into making asphalt or MFO, how do
                  refineries cause pollution, or damage the environment?</p>
              <p>of course, oil spill outside of proper storage or container
                  cause pollution, shit outside of toilet is also pollution, worse,
                  it stink!!</p>
              <p>If petroleum industry contribute only to pollution, then you
                  should stop using car and buses (only bicycle need no fuel),
                  and dont even use electricity, b'cause it is generated by burning

              <p>is there any city where there is NO POLLUTION? Energy from coal
              and petroleum is definitely not ZERO pollution. But of course,
              everytime you feel guilty of pollution when you fart,
              then you are indeed environmental friendly.</p>
              <p>I don't think we are talking about being proud of no 1 or no 3,
              we are talking about who had the forsight to bring in
              investment to build a world class refining center on an island with
              zero resources, zero domestic market. </p>

              <p>Yeah yeah.. must appreciate the big oil refineries.Must appreciate the great PAP ... everything comes at a COST.</p>
              <p>Do you understand what a COST means ?</p>
              <p>YOu think the many chimneys punctuating our shoreline is something we should be proud of ? Have you ever wondered what gets spewed from those smokers ? What kind of WASTES  these kind of operation produces and where does it all go ?</p>
              <p>The monstrosity of those convulated pipes are a beauty to behold, yes ???</p>
              <p>Have you even been to a refinery ???? I doubt so.</p>
              <p>Yah talk sitting in your multi million condo.. and marvel at the oil refineries from afar... the shining lights at night.. so memerizing, no ?</p>

              <p>brandon,</p>
              <p>even if  lee kuan yew died today,nothing will change much  as the system is having biodegradable  or weak pillars in place.as lky will be considered as justr one of those almost useless engineers in a factory where jobs and problems are mainly fixed by assistant engineers etc.he only says yes and no and if he cant make a correct decision,,,,his assistants in the past would  probably do it all and get problems fixed without any issues or losses or any illegal moves.</p>
              <p>in the past spore had dr winsemius and those that treasured money and made wise use of them.now spore having lost billions in investments overseas just keeps mum bout holes in a ship...prettysoon ship will end up as a submarine.</p>
              <p>who do we have as pillars in spore parliament now???</p>
              <p>1)goh chok tong??the one who introduced everyone the stock exchange?</p>
              <p>2)lee hsien loong who ended up cryin at werk and desperately hatch out a plan to make casinos in spore ??</p>
              <p>3)lee hsien loongs's wife who is commander director supreme chairwoman of singapore financial banking mechanism???how many billions of US$$$$ has she lost in temasek since she was left in charge of it?</p>
              <p>4)dr vivian balakrishnan???what the hell did he do except become some kid prefect?</p>
              <p>5)dr ng eng hen???the one who dun seem to be doing much of a job since he was left in charge of spore work labour system and salary issues caused by his policies in the past as a result of past policies he made.he might even be the one responsible for the mass exodus of skilled sporeans out of spore due to the easy influx of foreign skilled workers.</p>
              <p>6)???mah bow tan????i wouldnt even buy a second hand bicycle from that dude for what he's worth so far with his past policies.</p>
              <p>7)admiral teo???what did he do so far??he even has a hard time keeping himself awake in parliament !!!!!some admiral he would make in a real war!!!!sleeping while piloting his ship and into some coral reef!!!i wouldnt even have him as my nco medic even in case he falls asleep while injecting something or selecting wrong stuff to be injected into me whilst he is half asleep.</p>
              <p>8)??????????no more pillars in spore as the other PAP members are considered as merely collecting $$$$ and not doing much in return for future of spore.</p>
              <p>there u have it!!!the Top Ten in spore  to propel spore into the 21st century and beyond!actually from looks of it i think spore will not go far with the these 7 people as its pillars.....it would get worse in fact at your cost.sure they will have new spanking merc and ferraris and drive on new spotless roads and with new buildings,casinos.....but u all would be the ones paying for it mainly!</p>
