              <p>There was a blatant lie in the ST article when they wrote that Lee Kuan Yew came back to Singapore from London and started to "plot against the colonial masters in his basement."</p>
              <p>That is a complete lie.</p>
              <p>Lee Kuan Yew's first political act when he came back from London was to join a pro-british party and campaign for interests of the english speaking elite which he belongs.</p>
              <p>That was the good old days when Lee was simply Harry.</p>

              <p><span>The number of elected seats increased from six to nine, while the remaining 16 appointed seats would be status quo. The British government approved the suggestion by political parties to carve the six constituencies within the city according to municipal districts, including Balestier (North), Keppel (South), Katong (East) and Tanglin (West), while the rural area was divided into three instead of two. Gone were joint districts. One of the four Non-Officio Legislative Councillors and only woman Councillor appointed was war heroine Mrs Elizabeth Choy, who contested unsuccessfully in the 1950 Municipal Commission election. </span></p>
              <p><span>Another new additional seat was allocated to a representative from the MC. PP's main political opponent at the municipal level, LP, entered the legislative fray. Well-known Malay politician Mansoor bin Adabi, husband of Maria Bertha Hertogh (also known as Natra binte Maarof), the young Dutch woman whose parentage controversy sparked a racial riot in Singapore a year ago, planned to contest Bukit Timah under PP but withdrew his nomination at the final minute for unknown reasons. </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">The campaign manager for PP vice-chairman John Laycock was Lee Kuan Yew, a legal assistant in the former's law firm.

              <p>Of course, you are wrong, as usual.</p>
              <p>You failed to see the significant of a little red dot,
                      developing a refinery started decades ago, (by a newly formed
                      country) into the third largest refinery in the world
                      today.</p>
              <p>You can only see crap.</p>

              <p>Yeah yeah...the price we pay for that 3rd place glory.</p>
              <p>There are many countries with the ability to do so, but they didn't, not because they do not have the resources to do it.</p>
              <p>Not because those big oil companies arn't eager to set one up in those countries.</p>
              <p>Because the countries know the environmental damage refineries bring.</p>
              <p>Yes indeed, we have been prostituting our country for economic development.</p>
              <p>We sold off Christmas island to build a bridge.</p>
              <p>We gave up the many pristine islands to build refineries/chemical depot for big oil companies.</p>
              <p>We let foreigners step all over our backs so they can have a cushy retirement back in their own country.</p>
              <p>What else is new ?</p>
              <p>Can't see the bigger picture ? Well.. look who's talking lady !</p>
              <p>You got kids right ? Why don't you go tell them it's OK to prostitute themselves for money to help pay the bills ? So what if they defile their own body for "economic/financial development" eh ?</p>
              <p>Get the big picture yet ? Ok, good.</p>
