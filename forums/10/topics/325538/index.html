              <p>I guess this kind of things happened in every developed countries...and even government has its own limitation. By giving $$ is not a practical solution, cos there is so much that the government can give, it does not contribute much to a family.</p>
              <p>I think I am lucky not beÂ the government cos no matter what solution u give also will kana left right center and this is one of the issues that I do not have any ideas for a win win suituation. lol</p>

              <p>hmm.. what i mean is the baby bonus. its only help families when the child is born. but when children start schooling, need buy books, need tutions, need pocket money. all this need money and parents have to struggle till their children start working. i guess most singaporeans mind set are if they cannot afford to have children, they either rather dun have one or wait till mid 30 then start their family. rather then they have children and can't afford to bring him/her up right?</p>

              <p>its less costly to replace population with foreigners than to give heartland people a reason to have sexual intercourse without condoms. its pretty clear to me what the government is more concerned about, having enough people to pay tax and work rather than solving the people's problems.</p>
              <p>only solution is to decrease minister pay, use $$Â  to sponsor childcare and schooling fees intensively. at the same time lower paid ministers will be less preoccupied with their money and more concerned about the welfare of their fellow citizens.</p>

              <p>Haha. I'll make sure PAP sends you the too-old-and-too-ugly female MPs.</p>
              <p>Anyway, that's off-topic.</p>
              <p>I think the ways in which the government, the Lees especially, can increase the birth rate is aplenty. It's not that they can't, it's they don't.</p>
              <p>The government doesn't want to reduce GST, doesn't want to subsidize the cost of living, doesn't want to give out their life of luxuries.</p>
              <p>It all comes down to the same thing: If PAP doesn't want to, you don't get it.</p>

              Do our many talented world-class leaders even have the common sense to understand the root cause of our many problems like our having the world's lowest birth rate?
              
              DonÃ¢â¬â¢t they understand that citizens need to pay for higher and higher costs of living just to survive due to the government's wrongful taxing and hoarding of monies that deprive the citizens of the means to start families?
              
              Will an average citizen say of household income say of the range of $1,000.00 Ã¢â¬â $1,500.00 pm be able to get married and start a family?
              
              If say he is at age 25-30 and he has not made it to the top or middle income earner and having to face the prospect of paying the super-expensive public housing at almost $1,000.00 pm for a moderately sized HDB flat will he honestly convince himself he could pay for the basic living expenses and his or her children education up to universities or polys by age 35-40?
              
              Do all the calculation he likes he is going to find the odd against his getting married and starting a family unless he wants to take a gamble.
              
              It looks like by todayÃ¢â¬â¢s costs of living as pushed up by the government by all kinds of policies either to keep talented ministers corruption free or to keep the road congestion free, only the top 10-20% of population belonging to the rich and super-rich can afford to marry and start families.
              
              Surprisingly, none of the Ministers and MPs are willing to question the high-handed callous government push to impose higher taxes, profiteering and hoarding of monies against its own citizens is the no. 1 cause of our reaching the current plight of having the lowest birth rate in the World.
              
              If the leaders of such world-class talents and leadership as we are told we have cannot understand such simple common sense and basics and fundamental cause of the whole problem of low birth rate, is this kind of leaders relevant to our needs today and will we do better with this kind of leadership to govern the country in the next lap?
