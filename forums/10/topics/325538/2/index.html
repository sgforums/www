              In other words everything has a price. 
              
              If we let the government become the most expensive government in the world taxing citizens to the tune of $500,000.00 - $700,000.00 per family we will end up with the highest costs of living.
              
              With this kind of cost of living we will end up having the lowest birth rate in the world, as simple as that.
              
              Don't our ministers and MPs have the simple common sense to understand this simple fact?

              <p>hmm.. what i mean is the baby bonus. its only help families when the child is born. but when children start schooling, need buy books, need tutions, need pocket money. all this need money and parents have to struggle till their children start working. i guess most singaporeans mind set are if they cannot afford to have children, they either rather dun have one or wait till mid 30 then start their family. rather then they have children and can't afford to bring him/her up right?</p>

              <p>its less costly to replace population with foreigners than to give heartland people a reason to have sexual intercourse without condoms. its pretty clear to me what the government is more concerned about, having enough people to pay tax and work rather than solving the people's problems.</p>
              <p>only solution is to decrease minister pay, use $$  to sponsor childcare and schooling fees intensively. at the same time lower paid ministers will be less preoccupied with their money and more concerned about the welfare of their fellow citizens.</p>

              <p>Do our many talented world-class leaders even have the common sense to understand the root cause of our many problems like our having the world’s lowest birth rate?</p>
              <p>Don’t they understand that citizens need to pay for higher and higher costs of living just to survive due to the government’s wrongful taxing and hoarding of monies that deprive the citizens of the means to start families?</p>
              <p>Will an average citizen say of household income say of the range of $1,000.00 – $1,500.00 pm be able to get married and start a family?</p>
              <p>If say he is at age 25-30 and he has not made it to the top or middle income earner and having to face the prospect of paying the super-expensive public housing at almost $1,000.00 pm for a moderately sized <span>HDB</span> flat will he honestly convince himself he could pay for the basic living expenses and his or her children education up to universities or polys by age 35-40?</p>
              <p>Do all the calculation he likes he is going to find the odd against his getting married and starting a family unless he wants to take a gamble.</p>
              <p>It looks like by today’s costs of living as pushed up by the government by all kinds of policies either to keep talented ministers corruption free or to keep the road congestion free, only the top 10-20% of population belonging to the rich and super-rich can afford to marry and start families.</p>
              <p>Surprisingly, none of the Ministers and MPs are willing to question the high-handed callous government push to impose higher taxes, profiteering and hoarding of monies against its own citizens is the no. 1 cause of our reaching the current plight of having the lowest birth rate in the World.</p>
              <p>If the leaders of such world-class talents and leadership as we are told we have cannot understand such simple common sense and basics and fundamental cause of the whole problem of low birth rate, is this kind of leaders relevant to our needs today and will we do better with this kind of leadership to govern the country in the next lap?</p>

              <p>I agree with you Devil1976.  Govt is missing the root cause of the problem.  The most basic of the heirarchy of needs is food and shelter without which no beasts or humans can increase its own kind. Watch National Geographic lah, even Discovery Channel got also.  How can govt expect Singaporeans whose  jobs may be taken over by foreigners/FT maybe the next day be in the mood with all these anxieties to make babies.  The men will probably be impotent from fear and the females will be frigid with a bad headache. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Who is going to feed baby and pay for all those diapers?  How is one going to pay for the mortgage without a job?  Where and how to survive with baby without a job?  No job means no food and no shelter.  To support my point look at KKH in the 50s? Why? because after the war their is security of food and shelter.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Govt officers with gigantic pay package and whose jobs are protect from foreigners/FT should be in the best position to make babies.  I hope they will practise what they preach. </p>
