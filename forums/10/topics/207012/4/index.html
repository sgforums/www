Then Costs are high in relation to another country so your company moves out. They start some courses for you to upgrade, yes you want to, but then you need time to do the upgrading. While upgrading your skills, you may not have income, then your kids need someone to look after. You start work super early, attend night classes to super late. Don't see your kids/family at all, spend a LONG time traveling from point a to b because you can't afford a car. You fell asleep in the feeder bus after a 45 min train journey, and have to spend an extra 15 mins walking 4 bus stops to your block. Its 11.39 pm at night, you only had a cracker for dinner because some customer insisted on coming into the shop at 5.59 pm when it's to be closed for dinner, and the boss "stepped out" to home to have dinner with the family. Your life sucks but they tell it's like that. And the cycle begins all over again except the cycle is shorter becuase design to production to product life is now very short.<br><br>Eg. Record players and vinyl lasted for a long time, then came cassette decks, lasted some time, then CDs, then MP3s, then Flash memory/iPODs<br><br>What sort of a life is this where the rewards are limited by gov meddling, yet you got no  choice because we are affected by external events beyond our control.<br><br>That's why we need to make Singapore more the way we want how we want to live. Less population, more space for everyone - cause you only live life once - LIVE IT THE BEST YOU CAN.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>An excerpt from an ILO report:<br><br><strong>Wage growth lags behind productivity gains:</strong><br>In China labour productivity in manufacturing rose by 170 per cent between 1990 and 1999, while real wages rose by slightly less than 80 per cent. Pakistan and India experienced a decline in real manufacturing wages since 1990 Â– a drop of 8.5 per cent in the former and of 22 per cent in the latter. IndiaÂ’s wage decline occurred despite an increase in manufacturing labour productivity of over 84 per cent over the same period, indicating deterioration in workersÂ’ livelihoods despite the increasing efficiency of their labour;<br><br><strong>Long working hours:</strong> Large productivity gains arenÂ’t translating into substantially shorter working hours. The top six economies in the world in terms of annual hours worked are all AsianÂ—Bangladesh,  Hong Kong (China), Malaysia, Republic of Korea , Sri Lanka, ThailandÂ—and a large share of people work 50 hours or more a week;<br><br>(http://www.ilo.org/public/english/region/asro/bangkok/public/releases/yr2006/pr06_16.htm)<br><br>Why the government cannot allow our wages to rise? Here's one reason.<br><br>We live in Asia, arguably the most competitive environment in the world. We used to rely on increased productivity to justify higher wages (a PRC worker is cheaper but he makes plastic toys, our workers make wafer chips).<br><br>That is still true to some extent but the technology gap is closing very fast. PRC workers still make sports shoes and bras, but they are also making disk drives and computer chips. As this ILO report illustrates, their productivity is increasing extremely rapidly (170%) whilst their wages have risen only 80%. And it is not only the Chinese that are doing that, others are also increasing productivity rapidly...'Thailand saw its labour productivity growth soar between 1980-97, with the value added per person employed rising by a whopping 141 percentage points' (Source: http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/26/077.html).<br><br>Despite the rapid rise in productivity, catching up with newly industralized nations like Singapore, the wages of PRC workers have not risen as much and they work just as long, if not longer hours. The ILO report specifically mentioned our close neighbours Malaysia and Thailand as examples where a large share of people work 50 hours or more a week (more than six 8-hour-working days a week).<br><br>In contrast, in Singapore, 'real wage increase exceeded productivity growth in 2005 after three consecutive years (2002-2004) of lagging behind productivity growth.' ( http://www.mom.gov.sg/ProceduresAndGuidelines/LabourRelations/LabourRelationsGuidelines/National+Wages+Council+Wage+Guidelines+for+July+2006+to+June+2007.htm)<br><br>It was only in 2005 that productivity exceeded wage increase. In other words, whilst PRC and others have been increasing productivity dramatically without giving their workers more rest hours or high pay, we have paid our workers too much relative to the gains in productivity. That anomaly has been corrected in part with the variable bonus and other schemes. However, there is a constant risk that whilst the government tries to keep our wage rise slower than the rise in productivity, wages constantly and significantly lag behind productivity gains in economies like the PRC.<br><br>Of course this is not fair for workers, who work harder, upgrade their skills but still earn little. Frankly, employers don't care if you have no time for your family or that you can hardly afford to pay your mortgage and feed your wife and 2 kids. If Singaporeans demand more pay and shorter working hours without a drastic increase in productivity, they will simply move their businesses elsewhere.<br><br>So we have to capitalize on what the PRCs cannot do, and drastically increase productivity. There is no way we can make bras quicker or cheaper to beat them in productivity, so we have to make the most high-value products or provide the most high-value services possible. That's why the nation is moving into precision engineering, aerospace engineering, biomedical sciences etc.<br><br>Young people who want to have a decent life in the future must observe the trends of the global economy and react quickly. We have an advantage in industries like biomedical sciences because the West does not trust PRC with such high-value but also high-risk products. (It is one thing to make toys...if it is not well made, you can send it back. With medicine, it is quite another matter.)<br><br>But our advantage will not be for long...PRC will build up its reputation with time and when they do catch up (which they will), we must be ready to re-train ourselves for yet another high-value industry.<br><br>That is just the facts of life. We can whine about it all we want, but it will not change the facts. Our jobs will always be at risk until Thai and Chinese workers earn more than we do for the same level of productivity. Until that happens, for us to be ahead, we have no choice but to far exceed them in productivity. Our workers in low-value industries will continue to see their wages depressed by cheap foreign workers. It's either low wages or no wages at all if the business moves out to cheaper economies.<br><br></div>
