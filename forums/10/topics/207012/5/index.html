You see them taking positions like contracts executive &amp; other normal office desk bound jobs which there are planty of s'poreans out there w/o a job &amp; are qualified for it.<br><br>So i ask what is the criteria, it seems the government is pretty relax in this area when importing talent.<br><br>Why is the population rate going down, have they every considered how difficult is it compared to 30yrs ago to start a family. So much uncertainty, rising cost versus stagnant pay. (sometimes i seriously wonder where the obtain the statics mentioning that s'poreans are better paid now, from?)<br><br>To qualify for government subsidies &amp; grants, gross household income shouldn't exceed $1.5K..........u must be in a real bad shape b4 they will extend that help.<br><br>I am one such example who has no intention of setting up a family here because I don't want my wife &amp; especially my children to suffer.

We are in need of more real examples of Singaporeans who achieve dreams beyond others' imagination. In all fields Â— business, science, academia, sports Â— we need to produce our own world-class icons," said Mr Ng at the forum, on the theme "Standing Tall in a Shrinking World".<br><br>He cited "water queen" Olivia Lum, chief executive of water treatment company Hyflux, as someone who had fulfilled her dreams in Singapore. The 46-year-old entrepreneur, who is worth US$240 million ($377 million), was ranked 17th on Forbes Asia's Southeast Asia list of 40 richest businesspeople.<br><br>"If she could do it, why not you?" said Mr Ng.<br><br>Ms Lum had a good idea that made the seemingly improbable Â— selling water in a region with torrential rains Â— become possible and, more importantly, she had the drive to succeed. Mr Ng recounted how Ms Lum, a former Malaysian who came to Singapore at age 16, peddled her water filters and softeners from Jurong to Batu Pahat in Malaysia.<br><br>Mr Ng noted that while Singaporean graduates have the advantage of an "established international brand" renowned for intellectual rigour, they are also perceived as being less adept at dealing with "fuzzy situations" and "less daring".<br><br>"We have already realigned our educational system to train students to better handle ambiguity, to think and speak on their feet and to manage people, but this is still very much work in progress. Our universities will and must evolve new pedagogical styles to bring out these skills in students," he said.<br><br>Another weakness is the unwillingness of Singaporean graduates to work their way up.<br><br>"Singaporean graduates should realise that industry practices have changed," he said.<br><br>Mr Ng also warned the students they would have to face up to increasing competition from local and overseas graduates. "Ultimately, it will not be your paper qualifications which differentiate you, but your skills and attitudes," he said.<br><br><strong>During the question and answer session, one student asked how getting more foreign talent could be reconciled with nation-building goals. Mr Ng replied that perceptions that foreigners stole jobs from locals would have to be managed. Foreign talent were part and parcel of creating more opportunities for Singaporeans.</strong><br><br>To a query about dual citizenship, Mr Ng said "soft solutions", such as family ties, were needed to make mobile Singaporeans feel rooted here. It was not something one could solve just by allowing dual citizenship.<br><br>Singapore is well poised to benefit from the rise of India and China. Domestically, it has set the stage for local talent to shine, in sectors such as research and development, digital media and tourism.<br><br>"The opportunities are there for you and the decisions you make in the next 10 years will decide your trajectory and zenith. The world is literally at your feet, with the possibilities limited only by your grit and imagination," said Mr Ng.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>An Excerpt from <a href="http://www.yawningbread.org" rel="nofollow">Yawning Bread</a> on the issue of immigration:<br><br><blockquote><span style="color: darkblue;"><strong>Rather than the media, it is the government and PAP Members of Parliament who should be the ones selling immigration. It's their policy proposal, after all. Alas, judging from Lee's speech, it's not a convincing sell. You can bet that other ministers and MPs will probably do an even more amateurish job of it.<br><br>The reason is obvious: this lot does not know how to sell, how to persuade. Recruited from the ranks of the elite, and floated into office, they may know how to wield power, but they have precious little experience winning support.<br><br>If Lee's speech is any indication, the argument will fail because to the layman, it remains abstract. It is couched in macro-economic terms. Singapore is short of babies. We need talent to keep the economy growing. Foreign talent is available. So we should admit more of them. It is good for Singapore. Therefore it is good for you.<br><br>Besides being too abstract, it suffers from two critical weaknesses.<br><br>It fails to close the loop in the mind of the listener, Tan Ah Kow. So you say it's good for Singapore, but how does all this become good for me, he would ask? And find no answer.<br><br>It fails to respond to his primary objection, which is the fear that foreigners will rob him of his job.</strong></span> </blockquote>Pretty much sums up PM Lee's pathetic attempt to sell the idea of immigration and FT to Singaporeans: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">no political skills</span><br><br>He should learn a thing or two from Low Thia Khiang and how he commands the interest of a rally crowd.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sep 2, 2006<br><strong>Drive for foreign talent to become citizens may create greater rather than lighter socio-economic burden<br></strong><br>THE drive for foreign talent to become citizens - or even the subject of national economic survival - cannot be a mere matter of boosting the population in absolute figures, as the letter, 'Could Singapore survive another 80 years?' (ST, Aug 31), seems to be dwell on repeatedly.<br>This is because, if that were the real consideration, there is no lack of foreigners without requisite qualifications who want to become Singapore citizens. The lengths to which illegal workers go to smuggle themselves into Singapore just to find menial jobs shows this is so.<br><br>In any case, if we are not careful about the new drive for foreign talent to become citizens, Singapore could end up with a greater rather than a lighter socio-economic burden.<br><br>This is because for every immigrant who becomes a Singapore citizen, there are family members who will tag along, including the aged and infirm who will become citizens or permanent residents with certain privileges conferred by the state such as subsidised health care.<br><br>And given there is officially no state welfare in Singapore, it also follows that the added burden of an increased population will fall on society in general. How will society cope, seeing that presently the community welfare system is already under strain?<br><br>Viability of the economy is more about the appropriateness of overall economic strategies and less about population size. Smaller populations than Singapore, like those of Monaco and Macau, thrive precisely because of this economic strategy factor.<br><br>There are many ramifications to this issue of attracting foreign talent to take up citizenship. Some issues the Government and society can look into include:<br><br>* How many of the 100,000 Hong Kongers said to have migrated here after the 1989 Tiananmen incident stayed put and how have they contributed to the economy and society?<br><br>* There are many fields of endeavour and in-depth knowledge of these fields needed to screen citizenship applicants expertly is hard to come by. Thus if we are not careful, instead of talent we end up with 'pseudo talent' - which society will have to put up with simply because they are now Singapore citizens.<br><br>* Talented individuals without paper qualifications, which the Government now also wants, will be difficult if not impossible to identify before they become successful and well known. But if they are already successful, it is doubtful they will be bothered with the citizenship issue as they will be welcome anywhere in the world.<br><br>Is it not too sweeping to say that because our forefathers were immigrants, we should be open to new immigrants? There is a wide disparity between the state of development of Singapore then and now.<br><br>* Skilled manpower needs can be met as done presently by employing foreign professionals. In other instances, outsourcing or sub-contracting to foreign companies at costs that are lower than localised operations has proved a viable approach. Foreign call centres and software development are two good examples.<br><br>There is more flexibility with these options because in an economic downturn, society does not have to cope with a high unemployment rate.<br><br>Chia Hern Keng<br><br></div>
