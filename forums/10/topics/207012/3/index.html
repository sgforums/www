The yard stick comes when critical periods are filled with maternity leave or long-term illnesses.<br><br>I don't think health costs and medical benefits come into the picture just yet.

Meaning that people have a decent education would not likely give a thought to menial jobs, such as rubbish collecting. In other words, given equal opportunities, I think almost all would rather be an employer rather than an employee. Myself, as an example.<br><br>While true back then that local Chinese tend to view such jobs as lowly, I believe the times have change their mindset quite substantially. However, time was not able to affect change of any degree towards rising living costs hence people are generally still UNABLE (not UNWILLING) to take a lower salaried job. (what's the point of slogging all day all week and still have your electricity and water supply cut off?)<br><br>It isn't so much status and or name of the position that irks locals, it's the amount paid for the effort. Society in every country are NEVER comprised totally of Doctors, Scientists &amp; Engineers. Hence there will always be the averagely ambitioned fraction of society who just simply wants to GET BY.<br><br>So fancy cosmetic titles for jobs catches not their interest, but rather size of salary to/that commensurates with today's living costs.<br><br>quote:<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Originally posted by billybong:<br><br>Competition has stressed out the market.

And it is a competition i have to beat to stay relevant.<br>------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Agreeably, competition has done something to the market, but why do you think both employee and employers are biatching about costs and hankering for cheaper this and cheaper that??<br><br>FTs I admit are good for our economy. But right now, not all from China coming and already here, are "skilled". A large proportion of them are unskilled and are contributing to society's vices and crime. This is due to our government's throw-our-door-wide-open-to-all-from-anywhere policy. As you already know, these "FTs" from PRC are making a mockery of our immigration system by doing all sorts of things just to secure the PR status.<br><br>You can't blame locals for "jumping ship when greener pastures beckons", because this is not a welfare state and everyone must take care of his/her own retirement years (if any/able to at all). Who will want to waste time and effort doing some job which in the end, lands them in some old age home? Don't tell me their children will be there for them - having children doesn't mean they will take care of aged parents. Gov has OVERPRICED living costs, hence the people need also to PRICE themselves accordingly. As much as businesses are NOT CHARITIES, people also needs to SURVIVE.<br><br>Governments hopes to "top up" population with FOREIGNERS (FTs), but it looks to me, they're topping up population with future aged PR holders and New Citizens!!!<br><br>quote:<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Originally posted by billybong:<br><br>Maybe this is a question meant for the aunties.

As said, people here are now not as mindful of what they do, and I believe many will gladly take up any cleaning or maid jobs if opportunities arises; many jobless middle aged and able bodied ladies/men have children to support and see through school and higher education - if ordinary low-skilled or unskilled jobs are snatched away by unskilled "FTs", HOW do local people dare consider having babies??

And NO ONE (employers) will ever admit it so long as gov does not bother to PROACTIVELY crack down on discrimination towards employees and or would-be employees.<br><br>Who do you think is responsible for causing young pregnant women to lose their jobs? For want or more babies, gov implements policies with little consideration of the kind of repercusions it will cause, just like throwing our doors wide open to all sorts of FTs.<br><br>Healthcare costs DOES matter. Medical Benefits costs a lot in a business that employs older people. I have business friends who will only hire older locals if they agree to not being given ANY medical benefits - eg., if he or she has diabtetes, his/her monthly medical costs for treating the condition will not be subsidized. Such arrangents are blossoming everywhere here like toadstools in a rotten wood!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I like to quote a posting by Cosmoking as follows:<br><br>quote:<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Originally posted by CosmoKing:<br>the abbreviated FT is so often used to mean 'foreign talent' but there must be lots of 'foreign trash' floating around. Don't know if these mish mash of different customs, behaviour, cultural nuances will lead to sinkapore...I mean a melting pot that really sink. then, those sorry but patriotic stayers will be the real losers while the quitters will be laughing out of their seats. remember, its just a small myopic pot, and it will be the biggest bluff if one said they could brew more jobs for locals e.g. you could frame up your beautiful certificates as these FT will be willing to do your work for half your salary. the difference is, they send money home to buy twice or three times in their big country what you could afford here in a tiny red dot, but you being here stuffed in a pigeon hole have to figure out what little or no savings, let alone retirement, after having paid all the bills, taxes, and with the rapid high costs of living and onslaughts of basic transports and utilities hike. and so, if FT could mean Foreigh talent or foreign trash, the once quitters are the ones who should be emulated. e.g. they had the foresight to jump ship before sinkapore sinks, and stayers just lament, complaint under the all 'inclusiveness' of oppressions and greater sufferings. saying that the income gap is widening is too late now, as social discontent rears it ulgy head in a millions of way and maybe 10 years from now, it may not be a good, safe, and clean city to live anymore. experts have predicted the ruling party will face a tougher fight in each coming elections, well let them rest on their laurels as long as it lasts. nothing goes on forever.<br></div>
