            <div class='col-md body'>Labour shortage is a tried and true problem of Singapore, mainly because of our ageing population and low replacement level. The labour market works on the principle of demand and supply as well. Currently, our supply is predictably low, and couple this fact to the structural unemployment that we are facing and you get labour shortage. If FTs do not fill in the gap, who will?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"><br><br>Sure, you may argue that if we increase our labour supply, our wages will fall. But think in the long run, if our productivity remains unchanged, our friendly MNCs and local firms will start to face higher costs of production. Don't forget, we still have to compete with China and India who has the comparative advantage in cheap labour. Soon, our investors leave Singapore and we get more unemployment. Isn't this worse?</div>

Almost. First, let's recap two major trends/policies for Singapore:<br><br>(1) Singapore faces the challenge of an ageing population (or so we're told). Current projections show that one in five Singaporeans will be over the age of 65 by 2030. The government therefore wants to encourage Singaporeans to have more babies.<br><br>(2) Singapore's economy lacks skilled manpower (or so we're told). The government wants to import huge numbers of foreign talents, to keep the economy going strong.<br><br>PM Lee's rally speech is perhaps the first time that the Singapore government has tied Point (1) directly to Point (2). Let's look at the relevant passage:<br><br>"Two years ago, we introduced major policy changes to encourage couples to have more babies. So far the results have been very modest. I understand why some Singaporeans do not want to have more children. But I have not given up hope and will continue to think of ways to encourage couples to have more babies.<br><br>Let me explain why we need new immigrants. To maintain a population of 4 million, Singapore needs at least 50,000 babies a year. Last year, we had 36,000 babies. This means that we are short by 14,000 babies. No matter how hard we try, it would be hard to produce another 14,000 babies. Hence we need to attract more immigrants."<br>Something is very wrong with the above reasoning, and no one in the blogosphere seems to have pointed it out yet. So I guess I'll have to do the job again.<br><br>This is it - babies are not adults. Adults are not babies. Let's imagine that PM Lee's baby-making incentives had succeeded beyond his wildest dreams and Singaporeans produced 75,000 babies last year. That means we would have 75,000 one-year-old cute little chubbies in Singapore today.<br><br>But babies can't work. They don't contribute to the economy. They're not research scientists, engineers, bankers or teachers. That would take another 20 to 25 years to happen.<br><br>Meanwhile, we import foreign talent. Let's say A*STAR finds a 40-year-old stem research scientist in the US and imports him into Singapore. He settles here, and because of his valuable skills, immediately starts contributing to the economy. However, he is not a baby.<br><br>In 20 or 25 years' time, he will be 60 or 65 years old and would have become one extra member in the senior citizen population for the Singapore government to worry about. In fact, the more we import foreign talent in their 30s and 40s, the greater our future "aging population" problem will become!<br><br>Of course, I have also oversimplified. The true dynamics are more complicated. For now, my point is just that PM Lee is talking nonsense here:<br><br>Last year, we had 36,000 babies. This means that we are short by 14,000 babies. No matter how hard we try, it would be hard to produce another 14,000 babies. Hence we need to attract more immigrants.<br>I see his attempt to tie the lack of babies to the immediate need for foreigners as just another sales strategy to convince the Singaporean public about his foreign talent schemes. Furthermore he gets to shift the blame ("See? YOU Singaporeans are not producing enough babies, so I, the Prime Minister need to import foreign talent".<br><br>The truth is - babies are not adults. Adults are not babies. PM Lee is surely smart enough to see that. I think that he thinks you're not. Here's another example of his quicksell tactics, from April 2006.<br><br>Meanwhile, Singaporeans are getting fooled. Look at poor Ms Lee Pai Ping, writing to the online ST Forum:<br><br>Aug 23, 2006<br>S'poreans have to pay a price for not heeding govt's plea for more babies<br><br>I missed Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's National Day Rally Speech on television last Sunday.<br><br>When I read about it in The Straits Times the next day, a sudden sadness overwhelmed me.<br><br>The Singapore government has decided to be more aggressive in attracting immigrants with talents of all kinds to Singapore with the offer of Singapore permanent residence status, once purportedly aimed at graduates, professionals, bankers, lawyers and the like.<br><br>What a huge price Singaporeans have to pay for not heeding the government's persistent plea for higher birth rates among its people, and to be less picky about jobs.<br><br>I am for the Singapore government's move to import foreign talents to fill the gap and boost the economy by creating job opportunities as entrepreneurs.<br><br>But I shrug at the thought that some native Singaporeans, especially the young and educated of marrying age, do not think it their duty to marry and procreate as part of nation-building, and the unemployed who still fuss over jobs, choosing to remain jobless rather than accepting a job below their expectations.<br><br>Singaporeans should not be complacent. Nation-building is our utmost duty and responsibility.<br><br>Lee Pai Ping (Ms)<br>Ms Lee Pai Ping, try to understand this. If today we import skilled foreigners in their 30s because we lack Singaporean working adults, then our problem isn't with young, married, childless Singaporean couples today. The problem really happened 30 years ago - when the government was busy telling young couples then to "Stop At Two".<br><br>So no need to suffer all that guilt, Pai Ping. The government is to blame. That's what PM Lee doesn't want to tell you. He'd rather just blame you and make you feel bad instead.<br><br>Pai Ping isn't the only person who got suckered. Seems like a senior ST columnist also got suckered too. Click here to read the ST editorial of 22 August 2006. There he goes - putting the blame on "career-minded young couples" without kids. Or maybe the Straits Times guy does know the truth, but just wanted to perform one of those "nation-building-press" gymnastic tricks.<br></div>

Here's your Foreigh Talents from China!<br><br>========================================<br><br>China woman to S';pore date on first meet:<br>Let's get married now<br>She offers another S'porean, a finance exec, 43, the same deal<br>August 27, 2006<br><br>WITH her silky-smooth complexion, long black hair and slim figure, Qili (not her real name) could have any man she wanted.<br><br>But she wanted more than 'any man'. The woman from Liaoning province in China wanted Singapore citizenship.<br><br>Like many of her peers, the diploma-holder wanted to strike it rich in what she saw as the land of opportunity.<br><br>So three years ago, Qili got herself a student pass and and a one-way air ticket to Singapore.<br><br>Once in the country, she ignored her student status and found herself a job as a cleaner.<br><br>She also approached a matchmaking agency to find her a husband. But the agency could not provide the kind of man she wanted.<br><br>Speaking to The New Paper on condition of anonymity because of confidentiality agreements with clients, the agency owner said: 'She had big eyes and gentle manners. Although she put down her age as 33, she looked like she was in her 20s. But she was also secretive about personal details and answered our questions carefully.<br><br>'She specifically wanted men who were aged 50 and under, with a stable career and earning more than $3,000 a month.'<br><br>WANTED FAKE MARRIAGE<br><br>But one sentence she said put the owner off.<br><br>'She said she wanted a 'fake marriage' to get PR status here, and was willing to pay me and the man to do it. I told her I couldn't do that.'<br><br>Undaunted, Qili returned to the same agency a year later and told the owner that she was sincere about finding true love.<br><br>This time round, she would accept a man under 60 and did not specify a minimum salary.<br><br>'I accepted that her aims might have changed over the year, so I set her up with a 36-year-old auditor.<br><br>'But after their first date, he came back in a huff and scolded me for setting him up with a woman like that.<br><br>'He told me Qili offered him money to marry her immediately. I questioned her about it, and she said she was joking,' the agency owner recalled.<br><br>Believing her, the owner then set Qili up with a 43-year-old finance executive.
