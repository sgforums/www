We leave a vacuum of necessary jobs to be filled, and employers have no option other than to hire abroad. In such cases, FT is inevitable.<br><br>It is also unfair to accuse them of being responsible for the spike in crime; many of them are really here just to earn a living for themselves and their families. It's the screening process during recruitment that needs improvement. </div></blockquote>But if you take a few large steps backwards, and you take a long look at the whole picture, wouldn't you wonder about the following:<br><br>&gt;&gt; why cultivate a society of well educated people who aren't likely to take up these jobs? Besides, who in the right mind and a decent qualification would want to be a rubbish collector after almost a lifetime of studies and the money spent on education? But being a the OWNER of a garbage collection company is a different thing altogether.<br><br>&gt;&gt; Escalating costs of living is the main factor that people aren't taking up certain jobs, but now, with all the FTs in abundance, even high level position salaries are devalued by FTs - who the hell can support a family much less have a baby if one is expected to outperform and take a lower paycheck as FTs or even lower?<br><br>&gt;&gt; Maids are imported, why not let local aunties take the role? No levies to collect maybe?<br><br>&gt;&gt; Why do they say Medical and Health Care is affordable when most employers still shun old workers because of the need to provide medical benefits, and potential loss of man-hours due to health.<br><br>We shouldn't kid ourselves that the gov is taking care of our interests.. if so, most of the above scenarios would have been different.<br><br></div>

Is it not because your skills are no longer relevant or FT have similar skills that they are willing to export at a lower price? Employers are not running charities. They are willing to pay more for a worker only if the employee can improve the bottomline more than a cheaper one.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by ShutterBug:</div><div class="quote_body">&gt;&gt; Escalating costs of living is the main factor that people aren't taking up certain jobs, but now, with all the FTs in abundance, even high level position salaries are devalued by FTs - who the hell can support a family much less have a baby if one is expected to outperform and take a lower paycheck as FTs or even lower?</div></blockquote>So you admit that FTs can outperform and accept lower pay than local Singaporeans. We have outpriced ourselves and unable to compete. On a global scale, with cheaper economies in abundance, Singapore's economic growth will be stunted by cheaper foreign economies if we do not have FTs to lower our costs and improve competitiveness. If foreign investments go to PRC instead of Singapore, we have more to lose.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by ShutterBug:</div><div class="quote_body">&gt;&gt; Maids are imported, why not let local aunties take the role? No levies to collect maybe? </div></blockquote>I have been saying that for ages and it is a good illustration of my point. The reason is that Singaporeans have become accustomed to the good life. How many British familes are able to afford a maid who lives with them and offer domestic services more than 12 hours a day without annual leave or weekends off? A significant number of Singaporean families have more than one maid!<br><br>Singaporeans want cheap FTs as domestic maids. Why don't you try to ban foreign domestic maids? You will get a huge furore on your hands. It is near impossible to offer domestic services by Singaporean aunties if we insist on having maids that work all day and night without rest at only $300 a month. Do you expect our Singaporean aunties to be able to compete?<br><br>It's the same with other industries. Just as Singaporean employers want cheap domestic maids even though the service can be rendered by Singaporeans, so Singaporean employers also want cheap FT in their factories when Singaporean workers can do that job but at a higher price.<br><br>The big difference is that whilst factories that hire FT reduce costs and make Singapore more competitive, families that hire foreign domestic maids help to keep our Singaporean aunties unemployed.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by ShutterBug:<br>[b Why do they say Medical and Health Care is affordable when most employers still shun old workers because of the need to provide medical benefits, and potential loss of man-hours due to health.[/b]</blockquote>Healthcare is not the reason why employers shun older workers. We are not legally required to pay much for medical benefits anyway. The loss of man-hours is a consideration but the risk of that is actually higher with a young, recently married woman....older men do not take 2 months' maternity leave.<br><br>As an ex-employer, I can tell you what puts employers off is rather the higher salaries they tend to demand on account of their experience and the work performance in strenuous jobs. We used to have old aunties to do the office cleaning and file stacking jobs, requring them to climb ladders and carry heavy loads. Many of them were not capable of these tasks. When we switched to young foreign workers in their early 20s, we could reduce the number of such staff by half and yet double their output.<br><br></div>
