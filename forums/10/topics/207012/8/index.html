I believe this idea had been brought up several time but alas all in vain or else we will see our women folk conscripted and hence complaining here and at the same time most of the PRs packing up to go home. Anyway, most importantly such policy are not going to be controlled by you or me. Everything in singapore has to be the doing of the government because singaporean got no choice politically as i told you.

To ask for the impossible would be to pay the men close to the regular market rate for their sacrifice. It is still consider a sacrifice because not everyone want to start a career in the army. but since it was already deemed impossible, I believe the sg men have to take it hard down their throat with whatever pathetic compensations that the government throw at them e.g. NS Bonus.....and stop complaining but to accept the facts. Next life wise up and be borned in other country to come back as FT to fight for the gold only, problem solved. At the same time be wise not to procreate in this land and bring misery to the next generation.</strong></div>
