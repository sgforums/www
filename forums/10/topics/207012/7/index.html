And when economy takes a bad dip and the FTs as well as the FWs take flight, there wouldn't be much population left, to say nothing about shortage of babies.<br><br>It's relative costs, and the FTs' and FWs' pursuit of our dollars.<br><br>How much better, can or could a FW/FT from PRC working as a counter assistance in a foodcourt such as Kopitiam foodcourt in some shopping centers?  I've seen them, they only speak Mandarin very well and that's about it. I don't see any "better performance".<br><br>Let me say this; Singapore's service standard in retail and service related industries (such as those in food courts) are going to go further down the drain because of them.<br><br>I mean, talk about locals not being willing to move out of their comfort zones; what about these multitude of PRCs talented and untalented? Are they willing to speak English besides Mandarin?? How many times I encountered (has anyone of you) assistance in retail who simply cannot speak or understand English and has to refer me to another colleague. In HDB branch office, a very chinese lady behind the counter, could not understand what I wanted to enquire about and had to call in her supervisor.<br><br>What the hell man, how is this deemed EFFICIENT and PERFORMANCE? Simply because they flew thousands of miles here from China and accepts lower salaries? I know there are REAL talented ones here, have met and spoken to them - they are effectively billingual. They spoke Mandarin very well, and when they speak English, you can here diction in every word that has the letters 'S', 'T', and 'R'. And there is an ocean of non-talented ones out there who consistently come knocking at my company door seeking employment - I turn them down flat. I let them rattle off in Mandarin and then reply asking them in either English (proper form) or in my own mother-tongue Teochew, can you speak English? or in the case of Teochew; can you speak Teochew?<br><br>THere are also other forms of talents roaming our streets here; today I was downtown Orchard Road Wisma Atria food court for lunch. A man in his early 40s approached me attired in smart casuals and asked me if I would like to have my fortune told. I said to him in English; "I am just hungry, but not that hungry." and I walked away.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The market will decide who is better value for the job, FT or locals. The PRC's English may be poor but the employer may feel that it does not matter because the bulk of Singaporeans speak Mandarin or that his products target Mandarin-speaking customers. He may even prefer the FT to the English-speaking Malay Singaporean. On the other hand, retail businesses that target Malay or Indian customers would be daft to employ PRCs who do not speak English.<br><br>The fact that so many businesses employ PRCs indicate that they are considered to be better value.</div>
