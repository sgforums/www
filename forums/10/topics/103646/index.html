            <div class='col-md body'>Singapore has the potential to build the world best casino by taking advantage of its excellent location provided it is properly regulated to discourage its own people from addiction to gambling.<br><br>Your views ? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>For convenience, your suggestions on how to build a world-class casino will be formulated into an overall business master plan as listed below:<br><br>(1)  Size<br>Whole Island of Sentosa + reclaimed land + floating casinos on stilts<br>(Malay villages) below which families can take a dip.<br><br>(2)  Layout<br>Most user-friendly networking of all business travellers who will be<br>attracted live and work here and to stay longer here in view of overall<br>attraction of our facilities.<br><br>(3)  Facility<br>7 bars, 6 restaurants, $18 car park per entry<br>24-hour amusement park, c/w ferris wheel (day-time museum<br>underwater world), any kinds of entertainment, licensed quality red-light<br>district, (transferring Orchard Road call-girls to Sentosa) integrated<br>cluster hotels laid in village formation to add personal touch, each known<br>by its own name, monorail, segway, bicycle, Banks, (easy loans),<br>bunnies to serve high rollers,<br><br>(4)   Regulations<br>Total entertainment, relaxed rules to encourage all types of<br>entertainment set-up, protections of vulnerable against gambling<br>addictions, limiting entries of vulnerable persons, security measures<br>(robberies or thefts)<br><br>(5)   Software<br>Good, cheap food, bazaar, huge hotdogs (like Las Vegas)<br><br>(6)  (a) Network - Tourism<br>Link Sentosa to all regional tourism destinations to create tropical theme<br>travel package. (stand-alone will not be sufficient to create attractions).<br><br>Refine Sentosa's underwater world to attract whole family tours with<br>sharks and bikini-mermaids performing fearsome underwater acts<br><br>(6)  (b) Network - Shopping<br>Showcasing products and services from fortune-500 and other world<br>companies through permanent conferences/ conventions connected<br>to world market.<br><br>(6)  (c) Network - Financial Hub<br>Swiss-style banking facilities to serve new breed of global businessmen<br>who will be attracted by holistic communication and financial hub<br>to operate from Sentosa. Additionally, total facilities exist to enable<br>them to extend and maintain world contacts with various businesses,<br>hubs, HQ services, incentive fund placements through Singapore<br>business/financial hub.<br><br>It is in short not casino that Singapore is after but world market<br>which can be integrated to casino via conferences/convention<br>tourisms/financial services.<br><br>Many more hubs serving petro-chemical, bio-tech, bio-medical, medical,<br>electronics, automation,  equipment, financial, banking, logistics and<br>telecoms. ..can then be enhanced or successfully created.<br><br>Casino will cause certain social risk. Such risk can be brought<br>under stringent control through proper regulations. Singapore should not<br>just build a casino but must aim at creating the world's best casino which<br>will turn it into a catalyst to create all integrated business hubs. Its<br>immediate clientele may be aimed at family, business travellers and rich<br>mobile tycoons who would have their home at nearby sentosa coves. Its<br>many indirect clientele will be many many business connections attracted<br>to  our hubs by overall integrated business/communication facilities.<br><br>[More...under construction ..open to new ideas]<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>We shud make it in such a way where sentosa has everything that you want for entertainment and any kind of entertainment. Move the farris wheel there, even move the entire red light district from geylang to sentosa.<br><br>Entertainment should run 24hrs with all night parties in evenings, day time transform back to the usual stuff like museum, underwater world etc ...<br><br>This way day and night service crews can be engaged to work round the clock<br><br>Build villages where in each village is a casino. Clustered around each casino   are hotels, pasar malam bazaars, food stalls, theme parks, discos, pubs.<br><br>But there should be no shopping centers at all, souvenir and DFS shops maybe but shopping centers leave it on the mainland.<br><br>Due to the size of the island, travelling from village to village is by either monorail, bicycle, or renting a segway. Attendants can be hired to collect , replenish bicycles, segways at different points etc ..<br><br>Rules regarding entertainment on island should be relaxed.<br><br>Rename sentosa into sin~tosa  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>
