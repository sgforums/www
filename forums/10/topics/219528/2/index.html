            <div class='col-md body'>Dear All,<br><br>I cannot speak on behalf of Tilik but this is what I feel.<br><br>There will always be diverse views among people in an organization. If everybody agrees 100% with each other everytime in a political party, that would be a total disaster! Not even communist parties around the world could achieve that level of "norming".<br><br>There will be compromises made here and there but I think for any people who are in opposition or alternative politics, they must have their own mind and principles. The crux of the matter is, where are the baselines?<br><br>Most of the time, we could compromise and come to a consensus and understanding. But for anybody with any sense of ideology and principles, when their baselines are being compromised, normally it would mean that there would be either vigorously conflicts within the party or that those who cannot agree on compromising their own principles, will leave the party.<br><br>There is one Chinese saying, dao bu tong, bu xiang wei mou, meaning if your path is no long the same, you will not walk/work together. Simple as that.<br><br>From this perspective, I do not think there is any right or wrong with regards to Tilik's resignation. At least he is truthful to himself, his own belief.<br><br>Goh Meng Seng<br><br></div>
