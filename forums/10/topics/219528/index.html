            <div class='col-md body'>"A RISING star in the Workers' Party quit the party yesterday in protest over members' right to speak freely on the Internet.<br>Lawyer and central executive council (CEC) member Chia Ti Lik, who led the WP's East Coast GRC team at the May General Election, said that he was opposed to a new resolution on Internet conduct passed by the party leadership.<br><br>The new ruling prevents CEC members from posting comments or statements on the Internet in their own name.<br><br>'This is about freedom of expression. Opposition members must be allowed to voice their criticism of the Government's policies and engage in any issue or debate that is of public interest,' said Mr Chia.<br><br>One of the WP's youngest leaders, Mr Chia, 32, is the second member in as many weeks to resign from the party.<br><br>On Tuesday, another CEC member, Mr Goh Meng Seng, said he quit the WP two weeks ago after creating what he called 'a bad image' for the party with his harsh online postings.<br><br>Party leaders met on Tuesday night at WP's Jalan Besar headquarters and passed the Internet resolution.<br><br>Mr Chia, who was not at the meeting, was dismayed by the move, saying it further limited the WP's 'scope and pace' of communication with the public.<br><br>'Since we often face problems getting our views across in the mainstream press, our only fallback is the Internet. This is a step backwards in public engagement,' he said.<br><br>He added that CEC members were now subject to a 'slow and tedious process of clearance' if they wanted to respond to any public issue.<br><br>Mr Chia joined the WP in 2004, becoming its assistant organising secretary a year later.<br><br>He revealed yesterday that the Internet restrictions were among other frustrations he had with the party leadership over the last six months, including during the polls.<br><br>One other issue was manpower. He said: 'During the General Election, we were very short-handed. Many supporters who helped out in East Coast GRC were not even party members. They were our friends and family.'<br><br>He added that he did not intend to join another political party any time soon.<br><br>Mr Perry Tong, a CEC member and the WP's youth wing president, told The Straits Times he was surprised by Mr Chia's resignation.<br><br>As for the WP's new Internet regulation, Mr Tong said he was 'comfortable' with it as the party needed to be cautious about participating in discussions that were 'not always responsible'.<br><br>Both the party's secretary-general Low Thia Khiang and chairman Sylvia Lim could not be reached for comment last night."<br><br>(Straits Times, 10 Nov)<br><br>As the Book of Great Learning states:<br><br>'He who desires to rule his nation must first learn to establish his own house' (http://libweb.zju.edu.cn:8080/renwen/JinDian/Ru/Ru.asp?title=%B4%F3%D1%A7%D5%C2%BE%E4)<br><br>If the Workers' Party cannot even keep its own leaders together, what hope do they have of trying to government an entire nation?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I reckon it all started off with that episode when one of the forumer   who was unhappy with a WP's member's replies in a forum and complained.  That triggered the WP to come out with some ruling that limits them so as to appease the general forum public.  Hence they weren't happy, and they quit. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  At least it showcases the dedication they have at what they do, willing to give it all up for what they stand for. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Why would resignations of this nature be seen as 'discord'?<br><br>Chia Ti Lik has at least stood by his beliefs and principles.

Therefore there is no point in pretending to stand united.<br><br>Better to seek greener pastures than to accept the party whip.<br><br>Such a move shows the willingness to think outside the box and stand firm in one's opinion. The WP allows freedom of expression and the daring to <strong><span style="color: darkblue;">QUESTION</span></strong> party lines that members do not agree with.<br><br>Can any such maturity be found in the Ruling Party, where party members have to 'toe the line' and <strong><span style="color: indigo;">OBEY</span></strong> the party whip without reservation?<br><br>Is it any wonder why there are almost no resignations from the White T-Shirt gang given such a compliant atmosphere where the voice of one man reigns supreme?</div>
