              <h1>Australia's dirty little colonial wars</h1>
              <p><em>As Anzac Day approaches, campaigners want Australia's war memorial to
              recognise the forgotten Aborigines killed by white settlers</em></p>
              <p class="author">By Kathy Marks</p>
              <p class="info"><em>Sunday, 19 April 2009</em></p>
              <p>The Australian War Memorial, an imposing building on the shores of
              Lake Burley Griffin in Canberra, honours the dead of two world wars as
              well as other conflicts, including Korea, Malaysia and Vietnam. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>But the
              bloody and prolonged battles that accompanied white settlement of
              Australia, and claimed at least 20,000 Aboriginal lives, rate barely a
              mention.</strong></span></p>
              <p>More than 200 years after the First Fleet landed at
              Sydney Cove, white Australians are still struggling to come to terms
              with their colonial past. Long erased from official accounts, the
              clashes and massacres that took place on the frontier remain a
              contested area of history, often replaced by more palatable stories of
              rugged pioneers conquering an inhospitable land.</p>
              <p>The descendants
              of the early white settlers served the British Empire, and later
              Australia, overseas; their deeds are celebrated in the War Memorial,
              and are recalled on 25 April, the anniversary of the First World War
              campaign at Gallipoli. This year, though, as Anzac Day approaches,
              there are demands for the memorial to commemorate a less heroic aspect
              of military history: the dirty wars fought on Australian soil.</p>
              <p>A lithograph of British troops killing black warriors in 1838 at the
              aptly named Slaughterhouse Creek is the only reference to those wars in
              the monument's displays. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Yet they raged across the continent for nearly
              150 years, the last recorded incident being at Coniston, in the
              Northern Territory, where 70 Aborigines were shot dead in 1928 by an
              official force, which was subsequently exonerated.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Calls for
              proper recognition are supported by leading historians, who note that
              the US and New Zealand, among others, have faced up to their
              colonial-era atrocities. The Canadian War Memorial includes displays on
              the violence committed by European settlers against native peoples.</p>
              <p>However,
              the Canberra monument's governing council insists that the frontier
              conflicts do not belong within its walls. Bill Crews, a council member,
              and president of the Returned and Services League (RSL), says: "These
              events are principally a matter of social history, and as such are more
              appropriately reflected in other institutions, such as the National
              Museum."</p>
              <p>Military historians disagree. John Connor, from the
              Australian Defence Force Academy, has no doubt that war was waged in
              early colonial times – even if it was undeclared and did not resemble a
              traditional war, consisting of small-scale skirmishes between
              Aborigines and soldiers or police.</p>
              <p>British soldiers were
              despatched to the Hunter Valley and Hawkesbury River, north of Sydney,
              while Australian paramilitary police were sent into action elsewhere.
              In Queensland, Aborigines were "dispersed" and "pacified" by Native
              Mounted Police. In total, an estimated 3,000 whites were killed.</p>
              <p>Dr
              Connor says: "Military officers on the ground talked about war, and if
              they're calling it a war, what else can you call it? On the Aboriginal
              side, they remember it as a war, to defend their land."</p>
              <p>That
              definition, though, casts doubt on the legal and moral basis of
              colonisation, he says. "If the British occupation of Australia was
              fought over, it means the wealth of white Australians comes from taking
              the land from indigenous Australians, and their social problems,
              including low life expectancy, are because of the dislocation of losing
              their land and lifestyle."</p>
              <p>At least the subject is being
              discussed now. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>For nearly 100 years, the frontier conflicts were
              ignored, forgotten or denied.</strong></span> During the 19th century, urban
              Australians knew and cared little about what was happening on the edges
              of civilisation. For much of the 20th century, the clashes over land
              were written out of the history books and were not taught in schools.</p>
              <p>Instead,
              the myth was forged, particularly after the Australian colonies
              federated as an independent nation in 1901, of a bloodless occupation,
              and a country that knew neither war nor revolution. The late
              anthropologist William Stanner called it the "great Australian
              silence". Henry Reynolds, an eminent historian, says: "The foundation
              story was a heroic one, and the story was fatally compromised if you
              put the Aborigines into it."</p>
              <p>Rather than resisting the foreign
              invaders, Aborigines – with the exception of a few "treacherous blacks"
              – meekly abandoned their land, it was believed. Indeed, until the mid
              20th century, they were assumed to be a dying race, partly because of
              introduced diseases.</p>
              <p>A series of lectures by Stanner in 1968,
              entitled "After the Dreaming", pierced the bubble of silence. But not
              until 1981, when Professor Reynolds published The Other Side of the
              Frontier, did the colonial-era wars begin to be widely discussed and
              accepted as historical orthodoxy. His writings were cited by the High
              Court judges who, in 1992, finally overthrew the legal fiction of terra
              nullius – the idea that Australia was uninhabited when the British
              arrived.</p>
              <p>Even now, though, the subject remains controversial. One
              well-known historian, Geoffrey Blainey, has criticised the "black
              armband view of history". Another, Keith Windschuttle, has challenged
              Professor Reynolds's estimate of the number of Aboriginal deaths and
              his claims of a policy of deliberate genocide.</p>
              <p>The history wars
              are still being fought; meanwhile, the Anzac legend – based on the
              bravery of Australian and New Zealand troops at Gallipoli – is stronger
              than ever. Increasing numbers of young people visit the Turkish
              peninsula where the Anzacs landed in 1915, and where, despite heavy
              casualties and an eventual retreat, Australia became a nation, it is
              said.</p>
              <p>There are war memorials in almost every Australian town,
              but only a handful of reminders of the brutal events close to home. A
              monument to 28 Aborigines, mainly women and children, who were
              massacred in 1838 at Myall Creek, in New South Wales, was put up only
              in 2003.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>In New Zealand, the wars that accompanied colonisation
              are widely recognised. However, the Maoris were far more numerous than
              the Aborigines; they spoke the same language and came together to fight
              formal battles. Aborigines were widely scattered, spoke nearly 300
              languages and moved around in small family groups.</strong></span></p>
              <p>The
              Australian frontier wars sit uneasily with the Anzac legend, with its
              emphasis on service and sacrifice. Peter Stanley, who was the War
              Memorial's chief historian for 27 years, describes them as "guerrilla
              wars ... sordid and secret". "Those who say they don't belong there are
              disregarding and diminishing the Aboriginal understanding of history,"
              says Dr Stanley, now director of the Centre for Historical Research at
              the National Museum of Australia. "<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The conflicts begin in 1790 and
              continue until the 1920s. In between, if you look at a map of
              Australia, you can plot literally dozens of fights, with the largest
              taking place in New South Wales and Western Australia in the 1830s and
              Queensland in the 1860s and 1870s.</strong></span></p>
              <p>"<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>As the frontier moves, the
              settlers encounter each Aboriginal people's territory. The Aborigines
              kill some of their cattle, and retribution occurs. At the same time,
              there's cultural degradation. The conflicts precede the destruction of
              Aboriginal society, and you can trace it across the continent."</strong></span></p>
              <p>A
              War Memorial spokesman says the frontier wars fall outside its charter,
              which requires it to honour Australian troops killed overseas. Others
              dispute that legal interpretation, and point out that the charter had
              been changed to include the Boer Wars.</p>
              <p>Professor Reynolds
              believes racism lies behind the governing council's stance. "It's the
              idea that the Aborigines were not worthy opponents, and therefore it
              wasn't really a war," he says. "But it was a war of Aboriginal
              resistance, and it was amazingly effective in some places: in Tasmania,
              200 Europeans were killed."</p>
              <p>Bill Crews, the RSL president, denies
              the racism charge, noting that the memorial honours Aboriginal
              servicemen who have fought for Australia. Dr Stanley sees things
              differently. Recalling the official apology by the Prime Minister,
              Kevin Rudd, last year to the "Stolen Generations", he says: "I don't
              think it's feasible, in a post-apology Australia, to ignore that
              important part of our history any longer."</p>
