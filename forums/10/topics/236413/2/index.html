Why so if our big biopolis was producing results? What did our minister for manpower, and trade and industry say.<br><br>Still remember what they said : Singapore is too small and being vulnerable to external conditions, the government cannot do anything in stoping these MNCs and foreign companies from leaving and retrenching our workers.<br><br>I am sure if the biopolis in our economic restructuring has been progressing well indeed as stated by the ministers and EDB chief they would not be so helpless as to blame everything on external conditions and lack of retraining by the workers.<br><br>If you are to re-read the Straits Times of 1999-2004, I am sure you will come across ministers saying practically the only solution is for people to be re-trained as muli-tasking cleaners, taxi-drivers, nurses or teachers ...<br><br>If biomedical researches have worked well due to good strategizing we could have discovered some new drugs like vaccine for bird flus, as the Taiwanese researchers have done with lesser fanfare and boasting.<br><br>Of the smaller amounts spent on their own strategic economic restructuring plan including some lesser biomedical hubs, the Koreans and Taiwanese have done better and climbed out of their recessions earlier.<br><br>They do not have to keep raising fees or taxes against their own people in doing so as our ministers have done. They solved their problems by practical entrepreneurship and creativity instead of seeking scapegoat of the people.<br><br>The ministers and Philip Yeo have only been wringling their hands or trying to put their own failures on some bond breakers or male NS men. It is a shame that despite being paid super-peanut salaries all that they could do is to blame the people for lack of retraining or skills.<br><br>What has the government been doing spending people's millions on workers' training since 1970s? I asked this question at one seminar of Spring and it was admitted by the Spring speaker that the training of workers during the past twenty years or so have not quite produced the desired results. So who was at fault - spring, edb, ministers or workers.<br><br>The whole system is full of grand concepts or one kind or another full of hot air and talking but little implementation skills or abilities.<br><br>That is why our economy was still not restructured as intended since the 1970s when Goh Keng Swee was already planning to upgrade it to some value-adding technology-driven model.<br><br>Why, we took so long and there was still all the talking about R&amp;D and more R&amp; D to no end?<br><br>Many workers who lost their jobs in the 1997 recessions remained unemployed and those who were re-employed had their wages dropping below that of the 1980s. What do our ministers do to help these workers - more gst and more fee increases I suppose?<br><br>The above I am sure are sufficient evidence to show that our EDB chief and all the ministers are only interested in talking but little strategizing with the support of all our own unemployed and highly educated human and land resources.<br><br>One could only wonder why we are paying millions to the ministers and yet we keep hearing excuses after excuses. The latest excuse seems to be we still have to wait for indefinite period for such billion-dollar investments on biomedical researches to bear fruits. That is why our ministers and EDB chief have failed to catch the bull by the horn so to speak to stop playing with concepts and giving excuses.<br><br><blockquote>  quote:Originally posted by robertteh:<br>It is in the area of how and implementation which is the real issue.

Surely you are aware that exports in the biomedical industry has grown by a startling 30%, contributing much revenue to the economy. There are new jobs being created in the biomedical industry, but there is a mismatch between the jobs created the skillset of our workers. Many local workers either do not have the required skills in the R&amp;D labs or refuse to work in clean rooms that are necesary in the manufacturing plants. That is why we need to change the attitude of our workers and re-train them for the new jobs that are available.<br><br>You are talking about recesions since 1993, way before our biomedical indiustry has been conceived. It requires lead time to grow this industry, given how few of our students study biology in secondary schools and universities. The past recessions illustrate the dangers of relying on just our IT industry to bring in the manufacturing revenue. That is exactly why this life sciences initiative is necessary to broaden our economic base. Singapore has recovered from these recessions and emerged stronger than ever, which is a testament to the leadership of the government. What has the Opposition parties done for Singaporeans during all these recessions?<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by robertteh:</div><div class="quote_body"> That is why our economy was still not restructured as intended since the 1970s when Goh Keng Swee was already planning to upgrade it to some value-adding technology-driven model.<br><br>Why, we took so long and there was still all the talking about R&amp;D and more R&amp; D to no end? </div></blockquote>Because too many Singaporeans are just sitting on their backsides and ranting like you instead of acquiring the skillsets that are needed for new growth industries. When students from China are working hard and sweeping all our top prizes, our students are learning from the adults and complain all day.

There are plenty of jobs in wafer fabs but half the workers are foreigners because our locals refuse to take them. If our unemployed workers are so desperate, why won't they take the jobs? Oh no! They would have to work shifts and be suited up in the clean room...it's uncomfortable...excuses, excuses.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>quote:Originally posted by robertteh:<br>Despite all the big monies spent on biomedical researches, have we succeeded in making a dent on our manufacturing in terms on job creations for these period from our biomedical researches?<br><br>How many of our new graduates from universities during 1999-2004 when we were spending big bucks in these researches were absorbed by these biopolis and the spin-offs created from such capital-intensive investments.<br><br>During the last three recessions, we took about the longest than Korea, Taiwan and HongKong to recover from recession. Why so if our big biopolis was producing results? What did our minister for manpower, and trade and industry say.<br><br>OM:-<br><br>The rapid rise in biomedical exports in the recent years has been well publicised. Surely you are aware that exports in the biomedical industry has grown by a startling 30%, contributing much revenue to the economy. There are new jobs being created in the biomedical industry, but there is a mismatch between the jobs created the skillset of our workers. Many local workers either do not have the required skills in the R&amp;D labs or refuse to work in clean rooms that are necesary in the manufacturing plants. That is why we need to change the attitude of our workers and re-train them for the new jobs that are available.<br><br>You are talking about recesions since 1993, way before our biomedical indiustry has been conceived. It requires lead time to grow this industry, given how few of our students study biology in secondary schools and universities. The past recessions illustrate the dangers of relying on just our IT industry to bring in the manufacturing revenue. That is exactly why this life sciences initiative is necessary to broaden our economic base. Singapore has recovered from these recessions and emerged stronger than ever, which is a testament to the leadership of the government. What has the Opposition parties done for Singaporeans during all these recessions?</blockquote>You have asked for evidence why people and the World Bank are saying why our biopolis has not been successful and their chances of success is at best 50/50 and I have given you relevant evidence in your absence of the ministers and EDB providing the data and now you are not accepting such evidences.<br><br>The relevant apple-to-apple evidences should actually come forth from the ministers and EDB chief and not for the people to provide.<br><br>Nonetheless given the kind of autocratic government that we have we have all to take what they claims as job creations with a big pinch of salt. So far all the job creation data as questioned by Dr. Lee Wei Ling were quite muddled probably deliberately kept that way like in the nkf saga so as to avoid accountability. People are no fools to believe their so-called biopolis sucecss and they probably will have to bear with such denials as happened in NKF.<br><br>The correct approach to arrive your required evidences actually is for the ministers and EDB to keep track of biomedical spending with coordinated call-centre processes which people can view on weekly basis to show progress as to whether biomedical spending has produced returns : (1) Major discoveries like  bird flu vaccines or cure of certain cancer (2) ROI on our multi-billion investments in this area.<br><br>Philip Yeo cannot just make claims of success based on his own generation and he must invite all concerned including the ministers witnessed by such reliable data to review the efforts periodically and decide whether to continue or close down or phase out any over-ambitious projects to avoid throwing away monies which do not hold promise or assurances of returns.<br><br>Are our ministers and the government prepared to change their system and make themselves more accountable on such spendings which may not produce any returns of usefulness to our people many of whom despite all the hghly trained skills and education are still unemployed after recessions retrenchments.<br><br>Can we truly claim that the biopolis has been successful just by claiming that they create some jobs. Who analyse these jobs as value-adding jobs which were directly attributable to the biopolis? The world bank has expressed great doubts about so-called success of our biopolis. Like what Dr Lee Wei Ling has pointed out the recent job creations in our various industries do not necessarily arise from our biopolis. Many of the firms were set up here due to our factors like our IP laws, and a more English educated work force. Mostly if we have some creations of jobs recently it is generally attributable to world recovery and the rise of China and India which provide us with some opportunities finally to emerge out of our desperate straits.<br><br>So it will have to be the ministers and and civil servants paid to do their jobs to restructure the economy. Where they have failed to do so during the 1990s recessions, it is for them now to reexamine their policy mistakes and implementation shortfalls and not to continue to push the problems back to the people - giving excuses like their being lacking in skills. Are our early highly educated  unemployed short of skills? Something must be wrong with our education system.<br><br>In addition, to my advice that the ministers and EDB must own up and not give any more excuses like the NKF I have shown you evidences from the past recessions that they have been continuously giving excuses for their inabilities in upgrading the economy talked about since 1970s to the value-adding model. What went wrong? Are they not going to do something to focus on niche areas and make better use of our highly educated work force many of whom even with university education are becoming the newly highly educated unemployed.<br><br>What is wrong ? We are paying our ministers million-dollar salaries only to hear more excuses and they have the cheek to ask people to give them solutions ever so often.<br><br>Don't make our ministers who are supposed to be talented world-class leaders the laughing stock of the world community.<br><br>People are not fools to take what they say about job creations at face value. They seem to be only interested in their own GDP or surpluses which hardly help to solve problems faced by the majority.<br><br>All that happened during recessions is that people kept hearing excuses like the government could not do anything about some so-called globalisation phenomenon known as structural unemployments.<br><br>When the world economy finally recovers they were so quick to claim that their biopolis is now working wonderfully without any reliable and verified figures to back up their claims. It is like the nkf saying what they like for years and when exposed in a proper scrutiny, all the worms will be crawling out of the cans.<br><br>There were misfits between the government ERC plans obviously as you have now admitted that jobs that were created in some factories are unable to be taken up by our citizens. Who causes these poor implementations of the ER plans.<br><br>Citizens are not paid to give ideas or help in implementation of these ER plans since 1993 when the economy was floundering due to lack of efforts by EDB in upgrading to the value-adding model to catch up with the Koreans and Taiwanese whose IT, biomedical and technologies are producing international brand names.<br><br>Has the ministers succeeded in upgrading the economy since the 1990s? If they have why do we still have to retired all the young scholars and highly educated graduates in the early 40s.<br><br>Obviously the leaders have failed in their past 3 economic restructuring plan and are now at the instance of the world recovery tried to make claims that their biomedical R&amp;D researches are doing well.<br><br>Just go and look back on our economic performance, for how many quarters of 2006 have these industries connected to the biopolis been making advances in the form of breakthrough and job creations and using the GDP or other close-door statistics which hardly convince any one.<br><br><blockquote>quote:Originally posted by robertteh:<br>That is why our economy was still not restructured as intended since the 1970s when Goh Keng Swee was already planning to upgrade it to some value-adding technology-driven model.<br><br>Why, we took so long and there was still all the talking about R&amp;D and more R&amp; D to no end?<br><br>Because too many Singaporeans are just sitting on their backsides and ranting like you instead of acquiring the skillsets that are needed for new growth industries. When students from China are working hard and sweeping all our top prizes, our students are learning from the adults and complain all day. Burying your sand in the sand will not make you fit to work in the biomed ndustry.</blockquote>I can tell you that people are not fools to believe all the craps about biopolis being successful. It is the responsibility of the paid ministers and civil servants to implement the economic restructuring plans aimed at upgrading the economy to a value-adding technology-driven model as announced for many years. They will not easily believe such excuses like they are at fault for not implementing the restructuring or being too laid back on their skill training.<br><br><blockquote> quote:Originally posted by robertteh:<br>Many workers who lost their jobs in the 1997 recessions remained unemployed and those who were re-employed had their wages dropping below that of the 1980s. What do our ministers do to help these workers - more gst and more fee increases I suppose?<br><br>The only way to help these workers is to re-train them for new jobs that are available. There are plenty of jobs in wafer fabs but half the workers are foreigners because our locals refuse to take them. If our unemployed workers are so desperate, why won't they take the jobs? Oh no! They would have to work shifts and be suited up in the clean room...it's uncomfortable...excuses, excuses. Fact is: they are not hungry enough for the jobs, which go to the Malaysians and the Chinese.</blockquote>Just advise the ministers and EDB not to make unsubstantiated claims and come up with information and data to show breakthrough researches and applications in actual implementation like a new cure for diseases or bird flu.<br><br>If they researchers are still unable to come up with tangible discoveries or products which are turned into manufacturing and jobs, let us forget about any such projects and concentrate in doing something else more worthwhile to do.<br><br><blockquote>   quote:Originally posted by robertteh:<br>They could well be wasting more valuable time when Taiwan researchers armed with more strategic plans and implementation skills as espoused by practical entrepreneurs like Stanley Shih is going to discover bird flus vaccine whereas we are still waiting and waiting for some elusive breakthrough or foreign talents to help in breaking through.<br><br>Talk is cheap. Make the vaccone and then talk.</blockquote>Yes people's talk are cheap but if our ministers and EDB talk cheap it will be time they go and let someone else take over like the clintons or mahathirs.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ha... the IT sector died. It died because there was simply not enough private sector involvement and all the Govt jobs ended up in Govt company hands or MNC hands. Another reason why to suspect the biotech industry will end up like a failure like all the other great economic initiatives of the Govt. Silicon Valley of the east my bloody foot. More air than actual substance. At the root of the whole problem is the Govt's obsession with increasing cash that goes into their coffers and not cash into the hands of the individual as the Govt fears rich men and their influence. The more of corporate Singapore under their control the better.<br><br>The biotech sector is just another attempt to replace the electronics sector as the main driver of the manufacturing sector. Perhaps the Govt would set up another Chartered to be in the sector, only to have it fail because of poor business strategy and practices just as Chartered fell so far behind its more agile Taiwanese rivals that it had to run piggy back on IBM and AMD to get away from red ink. Chartered simply symbolised all things bad about corporate Singapore and is a mere symptom of the wider problem. Typical Govt strategy, typical outcome and typical nonsense that one should expect from a control freakish Govt who uses Confucianism as it can control the masses/sheep better, only to reward themselves richly when the economy does well or worse whatever. The Govt just enjoys talking up the country when in reality everything is just a deck of cards. Give it a good kick, and everything comes crashing down.</div>

Despite portraying yourself as an informed critic of the government, you have concentrated only pointing out Mr Philip Yeo's faults while apparently supporting Dr Lee without explaining your reasons why.<br><br>In addition, some of your articles are general criticisms of the government and not addressing the specific points in this debate.<br><br>Of course many of us are concerned with where the biomedical sector is headed.<br><br>However your posts misrepresent the issues.<br><br>It's not "Philip Yeo has no strategy" vs "Lee Wei Ling has strategy".<br><br>It's "Philip Yeo has one strategy" vs "Lee Wei Ling has another".<br><br>The government does have a niche strategy that prioritizes biomedical research in areas like cancer, heart disease and stem cells.<br><br>Dr. Lee disagrees with these areas and recommends head injury and Hepatitis B as better niche areas.<br><br>She thinks that the government is having aimlessly "shotgun approach", but if that is the case why did Philip Yeo close the Institute of Agrobiology?<br><br>Robert, if you are supportive of Dr. Lee's approach, then can you explain to the rest of us why you agree that Singapore has a unique advantage in head injury and Hepatitis B research compared to cancer and stem cell biology?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just to add on:  Dr. Lee's recommendations on focusing on areas such as head injury...<br><br>Here's some <a href="http://www.moh.gov.sg/corp/publications/statistics/principal.do" rel="nofollow"> statistics from MOH</a><br><br>I think Dr. Brenner's and Philip Yeo's recommendations to focus on areas such cancer and stem cell biology are still a lot more reasonable for the local population than on very specialized areas such as head injury and hep b. A huge part about the translational medicine component of biomedical research is being about to work with patients, and without a large patient base, it is going be difficult to establish.<br><br>[/url]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by oxford mushroom:</div><div class="quote_body">The rapid rise in biomedical exports in the recent years has been well publicised. Surely you are aware that exports in the biomedical industry has grown by a startling 30%, contributing much revenue to the economy. There are new jobs being created in the biomedical industry, but there is a mismatch between the jobs created the skillset of our workers. Many local workers either do not have the required skills in the R&amp;D labs or refuse to work in clean rooms that are necesary in the manufacturing plants. That is why we need to change the attitude of our workers and re-train them for the new jobs that are available. </div></blockquote>OM,<br><br>From this paragraph, I can see that you have also been confused by the difference between pharmaceutical manufacturing industry and biomedical research initiative.<br><br>Though it is true that the government's biomedical initiative has encouraged a number of pharmaceutical companies to come to Singapore after 2001, most of the money spent on the initiative has been used for infrastructure and manpower training.<br><br>So Dr. Lee is right that the biomedical investment costs has not paid off directly yet. The pharma are posting record sales, but pocketing much of this. Meanwhile the government is spending billions to build the foundations of a biotech industry.<br><br>In order to make megabucks, we still have to wait for our freshly trained scientists to join industry and set up our own pharma and biotech companies.<br><br>What we can agree on is that Dr. Lee thinks that it's all a mistake and IMHO that call is way, way too premature.<br></div>
