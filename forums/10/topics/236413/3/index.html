The pharma are posting record sales, but pocketing much of this. Meanwhile the government is spending billions to build the foundations of a biotech industry.<br><br>In order to make megabucks, we still have to wait for our freshly trained scientists to join industry and set up our own pharma and biotech companies.<br><br>What we can agree on is that Dr. Lee thinks that it's all a mistake and IMHO that call is way, way too premature.<br></div></blockquote>In all likelihood, the Govt is likely to personally push and set up a new GLC to do the job of fighting the pharmaceuticals. Start-ups in Singapore have a very harsh environment to work on and likely, even if it does survive, it would get bought by Temasek, just as Temasek bought a piece of Hyflux.<br><br>That assumes we even get that far to start our own GLC.</div>

It will be clear from reading the old Straits Times that the ministers were at their wit's end and were not sure of all their so-called economic restructuring or biomedical plans and tended to blame the lack of implementation of those plans on the people instead for lack of skills or the right education to stay ahead.<br><br>I have not misrepresented the crucial issues here involved in this topic. I am afraid you have not understood my perspective in the whole topic. If the various past economic restructuring plans would not be carried out consistently so far how could our ministers or Philip Yeo be so sure that this time the biomedical plan would be strategically and consistently carried out espcially in an industry as complex as the biopolis.  It is quite as likely that the grandiose biomedical plans may just suffer the same fate.<br><br>I am afraid even if we do have well-reasoned biomedical long-term plan, we may no longer have the kind of people with good implementation excellence like Dr. Goh Keng Swee or Lim Kim San to oversee them consistently.<br><br>So far we only hear the ministers continue to talk and talk about upgrading our economy but we have not seen any existing plans implemented with excellence in respect of even conventional projects like creating IT hubs, software engineering hubs and needed technology start-ups.<br><br>Too much academic or technocratic type of people may be at fault. Since absorbing so many new bloods from the 1970s, we have yet to see transformation of our own domestic manufacturing sector to value-adding technology-driven model of model to match that of Korea, Taiwan or Finland which are turning out many international branded products.<br><br>In our case we are just hoping and hoping to attract more and more foreign set-ups to revitalise our own lagging domestic economy. Something seriously is going wrong with the management of our economy.<br><br>If we are still talking again and again to create some more grandiose plans, I would like to ask the question - do we not have enough plans already and which direction are we heading now or are our leaders only concept people all the time good for more big-picture presentations which again may not produce results due to lack of implementation abilities.<br><br>Remember, the need to set up biomedical hubs has been talked about by the ministers for a long time. Our biomedical hubs were seen as struggling and not bringing in the results like scientific breakthroughs in this area and follow-up manufacturing and creations of jobs among our own citizens.<br><br>What assurances can be given to the citizens now that all the hopes and dreams of discovering something big and follow-up manufacturing of various drugs and cures in our particular targeting will be achieved within say three to five years to further confirm to our citizens the efforts and total investment commitments by the billions will be worthwhile.<br><br>Based on the rather muddled thinking mentioned that we must invest in such areas so as to hit big returns equivalent to discovery of cancer cures or bird flu vaccines is for the moment in the absence of good objective analysis from learned strategists, we can only conclude that their hopes and aspirations are nothing more than some wishful thinking.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>What we should look for in our biomed investment are the potential for job creation and commercial gains.<br><br>There's no point pumping millions of investment to fuel the research interests of local scientific elites or FTs. Breakthrough in pure research don't create jobs or make money. That's why Brenner is not an industrialist, though he is much respected in his field.<br><br>Dr Lee has a good point about the strategy of identifying niche areas ie. Singapore should differentiate its R&amp;D from other countries'. All else being equal, concentrating our resources on niche areas increase the chance for our success. Then we should choose the niche which has market potential.<br><br>Philip Yeo's strategy is less likely to result in a breakthrough because our investment is spread over many areas. Plus every other country is working on the same popular fields of stem cells and cancer. His strategy will result in a diversity of talents working in Singapore which makes the R&amp;D scene more interesting, not will not get us to commercial success sooner.<br><br>I'd suggest that Singapore invest in food &amp; nutrition R&amp;D. Products like vitamins, diet pills, cosmetics have more immediate commercial value and are lower tech and more appropriate for our level of R&amp;D capability. Even less sexy products like reduced-harm cigarettes have huge and immediate market potential. Forget about Nobel-prize winning cancer cures for now.<br></div>
