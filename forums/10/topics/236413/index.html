            <div class='col-md body'>This past few days there has been a war of words between two powerful members of the establishment, Mr Philip Yeo of A*Star and Dr Lee Wei Ling of NNI about the current state of the biomedical research industry.<br><br>Is it thriving or ailing?<br><br>Dr Lee commented that (ST 8 Feb)...<br><br>"This is not a matter of one-upmanship. We're talking about billions of dollars of tax-payers' money. I will not let this mistake continue."<br><br>From  Mr Yeo's perspective...<br><br>"The debate has drawn strong words from both sides, with outgoing A*Star chairman Philip Yeo remarking that Dr Lee had not set foot into the biomedical centre Biopolis, where key research institutes are clustered."<br><br>On the other hand, Dr Lee countered that...<br><br>"I would say that Mr Philip Yeo, having never practiced as a doctor, is strategising about biomedical research directions in an ivory tower. That is why he can dismiss hepatitis B and head injury as unimportant."<br><br>Needless to say, many Singaporeans are concerned about the costs of building a biomedical industry. The amounts of money involved is huge and the payoffs may be uncertain.<br><br>The pharmaceutical companies are posting record high returns. However the eventual results of basic biomedical research is still unknown at this time. The first batch of A*Star PhD scholars are just graduating, and the MD-PhDs are not even done school yet.<br><br>I am disappointed that instead of a lively debate using facts and figures, the discussion has quickly turned into a game of pulling rank.<br><br>If you consider this a lone voice of reason against the establishment - in what way is a director of a national institute not establishment?<br><br>All of us little people are utterly confused.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This debate clearly represents different things to different people depending on one's perception of the issues involved.<br><br>To me, the issues being debated are more than biomedical research but bespeak of more fundamental issues of our governance as may be summarized as follows:-<br><br>(1) When our leaders talk of world-class leadership and creating all sorts of hubs or chasing the world cup in football, honestly do they have the abilities to attain such goals and objectives. What kind of implementation or practical talents do they have among their own numbers in attaining all these goals. Are they over-confident of themselves or are they simply too self-centred to understand what were behind such endeavours. There are major challenges which need to be targetted at and not just spewing policies or spending taxpayers' billions or importing of all the foreign talents and throwing good monies after bad monies.<br><br>(2) Do we have among a heavy-weight technology-startup experts among ministers or top civil servants of the calibre of Stanley Shih to build up international products needed by the world and create brand names and introducing all the practical knowledge applications for technology startups to succeed. Ask Philip Yeo and we all will recall his approach is to send more and more top students overseas and what were his follow-up plans to use these proteges for after graduation. Did they go into speerheading technology startups to support our value-adding economic restructuring plans announced over the past three recessions?<br><br>For one thing we cannot over-rely on only overly conceptual incentives or generalist academic-oriented talents to get to what we want -value for monies and targeting and strategizing with a master plan is critical but did Philip Yeo come up with one such master plan to ensure practical follow-up to restructure the past value-adding upgrading plans to take our economy one notch higher to where Dr.Goh Keng Swee left us.<br><br>So with this type of conceptual policy approach we are unlikely to have the wherewithal to make it big in biomedical researches given the keen competitions among such similar centres.<br><br>I have to ask Philip Yeo based on what confidence that his vision as painted by him will be achieved given our smaller resources and lesser implementation abilities among our civil servants to restructure the economy. Do we have any better triumph cards then some pools of generalists who know next to nothing other than academic educations. How many of them are that creative or entrepreneurial as compared with the like of Bill Gate or Stanley Shih in creating technology start-ups and succeed against world competitions.<br><br>(3) Can we talk up the economic competitiveness just by praising government's past policies based on academic theories?<br><br>It would appear that for most of the past 40 years now, our leaders have been managing the country academically, legalistically with little hands-on implementation abilities.<br><br>That is why, when we try to copy Taiwan by going into semi-conductor wafer fabrication, computer and micro-electronic, our wafer plants set up with huge capital pumped in for years have not turned in any credible results.<br><br>Chartered Semi-Conductor will be forever playing second fiddle to the Taiwanese firms specializing in wafer fab.<br><br>We do not have strategists who could see both macro and micro pictures of the whole economic restructuring and our scholars in EDB like Philip Yeo could at best scrape the whole Biomedical drive at the surface.<br><br>I remember at one time, it was reported by some biomedical scientist interviewed by the press as to why she did not choose to return to Singapore to do her stint of biomedical research in our motivated environment and her answer was: She has to decide whether to work in more advanced centres of research in UK of which there were 16 as compared with Singapore which has yet to establish even one leading centre.<br><br>Dr. Lee Wei Ling may be right in disagreeing with the self-centred policies adopted by our government and Mr. Philip Yeo mere is a by-product of our past conceptual policy or ivory-tower approach adopted by our first-generation leaders.<br><br>If there is a fault-line in our past leadership system, it shows up clearly in our launching into world cup quest, semi-conductor and all the world-class or leadership jazz which could not be implemented due to the sheer lack of practical implementation strategizing.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>While no doubt Singapore's biomedical industry is reaping profits, I doubt it would last, going by how strong developing nations are.<br><br>Mr Yeo, if I'm not wrong, is a businessman, and will see profits. Dr Lee, on the other hand, is a doctor, and definitely would have understood the consequences and the severity of illnesses if not treated, no matter how minor.<br><br>It's a debate of business profits against medical research and somewhere in between, they cross each other paths.</div>

Saying that i want to achieve this or that breakthrough but doing is hard. Which is probably why we need these expensive researchers to make things simpler. But even then, it doesn't guarantee that breakthrough could be achieve in one or two years. The huge amount of time and effort required had been explained by Philip Yeo which is why you won't see any results for now.<br><br>Also for your investment by allied firms, I suppose its easy to attract them to our soils.

Science is quite a hit and miss affair and I disagree with the Govt's approach with regards to big names. Furthermore, the Govt's attitudes towards Science is appalling. Focusing on one main field only is recipe for disaster and only serves to alienate local talent who are interested in other fields and choose to ply their trade else where instead of contributing to Singapore. Fact of the matter is, if the Govt had taken an enlightened approach to Science a long time ago instead of playing around with social engineering for the past decades, none of this would have happened. We would never have to had the need of injecting billions into research just to catch up.<br><br>At the end of the day, the Govt is going to realise that many things are interconnected and that developing inquiring minds is not something you can just order over the counter.</div>

Dr Lee, on the other hand, is a doctor, and definitely would have understood the consequences and the severity of illnesses if not treated, no matter how minor.<br><br>It's a debate of business profits against medical research and somewhere in between, they cross each other paths.</div></blockquote>Mr Yeo was trained as an engineer, but he has an MBA from Harvard, so he does see things from a more business perspective.<br><br>Dr Lee was trained as an neurologist, so you are right that she should tends towards a medical view. However, I hope you understand that doctors of senior appointment are practically administrators who are supposed to understand the big picture, so she should understand what the biomedical field entails.<br><br>In fact her suggestion to focus on head injury and Hepatitis B stems from her belief that there is a strong market in these areas.<br><br>So I strongly disagree that it is a debate  of "business profits vs medical research". Both parties clearly understand the importance of business profits, its the direction that they don't agree.</div>
