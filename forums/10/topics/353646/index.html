              </div>
              <div class="post-body entry-content"><br><br>I
                      have just watched the news on the proposed PAP law on political films
                      and illegal gatherings. I have very mixed feelings at first but that
                      lasted only for a mere 5 minutes and thereafter I begin to feel amused
                      again by PAP's policy of micro management. <br><br>The thought of the
                      Cha Cha dance comes into my mind straight away and yes, it is PAP's Cha
                      Cha with its monopoly of power again. While it tries very hard to
                      "mitigate" the "problems" brought about by the New Media, it also tries
                      very hard to make itself looks good.</div>
              <div class="post-body entry-content"><br></div>
              <div class="post-body entry-content">Well, it tries to show
                      Singaporeans, especially the young ones, that it is willing to "take a
                      step forward" in "loosening up" on such rules,<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> but in actual fact, it
                      is taking THREE STEPS backwards in TIGHTENING the screws</strong></span> that the New
                      Media has loosen for FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION as well as Freedom of
                      Information Flow! <br><br>Incidentally, just minutes after I recompose myself from such amusement, <a href="http://singaporerebel.blogspot.com/2009/03/new-restrictions-to-films-act.html">Martyn See</a> has sent a note to me via facebook. Yes, he has exactly the same
                      thought I have with regards to the issue on political films. PAP's
                      INTOLERANCE of the "mocking nature" of some creation of its critics in
                      Youtube has prompted it to implement such rules on political films.</div>
              <div class="post-body entry-content"><br></div>
              <div class="post-body entry-content">The
                      spin doctors of this very establishment will go around to boast about
                      the "OPENNESS" of PAP for the coming few days but in actual fact, what
                      the PAP government tries to do is to try to erase away all those grey
                      areas and deprive its Internet Critics a platform to dance around. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>But
                      of course, the PAP policy think tank will have to hoodwink Singaporeans
                      into thinking that PAP is actually "loosening up" when in actual fact
                      it is trying very hard to tighten it up. </strong></span><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Singapore has the
                      most absurd laws on Freedom of Expression. </strong></span>In this new era of
                      multimedia, it actually restricts politicians and Singaporeans in the
                      form of media expression. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>For example, why do we have such strange
                      rules on "no animation" in political films?</strong></span> I guess the next possible
                      ruling would be political films should be all dry and high with no
                      jokes and satire expressions allowed!<br><br>The truth is, such absurd
                      rules have existed in other forms in the past and present. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>For example,
                      when the rock and roll bands are so common in the 1960s, the law on
                      political rallies during elections are banned from using songs, music
                      and any other kind of entertainment means.</strong></span> Luckily it does not ban
                      opposition politicians from speaking during rallies and force them to
                      use sign languages! <br><br>This law has its political historical
                      background. For the benefits of my younger readers, I will have to
                      dealt with some political history of Singapore here. <br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The
                      leftist movement that helped PAP in bargaining against British Colonial
                      rule has used songs and music very effectively in motivating and
                      mobilizing its supporters in big and small rallies. </strong></span></div>
              <div class="post-body entry-content"><br></div>
              <div class="post-body entry-content">The most active
                      anti-Colonial movement existed in Chinese school choir and drama
                      groups. Of course the communist elements have infiltrated into such
                      organizations but not all of them are communists. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>They are just
                      students and educated people back then trying to mobilize the Colonial
                      subjects to protest against the British Colonial administration.</strong></span></div>
              <div class="post-body entry-content"><br></div>
              <div class="post-body entry-content">Of
                      course, PAP leaders back then have ride on this wave of anti-colonial
                      movement to come into power. However, there was a break in the
                      different factions within PAP back in 196[1] when the faction that Lee
                      Kuan Yew led, decided to have a merger with Malaysia so to break away
                      from the British Colonial rule. Malaysian Malaysia was the slogan of
                      this faction. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>But the other faction resisted and break away to form the
                      Barisan Socialist party. </strong></span><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>History has proven that that the
                      Barisan Socialist faction is right about the merger with Malaysia.</strong></span> It
                      only took two years for the merger to break. This is a great moral
                      challenge against the PAP leadership back then. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>It created a serious
                      doubt on the PAP leadership's political judgment but the next thing you
                      know, Operation Cold Store was executed to round up all those
                      ex-anti-Colonial fighters whom most of them are in the Barisan
                      Socialist party. They were conveniently labeled as Communists and
                      arrested under ISA without trial. <br></strong></span><br>There may be a big grey area
                      between Communists movement and the anti-Colonial movement. All
                      Communists are against Colonial rule but not all anti-Colonial people
                      were communists. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>It was due to this blurring perception that PAP back
                      then was so successful in putting the Communist labels on almost all
                      its political dissidents. </strong></span>After Operation Cold Store, the General
                      Elections was called and naturally, with no strong dissidents left to
                      contest against PAP, PAP won a landslide victory. <br><br>It was under
                      such political background that PAP decided to eliminate the most
                      effective tool of its dissidents which anti-Colonial elements has used
                      against the British Colonial rulers, songs, music and drama.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> Right from
                      the late 1960s throughout the whole of 1970s, we have experienced more
                      than a decade of WHITE TERROR rule.</strong></span></div>
              <div class="post-body entry-content"><br></div>
              <div class="post-body entry-content">Any artistic creations of songs,
                      music, playwright, books, essays, poems and dramas etc that suggested
                      any slight anti-establishment sentiments will be termed as "communist".
                      <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>It will be banned immediately and its authors and groups of people
                      behind such creation will be asked to "limp kopi"</strong></span> (Hokkien dialect term
                      for drinking coffee) in Internal Security Department. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Many of these
                      people were locked up in ISD without trial for weeks and months, if not
                      years or decades. <br></strong></span><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>This has resulted in Singapore becoming a
                      cultural desert in contrast with its cultural vibrancy back in the
                      1950s and early 1960s where we are the Gem of Cultural revival of
                      Southeast Asia.</strong></span> We were the hot bed of artistic creativity whereby many
                      classic movies were made in Singapore <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>instead of Hong Kong before this
                      rule of White Terror came into play. </strong></span><br><br>I have gone into length
                      of this piece of Singapore's history to illustrate a simple fact of
                      PAP's monopoly of power. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>PAP could only monopolize power via its tight
                      control of the media as well as the suppression on the creativity
                      creation of the people. Freedom of Expression was curtailed at a huge
                      social and cultural cost, just for the perpetuation of PAP's monopoly
                      of power. </strong></span><br><br>This simple mindset still exists today with the
                      latest additions to its effort in trying to control on the Freedom of
                      Expression on the New Media, Internet. Of course, it has to be done in
                      the guise of "openness", so to speak. <br><br>Beside changing the
                      political film act in a bid to eliminate grey areas for other people to
                      dance around, I believe that it is a change in law so that PAP sets to
                      allow itself to use the New Media in the coming Snap General Elections.
                      <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>It has to "fight back" the overwhelming anti-PAP sentiments expressed
                      in the New Media in the form of home made videos. </strong></span></div>
              <div class="post-body entry-content"><br></div>
              <div class="post-body entry-content">Thus, it chose to
                      limit the space for its critics while pathing the legitimate way for
                      its own use of the New Media. At present, the political film act has
                      unwittingly tied up PAP's hands in using Youtube and the New Media in
                      its campaigning effort. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="font-weight: bold;">The latest
                      move IS NOT A SIGN OF OPENNESS but rather A MOVE TO UNTIE PAP's HANDS
                      WHILE MAKING MORE RESTRICTIONS FOR ITS DISSIDENTS, CRITICS AND
                      POLITICAL OPPONENTS.</span></strong></span> It is basically a ploy in laying the "FAVORABLE GROUND RULES" for PAP to enter into the New Media Battle Ground. <br><br>I
                      would not be surprised that PAP will flush the Internet sphere with all
                      sorts of political films of speeches and political messages once the
                      General Elections is being called. PAP has the resources to get
                      professional production team to do up all the films needed for this New
                      Media campaign. <br><br>I have told many of my comrades that the
                      BATTLE GROUND for the next and future General Elections will be fought
                      over the New Media. I have been preparing for eventuality of the usage
                      of the Youtube in the coming election campaign.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> If you have studied
                      PAP's political behavior well, you would notice that PAP will always
                      try to put up new rules or laws that are advantageous to them or to
                      eliminate strong opponents' participation right before they go for
                      elections. </strong></span>This will be no exception and yes, this is a BIG SIGN that
                      PAP is really preparing for a Snap General Elections. <br><br>If PAP
                      is all for OPENNESS on FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION, why would it restrict
                      people to film "illegal political activity"? It does not want people to
                      know the truth on how the police treated these political dissidents via
                      the net? This is definitely not a World Class mindset but rather, a
                      Third Class dictatorial mindset similar to the Burmese Junta's brutal
                      suppression of dissidents and the restrictions imposed on those who
                      "leaks" out the "TRUTH" of what is really happening during that period!
                      <br><br>Only a CLOSED MIND government would not want people to know the
                      TRUTH of what is happening on the ground, whether it is legal or
                      illegal political activities. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>They could ban or control the
                      conventional press and media from giving an independent account of such
                      events but they are helpless in preventing others to video taped it to
                      put them up on the net! </strong></span></div>
              <div class="post-body entry-content"><br></div>
              <div class="post-body entry-content">Thus, this new change to the present laws comes
                      about, NOT in the spirit of OPENNESS or with any respect to Freedom of
                      Expression, nor does it comes with spirit of Freedom of Information
                      flow or respect for Truth to be told. These changes are in fact a
                      blatant attempt to RESTRICT information flow as well as Freedom of
                      Expression over the Internet. <br><br>Don't be fooled by such sweet
                      sugar coating of words like "Openness", "Loosening of rules" etc etc.
                      The real poisoned beef lies in the details. <br><br>If you ask me, the
                      greatest HARM of these new changes lies in "the banning of filming
                      illegal political gatherings". Is there anything to hide from the
                      matured Singaporeans about such "illegal political gatherings"? Well,
                      to be honest, I could only see one reason behind it. It is not the
                      "legitimacy" of the political gatherings that matters. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>It is the
                      inexperienced, clumsy and sometimes hilarious way that the police
                      officers handled the situation that the administration is trying to
                      hide from the public eyes. </strong></span></div>
              <div class="post-body entry-content"><br></div>
              <div class="post-body entry-content">Of course, such filming may become evidences
                      submitted to court which may contradict police statements! (From the
                      past cases, we have seen some instances whereby police officers'
                      statements that have been contradicted by factual video evidences that
                      were submitted by the Non-Violence-Action group of people).<br><br>Having
                      said all these, I don't mean to indicate any support to the NVA
                      movement. Personally, I still believe in the parliamentary path. But I
                      would find it strange that a self proclaimed <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>First World Government
                      actually want to emulate a backward Third World Dictatorship like Burma
                      or North Korea regimes in disallowing people to report on video the
                      TRUTH of such "illegal political activities". </strong></span></div>
              <div class="post-body entry-content"><br></div>
              <div class="post-body entry-content">It would mean that
                      reporters (alas, of course I mean the foreign journalists! The local
                      media will naturally be gone missing!) would be banned from reporting
                      on such events as well! <br><br>Such little change in the law has
                      actually exposed PAP's anxiety over the negative responses ignited by
                      FACTUAL REPORTING of what actually happens on the ground; never mind
                      whether it is illegal gathering or not. <br><br>Personally, my take is
                      this. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>PAP is fighting the losing battle over the New Media.</strong></span> The more it
                      tries to control the monster, the more it exposes its own inadequacy as
                      well as anxiety over the negative impact of the New Media that has
                      brought upon it.<br><br>Well, folks, it seems that the Battle has just
                      begun. All of you have done a great job back in 2006 in defying such
                      absurd laws on political films over the New Media and I hope you will
                      continue to push the boundaries in the coming elections.</div>
