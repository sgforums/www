What i meant to say is that those flights from Amsterdam to Jakarta. They used to make a stop-over in Singapore. Now they do it in KLIA. So, Quantas can do the same for theirs if they want to make a stop-over in a SEA city before going to China. Especially if they do not feel comfortable about landing in Changi.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Simple. We should bar Qantas from flying to Singapore. They will likely retaliate by barring SIA from flying to Australia.<br><br>Who has more to lose? Of course Australia. Thousands of Singaporeans go to Australia each year, for tourism, to study etc. We are bringing lots of foreign revenue into Australia. Stop all this, and the Aussies will feel the pinch.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
