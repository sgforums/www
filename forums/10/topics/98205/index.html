Why are the utilities charges so high? Everyone knows how much money we are paying to buy water from Malaysia. Dr Mahathir has been trumpeting this ALL the time.

So donÂ’t even suggest migration, if you truly love your country.<br><br>[/b]</blockquote>I will agree with everything except the above statement . People who migrate have plenty of reasons to do so . Unless they surrender Singaporean citizenship for another country's citizenship then it means they don't care about the country at all. Did you know that if you didn't return to Singapore within 10 years - u lose your citizenship?<br><br>I migrated to Australia as a permanent resident .As far as I know , I am still a citizen of Singapore - passport still Singaporean.   Are you going to say I don't care about Singapore? I am sick of hearing from our own singaporeans that people who migrate are "quitters" just because GCT said so. Aren't those same foreign talents, whom Singapore so highly regard,  quitters of their own country as well?  Why is Singapore engaging these "unloyal people" .<br><br>My reasons are simple - I have to go where opportunities are while I am young ...if not, I will languish into the abyss of hoping for career advancements which are only given to the elite ( scholars)  . So am I suppose to stay and get shortchanged in my future in order to be called loyal?<br><br>JC students with psc scholarships are known as scholars - that is a ridiculous assumption. Scholars are what we call academic professors, people who discovered an important area of knowledge.  Not some 18 year old kid who got straight As and a wonderful ECA record - and have their future set above commoners . All I knew back then, was a psc scholar is never wrong - he/she commits the mistake because u "never train or teach her well". Masters is only reserved for people with "special leadership qualities" although ur result is better than the said scholar. This is what made me see how my future is going to be. Stay back and rot? No thanks , I prefer to get out and do something to expand my own potential  instead of whining about singapore and how bad my job is in singapore.<br><br>Australia herself have 5% of her population living overseas and I don't see her condemning her own australians.  Who knows one day , someone who migrated out as a pr of another country will do so well there and get international accolades - and then attribute their success to Singapore ....like the overseas Australians , be it scientists or actors.<br><br>Like my vietnamese classmate who migrated to australia as a pr, I asked him where his future lies. His answer was simple yet quite nationalistic : " Well I learn what knowledge Australia have to offer and I will go back to Vietnam to build her up when I have established my career ". There is another vietnamese who used her fulbright scholarship to  research landmines in her own country . So are u going to condemn all singaporeans who migrate if some have these thoughts?</div>
