            <div class='col-md body'>I can't but think this way....just look at the performance and contents, PAP party flags.....videos of LKY's and his PAP struggle...It's not a bad idea...LKY did good, it must be agreed that without him and the PAPs Singapore will have no today....but why no opposition parties and their members were invited, after all they all represent Singapore. ...I'm not saying PAP should not raise their standards or watever but I believe it can be fairer if opposition parties can display their own content, such as flags parade of all the political parties in Singapore</div>
