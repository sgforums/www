But once embarked on this course with  constant repetition you get more and more brazen in the attack. All you have  to do is to dissolve organizations and societies and banish and detain the  key  political workers in these societies. Then miraculously everything is  tranquil on the surface. Then an intimidated press and the  government-controlled radio together can regularly sing your praises, and  slowly and steadily the people are made to forget the evil things that  have already been done, or if these things are referred to again they're conveniently distorted and distorted with impunity, because there will be  no opposition to contradict."<br><br>I'm trying to confirm the veracity of the allegation made as to the person who spoke these words.

In an Assembly session, Lee proposed a motion of Â“grave concernÂ” over these actions. He deplored the purge as a careful plot hatched with the Â“colonial masters as fellow conspiratorsÂ” to Â“ensure no organized challenge at the next electionÂ”.12 He quoted positive Western news reports, insinuating that Lim had ordered the arrests to gain their favour. He warned of the danger of such powers used illegitimately against real or imagined threats:<br><br><blockquote><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Repression, Sir, is a habit that grows. I am told it is like making love - it is always easier the second time! The first time there may be pangs of conscience, a sense of guilt. But once embarked on this course, with constant repetition, you get more and more brazen in the attack and in the scope of the attack.13 </span></strong></blockquote>Reflecting that Â“repression is an easy substitute for hard work and organisationÂ”, Lee portrayed the arrests as the beginning of a systematic Labour Front campaign to eliminate rival organisations and societies and detain political opposition. Even if this succeeds, it would ultimately lead to Â“complacencyÂ” and Â“degenerationÂ”.14 Â“Indiscriminate suppressionÂ” was not the answer:<br><br><blockquote><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">I agreeÂ… that if any act is done to overthrow a government by force, that act must be suppressed. But if we say we believe in democracy, if we say that the fabric of democracy is one which allows the free play of ideas, which avoids revolution by violence because revolution by peaceful methods of persuasion is allowed, then, in the name of all the gods that we have in this country, give that free play a chance to work within the constitutional framework. 15 </span></strong></blockquote>The following month, LeeÂ’s fellow assemblyman Lim Chin Siong was detained along with hundreds of trade unionists and activists for stirring up student riots in late October. <strong><span style="color: red;">Lee moved a motion deploring the detention, done Â“without, in his view, proper justification</span></strong>Â”.16<br><br><blockquote><br><strong><span style="color: brown;">"Once a government is committed to the principle of silencing the voice of opposition, it has only one way to go, and that is down the path of increasingly repressive measures, until it becomes a source of terror to all its citizens and creates a country where everyone lives in fear." </span></strong><br><br>- Harry S Truman (1884 - 1972), August 8, 1950 </blockquote></div>
