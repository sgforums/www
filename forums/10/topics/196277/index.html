Think spanish flu . The western nations are gearing for one overdue flu pandemic and the fear was built further from the  SARS outbreak which they suspected was from some wild animal . HIV , Ebola, marburg and lassa viruses are also suspected to be initially mutated from primates. So I am not surprised that the world is so paranoid .</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The present situation is that the avian flu is already spreading from birds to other species such as cats, dogs, pigs, human, etc... It is not yet spreading from person to person yet or at least not confirmed yet. It seem that H5N1 is not as contageous as human influenza. The normal human flu is more contageous and when one sneeze, it can spread the germs to the nearby persons.<br><br>The WHO's main concern now is when H5N1 goes into body of a person who has flu, H5N1 may mutate and acquire the contageousness of the human flu and spread easily amongst human just like the normal flu. Then it's going to be like the Spainish flu where it wipe off millions of people.<br><br>The recent case of the Indonesian family of about 5 people who died of bird flu could be the first sign of avian flu spreading from human to human. Yet again, there were no confirmation. Also study shows the avain flu affects the deeper part of the lung, making it hard for the germs to get out of the infected person's lung.<br><br>Tamiflu tablet is not a remedy to avian flu. When consumed, tamiflu tablet can only contained the human flu germs from reacting with H5N1. That is why,  the health care workers are using them.<br><br>I don't think there is an immediate solution to this avian flu. All the gov can do is to quarantine the infected person to prevent spreading. Just like SARS.<br><br>BTW,  how was the Spainish flu or SARS defeated? Actually,  they were not defeated. They just disappearred by itslef. They may surface again one day.</div>

If Tamiflu can be use to treat bird flu then what is the huha about a bird flu pandemic?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Like I said,  Tamiflu can only prevent bird flu from mutating with the human flu and cause it to be contageous. So far only Tamiflu has this effect on bird flu and nothing come close to it.<br><br>Sadly, Singaporeans are not too much bothered by this because we have tis mind set that the gov will have effective measures. During the Sars outbreak, some even went around showing thier quarantine papers,  some had meals in the coffeeshops even while they were told they might have contracted SARS. Some can't even be bothered. How many ppl bother to read the AvainFlu Pandemic hand book produced by health ministry?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There were some MNCs who have a pandemic plan. The Sg Gov also has something in place.<br><br>That is, they divide their staffs into two teams. When a pandemic is declared, one team will work from home while the other runs the daily operations in the company premises. When one member of the office team contracted avain flu / SARS. The team goes into quarantine for 10 days while the 2nd team returns to the company premises to run the company's operation. Until 10 days later, those who remain unaffected, continue to work from home until the other team contracted Avain flu/SARS. The cycle continues to alternate.<br><br>Although it's not 100%, at least there is a chance to sustain the operation to tie over the period. Once the pandemic is out of control then we can only pray to GOD. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Heh....Avian flu is starting to show resistance to Tamiflu especially one strain in vietnam sooo I won't bank too much on some tablet. You can only hope relenza work . If it all fails, you pray your body will be able to take the assault .<br><br>Quarantine the infected people or kill off infected animals - try to stop a spread but I don't know frankly what Singapore might do in a pandemic . Look at the high density packed population - our dear HDB flats or condominiums- the spread of airborne or contact disease will not be a problem at all.<br><br>They are trying to develop a vaccine in USA and Australia but with a mutation as rapid as HN51 - it will be difficult. Another choice is to take blood out of survivors - draw out the antibodies in the serum and try injecting it into affected people but that won't guarantee a cure either.<br><br></div>
