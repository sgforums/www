            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Amnesty International update on Chee Soon Juan</strong><br><br>Amnesty International Canada<br>05 Sep 07<br><br>Prominent human rights defender and opposition leader Dr Chee Soon Juan has again been imprisoned. The imprisonment is the result of his attempt to<br>leave the country in April 2006 to attend a World Movement for Democracy<br>conference in Turkey.<br><br>The High Court dismissed his appeal 3 September against his conviction of attempting to leave Singapore as an undiuscharged bankrupt. Individuals who have been bankrupted are not allowed to travel abroad without official permission. His application was rejected two weeks after he was due to travel. He was fined S$4000 or three weeks in prison in default of payment. He has made some 12 applications to travel abroad to attend human rights and democracy meetings, all of which have been rejected.<br><br>He was last imprisoned for over two weeks in late 2006.<br><br>Dr Chee had been made bankrupt by the courts when he failed to pay former<br>prime ministers Lee Kuan Yew and Goh Chok Tong S$500,000 in a lawsuit they<br>had taken out against him in 2001.<br><br>Despite the loss of his university position, several terms of imprisonment,<br>bankruptcy and a ban on his contesting parliamentary election, Dr Chee<br>continues to speak out about human rights and democracy. In his most recent<br>article (28 August, www.singaporedemocrat.org), written knowing he faced<br>imprisonment, he called on Singaporeans to take action despite their fears,<br>and quoted Nelson Mandela: Courage is not the absence of fear but the<br>triumph over it. In the article, he points to punitive action taken against<br>dissidents, including peaceful anti-Iraq war protesters, Falun Gong<br>practitioners critical of the Chinese government, anti-death penalty<br>activists, Human Rights Day marchers, and the gay and lesbian community. In<br>recent months, he has tried to ensure that human rights concerns in<br>Singapore will be addressed in the October international conference of the<br>International Bar Association. He is planning an alternative conference with<br>high-level speakers prior to the IBA meeting.<br><br>Amnesty International has repeatedly expressed concern about civil<br>defamation suits, bankruptcies and criminal charges used or threatened<br>against government critics, human rights activists and foreign news media.<br>Dr Chee's sister, Chee Siok Chin, who is a prominent member of the small<br>opposition Singapore Democratic Party, was also recently made bankrupt by a<br>court - thus barring her from contesting a parliamentary seat (as she did<br>in the last election) or travelling abroad (where she has spoken at<br>high-level conferences). The Far Eastern Economic Review is the latest<br>foreign journal to be sued for defamation following its 2006 interview<br>article on Dr Chee. Laws permitting such restrictions maintain a climate of<br>political intimidation and self-censorship in Singapore. This climate<br>continues to stifle freedom of expression, deters the expression of views<br>alternative to those of the ruling People's Action Party and dissuades many<br>Singaporeans from exercising their right to take part in public affairs. The<br>Singapore government has stated that it is building an "open society".<br><br>TAKE ACTION:<br><br>Please write to Singapore's President<br><br>* Express your concern that government critics and human rights<br>defenders such as Dr Chee Soon Juan and his sister Chee Siok Chin continue<br>to be penalised for the non-violent expression of their opinions;<br><br>* Ask the President to emphasize that progress depends not only on<br>economic advancement but also on respect for fundamental international human<br>rights standards, including the right to express one's opinions;<br><br>* State that you welcome the government's promise to build an "open<br>society" and that you look forward to the fulfillment of that promise. Ask<br>what steps are being taken to ensure respect for the basic right to freedom<br>of expression.<br><br>WRITE TO:<br><br>His Excellency President S R Nathan<br>Office of the President<br>Istana, Orchard Road<br>Singapore 0922<br>Fax: +65 6735 3135<br>E-mail: S_R_Nathan@Istana.gov.sg<br>Salutation: Your Excellency<br>Please send copies to :<br><br>His Excellency Vanu Gopala Menon<br>Permanent Representative of Singapore to the United Nations and High<br>Commissioner to Canada<br>231 East 51st Street<br>New York, NY 10022, USA<br>Fax: 1 (212) 826-2964<br>Salutation: Your Excellency<br><br>Please forward any responses to: Margaret John, Coordinator for Singapore<br>and Malaysia (malaysiasingaporecoordinator@amnesty.ca)<br><br>FURTHER BACKGROUND:<br><br>AI has longstanding concerns about Singapore:<br><br>Freedom of expression is tightly controlled by the People's Action Party,<br>which has been in power over 40 years with almost no opposition MPs.<br>Political critics face ruinous defamation suits filed by leading government<br>figures and risk bankruptcy and imprisonment. AI describes this situation as<br>a "climate of fear".<br><br>AI believes that Singapore has the highest per capita rate of executions of<br>any country worldwide. Death sentences have been handed down after unfair<br>trials. For example, in drug trafficking cases, there is a presumption of<br>guilt and a mandatory death sentence.<br><br>International concern about human rights violations in Singapore is<br>mounting. The International Monetary Fund and World Bank, which met in<br>Singapore in 2006, criticised the authorities' exclusion of some of their<br>invited NGO representatives as well as the restrictions on peaceful<br>protests. In recent weeks, a visiting delegation of parliamentarians from<br>Europe and Asia protested when they were denied permission to speak at a<br>public forum. In the past few weeks, the international media have reported<br>criticism of large salary increases for the government while t he gap<br>between rich and poor is increasing. The Prime Minister's salary at over S$3<br>million (equivalent to the Canadian dollar) will be five times that of US<br>President Bush.<br><br>Dr. Chee is recognised internationally as a courageous human rights<br>defender. He received the prestigious Defender of Democracy Award by<br>Parliamentarians for Global Action in 2003 (Nelson Mandela is also a past<br>recipient). He states that imprisonment does not deter him and that he will<br>continue Â– referring to Martin Luther King and Mahatma Gandhi Â– his<br>non-violent efforts to bring human rights and democracy to Singapore,<br>regardless of the consequences to himself. It was a message he repeated when he visited Canada in 2003.<br><br><a href="http://singaporedemocrat.org/articlecheeWMDistanbul20.html" rel="nofollow">http://singaporedemocrat.org/articlecheeWMDistanbul20.html</a></div>

(Don't laugh at how they mangle the terminology)<br><br>These ''non-resident'' are those who are here on medium-term passes of a few years' duration. They include company executives based here, professors on contract, the families, students from abroad, and vast numbers of low-skilled workers and domestic maids.<br><br>3.6085 million are ''ingapore residents'' This term is used to mean 2 categories Citizens and Permanent Residents (PR) together.<br><br>The Statstics Departments no longer publishes data pertaining to citizens alone. If I recall correctly, they used to, as recently as 2 or 3 years ago.<br><br>But our curiosity insists on asking, what percentage of ''residents'' were citizens as at June 2006? The Department of Statistics website was no help at all, so I had to attempt an estimate by comparing data from the Elections Department with the demographic data in the the Statistics Department website.<br><br>The Elections Department said there were 2.1587 million voters for the May 2006 general election. To be eligible to vote in Singapore, one has to be at least 21 years old. The Stats Department said there were 2.6605 million "residents" who were 20 years old and above.<br><br>Thus, about 19% of adult ''residents'' were not eligible to vote; I would assume that the main reason would be because there were not citizens. Hence, by extension, we can estimate that about 19% of all ''residents'' reported in the Statistics Department website were PRs. This in turn translates to 15.2% of all inhabitants in Singapore.<br><br>Thus, this gives a breakdown of the 4.484 million inhabitants of Singapore: 65.3% citizens, 15.2% PRs, 19.5% ''non-residents''.<br><br>However, the Straits Times on 24 Feb 2007 gave slightly different percentage (but for 2005). See next box below.<br><br><strong>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</strong><br><br><strong>Historical data from the Straits Times' article of 24 Feb 2007</strong>.<br><br>1960: Singapore had 1.6 million inhabitants, of which 73% were born in Singapore and Malaysia and 27% born elsewhere.<br><br>1970: Singapore had 2.07 million inhabitants. 90.4% citizens, 6.7% PRs and 2.9% "non-residents''.<br><br>1990: Singapore had 3.05 million inhabitants. 86% citizens, 3.6% PRs and 10.3% "non-residents''<br><br>2005: Singapore had 4.3 million inhabitants. 71.5% citizens, 10.1% PRs and 18.3% "non-residents''.<br><br>The newspaper cited the Department of Statistics for the the number of inhabitants and the 2005 percentage breakdowns. For the percentage breakdowns of other years. it cited Migration and Social Diversity by Prof Brenda Yeoh, National University of Singapore, Department of Geography.<br></blockquote></div>
