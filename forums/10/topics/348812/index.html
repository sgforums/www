              <div id="columnist" dir="ltr">
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><img src="http://www.yoursdp.org/images/stories/Buildings/singport.jpg" border="1" alt="" width="185" align="right"><em>David Greising <br>Chicago Tribune<br></em><br>On
                      a typical day, more than 500 ships sail in or out of the harbor here,
                      an armada of mercantilism that makes Singapore one of the busiest ports
                      in the world.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">These days, though, Singapore stands at the terminus 	of a commerce parking lot. <br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Hundreds
                      of ships idle at anchor within sight of this city-state</strong></span>, giving the
                      Strait of Malacca the look of Burnham Harbor on the 4th of July. Except
                      the vessels in the water have the length and girth of a mid-rise office
                      building, and the people on board are not having fun.<br><br>"Look at
                      the number of ships anchored out there," exclaimed David Lum, chief
                      executive of Chicago-based Aon Corp.'s South Asia business, waving an
                      arm toward the still life on the waters visible through both corner
                      windows of his 32nd-floor office. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>"They're all anchored there with a
                      skeleton crew, waiting for some cargo to load. But there isn't any."<br></strong></span><br>Singapore
                      harbor sums up how the global economic crisis has reached around the
                      globe. Starting with the housing and financial crises in the U.S., it
                      quickly leached into Europe's financial markets, then spread to China
                      when Americans stopped buying furniture, electronics and cars. Now that
                      China's growth engine has ground to a halt, the supply-chain economics
                      of Southeast Asia are sputtering toward a stopping point too.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>That's
                      why maritime Singapore is at a standstill</strong></span>, one that affects the local
                      economy and revenue at Aon, the insurance giant with headquarters off
                      Michigan Avenue.<br><br>Aon's revenue from Southeast Asia has declined
                      sharply as ships that hired out a year ago for around $60,000 a day now
                      have a hard time fetching $8,000 a day, and far fewer are leaving port.
                      <br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>"Shipping values have collapsed completely," said Lum.</strong></span> And so
                      has revenue from the shipping insurance Aon sells from its Singapore
                      office.<br><br>Before the economic crisis hit, there was some talk that
                      the Asian economy had "decoupled" from the old days of U.S.-dominated
                      global economics. China's growth was so powerful a force, the argument
                      went, that a China-centered Asian economy was growing, and thriving,
                      almost independent of the U.S. <br><br>Few people talk that way 	anymore.<br><br>Chia
                      Siow Yue, senior researcher at the Singapore Institute of International
                      Affairs, used to see some logic to the argument for a decoupled global
                      economy. <br><br>"Now we know that Asia has not decoupled, and that is
                      the problem," she told a group of journalists touring Southeast Asia in
                      a program sponsored by the East-West Center of Hawaii.<br><br>Evidence of the close 	coupling abounds in Asia. <br><br>The
                      Chinese economy, which grew at double-digit rates in recent years, is
                      expected to slow to an 8 percent pace this year, a dizzying slowdown
                      that prompted Chinese officials this week to criticize the "Buy
                      American" policies in the U.S. economic stimulus package. Japan's heavy
                      reliance on U.S. exports was at the heart of its weakest economic
                      report in 35 years.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br><br>Tiny Singapore has seen multiple signs of
                      trouble, not surprising, perhaps, for the world's most trade-intensive
                      economy at the time of a global economic breakdown.</strong></span><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br>The key
                      electronics sector is staggering, with the electronics purchasing
                      managers index hitting a record low in December. Singapore Airlines, a
                      major carrier to Chicago and other U.S. cities, announced it is cutting
                      11 percent of its fleet and will cut staff. Singapore's economy is
                      expected to shrink some 2.4 percent this year, which would be the worst
                      performance since after the dot-com bust in 2000. Rents in Singapore's
                      densely populated office market are expected to drop by half this year.</strong></span> <br><br>The fully coupled economy may be a problem for now, but it has
                      the potential to be an asset to the Asian economic zone if the U.S.
                      leads the world back from recession a year or so from now, as many
                      economists expect. <br><br>When that happens, Aon's Lum may be among
                      the first to notice. The evidence of a comeback will move right before
                      his eyes, just outside his office window.<br><br><a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/columnists/chi-fri-greising-feb20,0,6955296.column"><em>http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/columnists/...</em></a></p>
