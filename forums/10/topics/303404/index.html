            <div class='col-md body'>It would be rubbish if we are too demanding and talking nonsense in our feedbacks in the only media available to the people to do so today - the internet forum like this one.<br><br>Let us review whether we have a government which has been doing well succeeding in its various objectives as announced over the years.<br><br>For many years our government has been promoting meritocracy and education and creating a value-adding economy.<br><br>Just stay objective and concentrate in evaluating whether our so-called talented and world's best government has been pursuing these three objectives with success consistently over these years.<br><br>Well, Meritocracy has served well up to a point where ordinary citizens are able to secure their jobs based on merits from their education etc. Apart from that limited aspect of meritocracy what have we achieved at a higher level.<br><br>To the citizens it is obvious that meritocracy has been used mainly as a political tool to build up a system of elites or mandarin to enable the government to practise tyranny and autocracy to serve its own objectives.<br><br>Meritocracy has degenerated into a system to serve the ruling politicians own political control to stay in power and nothing more.<br><br>As for education, initially it has achieved literacy allowing citizens to gain jobs which upgraded their livelihood. However as years go by, it is increasingly obvious that it has been blindly pursued as paper chase for recognition and pride and nothing much. During the last three deep recessions, many of our highly educated graduates were unable to get jobs befitting their education investments.<br><br>Many Scholar ministers despite their high academic attainment have not been able to help us to upgrade the economy or solve our many problems like rising costs and dropping wages.<br><br>Our own domestic sector of the economy remained very weak and vulnerable. There is no major breakthrough to a value-adding economy except for property play and IR. People are waiting and waiting for one of our many scholar ministers to quickly take actions to bring about the promised value-add economy producing major world-beating products like Samsung or Nokia to give us better jobs.<br><br>So in the initial years we have scored some limited success. After 1970s, we saw failures in our major government constantly promoting themselves, clinging on to power and their own talents appear to be only in increasing taxes, and making obscene profits from people's assets of lands and infrastructures with double and triple charging of all kinds of fees and taxes,<br><br>Such a system of government is not truly talented or leadership and is far from the world's best. Passing laws to give themselves the power to take and add nothing of values to the economy is not a true success we can be proud of.<br><br>It is time our scholar ministers and MPs think long and hard again their meaning of leadership and success if they want to keep talking about their talents and success.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just look at the latest accident of a worker falling to death in IR site.<br><br>The two ministries responsible are MND, (in charge of BCA) and MOM (in charge of work site safety) should carry out an joint inquiry into any accident which occur at our work sites.<br><br>There should be no more excuses today for any structural collapses as legislated in the Building Control Act and Factory Act especially when ministers claimed to be world's best after the Hotel New World Collapse (and later Nicol Highway collapse) where minister has openly admitted problems within BCD and promised not to let the same negligence happen again and to take fullest actions with no stone unturned to solve such problems.<br><br>If they need to make excuses like trying to penalize the contractors and not their own over-paid BCA officers or permanent secretaries and keep hiding behind MM Lee for protection then I doubt they are the true talents as MM Lee has always tried to make them out to be.</div>
