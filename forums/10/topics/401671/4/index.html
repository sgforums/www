              <p>It was reported in Lianhe Zhaobao today, when Jet Li was asked about his choice to become Singaporean, he said this "I have lived in the US for many years, China for many years, I wanted a place where I can let my two daughters receive education in both english and chinese, a place where I can go out working without worry about their safety, æ‰¾æ�¥æ‰¾åŽ»ï¼ŒI found Singapore."</p>
              <p>I believe the same thought went through the minds of many chinese, from PRC, Taiwan, HK and the asean countries, who chose to settle in Singapore.</p>
              <p>I believe the immigrants from the tamil speaking part of india also find singapore a more familiar place to settle in. The hindi speaking ones would want to settle in america, the singh want to settle in canada,....</p>
              <p>Finding a place to settle, to bring up families take more than just a high salary. May be that is why many singaporean who are overseas have not given up their singaporean citizenship. Things could be very different when its time to raise children.</p>
              <p>of course, when their children grown up, they will learn to kpkb like singaporean, and then think of migrating.</p>

              <p>never heard of the saying "somebody's meat is another's poison"?</p>
              <p>may be to you money is everything, to me I pay a price for the money I make. If I have to sacrifice my time for my family or if I work so hard and spoil my health for a few dollars more, then that few dollars is bad for me. to you every cent is good.</p>
              <p>What is the best health care? I am young and healthy, if i take as much health supplement as some old folks, that is bad for me.</p>
              <p>What do you need in life? how much money you need to live a comfortable life. bear in mind, in singapore, like everywhere else, there is big income gap, but that doesn't mean the poor are not happy or the rich are always happy. </p>
