              <p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="size-medium wp-image-23884 alignleft" style="margin: 10px; float: left; border: black 3px solid;" title="graduate" src="http://theonlinecitizen.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/graduate-300x172.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="172">Hi Gilbert,</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">I am glad that I have chanced upon this website. Truly, I have some frightening tales to share with regard to the current employment condition in our country.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Let me share abit about myself first.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Armed with a local degree (even though without a fantastic grade), I thought that my qualifications would lead me to a decent job in Singapore. Unfortunately, I graduated during  the last economic recession and job opportunities were scarce.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Eventually, after  job searching for a while,  I  settled for a contract job and some tutoring to tide over a lean period. I was disappointed to say the least and was brought down to earth literally.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Now the contract job is over and the job search is on again. There is this feeling of insecurity and depression resurfacing all over again.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">I thought everything would be pretty fine – at least I have some work experience to count on  but what paints reality is that  several months may pass before I can get a full time job.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">I tried many ways and sent out quite a high number of application letters, but nothing comes to a fruition………… I became secretly depressed as I  understand that my parents are retired and they may wonder why this daughter of theirs’ is so useless.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Some of my peers are no better than me.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Many of them settled  for jobs they don’t even like because they have to satisfy parental obligations. Some of my foreign friends gave up and decided to return to their homeland. Others continue on their contract job as a means of continuation and survival.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">My years in school also supported the fact  that the fittest and elitist will survive  in our country and I am at the bottom of this pool.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">It looked like my future is bleak since I have no solid good grades, no proper working experience , no money and nothing. What am I supposed to do now?</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Regards<br><span style="font-weight: normal;"><strong>Sally (name changed)</strong></span></strong></p>
              <p>*****************************************************************</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em>Dear Sally,</em></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em>Thanks for you mail.</em></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em>Frankly your story is not uncommon – the feeling that there is not much hope for the newly graduated.</em></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em>Globalisation and some unbelievable government policies have deterred quite alot of people from gaining meaningful employment.</em></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em>Count yourself fortunate that you have found some temporary job just to survive. Many people I know could not even find a contract job after many months of job searching.</em></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em>Its the same  survival story  for many people out there these days.</em></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em>Many work for a short contract and they are off work for a while before rejoining the job market for another shorter contract. There is this feeling of insecurity and lack of financial independence.</em></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em>It will be good for you to network more as nowdays jobs are difficult to come by and knowing the right people helps.</em></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em>Go out and meet people, arrange drinks with them and attend social events to widen your circle of friends.</em></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em>The saying “Its not what you know but who you know” rings very true nowadays.</em></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em>Jobs come about by word of mouth and many people have told me that they found jobs not from the papers but from their friends.</em></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em>You can apply for hundreds or  even thousands of jobs but all you get is total silence or if you are fortunate – a nice rejection letter.</em></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em>Meanwhile, as you work, move around and source out for new opportunities.  Don’t just stay at home after work, join clubs and get to know more people.</em></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em>The job market now is like a survival jungle out there. Stay lean and strong.</em></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em>Try to raise your adversity quotient by taking on new challenges such as running a marathon  or mountain climbing.</em></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em>By doing that, it will actually help you to face up to much adversity in life and prepared you for the challenges of job searching and unemployment.</em></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em>Lastly, can I ask for your permission to post this mail on my site?</em></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em>I also need to know the kind of degree you have and a rough indication of your age group if you may. Please revert if possible on this.</em></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em>Thanks and never give up. We are here for you.</em></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>Regards<br><span style="font-weight: normal;"><em><span style="font-weight: normal;"><em>Gilbert</em></span></em></span></strong></em></p>

              TS, your problem is not unique just to you but thousands of others as well.
              
              It is during times like these that you have to adjust your expectations and adapt to the circumstances. if you think it's any easier getting a job in other countries, then you should think again. If you insist that jobs are easier to come by in other countries, an air ticket doesn't cost very much these days, does it?
              
              In hard times like these, it's your survival instincts that have to come to the forefront - when life gives you lemons, make lemonade.....! Good luck!

              <p>grads earnin $8k/mth after age 35???that is a myth.most engineers after graduating and 40 years old cant even get a$3k/mth engineer post....unless u go setup yer own company.</p>
              <p>i hate to break it to u but what u read or heard is rubbish from the times where degree holders in spore were hard to come by in the 1960's.</p>
              <p>if spore had salary which gave degree hiolder engineers $8k/mth then why would there be superintendents from shipyards immigrating to australia to start life anew??!!!it simply tells u the jobs in spore may be as good as working for food and shelter...no savings or not much savings.</p>

              <p>the sad reality in singapore if you are professional looking for jobs.</p>

              <p>actually what the graduate is fighting now is based on 4 fronts</p>
              <p>1st front- people of older age than her and also more experiance than her, especially those that have no jobs atm</p>
              <p>2nd front-people who are from the same batch as her, new grads , this area is sub divided into 2 areas, 1 is willing to take lower pay and do anything just to get the job, the other is smooth talker,able to talk their way into getting the job.</p>
              <p>3rd front- froiegn  workers also have a stiff competition here, as i have put it, they are willing to take lower payment just to undercut competition, both to their own kind and to the locals here</p>
              <p>4th front- if the time of jobless grow longer, the TS also have to fight with additional graduates from those who are graduate later than her. e.g if she graduate in 2010, remains unemployed till 2012, then she have to fight all the 3 plus the graduates from 2011 and maybe 2012 depending on the month of that year.</p>

              <p><br>whatever, what i meant was, the lower educated peoples are going thru their hard life here as simple as possible, and within, they hv to endure and tolerate the high cost, inflation and being more or less casted one side, but then, they still strive thru life, build family and carry on with what they are doing...as a graduate, i should see a better person who are much able to take the hardknock of lifes than a layman, he/she who attained high education level should be able to think better and well organise in life. But i find graduate today are the complaining lots, little bit of problem only, start to whine and curse on life, which in the first place, had treated them well.</p>

              <p>People here have a very wrong concept of studying, to singaporeans, studying is to get good salary, good jobs and high post. And that is very wrong. In taiwan and also in many other countries, this is secondary, the primary objectives of studying is to gain knowledge of the know how and why and also to civlise/discipline oneself as a scholar, which is benefical to the society at large.</p>
              <p>the notion is, i studied because i want to be a better person, more knowledgeable and more understanding, not simply just for paid and jobs ya.</p>
              <p>Structural unemployment is a term use to say that there are jobs, but peoples are not skill enough to work on it. Not because you are a graduate with knowledge and skill and still cannot get job, it is infact, in a way good that graduates today have to compete for jobs, and once you need to compete, you dun become complacent but instead fight for your bread and butter. There are graduates who are successful in life, there are some end up selling phone cards, it doesn't mean if you are a graduate, you will be successful , you need to work on it, take failure as a way to success and if you need to compete in a global market, so be it, show your strength and power. No boss are blind and certainly no one owe you a living ya</p>
