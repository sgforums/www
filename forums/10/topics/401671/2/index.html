              <p>i hate to break it to u but what u read or heard is rubbish from
              the times where degree holders in spore were hard to come by in
              the 1960's.</p>
              <p>if spore had salary which gave degree hiolder engineers $8k/mth
              then why would there be superintendents from shipyards immigrating
              to australia to start life anew??!!!it simply tells u the jobs in
              spore may be as good as working for food and shelter...no savings
              or not much savings.</p>

              <p>True, there will be some fresh grads who make $3-4K upon graduation (as featured in the media sometimes) and there will be some 35 year olds making $8K a month (lawyers, bankers, consultants, doctors etc) but they are definitely in the very small minority.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My take is the average salary for a fresh grad is around $2-2.5K and a 35 year old grad should be around $4 to 4.5K.</p>

              <p>TEMASEK REVIEW</p>
              <p>Despite rising unhappiness among Singaporeans over the PAP’s liberal immigration policies, PAP leaders are adamant that immigration is essential to Singapore.</p>
              <p>Speaking during a seminar at NUS, the Minister for Community, Youth and Sports (MCYS) Dr Vivian Balakrishnan stressed that Singapore must stay “open” to newcomers and help them “integrate” into society in order for Singapore to thrive in the future.</p>
              <p>In other developed countries like Australia, Canada and New Zealand, the onus lies on the immigrants to integrate themselves. It appears to be the other way round.</p>
              <p>Not only is the PAP splurging millions of dollars to roll out the red carpet for the immigrants, Singaporeans are exhorted repeatedly to accept and embrace them.</p>
              <p>Last year October, MCYS unveiled a mega $10-million dollar Community Integration Funds to make the newcomers feel welcomed and happy in Singapore.</p>
              <p>While MCYS has been most generous towards the immigrants, Dr Vivian said during the same speech that the state “cannot take over the role of providing support” to Singapore families.</p>
              <p>The PAP has always eschewed welfare and expects Singaporeans to be “self-reliant” even as it continues to import more and more foreigners to compete with them while demanding that they remain “cheaper, better and faster” at the same time.</p>
              <p>MCYS has a Public Assistance scheme which provides a paltry $330 monthly to destitute Singaporeans and those certified permanently unfit to work.</p>
              <p>During a parliamentary debate to raise the amount of allowance given to PA holders, Dr Vivian Balakrishnan rebuked fellow PAP MP Dr Lily Neo in a now immortalized quote:</p>
              <p><strong>“How much do you want? Do you want three meals in a hawker centre, food court or restaurant?”</strong></p>

              <p class="art-PostHeader">TEMASEK REVIEW</p>
              <p>According to the 2009 Redundancy and Re-employment report released by MOM’s Research and Statistics Department, Professionals, Managers, Executives &amp; Technicians (PMETs) saw the largest increase in the number of workers made redundant from 6,200 in 2008 to 9,570 in 2009.</p>
              <p>This represent an increase of 3,570 workers in absolute numbers or a rise from 37 to 41 percent.</p>
              <p>Production &amp; related workers saw 11,330 or 48% made redundant, while clerical, sales &amp; service workers saw 2,530 or 11% laid off.</p>
              <p>The same report also found that re-employment had improved after hitting a low in the middle of the year, though re-employment for the year was still lower than in 2008.</p>
              <p>The reasons for the high percentage of PMETs being laid off were not revealed, it is likely due to the easy availability of foreign workers in the Singapore labor market.</p>
              <p>In other countries like Australia and New Zealand, there are strict labor laws in place governing the hiring of foreigners who can only be employed in sectors where there is an acute shortage of local workers.</p>
              <p>In Singapore, foreigners are allowed to compete directly with Singaporeans for jobs which can otherwise be taken up by them such as the PMETs.</p>
              <p>There is a scheme called the EPEC which allows foreign graduates from approved universities overseas to stay in Singapore up to a year to look for a job.</p>
              <p>More shockingly, English is not a basic requirement for foreigners seeking jobs in Singapore unlike in other English-speaking nations which require them to pass a basic English proficiency test like IELTS.</p>
              <p>Contact Singapore, a government agency even sent its officials to Taiwan lately to recruit a few thousand Taiwanese PMETs to work in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Despite rising disgruntlement on the ground, the PAP continues to insist that foreigners are “essential” to Singapore.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans are repeatedly exhorted by PAP leaders to compete with foreigners as the government cannot “shield” them from global competition.</p>

              <p>God. Stop complaining. If you're not getting hired it's all of a sudden the governments fault?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Have you maybe thought that you should have done better at school? Maybe gotten into the honour roll, or at least high honours?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And how is it foreigner's fault? That they're better than you were and so were offered jobs? Live with it. Singaporeans have a great advantage being that they actually live here. Foreigners have to adjust. The only ones that are able to work here deserve it. Most of them were scouted by the companies that hired them anyway.</p>

              <p><br>1) TS is pessimistic towards landing a decent job after graduating from a local uni with mediocre grades and you're saying meybe she should have gotten into the honour roll? God how dumb can you be.... what about the rest of the population that could not even get into a local uni? Never thought so deep into it? Then stop regurgitating crap.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2) How is it the foreigners fault? Well for a start competition for decent jobs is already stressful in small small Singapore and what do we have here? Foreigners.... why.... are wages so good that there is enough to share around with? I think not if local uni grads with mediocre grades are pessimistic.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3) "That they're better than you were and so were offered jobs? Live with it"</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What are you implying? That the government does not care for the welfare of Singaporeans? ... Oh Singaporeans aren't as good as foreigners so lets get them into Singapore and give them jobs, Singaporeans can live with it since they aint good enough.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hello ... who voted them in if not Singaporeans? Why are Singaporeans lazy? Or they not as cheap as China? Are we trying to compete with China in terms of cost of labour and then aspire to be the SEA Switzerland?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4)  God. Stop complaining. If you're not getting hired it's all of a sudden the governments fault?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Who opened the floodgates to allow more of them in? All of a sudden.... no its not all of a sudden... read pt 5)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>5) If you don't like the PAP so much. Why do you keep voting for them?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Because you dumb arse voted them....again ... and again... and again.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>6) Anyway I don't think the PAP is that bad... but whatever reasons they aint telling... at least they have reduced importing foreign talents. But whatever it is, you'll just follow won't you Caliburn.</p>
              <p>Stop complaining and just do it lol.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Why do foreigners say Singaporeans are given a red book by the government at birth.... got a question? refer to the red book. Got a mind of your own? Then stop taking news at facevalue and learn to regurgitate the shit into something meaningful and stop being an android.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Stormtrooper much Caliburn?  ....eat shit Caliburn... good it does you.... the force commands it.</p>

              <p>Well, this is the downside of the purely meritocratic system.</p>
              <p>Today's papers: unemployment is going down. The MNC I working in is furiously hiring,</p>
              <p>But one thing, I noticed all the new engineers coming in aren't Singaporeans. All.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>That said, I also noticed the trend that more and more Singaporeans are not taking up the degree of engineering. Not only that, there are those armed with engineering degree who decided to be on the path of bankers. Eventually, this country's local engineers might dwindle even more.</p>
