              <p>I believe the immigrants from the tamil speaking part of india also find singapore a more familiar place to settle in. The hindi speaking ones would want to settle in america, the singh want to settle in canada,....</p>
              <p>Finding a place to settle, to bring up families take more than just a high salary. May be that is why many singaporean who are overseas have not given up their singaporean citizenship. Things could be very different when its time to raise children.</p>
              <p>of course, when their children grown up, they will learn to kpkb like singaporean, and then think of migrating.</p>

              <p>you are absolutely right, many people see only the superficial things they see in the US, and compare the worse you get in Singapore. This remark is interesting "Its almost a full time job to be part of School activities for parents". I guess the situation is very different in that most singaporean parents are so full time in their job, there is little time for their children's family activities, where got time to for school activities.  </p>
              <p>Unless you bring up your children in the US, you will only know about the system from hear say. What really matters is your action, where do you bring up your children? Jet Li LIVED in the US for many years,  he speaks american, he was not confined to china town anywhere, and in the end, he chose Singapore. His action speaks louder than many words.</p>
              <p>again, you are absolutely right about the education system in Singapore, the young people are the products  moulded more by the school system and society, with little trace of their family and culture. Every damn thing not happy also complain about the system, the government, the society......</p>

              <p>I don't know Jet Li, not even his fan, especially when he went to hollywood. How well you know Jet Li to make such remark on how he runs his family? Looking from outside, his family is normal, with wife and children. Will he be another Tiger Woods we don't know. He is rich, and rich and normal family can have nanny and maids, there is nothing wrong with that.</p>
              <p>from the advertisement it appears that singaporeans really want what the rich brits used to have, a butler or chamberlaine, you call that evolution?</p>

              <p>so you think they will leave singapore after their children education? isn't it the same like many local born singaporean who have left singapore after they complete their education, I have better faith in jet li's children that they don't go to the net and complain and complain, like some singaporean. I hope Jet Li's family education to their children is better than many people here. I can be wrong, but I wont' want to pass the judgement too soon.</p>
