            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Australian pilot gives thumbs down to US bombing order </strong><br><br>24.03.2003<br>By GREG ANSLEY Australia correspondent<br>CANBERRA - An Australian FA/18 Hornet pilot has refused an American command to bomb a target in Iraq in the first conflict between the different rules governing the way the two allies make war.<br><br>Although Prime Minister John Howard said the incident during the coalition's drive towards Baghdad was not evidence of tension between the two commands, the prospect of a clash of rules was clear from the start.<br><br>Australia operates under a tougher set of rules of engagement than the US because Canberra has ratified more international agreements than Washington.<br><br>The refusal of the RAAF pilot to release his precision-guided bombs came as:<br><br>pf* Australian Navy boarding parties captured three Iraqi dhows loaded with 86 mines and a "wide array of military weapons" as their crews tried to slip through the coalition blockade to seed the top of the Gulf with sophisticated Manta acoustic and other floating mines.<br><br>pf* SAS soldiers, after a number of firefights over the weekend, called down an air strike on an Iraqi command and control base suspected of being involved in the launching of ballistic missiles.<br><br>pf* At home, tens of thousands of demonstrators rallied against the war, despite a poll showing opposition to Australian involvement had significantly weakened since the conflict started, with opinion now almost evenly divided.<br><br>The decision of the RAAF pilot not to attack an Iraqi target was taken when his Hornet, armed with a range of strike weapons, was ordered away from the round-the-clock escort missions the Australians have been flying since war started.<br><br>"However, the crew chose not to complete the mission because they could not positively identify the target," Defence Force spokesman Brigadier Mike Hannan said.<br><br>"The crew's decision reflects the ADF's strong commitment to the laws of armed conflict and its support of the Government's targeting policy, right down to the lowest levels."<br><br>The rules under which Australians are fighting in Iraq are governed by Australian and international law, the 1949 Geneva Convention, and additional 1977 protocols that the US has not signed.<br><br>A range of weapons in the American arsenal - such as landmines and cluster bombs - are banned by Australia, and Canberra has emphasised that its forces will refuse to attack civilian targets, including key bridges, dams and other vital infrastructure of the kind bombed by the US in the 1991 Gulf War.<br><br>Australia has also emphasised that its troops remain strictly under national command, but Brigadier Hannan said the final choice of whether or not to attack was a decision made by "ordinary young Australians, often in a split second, that they will have to live with for the rest of their lives".<br><br>"The rules are all well and good, and they are important and necessary, but they are not of themselves sufficient to ensure that the laws of armed conflict are upheld and targeting policy is implemented."<br><br>He said such decisions were made by young pilots flying at very high speed, often at night.<br><br>"In this case the pilot ... decided that the information didn't support the justification for the use of the weapon and aborted the mission."<br><br>Herald Feature: Iraq<br><br><a href="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/storydisplay.cfm?storyID=3251554&amp;thesection=news&amp;thesubsection=world" rel="nofollow">http://www.nzherald.co.nz/storydisplay.cfm?storyID=3251554&amp;thesection=news&amp;thesubsection=world</a></div>

Iraq actually made this switch in Nov. 2000 (when the euro was worth around 80 cents), and has actually made off like a bandit considering the dollar's steady depreciation against the euro ..."<br><br>The steady depreciation of the dollar versus the euro since late 2001 means that Iraq has profited handsomely from the switch in their reserve and transaction currencies.<br><br>The euro has gained roughly 17 per cent against the dollar in that time, which also applies to the $10 billion in Iraq's UN "oil for food" reserve fund that was previously held in dollars has also gained that same percent value since the switch.<br><br>What would happen if OPEC made a sudden switch to euros, as opposed to a gradual transition?<br><br>"the effect of an OPEC switch to the euro would be that oil-consuming nations would have to flush dollars out of their (central bank) reserve funds and replace these with euros.<br><br>"The dollar would crash anywhere from 20-40% in value and the consequences would be those one could expect from any currency collapse and massive inflation (think Argentina currency crisis, for example).<br><br>"You'd have foreign funds stream out of the US stock markets and dollar denominated assets, there'd surely be a run on the banks much like the 1930s, the current account deficit would become unserviceable, the budget deficit would go into default, and so on.

He says the grenade went off near him and near a staff sergeant with whom Muhammad had fought earlier that day. The Army's Criminal Investigation Division, Berentson says, concluded Muhammad (then named Williams) was the lead suspect.<br><br>Muhammad was led away in handcuffs and eventually transferred to another company pending charges. He had been court-martialed twice before for lesser incidents while serving in the Louisiana National Guard. But an indictment over the grenade incident never materialized, and Muhammad's Army file has no record of it.<br><br>John Allen Muhammad, in case you've forgotten, is the elder of the two Washington sniper suspects.

The strong resistance that Iraqi troops showed, Iraqi ABM systems and anti-tank facilities turned out to be an unexpected surprise for Americans.<br><br>As the American administration believed, the war turned out to be difficult on account of the fact that the Russian defense industry delivered anti-tank missiles to Iraq via third countries. As it was said, the Russian defense industry also supplied Iraq with night vision devices, and unique Kolchuga anti-missile systems. The US administration determined that Russia delivered those weapons to Iraq several days before the war was launched. The official note of protest on the part of the US Department of State was based on those illegal deliveries. The note of protest was handed over to the Russian ambassador to the USA, Yury Ushakov.<br><br>The Russian government did not ignore USAÂ’s threats (in the form of certain statements) to punish Russia for arms deliveries. The Russian leadership realizes that the war menace is approaching the country. According to the information from competent military sources, the navy command finished checking the alertness of anti-submarine facilities of naval troops in Kamchatka. Military exercises were conducted in admiralsÂ’ presence. Diesel submarines of the Russian navy performed basic military exercises at sea. The order for battleships to travel to the Indian Ocean and to the Persian Gulf was called off.<br><br>Military units of the Russian Far East get ready for possible border conflicts. It seems that the Supreme Commander-in-Chief of Russia, President Vladimir Putin, realizes the anti-Russian essence of AmericaÂ’s aggressive aspiration. Putin takes measures to strengthen the alertness of Russian troops at the border territory. The Russian army and navy command held a secret session in Moscow yesterday, at which military high-ranking officials considered possible variants for the Mideast situation to develop. American spy planes have been conducting aerial reconnaissance at RussiaÂ’s borders for several days already.<br><br>Colonel-General Valery Manilov, a member of the Federation Council from the Primorye region, said in his interview to Echo of Moscow radio station: Â“The decision to start the war on Iraq is a big mistake that the United States made. America gave an incentive for the rest of the world to unite in the anti-American coalition. It is obvious from the diplomatic point of view that no country in the whole world will wish to live and watch Americans using the military force whenever they want and like it to use. The world community will have to consolidate its military, political, economic, technical resources in order not to allow that to happen. The process is under way already. This is a unique moment, for it never happened before, not even during the USAÂ’s bombing of Yugoslavia. The world will have to unite and find a format to restrain America, the country, which opposed itself to the whole world.Â”<br><br>On the other hand, the beginning of the war is a drama for the USA itself. This is likely to provoke the collapse of the antiterrorist coalition, terrorist activities in the USA and in Great Britain might increase, arms race is likely to speed up, including the weapons of mass destruction race. Ecological catastrophes are likely to happen in the world as well. Before opposing the whole world, the United States and Great Britain made desperate steps to strengthen their activities for winning UN Security Council members and the world community over to their side. This means that George W. Bush, Donald Rumsfeld, Colin Powell, Condoleezza Rice did their best not to let the USA have an aggressive image for the world community. The American administration suffered a diplomatic failure. Cheap and high-quality Iraqi oil is the prime goal of the game. Americans hope that the oil will allow them to settle their economic and financial issues. However, the price of that oil will be unacceptable for the USA. AmericaÂ’s image as a safe, stable and powerful country has been ruined. At present moment, the world perceives the USA as a country that is ready to disregard the opinion of the world for the sake of its own interests only. A large number of victims is not an issue at all.<br><br>Thousands of lives will have to be wasted for such hypothetical takeover of the Iraqi oil. Those lives will be the lives of American people too. As they say, if you sow wind you will rip a storm. The inferiority complex might also be a reason why the war began. This complex has been tormenting President Bush and his team Â– the people, who did not get to overthrow Saddam in 1991. Those people try to get rid of their complexes, including the September 11th complex, with the help of the military force. The inevitable failure of the incumbent American administration will be the result of that. You can conquer with bayonets, but you canÂ’t sit on them.<br><br>Vasily Buslayev<br>Daily News<br>Vladivostok<br><br>PRAVDA.Ru<br><br><a href="http://english.pravda.ru/war/2003/03/24/44928.html" rel="nofollow">http://english.pravda.ru/war/2003/03/24/44928.html</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Urban Warfare Promises Peril </strong><br>Associated Press<br>March 25, 2003<br><br>WASHINGTON - War strategists liken urban combat to knife fights in a phone booth. Allied forces are getting a taste of it in small Iraqi cities, trying to avoid it in a larger one and face an almost certain round of it in the biggest prize of all, Baghdad.<br><br>Unless Iraq capitulates before the fall of the capital, the city's rooftops, modern boulevards, sprawling neighborhoods and narrow, twisty side streets will test coalition armies inching closer by the hour.<br><br>Military theory holds that an army unit loses almost one-third of its people taking a city - a price the United States hasn't paid for generations and hopes to avoid with new tactics and training, an excess of caution and a dose of luck.<br><br>Already, allied forces have engaged "rag tags in flip-flops," as British Sgt. Nigel Barton described poorly trained but dangerously unpredictable urban irregulars who might extend a hand of friendship one minute and shoot the next.<br><br>U.S. and British troops have struggled for four days to secure an early conquest, the strategic port town of Umm Qasr where the Iraqi resistance has refused to melt from the streets.<br><br>Farther up the highway, allies closed in quickly on the outskirts of Basra, a city of 1.3 million, taking the airfield on the outskirts and a bridge. But there the assault paused, turning into a shooting match that persists.<br><br>Allies hope the enemy will give up before they have to send troops into the city. "We're not going to get drawn in unless we absolutely have to," said British Col. Chris Vernon.<br><br>Basra is but a microcosm of Baghdad, city of 5 million, home to Saddam Hussein's toughest defenders and the key to victory.<br><br>Allies face a multitude of hazards if they have to mix it up inside "Fortress Baghdad," as Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld put it. Military analysts say the worst case - actual door-to-door combat, with civilians always in the way - might be avoidable, but incursions of some sort into hostile urban areas are likely.<br><br>Beyond the obvious risk to troops moving through unfamiliar neighborhoods, the prospect of high civilian casualties gives commanders pause. After the 17-hour urban gun battle in Mogadishu, Somalia, in 1993, 18 U.S. servicemen and more than 1,000 Somalis lay dead - and not all the Somalis were combatants.<br><br>Separating combatants and innocents, already a deadly challenge for forces operating in southern Iraq, would be all the harder in Baghdad.<br><br>On the approach to the capital, the Army's 3rd Infantry Division has run into al-Quds militiamen who used a commercial area to stage guerrilla attacks, officials said. When U.S. tanks went after them, they quickly found themselves in a residential neighborhood, with women and children coming out of their houses to gawk at the Americans.<br><br>"The al-Quds are all along this area, dressed like civilians and driving civilian vehicles and they come out at night," 4th Battalion Commander Lt. Col. Philip DeCamp said Monday. "The al-Quds are madmen, taking over people's houses and making them get out."<br><br>For all that, some U.S. strategists say Fortress Baghdad can be taken, and not necessarily at tremendous cost.<br><br>"I don't think it's going to be a Stalingrad," said retired Marine Col. Bob Work, referring to the Russian city where 1 million died in a crucial defeat for German invaders in World War II.<br><br>He said the positioning of Saddam's toughest divisions outside the city raises hope they can be decimated by air attack rather than take up urban warrens in great numbers.<br><br>He is clinging to that hope.<br><br>"In the city, everything is a line-of-sight fight," Work said. "You peek your head around the corner and you can see down one block. Enemies can pop out above you, below you. They can come from the sewers.<br><br>"They can shoot down from you from windows. They can outflank you by going down alleyways on the other side of the building."<br><br>Daniel Goure, a military analyst at the Lexington Institute, said allies would have to divide the city into manageable chunks, isolating the resistance.<br><br>"It will be a pain, it will be difficult, it will be urban," Goure said. "But it will work."<br><br>John Pike, defense analyst at Globalsecurity.org, predicted a three-pronged urban strategy - bombing leadership targets, sending in the tanks and seizing airwaves to urge surrender.<br><br>"Those three things simultaneously will hopefully convince people that Iraq is under new management," Pike said. "And if that doesn't work, then there's going to be a problem."<br><br>Some of America's costliest fights have been in urban combat - several thousand lost in Seoul during the Korean War, hundreds in Hue City in Vietnam. Retired Marine Col. Randy Gangle, former adviser to the Marine Corps Warfighting Lab, said it is common for 30 percent of an invading force to be killed or wounded in the early going, compared with 10 percent in open combat.<br><br>"We will not willy-nilly use our firepower in the cities the way we would in the open," he said. "And we've trained for just that type of thing."<br><br>Sound Off...What do you think?<br><br></div>

The CIA and the Pentagon have two known targets and are currently working on them: Colombia and the "Triple Border" between Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay.<br><br>While Colombia's 40 years civil war is an example of an unresolved internal conflict, the "Triple Border" could have international repercussion. However, no matter the case, White House Hawks see terrorists where they aren't.<br><br>As for the situation in Colombia, even when some means used by the marxist rebel groups operating in the country could sound similar to the one used by terrorists, the history of the conflict says something different. The Revolutionary Armed Force of Colombia (FARC) and the National Army of Liberation (ELN) have more to do with the Cold War years than to the current global scenario.<br><br>FARC forces born as a reaction of impoverished farmers against the exploitation of landowners. The Communist Party of Colombia firstly organized this armed group to establish a Soviet style state in the country. Then, poor farmers joined FARC's and ELN's armies after local authorities banned coca crops production, main source of incomes for them.<br><br>Now, Washington says the FARC's and the ELN's are terrorists linked to the narcotraffic. At the same time, the current right wing Government of Alvaro Uribe, fails on its no-negotiation policy and claims for a US military intervention into its own country "similar to the one in Iraq". Perhaps, Mr. Uribe wants to see Bogota as destroyed, as it is Baghdad today.<br><br>Despite of the lack of evidence about terrorist activity found in the "Triple Border", Washington insists on the existence of a terrorism sanctuary in the small area that joins Brazil, Argentina and Paraguay. Neither Brazil's intelligence services nor Argentina ones found any sort of signal about the presence of al-Qaida members operating in the region. The CIA says yes.<br><br>In an operation in Afghanistan the US army said that found a picture of the Iguazu Falls, the amazing tourist attraction nearby the region. For them, this is enough to say that Osama Bin Laden or other al-Qaida members were there and to ignore detailed and full reports from South America on the negative.<br><br>The area, a profitable black market and money-laundering place for US based international banks, is alleged to host several Middle Eastern terrorist groups camouflaged among the large Arab community that has lived in peace for decades. Again, no evidence of this has been found either by governmental offices or independent researches.<br><br>All in all, there is something clear: as long as Mercosur countries keep on approaching economically and politically to Europe rumors about terrorist activities inside the block will increase. As per Colombia, Washington already has over 400 troops operating within the country. It is only a matter of time to see a larger force "securing" nation's natural resources.<br><br>Hernan Etchaleco<br>PRAVDA.Ru<br>Argentina<br><br></div>

The records are inaccessible to the public, and police have been prosecuted in U.S. courts for misusing the system to find, for example, personal information about girlfriends or former spouses.<br><br>Officials said the change, which immediately drew criticism from civil-liberties advocates, is necessary to ensure investigators have access to information that can't be confirmed but could take on new significance later, FBI spokesman Paul Bresson said.<br><br>The change to the 1974 U.S. Privacy Act was disclosed with an announcement published in the Federal Register.<br><br>The Privacy Act previously required the FBI to ensure information was "accurate, relevant, timely and complete" before it could be added to the system.<br><br>"It's a pretty big job to be accurate and complete," said Stewart Baker, a Washington lawyer who specializes in technology and surveillance issues. "On the other hand, these are potentially very significant records for people, and if it's not accurate and complete, it can mean trouble."<br><br>Critics urged Congress to review the change, arguing that information in the computer files was especially important because it can affect many aspects of a person's life.<br><br>"This is information that has always been stigmatizing, the type of data that can prevent someone from getting a job," said Marc Rotenberg of the Washington-based Electronic Privacy Information Center. "When you remove the accuracy obligations, you open the door to the use of unreliable information."<br><br>Critics have noted complaints for years about wrong information in the computer files that disrupted the lives of innocent citizens, and the FBI has acknowledged problems. In one case, a Phoenix resident was arrested for minor traffic violations that had been quashed weeks earlier; in another, a civilian was misidentified as a Navy deserter.<br><br>The system "is replete with inaccurate, untimely information, but everybody does their best to keep it up to date," said Beryl Howell, former general counsel to the Senate Judiciary Committee. "That's a goal we shouldn't just throw out."<br><br>In the change, the Justice Department said earlier restrictions on information "would limit the ability of trained investigators and intelligence analysts to exercise their judgment in reporting on investigations and impede the development of criminal intelligence necessary for effective law enforcement."<br><br>It added that, because the system collects its data from so many other organizations, "it is administratively impossible to ensure compliance."<br><br>___<br><br>On the Net: National Crime Information Center: http://www.fbi.gov/hq/cjisd/ncic.htm<br><br>Electronic Privacy Information Center: http://www.epic.org/<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> No longer does FBI have to doublecheck to see if its information is accurate before it enters it into its database!

            <div class='col-md body'>14:30 2003-03-25<br><br>Main Objective of War Â– New Weapon Tests<br><br>Reserve Major-General, Professor Vladimir Slipchenko, military analyst, doctor of military science is RussiaÂ’s first-rate specialist on wars of tomorrow. His forecasts concerning USÂ’s military operations in Iraq (1991, 1996 and 1998 ), in Yugoslavia (1999) and Afghanistan (2001) proved to be almost 100% true, and that was proved by the actual course of the operations. Now the analyst gives forecasts concerning further development and result of the US-led war in Iraq.<br><br>Main objective of the Iraqi war is still offscreen, nobody ever mentions it. My opinion is that main objective of the war is a large-scale testing of new high precision weapons held by the USA in Iraq. This is the top-priority objective for America, all the rest are minor objectives or undisguised misinformation in fact.<br><br>For over ten years already the USA has been waging no-contact wars. In May 2001, George W. Bush delivered his first presidential speech to students of the US Navy Academy in Annapolis and declared that drastic measures must be taken to start preparation of the US armed forces for wars of tomorrow. He emphasized at that, these should be high-tech armed forces to perform no-contact operations all over the world. Now the objective is persistently carried out.<br><br>It makes sense to mention that the Pentagon purchases from the defense establishment only weapons tested in real wars and holding quality certificates taken on battle fields. After several real experiments, the wars in Iraq, Yugoslavia and Afghanistan, many of the US defense corporations have been given the right to sell their high-precision weapons to the Pentagon. These are Martin Lockheed, General Electric and Loral. Other large companies havenÂ’t yet got orders from the military department. The price of the issue is 50-60 billion dollars per year, everybody wants to get such sums. But todayÂ’s weapons suppliers of the Pentagon constantly develop more new weapons that must be tested. The US defense establishment demands the political leadership to provide testing grounds, wars where the new weapons can be tested. And they do get such grounds. This is the main reason why the war has been started in Iraq, not because of USÂ’s desire to get control over Iraqi oil.<br><br>This war will differ from the USÂ’s previously held no-contact wars for its political purposes first of all. It is for the first time since 1991 that the USA makes sets itself an objective to change the political regime in an inimical country, to remove or liquidate leadership of the country. Objectives of this kind havenÂ’t been yet attained.<br><br>Remember, the USA never attempted to remove Saddam out of politics; those were not war methods used for overthrowing Slobodan Milosevic. The US armed forces held tests of new weapons, then took the weapons and went home. Now they are facing a very hard objective.<br><br>So, if the objective is different, the war strategy changes as well. It is for the first time declared that a war must result in USÂ’s absolute victory. Three problems must be settled for this purpose: to smash inimical armed forces, to destroy economy of the country and change its political regime.<br><br>I have no doubt that IraqÂ’s army will suffer the strongest blows. The USA will have to completely occupy the Iraqi territories to bring a new puppet government into the country (and it is highly likely that this government has been already formed) and to give this new government an opportunity to work. Occupation on the territory where resistance may still be very strong will entail lots of casualties among the US army. Certainly Americans donÂ’t need partisans, that is why the whole of the Iraqi army will be liquidated; it is going to be a terrible slaughter.<br><br>Now itÂ’s being actively discussed whether Iraq has at least a chance to put up resistance to the USA. I say there are none. In Iraq weÂ’ll once again see the situation when two generations of wars meet.<br><br>Iraq is strong to fight a war of the previous generation, the war held on ground and for every object on ground. But 600.000 Iraqi soldiers and all the weapons and ammunition they have wonÂ’t be enough for meeting the aggressor.<br><br>In fact, there will be no meeting as such on the battle field. Fighting their no-contact wars, Americans will send high-precision missiles to destroy all central objects of the Iraqi governmental and military infrastructure; then they will start bombing raids to liquidate the Iraqi army.<br><br>My opinion is that Americans will start the operation with high-precision strikes against bunkers and command posts where Saddam and other Iraqi leaders may be taking shelter, against army headquarters and dispositions of troops. High-precision ammunition of a vacuum type will be used to hit subsurface objects. Even if such ammunition blows up not exactly inside a bunker, it will all the same block all ways for escape from it.<br><br>Within the first days of the war Americans will use cluster aircraft bombs with self-guided elements. At a high altitude this Â“motherÂ” bomb releases tens and even hundreds of smaller bombs, each of them picks out a target on the surface.<br><br>I am sure that the USA will use new impulse bombs as soon as the war begins. Such bombs operate the following way: they eject electromagnetic radiation of about 2 megawatt in an instant. At a distance of 2 Â– 2.5 kilometers from the epicenter of the place where such a bomb blows up, it disables all electronic systems, communication systems, radars, computers, radio sets, hearing aids and even cardiostimulators. They are destroyed by melting. Thus, this weapon will destroy IraqÂ’s systems of management over the country and the troops practically in a moment.<br><br>As this war will be experimental for the USA, Iraq will become a testing ground for tests of new high-precision cruise missiles with a view to further obtain certificates of quality for the weapons. I think that first of all special attention will be focused on launching missiles from submarines.<br><br>The Pentagon will keep on developing mechanism of pointing of high-precision weapons. In 2000, the USA used an Endeavor space shuttle to scan up to 80% of the Earth surface and created an electronic 3-D map. This map allows to direct cruise missiles from a military satellite at a window in SaddamÂ’s palace.<br><br>Vladimir Slipchenko forecasts that the war will last for not more than 1.5 months. The first period of the war will last for about 30 days. 400-500 high-precision cruise missiles will be launched from marine and air bases against Iraqi objects every day. Within this month IraqÂ’s troops and economic potential will be liquidated. And if anything remains intact after these attacks, these objects will be all the same destroyed within the next two weeks.<br><br>Americans will organize a large-scale cleansing of the territory from B-52 and B-2 Stealth bombers. One Stealth bomber can detect and liquidate up to 200 surface immovable and moving targets within four hours of flights. The USA is going to use not less than 16 B-2 bombers. IraqÂ’s air defense wonÂ’t be able to somehow oppose attacks of US planes and cruise missiles. Already now Iraq has no air defense facilities in the south and in the north, US aviation is bombing the areas perpetually.<br><br>IraqÂ’s anti-aircarft defense system is based on the classical radar location scheme: radiate-detect-illuminate from beneath-liquidate. Americans will use this fact to pursue their own interests. As soon as an Iraqi radar ejects electromagnetic energy, a high-precision cruise missile will be immediately launched against this object.<br><br>According to my estimates, the USA will spend not less than 80 billion dollars on the Iraqi campaign. But total spending may also rise up to 100 billions. The exact sum of spending on the war wonÂ’t be published simply because partially the war is financed by private companies that provide the Pentagon with experimental samples of their weapons for free for further tests in the war. The program meant for modernization of the US armed forces costs about 600 billion dollars. That is why the US defense establishment can afford now to give weapons to the army for free.<br><br>Iraq will suffer tremendous losses. As Americans are going in fact to liquidate the Iraqi army, I think that losses may be not less than 500.000 people. This is going to be a bloody war.<br><br>Alexander Grigoryev<br>FreeLance Bureau<br><br>Translated by Maria Gousseva<br><br><a href="http://english.pravda.ru/war/2003/03/25/44979.html" rel="nofollow">http://english.pravda.ru/war/2003/03/25/44979.html</a></div>

All the speculations about chemical and biological weapons still remained a mystery. If Allied forces suffered the same fate as Hans Blix-led weapon inspectors, "incapable" as some critics might say, this will be the Greatest Mockery of mankind History!<br><br>They will keep on searching and continue to feed the world with its 2 WMD: the media (Weapons of Mass Distortion) and its propaganda and campaign (Weapons of Mass Distraction) to veer attention away from the administration's failure to address its ailing economy.<br><br>Amazingly, some of us view the perceived threat as so real that it came to our door steps. Almost blown out of proportions, the Jemaah Islamiah is totally a different issue to be linked with Saddam Hussein. All the accusations are not supported with evidence and some of us believe removing Saddam will eventually remove JI.<br><br>Then the most bizarre thing is, people linked Al-Qaeda with Saddam Hussein! 911 is another issue and this war is alleged by Bush administration as interlinked. All the talks of WMD and Terrorism propaganda had successfully penetrated into the minds of ignorants without rational thinking!<br><br>USA of today is totally on the wrong side this time around. If more Allied troops died in this war, if it takes more than 1 month as calculated, all the supports for Bush will subside dramatically and peace movement will become even greater.<br><br>First, it is about DISARMING Iraq. Now, it is about FREEING Iraqi people. It has never been consistent to me for quite a long time and I am beginning to believe, Saddam is innocent after all.<br><br>We can talk about Saddam's bad track record. He ordered the killing of his 2 sons-in-law. We never know what really happened. Then the Kurds poisoning. Some analyst blast the propaganda saying the chemical weapons were actually used for Iranian but it spread to Kurds territory. All the distortion of facts and confusion of this event remained a mystery.<br>Perhaps, after all the deaths and chaos, many years later, we'll come to a clear picture of what this all is about.<br><br>One thing is common among The Doves and The Hawks, may this war end sooner. God bless us all.<br><br></blockquote>Author: haza (---.156ce.scvmaxonline.com.sg)<br>Date:   03-26-03 10:47<br><br>Chryssler,<br><br>I don't know if you have watched CNA news, if i'm not mistaken was it this morning or yesterday night when May Ying-Welsh reported from Baghdad.<br><br>She said she knew and spoke to Iraqis who 2weeks ago welcome the coalition and now they are saying "We thought they are coming to free us, but it seems that they are invading our country. We will not let this happen. We will fight for our country adn support our President".<br><br>May Ying-Welsh repeated 'and this came from the same people who 2weeks ago support the coalition'.<br><br>So, I have read your posts - Interesting and Salutes, I must say, though in the beginning I was not quite in support with you, but now I think those Iraqis and you yourself are beginning to see the REAL MOTIVE of this so called "Op. Iraqi Freedom" is ALL about.<br><br>*The Planet Belongs To US-All - O(il) I(ncluded) L(aaa)*<br>get it?<br><br><blockquote></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Baghdad Has History of Foreign Invaders </strong><br><br>30 minutes ago<br><br>By MATT CRENSON, AP National Writer<br><br>First came the Mongols, then the Ottomans and Persians<br><br>Finally, in modern times, the British took Baghdad, sacrificing thousands of lives to wrest it from the Turks during World War I.<br><br>Over centuries, the city in the cradle of civilization has fallen to a succession of foreign armies. U.S. and allied forces are positioning themselves to be the next.<br><br>"It's a rather vulnerable city," said Arthur Goldschmidt, a professor emeritus of Middle Eastern history at Pennsylvania State University.<br><br>Today Baghdad is a sprawling industrial metropolis crisscrossed by highways. Under the Abbasid caliphs who made it their capital in A.D. 762, it was a walled center of culture and learning.<br><br>When Europe was mired in the chaos and backwardness of the Dark Ages, Muslim scholars in Baghdad translated ancient Greek texts into Arabic, invented algebra and created literary masterworks.<br><br>That golden age was already waning when the Mongols first sacked Baghdad in 1258 under Hulegu Khan, a grandson of Genghis Khan.<br><br>Hulegu's force of 200,000 easily overwhelmed the 20,000 horsemen who rode out to meet him. After a weeklong siege, Baghdad surrendered and the Mongols swarmed in.<br><br>The invaders sacked libraries, burned mosques, smashed and looted precious art objects; they killed hundreds of thousands.<br><br>To ensure that Baghdad would not recover, the Mongols destroyed the canals that watered the city's agricultural hinterlands. Rich farmland turned to desert. The canals were not fully rebuilt until the 20th century.<br><br>By the 1500s, the Mongols having retreated to their ancestral home in Central Asia, Baghdad became a pawn in the rivalry between the Turkish Ottomans and the Sefavids, a Shiite Muslim empire based in Persia.<br><br>The Sefavids struck first, capturing Baghdad in 1509. Suleyman the Magnificent took the city for the Ottomans 16 years later, but a century after that Baghdad was again in Persian hands. In 1638, Ottoman Sultan Murad IV took Baghdad back for good.<br><br>By then, the city of culture, power and wealth was a memory.<br><br>Baghdad persisted under Ottoman rule until World War I, when the Turks aligned themselves with Germany. The British launched an invasion. Just as coalition troops are doing today, they fought their way up the fertile crescent toward Baghdad.<br><br>"They had a terrible time of it," Goldschmidt said.<br><br>The campaign began smoothly enough. Major-General Sir Charles Townshend easily took the southern city of Basra in November 1914, and began advancing upriver.<br><br>Then his luck ran out. In November 1915, 15 miles outside Baghdad, Townshend and his 11,000 men found themselves outnumbered and beyond the reach of their stretched supply lines.<br><br>After sustaining 40 percent casualties, the British forces crumbled and retreated downriver to the city of Kut. Besieged there for almost five months, they surrendered only after four failed rescue attempts cost 23,000 more lives.<br><br>The British regrouped, resupplied and appointed a new commander, Lieutenant-General Stanley Maude. In March 1917, Baghdadis cheered the arrival of a British force four times the size of the one Townshend had led.<br><br>But like many before them, the British enjoyed limited hospitality in Iraq (news - web sites). They didn't plunder and slaughter like the Mongols, but they strafed from airplanes as a means of controlling fractious tribesmen. The British and their American allies also helped themselves to a healthy share of Iraqi oil until long after the country became independent in 1932.<br><br>When American forces roll in, they, too, can expect joyous greetings to conceal deep misgivings, said Middle East historian Phebe Marr, a former senior fellow at the Institute for National Strategic Studies and member of the Council on Foreign Relations.<br><br>"It is a country, particularly where you get into Baghdad ... that has a very strong tradition of nationalism," Marr said. "They don't like foreign occupation."<br><br><a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story2&amp;cid=540&amp;ncid=736&amp;e=9&amp;u=/ap/20030326/ap_on_re_mi_ea/war_taking_baghdad" rel="nofollow">http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story2&amp;cid=540&amp;ncid=736&amp;e=9&amp;u=/ap/20030326/ap_on_re_mi_ea/war_taking_baghdad</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>China readies for future U.S. fight</strong><br>By CNN Senior China Analyst Willy Wo-Lap Lam<br><br>March 24, 2003<br><br>HONG KONG, China (CNN) --The Iraqi war has convinced the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) leadership that some form of confrontation with the U.S. could come earlier than expected.<br><br>Beijing has also begun to fine-tune its domestic and security policies to counter the perceived threat of U.S. "neo-imperialism."<br><br>As more emphasis is being put on boosting national strength and cohesiveness, a big blow could be dealt to both economic and political reform.<br><br>That the new leadership has concluded China is coming up against formidable challenges in the short to medium term is evident from recent statements by President Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao.<br><br>Hu indicated earlier this year Beijing must pay more attention to global developments so that "China make good preparations before the rainstorm ... and be in a position to seize the initiative."<br><br>Wen also pointed out in the first meeting of the State Council, or cabinet, last Saturday the leadership "must keep a cool head."<br><br>"We must boost our consciousness about disasters and downturns -- and think about dangers in the midst of [apparent] safety," he said.<br><br>Alarm bells about a deteriorating international situation have been sounded by the CCP's secretive Leading Group on National Security (LGNS), which coordinates policies in areas including diplomacy, defense and energy.<br><br>The LGNS, which is headed by Hu, has since early this month called a series of meetings to discuss ways to handle the Iraqi crisis.<br><br>In the near term, of course, the focus is on the impact of rising oil prices -- and on the need to build up a strategic oil reserve that can last at least 30 days.<br><br>However, economic concerns are not the top priority. Given the likelihood oil prices will drop after the resolution of the conflict, some government economists are saying the war's impact on this year's economic performance will be insubstantial.<br><br>Officials even cite the safe haven theory to predict foreign direct investment flowing into China will exceed the record $52 billion last year.<br><br>Of more concern to the LGNS is the perceived expansion of American unilateralism if not neo-imperialism.<br><br>As People's Daily commentator Huang Peizhao pointed out last Saturday, U.S. moves in the Middle East "have served the goal of seeking world-wide domination."<br><br>State Council think-tank member Tong Gang saw the conflict as the first salvo in Washington's bid to "build a new world order under U.S. domination."<br><br>Chinese strategists think particularly if the U.S. can score a relatively quick victory over Baghdad, it will soon turn to Asia -- and begin efforts to "tame" China.<br><br>It is understood the LGNS believes the U.S. will take on North Korea -- still deemed a "lips-and-teeth" ally of China's -- as early as this summer.<br><br>These developments have prompted China to change its long-standing geopolitical strategy, which still held true as late as the 16th CCP Congress last November.<br><br>Until late last year, Beijing believed a confrontation with the U.S. could be delayed -- and China could through hewing to the late Deng Xiaoping's "keep a low profile" theory afford to concentrate almost exclusively on economic development.<br><br>"Now, many cadres and think-tank members think Beijing should adopt a more pro-active if not aggressive policy to thwart U.S. aggression," said a Chinese source close to the diplomatic establishment.<br><br>He added hard-line elements in the People's Liberation Army (PLA) had advocated providing weapons to North Korea to help Pyongyang defend itself against a possible U.S. missile strike at its nuclear facilities.<br><br>Forestalling the challenge<br>Even less hawkish experts are advocating beefing up the national security apparatus.<br><br>Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) economist Yang Fan pointed out the recent global flare-ups had alerted China to the imperative of improving national security and cohesiveness.<br><br>"Equal weight should be given to economic development and national security," Yang said. "As we become more prosperous, we must concentrate our forces [on safeguarding national safety]."<br><br>What is China doing to forestall the perceived U.S. challenge?<br><br>Firstly, the CCP leadership is fostering nationalistic sentiments, a sure-fire way to promote much-needed cohesiveness.<br><br>While not encouraging anti-U.S. demonstrations, Beijing has informed the people of what the media calls "increasingly treacherous international developments."<br><br>This explains what analysts including Beijing scholars considered the unexpectedly virulent official reaction to the start of the Iraq war.<br><br>Foreign Ministry spokesman Kong Quan said the U.S.-led military campaign had "trampled on the U.N. constitution and international law" and that it would lead to regional and global instability.<br><br>Equally tough statements were issued by the National People's Congress (NPC) and the advisory Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.<br><br>Major official media such as Xinhua and People's Daily have run dozens of articles and analyses whose gist is that, in the words of commentator Li Xuejiang, the invasion of Iraq had "damaged the international order."<br><br>In an apparent departure from Beijing's cautious attitude at the beginning of the Iraqi crisis, authorities last weekend allowed a group of nationalist intellectuals to hold a conference condemning U.S. "hegemonism."<br><br>The corollary of boosting national cohesiveness could be the suppression of dissent, particularly politically incorrect views expressed by "pro-West" intellectuals.<br><br>The warning and punishment that party authorities recently meted out to several Beijing and provincial publications may augur a relatively prolonged period of ideological control in the interest of promoting "unity of thinking."<br><br>On the economic front, the authorities may play up the imperative of concentrating resources to boost China's "economic security" and "energy security."<br><br>"The Wen leadership is checking out why earlier plans to build up a strategic oil reserve failed to materialize last year, when prices were much lower," said a Beijing-based party source.<br><br>"It is possible that bucking the overall trend of market reforms, Beijing may bring back more government fiats to sectors deemed to have strategic and national-security implications."<br><br>It is instructive that in his 90-minute long interview with the international media last week, Wen was quite reticent about boosting economic reform such as the liberalization of state-owned enterprises.<br><br>In accordance with the theory of "the synthesis of [the needs of] war and peace," civilian economic projects in areas including infrastructure may be planned will the requirements of the defense forces in mind.<br><br>On the military front, the Iraqi conflict will kick start another season of accelerated modernization of weaponry.<br><br>Diplomatic analysts in Beijing said PLA officers and strategists had been scrutinizing the latest hardware used by American and British forces.<br><br>They pointed out the PLA's astonishment at the wizardry of American firearms used in the 1991 Gulf War was a major factor behind the Chinese army's aggressive modernization drive through the 1990s.<br><br>Academy of Military Sciences (AMS) expert Peng Guanqian pointed out that the Iraqi war would provide the Pentagon with "a testing ground for new military equipment and strategies."<br><br>The Liberation Army Daily last Friday quoted unnamed officers from the Army and the People's Armed Police as saying the PLA must "quicken the pace of military modernization."<br><br>Such developments could in turn hasten a possible showdown between the two countries that harbor deep-seated mistrust of each other even in relatively tranquil times.<br><br>Find this article at:<br>http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/asiapcf/east/03/24/willy.column<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Free press and the face of war</strong><br>By Paul Belden<br><br>AMMAN - Suddenly, on Sunday, the war seemed a lot less like a video game than it had the day before.<br><br>At least, in the Arab world it did.<br><br>While Western television coverage continued to be dominated by a numbing rotation of embedded reporters, armchair generals and video special effects, Arab media was showing some of the most astonishing images of war ever broadcast.<br><br>An example of the Western approach: Sunday morning's coverage on CNN was anchored by an hours-long live broadcast by a camera crew embedded with a US Marine unit in southern Iraq. The unit had taken fire from a nearby building, and stopped behind a road to deal with it, the reporter explained. US forces had fired two rockets at the house, one of which had struck home.<br><br>But the reporter didn't show any of that. The only thing that the camera showed was a tank rolling slowly down another road into the picture from the right. The tank stopped. Then it backed up. "This is historic footage," the reporter intoned, his voice hushed. A convoy rolled into view behind the tank. The convoy stopped. "This is a real-time battle you're seeing."<br><br>Who knew that real-time battle could be so antiseptic, so choreographed, so clean?<br><br>Before the day was out, CNN's war coverage had been mocked and overtaken by images that showed the true face of war in all its madness and horror - images that almost invariably bore the label "Al-Jazeera exclusive". These were not scrolling maps or armchair generals - these were scenes of a 12-year-old child with half her head blown off in Basra. This was the sound and fury of the relatives of victims of Tomahawk cruise missile strikes in northern Iraq loudly promising their revenge. This was live coverage of a hundreds-strong posse of armed and delighted Iraqis setting fire to the bulrushes of the Tigris River in search of a Western pilot presumed hiding within.<br><br>This was a guided tour of a roomful of US soldiers in a morgue. This was the fear in the eyes of a captured US soldier as he was asked by an off-screen voice in broken English why he came all the way from Texas just to kill Iraqis. "I follow orders," he answered, a strain in his voice. These were images of war.<br><br>And while Western sensibilities might have been spared the trauma of exposure to these images, they went straight into the homes and hearts of 300 million viewers in the Middle East on Sunday. The effect was immediate, and strong.<br><br>At a press conference on Sunday in Amman, Prime Minister Ali Abu Ragheb was specifically asked to comment on "the al-Jazeera effect" produced by the images broadcast that day. "I found them painful," he answered. "Very, very painful. The people in the country are angry. We are angry." Then he went on to announce Jordan's support for a new Arab initiative aimed at ending the war through a negotiated compromise.<br><br>The "al-Jazeera effect" did not stop at the water's edge, either. Even US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld was forced to take the images into account, calling the showing of captured American troops a possible "war crime". President George W Bush cut short his working getaway at Camp David to return to the White House on Sunday and tell reporters that "I do know that we expect them [the US prisoners of war] to be treated humanely, just like we'll treat any prisoners of theirs that we capture - humanely."<br><br>Of course, the Arab media found much to mock in Bush's comments. The Bush administration's "newfound affection for the Geneva Convention is remarkable", wrote an editorial in the Riyadh-based daily Arab News. "The US does not believe that the prisoners now being held at Guantanamo Bay are prisoners of war under the Geneva Convention. Pictures of the men there, shackled and living in cages, were distributed by the Bush administration to the world's media."<br><br>Nobody could accuse al-Jazeera of taking sides in the showing of prisoners; they had earlier broadcast images of Iraqi men believed to be soldiers surrendering to British troops near Basra. Rumsfeld had not complained.<br><br>It's a big change from the 1991 Gulf War when the Middle East, along with the rest of the world, depended on the Western media for up-to-the-minute developments. Now they can choose from not only al-Jazeera, but other all-news channels, including the Abu Dhabi channel, which focuses on news in the Gulf states, and one-month-old al-Arabiya. There is also the Hezbollah-run al-Manar, based in Lebanon, which doesn't even try for objectiveness. Whereas al-Jazeera's tag line for war coverage is the neutral "War in Iraq", al-Manar's is the fiery "War of American Aggression".<br><br>Al-Jazeera's popularity rests in part in its refusal to follow any agenda, be it the official government line or the radical militant Islamism. Proof of its effect is the fact that its broadcasts have repeatedly angered Arab governments - including Jordan's, where the station had been banned from opening a bureau as recently as last week.<br><br>After the ban was lifted, the correspondent who arrived to staff the Amman bureau was the now-famous on-screen news personality Sawsan abu-Hamdeh, fresh from a two-month assignment in Baghdad. I asked her what she thought of the effect of her station's coverage of dead American soldiers. "It is only the truth," she answered. "I do not regret it [at] all. The government might not like it, but there is a difference between the government view of events and and the local view of events. We try to portray what is really happening in the world."<br><br>And the people seem to know it. In a small coffee shop in central Amman on Sunday, five old men were gathered spellbound around a small television set, watching the live coverage of the search for the supposed downed Western pilot in the Tigris River. The reporter on the scene, the well-known Palestinian Majed Abdul Hadi, had his camera constantly trained on the crowd as it searched the river with guns drawn and flaming brands in hand. Abdul Hadi provided a continuous overdub report on developments, responding to commentary and questions posed by his bureau chief in Doha, a woman named Fairrouz. This was the most newsworthy thing happening in the world at that moment. It was up to the minute, it was exciting, it was news. And al-Jazeera was prepared to cover it live as it unfolded.<br><br>Over on CNN, meanwhile, there was a reporter standing in front of the camera conveying the message that the Pentagon denied the loss of any aircraft. Now that's fair enough - but al-Jazeera also carried this denial prominently throughout its report, which was skeptical of both sides' claims. Fairrouz was constantly asking Abdul Hadi to clarify the conflicting reports she was receiving, whether anyone really had been captured or seen. It was tough and skeptical coverage.<br><br>CNN seemed to think that the Pentagon denial was the main news, but that patently wasn't the case. The search itself was the main news, as any newsman would know: the fact that a few hundred people were dead certain that they had a pilot cornered on the banks of the river. That was the news.<br><br>As of Monday morning, CNN and BBC began showing the interview with the captured American troops in Nasiriyah - but with their faces scrambled and only their voices heard. I can certainly understand their judgment. But the fear in those soldiers' eyes was the true face of war, seen up close. It was truer than the mushroom clouds seen from a distance over Baghdad. And if the true face of war is too much for American prime time television, then maybe prime time American television should stick to covering the Oscars, and leave the war alone.<br><br>(Â©2003 Asia Times Online Co, Ltd.

Instead, it has taken the lead in developing what could be the most significant advancement in airport security since the airline food industry discovered that its waffles make rather effective body armor.<br><br>Engineers in Great Britain have developed something which men and boys have dreamed about for years. Something that every male by the age of 12 had sent away for from an ad found in the back of most comic books. They have developed, and not a moment too soon in our ongoing war against terrorism, x-ray glasses.<br><br>Initial trials of the x-ray glasses are taking place right now in Terminal 1 of London's busy Heathrow Airport.<br><br>When you hear the term x-ray glasses, the first thing that probably comes to mind is a pair of really dorky-looking, Saddam Hussein-type glasses with two spiraling disks where the lenses normally are and emitting a futuristic "wooo wooo" sound.<br><br>If that is the image you have in mind, then you might be completely surprised when I tell you that, in fact, the glasses look exactly like that.<br><br>Just kidding. Actually I don't know what the x-ray glasses look like because the press release I read didn't include a picture. So there's no telling how dorky looking they might be.<br><br>Knowing how dorky is extremely important, however, in determining the overall likelihood that a renegade airport security guard might someday steal a pair of x-ray glasses and, while cruising local nightclubs, use the x-ray vision on unsuspecting female patrons.<br><br>An Urgent Warning to Women Traveling Overseas: Should you find yourself in a London area nightclub, especially one in close proximity to Heathrow Airport, and someone wearing extremely dorky looking glasses is standing in a corner staring at you, specifically staring at a point midway between your waist and neck, immediately realize that you are in England and this could be a normal local custom, much like cricket is.<br><br>When I say this might be normal behavior in England, I base this on my extensive experience many years ago watching the English comedy show "Benny Hill." If you have never watched Benny Hill, you should know that the major comic element in each show involved Benny Hill staring at various young women's, uh-um, Big Bens, if you know what I mean. The show was quite popular with teen-aged boys.<br><br>If, however, the man staring at you has dorky-looking glasses that are at the same time emitting a futuristic "wooo wooo" sound, then ladies take swift and forceful action by using mace to subdue the freak. And I'm not talking about the kind of mace that you spray, either. I'm talking about an actual mace that comes on a chain and has spikes.<br><br>All right, that's enough silliness about x-ray glasses and references to Big Ben. In truth, the x-ray glasses are only used to enhance three-dimensional images seen on an x-ray machine screen used to examine luggage. At no time will the x-ray glasses be used to "check out" a woman's "Benny Hills," if you're still thinking in terms of sophomoric references.<br><br>Instead, passenger screening will be left up to the new "Sentinel II" detection portal that, when an airline passenger steps inside the detection arch, will electronically sniff him.<br><br>How this works is that air will be gently blown across the person standing in the detection arch and the dislodged molecules immediately analyzed by a large, bionic nose.<br><br>I know what you're thinking: can this device really sniff out highly dangerous chemicals? How about body odors? If so, have we crossed a line here? Could our rights be trampled? Could this lead to a day when smelly people are routinely discriminated against and forced to sit in the rear of an airplane? And, honestly, would that be such a bad thing?<br><br>You can email Lee at lee.online@verizon.net<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> From CNA forums<br><br><blockquote><br><br>The Untold Stories<br>Author: Chryssler Lords Amberlin (219.93.64.---)<br>Date:   03-26-03 18:04<br><br>The motivation of war is money. WMD and Terrorism is a value-added theory included into the propaganda package sold by Bush administration to garner support.<br><br>As I read through all the topics, I am saddened time and again. Not because of nonsensical statement but it reflect the cruel side of human nature.<br><br>~Here we go. The costs of 1991 Gulf War is US$40b. 25% were covered by USA - US$10b. The other 75% is covered by Saudi Arabia and Kuwait - US$30b. Oil price before the war, was US$15 per barrell. With the Gulf War, it increased to US$42 and generate some US$60b. In Arabian country, the 50-50 rules applied. 50% profit goes to local government. Another 50% goes to MNC that controls the oil-field. This makes the net profit of price increase to US$60b shared by oil companies(US$30b) and Arabian Government(US$30b shared by both Saudi and Kuwait).<br><br>From the US$30b, USA Government gained 21b, 9b to private Americans. It is clear that without war, private companies will not profit. If war costs in 1991 is 10b, the profit for "liberating" Kuwait is 21b. Subtract, they gained US$11billion.<br><br>~Afghanistan War. The establishment of a puppet government which lead to building of oil pipeline owned by Americans 2,500km long across its territory. This is a strategic importance and has a unique alternative. The building of another pipeline 5,500km long, much more expensive due to high taxes from crossed countries to USA. Much easier huh? To destroy a country so weakened by 20 years of war and make it a COLONY having the opportunity to build the pipeline in peace. Calling France hypocrite indeed! A pot calling kettle black!<br><br>~Terrorism. They say bin Laden is in Iraq. Let me tell you all. It is in Saudi instead of Iraq! Bush Jr is arguing with its main oil supplier in Middle East: Saudi Arabia. Since they found out Saudi is the most involved country with bin Laden terrorism, and also international public opinion has pointed out the lack of human rights in this country, he went on to find alternative oil supplier. Get Iraq! Don't know what US wanna do to Saudi later on after the break.<br><br>The easiest way to control Iraq is to remove Saddam and establish a puppet Government. Bush already said he will directly control them under numerous pretexts. But Why Iraq??<br>(1) Iraq is a country unable to defend itself. Poverty due to embargo killed 300,000 children every year. Who asks for economic sanctions to be freed? France and Russia! Yes, for economic purpose too. I know. But at least, they may provide Iraqi people with better condition compared to USA and Great Britain.<br>(2) Iraq offers easy pretext. The mysterious WMD.<br>(3) Iraq has no strong allied compared to American.<br><br>Moreover, in the last 3 months, Venezuela had social broke out due to miserable life conditions controlled by American oil MNCs. Venezuela is biggest US supplier. Therefore, with Saudi out, and now Venezuela, they MUST go for Iraq this year! Or face elimination in 2004.<br><br>~What we can do? Don't support this war.<br><br>The most confusing thing about Hawks supporters is they rake up the past. Giving Kurds poisoning and invading Kuwait as concrete proof that Saddam will threaten world peace! It is so real that it almost came to Singapore. Too bad JI had links with Al-Qaeda who aspires to create pan-Islamic region are now "tipped-off" by US to be in Iraq instead of Saudi Arabia!<br><br>~ Kurds are now safe. In 1987-1988, poison gas used against Kurds. Then from 1988-1989, Kurds were victims of genocide. This was done to suppress revolt. HOWEVER, after 1991 Gulf War, Iraqi forces again assaulted Kurdish centres, and about 1.4 million refugees fled to Turkey and Iran.<br>UN respond by establishing "safe havens" in northern Iraq. 1996, US bombs military targets after Iraqi troops enter Kurdish territory. 1993, US-led air strikes repels Iraqi incursion on Kuwait. Case close. Shouldn't EXPLOIT this matter as it is thought to be resolved.<br>~ World War 2 analogy. Yes Saddam is portrayed as dictator, as brutal as Hitler. But the whole event is totally different! Hitler was rearming and invades territories of its neighbours while negotiating with Neville Chamberlain. Today, Iraq opens itself up but was accused of "not forthcoming" compared to North Korea who totally shuts its door. For more than 7 years they tolerate such humiliation and coupled with severe economic sanctions.<br><br>Why should we support this war? Its inhumane!<br><br></blockquote></div>

"He was upset. I don't think he felt like he'd done anything."<br><br>"Some general in Qatar blew a fuse and said, 'Get rid of this guy,' " said Smucker's father, John, who lives in Alexandria.<br><br>Pentagon spokeswoman Torie Clarke said she is looking into the report but could not confirm that Smucker had been detained. "Our overwhelming experience to date is that people are trying very hard to be very careful, very responsible," she said. "There have been less than a handful of incidents in which someone revealed information they shouldn't."<br><br>Smucker has been traveling with the 1st Marine Division even though he is not one of the 600 "embedded" journalists who formally agree not to disclose information deemed too sensitive by military commanders. Since Smucker is independent, said Bryan Whitman, Clarke's deputy, local commanders can "treat him as any other civilian on the battlefield." A spokesman at the U.S. Central Command in Qatar had no immediate information on the situation.<br><br>Smucker, 41, is a freelance reporter who has also worked for the Washington Times, U.S. News &amp; World Report, the Miami Herald and the San Francisco Chronicle, according to his father. He added that Smucker was detained by Syria for two days while trying to enter Iraq without a visa.<br><br>Scott said Smucker told him about 6:30 a.m. that he "got a general mad" with an interview he gave to CNN 90 minutes earlier and that the reporter said he was told that "I gave out information I shouldn't have given out."<br><br>In the interview, Smucker told CNN's Carol Costello: "We're about 100 miles south on the main highway. It's an unfinished highway. It goes between the Tigris and Euphrates River in the direction of Baghdad."<br><br>Smucker continued to provide more geographic details about the Army and Marine forces, prompting Costello to interrupt him:<br><br>"Well, don't be too specific," she said. "We don't want exact specifics."<br><br>"Okay," said Smucker, who gave a similar description yesterday to National Public Radio.<br><br>Scott said he suspects that the Marines "have his gear and are not letting him call out." He said Smucker might be expelled -- or forced to join the embedding program, "which would be fine by me."<br><br>While Smucker has been writing about the warfare in Iraq, his 75-year-old father has been trying to stop it. John Smucker said he has been arrested twice in recent weeks, once for kneeling on the steps of the Pentagon and again for blocking traffic on King Street in Alexandria.<br><br>As for his son, Smucker said: "I'm torn. Someone's decided to take his income possibilities away. But we want him back in the country anyway."<br><br>Â© 2003 The Washington Post Company<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Reporters find it difficult to tell truth<br><br></div>
