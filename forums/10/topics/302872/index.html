            <div class='col-md body'>Government is elected to look after the people including providing facilities and medical care of the people.<br><br>In doing so it collect taxes and allocates taxes (say 1/4 of total tax revenues) for provisions of such essential and critical services to the people.<br><br>If say $6.0 billions of taxes were collected annually (including profits from GLCs.HDB,LTA/URA/JTC etc) then $1.5 billion should be set aside for provision of medical care of the people. It is as simple as that. The allocation of tax revenue for medical services has nothing to do with welfarism. It is what the government is elected for i.e. collect taxes and provide basic medical care of the people from such taxes.<br><br>The original allocation of revenue for medical services should be made known to the people before any attempt to try to reduce allocation or make profits from medical services.<br><br>If the original allocated amount is reduced then taxes should be reduced.<br><br>There is no justification for Minister Khaw to try to reduce the medical spending just to have the allocated funds kept aside to form surpluses of the government.<br><br>Government is not elected to build surpluses but provisions of serviecs to the people from taxes collected.<br><br>People do not agree to this kind of governing system and have expressed outrage with NKF under Durai for such unauthorized hoarding of people's donation for surpluses which is not what NKF or government is set up for in the first place.<br><br>Let Minister tell us what was the amount of taxes allocated for provisions of basic medical services and whether it will be put to good use and not hoarded or used to pay higher salaries to themselves or other purposes?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Khaw defended Durai vigorously.. he probably felt that what Durai did was "fundamentally correct"... anyway, it is the same logic as that used by HDB<br><br>In Singapore, no one is equal and the more you earn, the more you pay. The only people who are entitled to be rich are the ministers.<br><br>Anyone who works harder to earn more, the government works harder to push you down to the middle income. How do they do this?<br><br>Simple...<br><br>1) You pay more tax<br>2) You pay more GST<br>3) You are not entitled to cheaper housing<br>4) You are not entitled to medical benefits<br>5) You have to pay higher insurance premiums.<br><br>And they want you to save enough for retirement? How to save when they deny ask you to pay more but denies you the same benefits?<br><br>If we all pay the same tax rate. I would agree that benefits should be staggered to support the lower income. Bu if you are already asked to pay more taxes.. should you get the fair share of benefits?<br><br>One wonder why you want to work so hard to make more money? Because in Singapore, it will never be enough to feed those men in white.<br><br></div>
