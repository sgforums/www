              So Singapore is an inconstitutional monarchy.
              
              And remember they think they are above all so better get ready to dump any God you worship, any parent or sons or daughters that you devote your life to because they demand that they be considered above all. As said by this police officer to Mr Gary Tan a blogger who is now in trouble with the authority.
              
              Gary: He said to me at the lift lobby 90% of the exact words â€“ â€�Mr Tan,if you walk out of here tomorrow,you might get killed.You might meet with a mysterious accident,you might disappear and nobody will know what happened to you! Mr Tan, some things and people in this country you cannot offend! Some people are above all things! You better make sure you know this! Mr Tan,we can arrange for things to happen to you.You understand or not!â€�

              <p>After this trip by LKY to Malaysia, where he will meet with members from the DAP and PAS - will there be any excuse for the PAP Government to prevent he Ministers from foreign countries visiting Singapore to meet with Singapore Polliticians from the Alternative Parties ?</p>
              <p>Race and religion has been a feature of Malaysian politics since the time when Singapore was part of Malaysia, and had remained to this day - where the Malays are allowed generous latitude to talk openly and aggressively about race and religion that offend the other ethnic groups, while harsh treatment will be meted out against anyone or any organisations not supported by those claiming to be Sons of the Soil.</p>
              <p>In comparison, politics in Singapore has "matured" somewhat in the last 52 years of One-Party domination by the PAP, in which the PAP had enforced strict and arbitrary rules that prevent any discussions that touch on race and religion that offend other ethnic or other interest groups.</p>
              <p>The Singapore "political maturity" has been reflected by the silent acceptance in the necessity to be sensitive on such issues, but has not stopped the Government itself from taking strict actions against strident religious demands by any one community that can affect or increase the faultlines in the differences amongst the ethnic groups.</p>
              <p>The paradox in the Singapore political scene is to embrace diversity but at the same time to prevent deep fault lines that separate the races - or ethnic groups when its is expressed in softer term.</p>

As Prof Datuk Dr Shamsul Amri Baharuddin points out, Lee is a person who understands very well the relationship between the two countries, as he had a part in the history of the formation of Malaysia and the separation of Singapore from Malaysia.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 21px; margin: 0px 0px 15px; font-family: Arial; color: #333333; font-size: 14px; padding: 0px;">"The visit can be viewed as an endorsement for (Prime Minister) Najib as Lee is known as a person who deeply believes that if Malaysia is not stable, it will affect Singapore," he says.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 21px; margin: 0px 0px 15px; font-family: Arial; color: #333333; font-size: 14px; padding: 0px;">"Najib is the son of (Malaysia's second Prime Minister) Tun Abdul Razak while Lee and Tun Abdul Razak were peers, having done law together in London ... another layer of relationship.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 21px; margin: 0px 0px 15px; font-family: Arial; color: #333333; font-size: 14px; padding: 0px;">"I know Lee is very concerned with what is happening in Malaysia as anything that happens here will affect Singapore. Things that shape Malaysia will shape Singapore," says Prof</p>
              <p style="line-height: 21px; margin: 0px 0px 15px; font-family: Arial; color: #333333; font-size: 14px; padding: 0px;">Shamsul Amri, who will be among those Lee is expected to meet during his visit.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 21px; margin: 0px 0px 15px; font-family: Arial; color: #333333; font-size: 14px; padding: 0px;">He says Lee has likened situations in Malaysia and Singapore to the "umbilical cord" which connects the two countries.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 21px; margin: 0px 0px 15px; font-family: Arial; color: #333333; font-size: 14px; padding: 0px;">Prof Shamsul Amri says that before Lee makes any statement, he will have given it deep thought as he is not the kind of leader who likes to make popular statements.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 21px; margin: 0px 0px 15px; font-family: Arial; color: #333333; font-size: 14px; padding: 0px;">"If you look at his speeches, you know that he has a lot of information at his disposal," he adds.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 21px; margin: 0px 0px 15px; font-family: Arial; color: #333333; font-size: 14px; padding: 0px;">Another political analyst, Dr Oh Ei Sun, believes that Lee will be taking stock of the latest developments in Malaysia during the visit besides looking at ways to improve bilateral relations, something which he often does when he travels abroad.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 21px; margin: 0px 0px 15px; font-family: Arial; color: #333333; font-size: 14px; padding: 0px;">"He will be meeting different strata of society. He is more or less advisor to the government. He not only advises the Singapore government. Sometimes he also offers his advice to the country he visits," he says.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 21px; margin: 0px 0px 15px; font-family: Arial; color: #333333; font-size: 14px; padding: 0px;">Malaysia and Singapore had a difficult relationship when Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad was the Malaysian prime minister while during the era of his successor, Tun Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, the relationship grew a bit warmer, he says.</p>

Kuan Yew is an old acquaintance of Najib's father (Tun Abdul Razak). Perhaps he will take this opportunity to look into ways to improve the relationship.

              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra_(Malaysia)">The Malaysia-Singapore Politics of the 60s – Politics of Race : The Ultras </a></p>
              <p>The present Malaysian PM Najib's father - Tun Abdul Razak who was a DPM when Singapore was part of Malaysia under the Malaysian PM Tunku Abdul Rahman - had understood the threat of the Malay politician that agitated and advocated for the singular dominance of the Malay Race in Malaysian Politics - <em>'Ketuanan Melayu'</em>.</p>
              <p>Immediately after the May 13, 1964 racial riots that broke out in Kuala Lumpur and Singapore - Tun Abdul Razak and the Home Minister Ismail Abdul Rahman did not hesistate to take immediate actions to throw out the extremist Malay Politicians whom LKY had labelled them as "Ultras".</p>
              <p>Those who were thrown out of UMNO in 1963 were Mohammed Mahathir who had written the book <em>'The Malay Dilemma'</em>  and later to become Malaysia's fifth PM, and also a Malay radical in Musa Hitam (who served recently as a Human Rights Commissioner).</p>
              <p>The other Ultras that remained in the Malaysian political scene included Syed Jaafar Albar (the father of the recent axed-Home Minister Syed Hamid Albar),  and Syed Nasir Ismail - both were accused for igniting the 1964 racial riots in Singapore.</p>
              <p>It was these tensions stoke up by the insistence of the Malay politicians demanding a singular monopoly in politics and a dominant economic role as well that caused fault lines to be deepen, and continue to this day in Malaysian politics.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>MM LKY's trip to Malaysia - at this early stage of PM Najib's taking over as the PM of Malaysia is seen by Malaysian political observers - to be an endorsement to PM Najib's position in Malaysian politics, as his position was clouded by the messy trial of the Mongolian Model murder case that remain inconclusive to this day.</p>

              <p>After this trip by LKY to Malaysia, where he will meet with members from the DAP and PAS - will there be any excuse for the PAP Government to prevent he Ministers from foreign countries visiting Singapore to meet with Singapore Polliticians from the Alternative Parties ?</p>
              <p>Race and religion has been a feature of Malaysian politics since the time when Singapore was part of Malaysia, and had remained to this day - where the Malays are allowed generous latitude to talk openly and aggressively about race and religion that offend the other ethnic groups, while harsh treatment will be meted out against anyone or any organisations not supported by those claiming to be Sons of the Soil.</p>
              <p>In comparison, politics in Singapore has "matured" somewhat in the last 52 years of One-Party domination by the PAP, in which the PAP had enforced strict and arbitrary rules that prevent any discussions that touch on race and religion that offend other ethnic or other interest groups.</p>
              <p>The Singapore "political maturity" has been reflected by the silent acceptance in the necessity to be sensitive on such issues, but has not stopped the Government itself from taking strict actions against strident religious demands by any one community that can affect or increase the faultlines in the differences amongst the ethnic groups.</p>
              <p>The paradox in the Singapore political scene is to embrace diversity but at the same time to prevent deep fault lines that separate the races - or ethnic groups when its is expressed in softer term.</p>

              <p>political landscape in our regions in Race is an unavoiable consideration. (it is a true reflection of how we are segregated by our prejudice and ignorance with the aid of govt continue segregating social engineering) so i would not apply the term "maturity", but of political realities in managing social differences.</p>
              <p>So in political realities i think he is there to twit the political players in our favour that is why i think this trip is to resurgen communicating with DAP and continue to work with  BNC maybe key to balancing the power within MY and slow down the penetrating influence from a circular govt with a symbolic monachy to a totally religious back govt.   </p>
              <p>PS: he may have already in communicating with DAP before but i guess this is a public meet up.   </p>

              <p>dear sir,allow my neutral views. (nothing personal).</p>
              <p>more of the posts here are not about his trips, but more about etc etc which has no politics values or educational in any sense.</p>
              <p>Before I go off topics -&gt; I don't really understand this trip too.</p>
              <p>Maybe, Old Lee is feeling the pulse of the people, the political climate, touching base, or etc.  As to the people he meets, I won't know the agenda 2.</p>
              <p>There are too many local political things I don't know.  Hence I come to this forum to  learn something. So pardon me, if i, poor in politics, share my two cents worth &amp; unwittingly offend any, thanks.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>I find you very shallow, if you think you are right in your arguement, standby it, dun have to seek pardon or feeling personal about it, afterall, my Uncle also dun give a damn who you are, or what you are. Lau Hero Lee go malaysia can hold many agenda, we dunno, so what for guess, but he certainly is not going there to see turtle lay eggs or eat penang laksa ai hum.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So, why worry about why he goes malaysia, just let him go, there are many agenda within both countries, can be Mas Selamat, the new bridge link, the support of his son, etc etc..Let him go, Lau Hero Lee is alway trying to do the best for singapore.</p>
