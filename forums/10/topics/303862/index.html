            <div class='col-md body'>Yup, I remember Dr Shih...<br><br>The move to shift NUS towards the more "American" model at that time was very quickly accompanied by this article talkingc0ck.com...<br><br>http://www.talkingc0ck.com/html/article.php?sid=935<br><br>(u may have to edit the URL... the forum's vulgarity shield blocks the URL cos of the word "c0ck...)<br><br>A lot of undergrads couldn't stand what he was doing to the uni... and it was totally hypocritical to want the "American" system which has a strong alumni network when they simply left undergrads to drown.<br><br>The frequent changes to the curriculum led to uncertainties on graduating requirements with some undergrads getting shortchanged... They thought it was a "double-degree" program, but it just changed so they just ended up with double-majors... lan lan lor...<br><br>Furthermore, American unis generous scholarships and funding... He's got NOTHING other than the standard tuition fee loan offered by the local banks... If u're a poor undergrad with no gov't or private scholarship, good luck! cos NUS dun pay for your fees for u, no matter how many "A"s u have...<br><br>Of course, u could fill up their stupid form, give them copies of your whole family's income tax returns to prove how friggin poor u are and hope to get a bursary...<br><br>AND!!! Lets not forget the infamous fee hikes under dear Dr. Shih... What a crook!<br><br>Dunno about other pple, but I think their frequent mailers to ask alumnis for donation is a bloody bad joke.</div>
