              <p><span style="color: #ff6600;">July 22, 2008	 <br>Coming nearer to residential areas: dorms for foreign workers <br>New dormitory sites for foreign workers may be located nearer residential areas as Singapore becomes more built up, said National Development Minister Mah Bow Tan. <br><br>In his written reply to a question from Sembawang GRC MP Lim Wee Kiak in Parliament on Monday, Mr Mah urged Singaporeans to be more understanding and accommodating as 'foreign workers are here to contribute to our economic growth.' <br><br>'We should accept their presence in our midst,' he added. <br><br>Since February 2007, he said 11 new dormitory sites, providing some 65,000 additional bed spaces, have been released. These will be completed in stages by 2010. <br><br>Among these are vacant government buildings that will be converted into transitional dorms to meet the immediate demand for dormitory facilities in the next one to two years, while more permanent dormitories are being developed. <br><br>For the new permanent dormitories, the Building and Construction Authority (BCA) and the Jurong Town Corporation (JTC) will require tenderers to provide a range of amenities within the sites. <br><br>Apart from adequate living space, they may come with facilities such as mini-marts, barber shop, remittance services, TV room and sports facilities. This will help to make the dormitories more attractive and self-contained, said Mr Mah. <br><br>'Given that Singapore is becoming more built up, it will be an increasing challenge to find suitable sites for foreign workers. Residents may find more foreign workers living in their midst, or dormitory sites located near to their premises,' he said. <br><br>'We hope that Singaporeans will be more understanding and accommodating in this aspect. Foreign workers are here to contribute to our economic growth.' <br><br>Employers and dormitory operators must also play a part in educating the foreign workers on the social norms and way of life in Singapore, and ensuring that the workers are properly housed, added Mr Mah.</span><br></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>I wonder whether Mah Bow Tan would be that gracious when workers' dormitories are built next to his house.</p>
              <p>I am annoyed that workers gather to occupy, drink and pee in our HDB void decks or near our residences.</p>
              <p>These dormitories do not provide them meeting areas to drink and meet their friends. They don't want fights in their area of monitoring. So, they passed these problems to the residential neighbours and public to monitor.</p>
              <p>If Mr Mah is that gracious, have the dormitories built near his home. Let's see whether he feels safe for his daughters.</p>

              </span></em></span></p><p><em>I
              AM saddened by recent reports of the possibility of turning the former
              Serangoon Garden South Primary School in Serangoon Gardens into living
              quarters for foreign workers.</em></p><em>
              <p>I had lived in Serangoon Gardens since I was nine months old, and it was my home for 29 years.</p>
              <p>If the plans for the foreign workers' dormitory were to go ahead, the face of Serangoon Gardens would undergo a drastic change.</p>
              <p>As a current resident of Farrer Park, I regret to say that, with the
              substantial number of foreign workers working and living in the
              neighbourhood, the area feels less safe than it used to.</p>
              <p>Loitering, littering, drunkenness, poor observance of traffic rules,
              and large gatherings in the void decks and open spaces at night are
              some of the common problems they create.</p>
              <p>I fear that this situation might arise in Serangoon Gardens once the dormitory materialises.</p>
              <p>I suggest using the land the school occupies to expand the
              neighbouring Tavistock Park; to open a new school; or to build a sports
              centre.</p>
              <p>I urge the Ministry of National Development to seriously consider
              the needs of the residents of Serangoon Gardens. Practicality must not
              always take precedence.</p>

              <p>The government has failed to assure residents that the problems created by workers living in these dormitories can be managed. Currently, there are dormitories built near residential estates. Tell us whether these residents are happy that the problems have been resolved.
