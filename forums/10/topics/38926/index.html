While they are precisely guided, nothing is perfect," the official, who asked not to be identified, said. The official said the incident was being investigated.<br><br>Tomahawks, unlike U.S. Air-Launched Cruise Missiles (ALCMs), are fired by ships and submarines. Both of the precision weapons are guided to targets by satellites.<br><br>Citing an unnamed military commander, IRNA also said that U.S. and British warplanes violated the Islamic Republic's airspace several times on Friday and Saturday during operations against targets in southern Iraq.<br><br>Tehran has not publicly accused U.S.-led forces of deliberately targeting Iran, suggesting that it considers the missiles were strays.<br><br></div>
