Jeyaretnam<br>The Prime Minster, Mr. Goh Chok Tong, has chosen not to reply to my letter of 26th January 2004.<br><br>As I said in my letter to him. I can only conclude that he was not being truthful in what he told CNN. I therefore now release my letter to him - letter follows.<br><br>I hope Mr.Goh and his colleague in the Cabinet realise that Goh's omission to clarify what he told CNN demonstrates that the government sets no store by the need for the government to appear credible at all times. it shows that it does not bother the government whether the people can trust government or not.<br><br>Signed J.B.

You realise that this is important because you have said his selection was done with transparency.<br><br>If I do not hear from you before the end of this week, I shall have no option but to conclude, as would Singaporeans, that you were just spinning a yarn to the CNN.<br><br>I reserve the right to release this letter and your reply to the public at large.<br><br>Yours faithfully,<br><br>Signed J.B.Jeyaretnam<br><br><a href="http://www.thinkcentre.org/article.cfm?ArticleID=2303" rel="nofollow">http://www.thinkcentre.org/article.cfm?ArticleID=2303</a><br></div>
