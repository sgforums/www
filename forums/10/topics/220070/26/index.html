For example, their contact details may not have been updated, they are living overseas or they simply could not be bothered to sign up.<br><br>They added that the majority of those who did not sign up for their packages are living in private properties.<br><br>As sufficient notice was given and reminder letters sent out in November, the Finance Ministry says the scheme is now closed.<br><br>But that appeals may be considered on a case-by-case basis.<br><br>The Progress Package was announced by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong in Singapore's Budget 2006 to share part of the government's surpluses with Singaporeans. - CNA /dt<br><br><span style="color: red;">With so many missing out on the package, is this scheme effective to help the poor as promised?</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The moment they first introduced GST and a lot of policy involved sucking more and more money, they are already corrupted. They pretend to be pure by wearing white but inside is dark and black. Just like Durai. Pretend to be angel but is a Satan reborn. If they are helping the poor, why more and more poor people not getting the help they needed. But instead rich people is getting more money.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>What is GST ?<br><br>Very simply,GST is to make majority pay for fat profits to corporates and highly paid professional, because of their greed drive them to choose singapore, among hong kong and shanghai, as their operation base or place to work.<br><br>If you are still working, your choices are: whether want to part your money as usual, to spend less, or to spend in JB and some say in Batam.<br><br>If you are not working, no luck in 4D that is literally means transferng your saving to the pocket of these minority. If worst come to the worst, your might need to consider living in  JB and some say in Batam.<br><br>Why can't the garman spend less, not to purchase pricey stuffs, in order to absord the would-be GST gain.<br><br></div>
