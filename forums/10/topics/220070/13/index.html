            <div class='col-md body'>Taken from talkingcock.com<br><br>Ministers to Get Pay Rise to Help Lower Income Groups<br>Posted on Monday, November 13, 2006<br>Topic: Politics<br>Politics<br>by K.K. Cheow<br><br>Besides raising GST, SingaporeÂ’s Ministers intend to raise their own pay in order to help lower income Singaporeans.<br><br>Â“The country needs more money for social measures like education, housing and health care for peasaÂ… I mean, lower income workers,Â” said Ministry of Elitism spokesman Louie Chin Ooh Lui. Â“So if Ministers get more pay, then we will be able to spend more money in the economy, and that will trickle down to help the peasaÂ… sorry, sorry, lower income workers.Â”<br><br>Mr. Chin said that the Ministerial pay rise would contribute to all sectors of the economy. Â“For example, it will definitely benefit the airline industry as Ministers will now have more money to afford an overseas education for their kids, and their families will definitely travel more to visit them. They will also buy more luxury cars, which will benefit the automotive sector, and also the chauffeur industry. By traveling more in cars, they will also contribute more ERP charges, thus benefiting the countryÂ’s land transport policies. They will also take up more country club memberships, thus providing more employment opportunities for peasaÂ… you know who I mean. If Ministers get paid more, every Singaporean benefits.Â”<br><br>In other news, many Singaporeans agree with PM LeeÂ’s characterization of the government as 'high quality but cheap' despite Singaporean Ministers having the highest salaries of any government in the world.<br><br>Said Bukit Buttocks resident, Kiam Siap Kui, Â“Look at how much money they give us back in exchange for supporting their million dollar lifestyles. Of course theyÂ’re cheap, lah!Â”<br><br>In completely unrelated news, TalkingCock.com believes that the current crop of sceptical analyses in the States Times about the changes proposed by the newly Democratic US Congress has absolutely nothing to do with President Bush's impending visit to Singapore this week. Really. Uh-huh. Swear. Guarantee plus chop plus two year warranty.</div>

They do that sometimes. Damn you reporters!!<br>I want you to cut and paste the full transcript!!<br><br>Anyway, distortion is the common termlah when talking about the transfer of information.
