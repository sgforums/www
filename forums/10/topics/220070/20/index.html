            <div class='col-md body'>According to the logic of MP Mah Broke Tan, residents of Potong Pasir &amp; Hougang are not entitled to upgrading as they did not vote for the PAP. (i.e. Don't vote PAP, no "goodies" for you).<br><br>Thus, in accordance with the above logic, shouldn't I and the rest of the patriotic 33.3% be exempted from the GST hike since we did not vote for the PAP???<br><br>Rob the poor to pay the destitute, what an ingenious suggestion. If our top brass elite uncaring Ministers are paid million dollar salaries to come up with such brillant policies and ideas....then why not fire all of them and hire us 33.3% to replace them.
