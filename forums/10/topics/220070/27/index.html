Even if you change the figures, the fact still remains as the Rich get Richer and the Poor gets Poorer.<br><br>Example 1<br>In 2006, if after rebates etc and your net taxable income is $60,000 , the income tax you need to pay is $2,700 (8.75%).

If you spend $800 a month on needed goods and services, the GST paid for 5% will be $480 Total=$667.50 in Tax paid.<br><br>In 2007, if after rebates etc and your net taxable income is $25,000, the income tax you need to pay is $175 (3.5%).

So correct me if I am wrong, but example 2 is not correct. Assuming income tax wasn't reduced, then the person in example 2 would be paying 61,650 + 3,360 = 65,010, which is an effective increase of 1.5% (over 64,050.00 when GST was 5%). Still, becoz the rich earns so much, the increase in cost of living is negligible to them, though in real money terms, they have to pay more.<br><br>Anyway, percentages are all but a numbers game. Present the appropriate numbers to prove your point ("only 2% GST increase, so don't worry", and you see a few pro-PAP people whom can tell you its only 2%, nothing much, when they are also being eaten alive by the policies)<br><br>In my research work in the past, I realized that there are SO MANY ways of looking at the same set of numbers, that you need only pick the ones that are most beneficial to you, and present them to your examiner.<br><br>Similarly, our govt practises the same tactics. Select the facts, and only show those that are most beneficial to them. So they never lied to you. Just that they never show you the negative aspects of their decisions.<br><br>And at the end of the day, who suffers most? The poor and the middle class. But most of us are ignorant to such high-level tactics anyway, or are too blinded by those small little carrots to see thru the tactics, that we just take it and still happily laugh while being eaten alive (read: 66% of the population who voted). So who is at fault? Not the govt, but US, the silly population.<br><br>I have many friends from other nationalities, and I always hear the same thing. "You singaporeans complain and complain and complain, but at the end, when the difference can be made during the elections, you guys chicken out and vote in the people you don't like. So who to blame? Yourselves. Can only blame yourselves for being stupid and cowardly".</div>

What's the meaning of P.Q.R.S.T.U. to you?<br><br>While similar in form to other governments in Western Europe, the Swedish state is among the most generous in the scope of government services provided. These include tax-funded childcare, parental leave, a ceiling on health care costs, tax-funded education (all levels up to, and including university), retirement pensions, tax-funded dental care up to 20 years of age and sick leave (partly paid by the employer). Parents are entitled to a total of 480 days partly paid leave between birth and the child's eighth birthday, with 60 days reserved specifically for each parent, in effect providing the father with two so-called "daddy-months". The ceiling on health care costs makes it easier, relative to other nations, for Swedish workers to take time off for medical reasons.<br><br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden<br><br></div>

Plus, they are tangibles and not something wrapped up in tonnes of red tape and don't feel as if they are some half hearted attempt to convince people to procreate. Never mind that the Swedish still turn in a surplus in their economy from time to time. Never mind that the Swedish enjoy a dynamic economy and what not.</div>
