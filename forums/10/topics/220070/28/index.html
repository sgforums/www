            <div class='col-md body'>An interesting paragraph from a book.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Abstract from Economics of the Public Sector by Joseph E. Stiglitz:</span> </strong><br><br>Government's ability to compel individuals' support of public goods, however, may also enable it to compel individuals' support of special interest groups: it can force one group to give up its resources to another group. Such forced transfers have been likened to theft, with one major difference: Transfers through the government wear the mantle of legality and respectability conferred upon them by the political process. <span style="color: blue;">When political process in a country becomes detached from the citizenry and is used to transfer resources to the groups in power, the distinction between taxation and theft becomes blurred at best.</span><br><br>These issues were of critical concern to the founders of the United States. The rebellion that became the Revolutionary War is often dated to the Boston Tea Party, which was motivated by the conviction that unjust taxes were being levied on the colonies. The slogan <span style="color: blue;">"Taxation without representation is tyranny"</span> provided one of the central motifs of the revolution. Distinguishing between the legitimate and illegitimate uses of the power of taxation is a matter of continual contention.</div>

They're just always saying and doing things for the sake of so....<br><br>Because GST was originally 5%. Increasing it directly to 10% (2 times) would definitely cause too many uproars. So they re-deploy what they did for the 3% to 5%. They make it 7%. Probably so that they can use the reason for 'convenience' sake, mark it up to 10%. It's like giving you one direct stab or cutting the dagger into you bit by bit... Everything's probably planned and systematically lay out.<br><br>Telling people that Singapore need more $ and reserve, increase GST. Then yet on the other hand, pulling out the $ supposingly for 'reserve' to become part of ever-increasing absurd pay. At the same time throwing peanuts at the bottom rank civil servants so that the public's anger would be at those poor chaps instead of the top cream. Because that's the lousy mentality of most Singaporeans. When they can't 'hantum' people at the top, they just anyhow 'hantum' people at the bottom. That's why they're on top. Watch clowns stab each other at the bottom... By the time they're truly rich and powerful enough, it won't matter what the people say... With the kinda money, they'll be most welcomed in many places in the world.<br><br>It's just like starting casino and telling people that they're watching over and taking precautionary steps against it... They've already well anticipated that it'll become a social problem. As usual, these are just 'buffers' to minimise anger display. They've long knew that gambling can be a great source of income for them. Just look at Singapore Pool and Singapore turf club. Look at the 4Ds, Toto and Big Sweeps.... You think these are regulatory controls?</div>

NOBODY can safely say if they work hard enough now, they'll be guaranteed a certain level of retirement in the future.... Just look at the older generations after they've contributed... You plan, invest and save for your retirement now... Do you know how much tax you might be paying in the future to keep up...? Can you even foresee...?
