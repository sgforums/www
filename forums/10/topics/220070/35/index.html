It made me laugh when he told me that.<br><br>2 of my friends, SIA cadets, have become really cheesed off with the govt for not heeding public sentiments about their pay hike. However, they tell me that they will still vote PAP the next elections. Can't blame them at all.<br><br>This is the dot com era, no longer the time where we get info from only newspapers, TV and radio. The pre-65ers have staunch support for the PAP but certainly not mine (post 65ers). We are of the savvy generation who thirst for the truth, rather than be force fed.<br><br>66.6%? Oh my. Remember how Lim Boon Heng said that an 80% mandate from AMK GRC would not be an issue? Look what happened as a result of disconnection from the masses. There was the Progress Package back then. If no progress package, lower "mandate" even? LOL.<br><br></div></blockquote>Support through fear instead of respect is a very risky type of support. The fundamentals are weak.<br><br>All tyrants get overthrown sooner or later. Perhaps not the 1st generation, but the next generation or later, the leaders get overrun.<br><br>I esp find it so funny that what is reported in the news, is almost not reflective of the grounds.<br><br>When I was young, I thought the truth is the truth, how can you bend the truth?<br><br>Now, I find it most interesting of how reports can be so disconnected from reality. I also realized that there are many blind people out there whom are not physically blind.<br><br>The Matrix and V for Vendetta reflects much of this, and much of the ideals in these films looks so applicable for the current Singapore society.</div>
