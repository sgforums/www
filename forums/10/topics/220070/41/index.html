Those few claims that your provided his 'article' or 'fact' lacks quality in substantiation as the example in point (7) demonstrates<br><br>5) Declared hawkers are POOR people, and now does not have the guts to face up to your own claims<br><br>6) Declared that our Poor has TVs, refrigerators, air cons, flat screen TVs, with NO EVIDENCE whatsoever to backup your claims<br><br>7) Declared that US politicians are much much richer than our ministers with the below example (and this is so funny):<br>-&gt; Clinton is earning millions with his talks<br>When in fact, the following are the cold hard truths to you:<br>-&gt; You DO NOT KNOW how much Clinton truly earns<br>-&gt; You think Clinton is a politician, when in fact, he is now an EX-POLITICIAN<br><br>8 ) Can't decide between people who leave = soft, or people who leave = smart and Singapore should bring back.<br></div>
