Redistribution of income means taking the higher income of citizens and redistributing it to the poor of society. The redistribution may be in the form of medical benefits (paying less or not paying any medical fees), provision of public housing for the poor through subsidies, giving out food coupons for the poor, provision of free education, etc. Else the poor who do not make enough might not receive a basic form of sustenance (medical, education, etc).[/quote]<br>yeah, welfare state.

These countries have existed long before Singapore, they continue to do well, with strong GDPs and good surpluses, yet they provide welfare for the common folks.<br><br>BTW, our resources are our people. In case you don't understand basic business concepts, it's the valuing adding feature of our workforce that contributes to the GDP of our nation. Resources mean very little if they have not been processed into their final commodity. eg How much is silicon (sand) use in the fabrication of computer chips cost? A barrel of non processed crude oil cost US$50-60 (there are 160 litres of crude oil in a barrel), the final product gasoline S$1.70 to S$1.90 per litre and byproduct diesel $1.17 per litre. Even expensive crude oil, the commodity that made middle eastern countries rich are a fraction the cost of it's final product gasoline.<br><br>These days, the cost of a product is based on the technology contained within. Even products like medication, the cost to produce is low compared to the research that goes into it. Mr. R. V.

I don't see Mat Toro there. I hope you explanation is not going to be like, "because they increase the GST, that's why investments will go up". An "explanation" like this hardly explain the mechanics of the issue.<br></div>

In UK healthcare is free, so it's more forgiving to wait! In Singapore, you are paying for healthcare services, yet you have to wait 3 months to see the doctor.<br><br>Turning off lights?

Why should we have higher income and corporate tax NOW if we don't increase GST? What is the main purpose to increase GST, would you mind telling me further?
