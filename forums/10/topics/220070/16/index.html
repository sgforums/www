Even in my last year as president, I was still not being informed about some ministerial procedures. For example, in April last year, the government said it would allow the sale of the Post Office Savings Bank POSB to DBS Bank. In the past, when there was no elected president, they could just proceed with this kind of thing. But when there is an elected president you cannot, because the POSB is a statutory board whose reserves are to be protected by the president. You cannot just announce this without informing him. But I came to know of it from the newspaper. That is not quite right. Not only that, but they were even going to submit a bill to parliament for this sale and to dissolve the POSB without first informing me.</blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>An application of some 'Robin Hood' chivalry from Sherwood Forest? But first you need to spend ...<br><br>Maybe one can consider the significance of the 'safety net - 2% gst increase' this way ...<br><br>The average household expenditure is the key to understanding the 'social safety nets' from the 2% GST increase. The other component is demographics.<br><br>Its true that the 2% gst increase is going to affect every consumer (personal or industrial) at all levels ie low-spending, mid-spending or high-spending.<br><br>By the law of averages, peppered with a touch of randomness, the amount of total gst collected will go up probably quite linearly by at least 2%, maybe up to 20% if you consider to include cases of 'non-linearly' increases in some B2C or B2B2C industries.<br><br>If you just consider the 2% increase, what you can get is a very big pot of money. I do not know what the total yearly consumer spending of Singapore is. Say X dollars. I am guessing maybe $12 Billion (churned out like this: $500 per month, 2M (households), 12 months). 2% of that would be a cool $240M.<br><br>The eventual figure by way of the 2% GST increase would be much much more than $240M. I am guessing maybe $1B.<br><br>Now the trick is knowing how many households are categorised as under the safety net. Name a figure ... 10,000 households?. Offer $1k to them*, it will only knock $10M off the first figure of $240M, a percentage point of bout 4.2%. For $1B, it woud be 1%. You can extrapolate that for a larger net of needy households.<br><br>The remaining 95.8% of $240M or 99% of $1B ... goes into reserves, more investments, infrastructure, creating jobs, future thinking ...<br><br>One of the many applications of the Robin Hood economic models ... just an exercise for casual reading ...<br><br>* Households spending $500 monthly incurs a $10 more GST (2% increase); $120 a year. So a safety net package of $1k a year is 8.3 times more than what's put upfront in $120.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Everyone have to "pay a price" for voting them. The goverment pay should be lower to help lower income people. When bus fare increased, they say the increased is affordable. GST, electric, medical increased always say affordable because they earn the most. To them they are very affordable, in their small bird eye view. I am so sad, pityful and grateful to the man who die in the MRT, if not for him, people still thought that  the bill, cost of living will always be affordable by poor people, and thought the goverment is so eager helping the poor, whereby there is a lot barrier when poor people getting help from government. what reason is that to increase GST to help the poor.

Raise here , raise there. Becuz they know ppl in SG only whine and get over it. So they bochup and the story just goes on.<br><br>I tell u, can you imagine if SG is given a scenario like Taiwan who wanna bring their president down. Protest here and there. You always tell us dont take SG for granted, safe place, no calamity... blah blah blah...
