            <div class='col-md body'>I refer you guys to the Recruit section as well<br><br>every few weeks, there will be one portion that is advertising for experienced people with &lt; 2 years exp to join a graduate programme sponsored by EDB in a certain research sector.<br><br>Thereafter, they are to work in a research institution for 2 years.<br><br>The sponsorship is for Singaporeans and PRs only.<br><br>You can read it as too few locals joining research or there is a demand for such programmes that EDB is sponsoring.<br><br>Judging from the fact that the sponsorship is continuing, I tend to believe that the demand is there, and that's why the programmes are still on.</div>
