            <div class='col-md body'>Here is my take on this GST issue. Please give me your thought about this.<br><br>If we look at the history of taxes, be it corporate tax and individual tax rates, there has been a significant drop of taxes being charged. This can give you a better idea about it.<br><br>Individual tax rates<br><a href="http://www.iras.gov.sg/ESVPortal/iit/iit-se-a1.1.15+tax+rates+for+resident+individuals.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.iras.gov.sg/ESVPortal/iit/iit-se-a1.1.15+tax+rates+for+resident+individuals.asp</a><br><br>Corporate tax rates<br><a href="http://www.iras.gov.sg/ESVPortal/ct/ct_b.2.2_what+are+the+tax+rates.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.iras.gov.sg/ESVPortal/ct/ct_b.2.2_what+are+the+tax+rates.asp</a><br><br>As you can see from the rates above, both tax rates has dropped significantly, with indivdual drop from the first $7500 at 2% to the first $20,000 at 0% and corporate tax drop from 40% to the current 20%.<br><br>Now lets look into the system of taxation for individuals. For those who knows a little bit about tax would realise that it is a system to tax the rich more then the poor. In another words, the government according to this tax system wants to shorten the gap between the poor and the rich.<br><br>Another minor example would be the government gave rebates on utilities for those who stay 3 room flat and below. Help the poor and let the rich pay for the utilities.<br><br>With the GST introduced, the general impact will be minimal to the company as they can choose to register as a GST trader. Therefore, the government is very much trying to promote a better environment to for the company to grow and become competitive especially when the gov is saying that there might be a decrease with the corporate tax further. With this in mind, in an environmentally friendly for company would push the economy to greater heights and thus giving the people more job prospects and better financial backing in the long run. With this in place, the government must train and educate everyone to make sure everyone can reap profit from this in which they are currently doing.  I shall not touch on the issue with inflation and such for now.<br><br>Thus, the main impact on GST will definitely be to the consumers - Citizen of Singapore. This is very different from the direction that the government would like to foster - tax the rich and not the poor. This is because GST affects everyone! From the poor to the rich. I would agree that the GST will definitely affect the poor more than the rich in terms of percentage on the spendings of necesities.  But if we were to take a step back and see, the rich definitely spends more than the poor and therefore, they will definitely pay more GST to the government.<br><br>The main primary concern now is that the poor, with the rising price (due to inflation) and the increase of GST might just be another blow to them. They might even suffer as their financial strenght is already limited. Now, the government has promised to help them. Should they be able to help them effectively will be the primary factor to make this entire system works. For now, we could only suspect and question on how well are they able to perform in this area.<br><br>In my conclusion, with the GST increase is to help the corporate world grow and people get more jobs (better pay?). As the poor will suffer the most, the government has promised to help them. The question is how well can they help especially when there is an inflation.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Folks,<br><br>Everyday, during lunch with my peers, we talk about GST, Football, Toto, etc.<br><br>End of the day, you buy yourself a Toto dream for $1, but what is the real catch?  Hoping to achieve financial freedom.<br><br>Even GST goes up to 7% but end consumer paying a cup of coffee from current $0.90 to $1, that is 10% increase, it is still normal.  Nothing you can do to overcome but wait for your yearly salary and bonus to increase. Hopefully more than 7%?  Fat hope!<br><br>That's life.  Move on and work on more practical stuff!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Somehow I do agree somewhat with bangkokboy.  This forum simply represents an outlet for us since we have not much way to change things now.<br><br>Let's face it.  This is S'pore and it works like this: Once a political party has been voted in, we will have to live with whatever policies that it is going to introduce for the next 5 year.<br><br>The world is much more globalised now and so is the job market as compared to say, 20-30 years back.  The difference is that we can either take it, or like the Scandinavian guy who was critical of his govt, leave to get a job somewhere else.<br><br>Many S'poreans have done it or are already doing it.  We often see the ST Forum publishing the letters of returning S'poreans (for whatever reasons) who say that those who stayed behind in S'pore are lucky and should be fortunate that we have a very good place to live in.  Unfortunately, we see very few ST Forum articles (maybe even none?) talking about ex-S'poreans or even S'poreans who come back and start to say that their host country they stayed is much better than S'pore.<br><br>Nevertheless, I think most pple who are online in this Forum should be well-informed either from friends or otherwise to make their own choice even though the Govt (maybe the press too?)  may be strongly encouraging you (as people is S'pore only precious resources) that this is indeed the best place for you.<br><br>My take is that S'pore is a good place to let your children have education and grow up in (up to a certain level).  For university onwards, it may be better for the children to experience a different environment.</div>
