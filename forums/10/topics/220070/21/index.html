            <div class='col-md body'>saw this on a blog...<br><br>ANNUAL BUDGET STATEMENT, 2002 May 15<br><br>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong: Thank you, Mr Speaker, Sir, for allowing me to join in this debate. I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister for his maiden Budget Statement. There are several proposals that I support. However, there are also some concerns that I would like to take this opportunity to raise.<br><br>First, like several other MPs yesterday, I want to talk about the impact of the GST on the poor and the ageing Singaporean workers. Second, I disagree with cuts in the top marginal personal income tax as a means for promoting business. Third, the corporate tax cut is not bold enough to increase 's competitiveness. Fourth, as moves towards greater indirect taxation, the anticipated impact of future GST increases should warrant exemption of essential goods and services from this tax. Last but not least, I support Prof. Chin's call on the Government to use the funds collected from the additional COEs to help HDB cover its car park building cost.<br><br>As I study the impact in detail, I become more and more convinced that these Budget changes and the recommendations of the ERC are from the rich, by the rich and for the rich - to make the rich even richer. The income gap between the talented and the workers is going to widen drastically. More has to be done to help the poor, the unskilled and the untalented to cope with this rising wealth gap. Otherwise, in our effort to rebuild our economy, the social cohesion and fabric of our society will risk being threatened and crumble in the long run, leading to detrimental results.<br><br>It is quite certain that after the five years of offset measures, the lower income and the ageing workers will become poorer, especially for the ageing workers who had been paying taxes in their younger days. Over the last 30 years of nation building, they had contributed in their own ways to help build into this developed society. They, the older workers, are retiring soon, or some of them have already retired. But they are going to continue to face paying GST right up to their deathbeds and even into their coffins.<br><br>This is not right. The Government should look into how it can waive the GST completely for the retirees and senior citizens. They have done their share of duty to serve the country. We should recognise their contribution and exempt them from this tax burden in their twilight years. The Government may have recognised this problem and adjusted the pension allowance for retired civil servants. But how about many other retirees and blue collar workers from the private sector? I believe the Government can do a lot more for this generation of nation building senior citizens not from the civil service too.<br><br>Next, coming to cuts in top-end personal income tax to 20%, I do not think that this is a useful move. The Minister had argued for a significant reduction as a means to attract international talents to work in and help create more jobs. Is that equation really that simple? I do not think so. I believe that talented high-income earners will not just flock to because of the lower individual tax rate. In any way, 20% is not attractive enough compared to other countries like . They will consider the total package. Factors like pay compensations, a more conducive living environment, cultural adaptations and other examples of cost of living, like car ownerships, will play a bigger consideration than simple tax cuts. If they have to spend more of what they earn by paying more indirect taxes, like higher liquor charges and car costs, then they will not be interested to come to in the first place. These talents are not stupid. It does not make sense for them to save on direct personal income taxes but pay a bomb to own a branded car or a pigeon hole in the sky.<br><br>Taxes are taxes, direct or indirect, it is cash outflow from the individual to the Government - be it income tax, GST, ERP, COEs or fees, it still adds to the Government's coffers. Therefore, we need more than personal income tax cuts to encourage talents here to help spur our economic activity and entrepreneurship. If the Government is genuine in wanting to encourage entrepreneurship through tax reductions, then it should consider waiving the tax liability of start-up business persons in the initial few years until their business is more stable and profitable. A larger "entrepreneurship income tax relief" can be introduced to help start-up smaller businessmen. It will definitely be more helpful than the top-end cut of 6% for already successful high income earners. Any tax waivers or rebates given to a new start-up business person will definitely help to plough back to help their business grow more and survive.<br><br>How many entrepreneurs just starting out can make disposable income of more than $320,000 a year to qualify for the 6% cut in personal income tax? Not many! I personally do not know of any. Maybe the Government can give us some examples of which entrepreneur has achieved this. This will help more Singaporeans to emulate their success. Incidentally, not all high income earners are entrepreneurs. Many in happen to be working in the Government service. It is clear that they will be one of the greatest beneficiaries of this tax cut. They earn very high income with zero risk of business failure attached.<br><br>But for the private sector, I wholly support the cut in the corporate income tax. However, I feel that this ERC proposal is not bold enough. If countries like , as cited, can reduce its corporate income tax from 40% to 25% in one year, we can do better than the miserable 4.5% cut over two years. We can be a lot bolder in cutting corporate income tax to keep us ahead of the competition. When a company has more retained profits, it will be bolder in employing more people, thus helping to create more jobs and helping the economy. If foreign companies intend to take advantage of this lower tax benefit and relocate to Singapore, their employees will have no choice but to move here too or they will face retrenchment back home in their country. There is no need for us to cut the top marginal personal income tax rate just to attract these companies to come over here.<br><br>The Government should save on cutting top marginal personal income tax for the rich. By doing so, the Government will save $620 million every year. This saving can be used to offset a bigger and bolder cut in the corporate tax rate than the 2.5% recommended.<br><br>Mr Speaker, Sir, I will now move on to talk about GST. Many speakers here have talked about the effects of the increase in the GST rate and have asked to delay its implementation. There is also a suggestion that certain items be exempted from GST. The Government has said no. Like many Singaporeans, I do not understand why the Government is so unwilling to exempt essential staples from GST. If the Minister finds it so difficult to decide what items to exempt from GST, be it sushi, fish or rice, then may I suggest that the Ministry of Finance send an investigative delegation to other developed countries with GST exemptions on these essential goods and services and study how these countries do it.<br><br>If these countries and some states like in the can have a system where certain essential goods like rice, oil, sugar, salt, meat, vegetables, fish, etc, or services can be exempted from GST, I do not see what is so difficult about implementing it in . Where there is a will, there is sure to be a way, unless it is the Government's intention to raise as much revenue as possible from GST. If so, I have nothing to say. If not, I will give one very good reason why these essential goods and services should be exempted from GST.<br><br>Currently, the GST rate stands at 3%. Come January, it will be increased to 5%. Five years later, maybe after the next general election, it may again be raised, perhaps to 7%, 9% or even 12%. I do not know how much higher it can go, but I am very certain that every percentage increase is going to affect everyone, but more so for the lower income, the poor, the unemployed and the retired.<br><br>When GST is all-encompassing and raised even higher, it is going to make living in more miserable and create greater social inequality, resulting in resentment to Government institutions. Citizens need to eat and drink to live and survive. It will become unbearable for less well-off citizens just continuing to eke out an existence here. Their lives will become more miserable as they have less purchasing power.<br><br>Looking at the trend, I am quite certain that there are going to be more cuts in the personal income and corporate tax rates in the future. To make up for this revenue loss, it is certain that the Government is going to raise GST even higher.<br><br>So before this GST is increased to 5%, 7%, 9% or even higher in future, I hope the Government can plan ahead and institute a system to exempt certain essential staple items from GST. Do not wait until there is great social discontent to do it.<br><br>Once such a system is institutionalised, any future increase in GST to a very high level will not cause severe hardship and political ramifications. Those who find that the tax on sushi is too high can still opt to buy plain rice and fish, with the option of not going hungry just to save on GST. The freedom of choice is there and this is very important.<br><br>Mr Speaker, Sir, as we progress into this developed world, let us work together towards a kinder and more caring society. Let us not subject our lower and middle income citizens and our aging community to more stress, hardships and taxes.<br><br>At my Party constituency walkabout in Jurong West two Sundays ago, I spoke to a senior citizen who said to me, "Given a choice, I would rather return all the ERS shares and rebates to the Government if I have the option to be exempted from GST. These rebates and grants are short-term measures to ease our pain, but GST is going to stay with me till I go to my grave. I would rather not have it. I paid taxes when I was young and working. Now I am old, unemployed and waiting to die, and I still have to pay taxes. This is unfair."<br><br>Mr Speaker, Sir, I hope the Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister can take the words of this old man into due consideration and look into how retired senior citizens and the lower income can be exempted from the effects of GST. I believe that the most efficient and equitable way is to identify a list of these essential items and exclude it from tax. If it is so easy for NTUC Fairprice to produce a list of such staple items and absorb the GST increase, I believe the Ministry of Finance can do a lot better than a blanket no.<br><br>Finally, Sir, I want to talk about car usage and car parking. If we want to allow more Singaporeans to own cars but encourage them to use it less often, then we must have incentives to encourage them to keep it stationary, ie, not to drive it. Increasing car parking charges is definitely not an incentive.<br><br>To the car owners, whether it is money paid to HDB, URA, LTA or the Ministry of Finance, it is still money going to the Government. The Government should consider the total revenue it collects from cars and look into subsidising some of these loss-making departments within the Ministry that help to solve and regulate car usage.<br><br>We cannot expect every department in the Ministry to be always profitable. There will always be some departments that cannot. If every department in the Ministry must be profitable, if HDB has to build car parks and make them profitable or at least break even while other ministries make a lot from COE, then it can only mean one thing, ie, our citizens will become poorer and poorer through all these taxes. I hope the Government will not insist that every Government service must be able to recover cost.<br><br>Steve Chia</div>
