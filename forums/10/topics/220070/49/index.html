              <p>There has been too much hype about the need to reduce
                                      corporate taxes in order to attract investors. While to a certain
                                      degree higher income tax may deter investments but it cannot simply be solved by replacing income tax with GST.</p>
              <p>Does the government really understand that higher GST deter consumption and many
                                      companies at the end may pay just as high taxes overall due to
                                      paying too much taxes on process materials or resources before they
                                      even produce the final marketable product<br> <br> So it is just as bad as high income tax if GST is raised too high
                                      to replace income tax. Companies will not be attracted here also if
                                      income tax is low while GST is high as there will be reduced
                                      consumption here because GST will deter consumption. Under a
                                      high-GST economy, companies will therefore try to import as little
                                      raw materials or semi-processed materials as they will have to pay
                                      GST on these materials which incur higher operating costs as much
                                      as paying higher income taxes.<br> <br> It will come back to square one if our ministers fail to understand
                                      the trade off of GST and instead insist on raising GST. If they are
                                      our true talents let them show us they understand at least such
                                      problems in greater depth and perspective.</p>

              <p>For num 1 objection, GST does not really shift tax burden from rich to poor or poor to rich. What will happen is the poor's spending on goods will not decrease much because they buy mostly the necessities, whereas for the rich, they will tend to buy more luxury goods. This is a tax on usage of money; the more you spend, the more you are taxed. The 'shifting' of the burden from the poor to the rich happens if and only if the government is active in redistributing the taxes through money packages, which they have been actively doing thus far. However, how long they will do this is up to question</p>
              <p>For num 2 objection, according to my recent research (but I've no source), for most major manufacturing companies, the selling price of their products exceeds the cost of materials and and resources for producing them by 200% or more. To these companies, a 2% rise in GST will not account for too much expenses. However, the same could not be applied to small and medium businesses, of which most are opened by Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>For objection num 3, it may, on first look, affect demand. However, by redistributing the taxes to the poor, their total income would have increased. By putting money back to people's hand, more spending from the lower and middle income group could be expected. To the rich however, we can expect that 2% rise might not be much of an impact considering that their income rise is most likely higher than 2%. Total expenditure of the economy might even increase.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However, there are some parts I won't agree with GST hike and packages for redistribution.<br>1) Our spendings from the GST package will be affected by GST again, effectively taking back 7% of what they have given us.</p>
              <p>2) There are many other ways to get the more taxes from the rich without resorting to GST. Just look at the 6 billion surplus =&gt; is GST thus necessary supposing that none of this 6 billion came from the 2% hike (all were supposedly returned to the people through packages)</p>

              <p>No, I am not from youngpap though I have once contacted youngpap asking to be granted permission to participate in its policy debates. In other words, I am prepared to debate PAP policies. My application of course was turned down probably because PAP was less than sincere in its earlier announcement that it welcomed non-conformist people to join them. As it turned out I was asked to join PAP first before I could do so. I said forget it and did not take up the offer.</p>

              <p>This is partly possible because of tax revenues from overpriced luxury goods like cigarettes, sports cars, beers, condoms, ... the things consumed usually by bad people. So the gov is transferring money from rich,evil people to poor,good students with ambitions.  This technique will be greatly amplified when the casinos are completed.</p>
