The reasons are the few factors below:<br>1) hawkers cannot claim back GST from the govt, and have to incur any GST raises from their suppliers as costs. They would then build this into their prices to cover their costs. I don't call this GST profiteering. Its just normal business sense to cover costs<br>2) its almost impossible for a hawker to raise price by 2% given the lower prices of their items. So,they increase by at least 10 cents to 50 cents.<br><br>In comparison, prices of most goods such as electronics or luxury products, mostly should increase by only 2%, given the following factors:<br>1) 2% of a huge amount is easier to add to the price, coz you don't deal with cents at this level, and rounding it up by 10cents or 50cents has lesser impact to the buyer<br>2) These retailers can claim GST back from govt.<br><br>Given the above, what one can see is that, the poor is the MOST AFFECTED, coz the poor depends on hawker food for their meals. And the impact is not 2%.<br><br>So how can GST increase help the poor? hmm...</div>
