            <div class='col-md body'>The government has decided to turn its attention on the poor and various schemes will be announced shortly to assist the poorest strata of society. But that assistance will come at a price: how can we fund it?<br><br>Direct taxation through corporate taxes and higher income tax will not work. With our competitors like Hong Kong planning to cut their already low corporate tax, Singapore will lose out if we tax corporations more. Businesses can and will move their investments and jobs elsewhere. Income tax will not work either. We cannot tax the poor that we intend to help and a large proportion of the middle class pays little to no income tax, after various deductions. That shifts the income tax burden to the high-income earners, who already shoulder a disproportionate portion of the income tax revenue. High income earners have options in the globalised world. They can move their businesses and skills somewhere else if we tax them too much, as the above letter from a foreigner  illustrates. One reason I turned down job offers in the UK is the much higher taxes I have to pay there. Increasing income tax will drive away the very people who contribute the bulk of the nation's income tax revenue and is self-defeating.<br><br>Raising funds through GST is the compromise. The poor with their lower spending power will spend less on items that attract GST (only companies with an annual turnover of 1 million collect GST). The housewife who buys a blouse in the wet market will not pay GST, buying it in the supermarket will. If you spend less and stick to cheaper goods provided by hawkers and small businesses, you pay less GST. If you are poor and insist on smoking, you have yourself to blame for paying more taxes. The Health Minister has already assured Singaporeans that he will waive the GST increase for subsidised patients, so the poor will not suffer on that account.<br><br>If Singaporeans are truly interested in helping the poor, they must see the GST hike as their contribution to help the poor in society.<br><br>The national reserves are essential as a buffer in times of economic downturn, which will come about inevitably. Healthcare costs will still rise during such times and the government will have to draw on it to fund such services and avoid having to raise prices during market downturns. Depleting our reserves during times of plenty is irresponsible and short-sighted.<br><br></div>
