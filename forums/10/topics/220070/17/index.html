This comes up to some $30 million each year.<br><br>Explaining why GST has to go up, as announced by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on Monday, Mr Khaw said that the current spending of 4 per cent of Singapore's Gross Domestic Product on healthcare services will have to go up with an ageing population in sight. The increase, he said, would have to come from all stakeholders and this is part of the reason why GST has to be increased.<br><br>Mr Khaw also said that he would apply to the MOF for top-ups to Medifund and Eldercare Fund as he does every budget cycle.<br><br>These moves are mainly to cater to the ageing population as Singapore's elderly number burgeons. Currently, those over 65 make up less than 8 per cent of Singapore's population. By 2030 however, it will be 18 per cent.<br><br>Despite this, information on elderly care services is "incomplete and hazy".<br><br>"Patients do not know the full range of step-down care choices that are available to them," acknowledged Mr Khaw, on a topic he touched on at length in an interview with Today last week. "Some feel that they are stuck with no option other than their current provider."<br><br>He added: "We do not know if our range of step-down care services is comprehensive enough. Are there gaps? Are there niche services which are absent today but can usefully meet a real need?"<br><br>The MOH will work with other ministries to ensure that care needs of the elderly are adequately met, he said.<br><br>The ministry is also looking into extending the policy of differential subsidies among citizens, permanent residents and foreigners in hospitals, after its implementation in polyclinics last year, Mr Khaw added. - TODAY/fa</div>

Salary hasn't increased that much, and we have to pay more," comments banker Koon Sik.<br><br>"Perhaps we should waive GST for medical services and purchases of say pharmaceutical products, because a lot of the elderly have problems paying for those necessities," says Eileen Phua, a finance manager.<br><br>Many agree the offset package to cushion the impact of the GST increase among the needy will go some way to ease financial hardship.<br><br>Economist Jason Lee says: "It's not the first time they are giving out assistance measures. They've done it with the Progress Package and so forth, so I am sure it will have its intended effect."<br><br>Still, political watchers warn such offset packages must not encourage a crutch mentality among lower income Singaporeans.<br><br>The real challenge is in helping them cope with the demands of globalisation.<br><br>The government too, has to walk the talk.<br><br>Eugene Tan, Assistant Professor at Lee Kong Chian School of Business, SMU says: "There should be this commitment that the increments resulting from GST, the revenue increment, will actually go towards strengthening of the social safety net. And I would like to see the government also putting in an equivalent amount from its budget.<br><br>"You want to see the accountability and I think when people understand where their taxes are going, they will be more persuaded that this is indeed a move that benefits society."<br><br>Analysts say the move represents a shift in the social compact to one where the more well-off citizens take care of less fortunate ones.<br><br>But they hope the interest of the middleclass will be considered, as a rise in the cost of living will be a burden for some.<br><br>To that end, grassroots organisations can be more proactive in identifying residents who need help.<br><br>"We know that some of the schemes that are in existence will be able to assist some of these families. The idea of forming the local network, making use of the existing infrastructure, schemes and network, will be the best way forward in getting help to the people," says Zainudin Nordin, Mayor of Central Singapore District.<br><br>Mr Zainudin says it may also be timely to review the current financial assistance schemes to factor in higher living cost. - CNA /ls</div>
