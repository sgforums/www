I wasn't boasting, I am only telling you the truth.<br>You then went on to say that my management is no good w/o any basis at all.<br>Why lower your discussion to such a level? How does that benefit you?<br><br>Why are you so intolerant of other people's views? </div></blockquote>You said I don't know business w/o any basis at all. And you directly clashed with my field of expertise which is business consulting. So how do you feel when I hit back at your business? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>But I agree, let's move back to a rational discussion, since getting personal is not healthy for debates.<br><br>i quote the below (let's go point by point), and kindly note your unfriendly remark (w/o any basis) like what you accuse me of doing to you:<br><br><blockquote><br>From what you just said, I know you don't have business experience.<br>Maintaining a big business is not a easy thing.<br>Competition is much tougher now than Tony's days. Please wake up and smell the coffee.<br></blockquote>My take is, the leadership of Singapore currently is not having it hard, unlike the leadership of the old. With a well-oiled machinery and an excellent administration, it has often been touted that the civil service can continue to function normally even if our leaders are all lost in one night.<br><br>I am impressed with the way PAP ran this country like a corporation, putting in place well-oiled processes to ensure the country can run normally even if the head isn't there.<br><br>And that's the foundation of a good business. Maintaining a big business is not easy, but it is not difficult either. Big businesses' greatest challenge is how to move on to the next level (ie expand market share, go into new markets, etc, in order to continue to reach new levels), and not on the maintenance of the current levels of success.<br><br><strong>Another analogy</strong><br><br>if a business is already running at 100million turnovers annually, does this necessarily mean the boss is a good boss when he takes over from the older generation and runs this 100million turnover business at a constant rate of returns?<br><br>Or is the boss whom built from scratch a business and turns it into a 10 million annual turnover business, the better boss?

            <div class='col-md body'>I give you another take in business<br><br>I have consulted a business where the business is doing very very well, earning loads and loads of profits, but the management does not share the fruits of labour to the employees. At the end of the day, this business's employee turnover is very high.<br><br>Compared to another business, it was doing well (but not as well as the previous example), and the management believes in sharing the fruits of labour to the employees. The end result is high talent retention and stability of the company.<br><br>What's so great if Singapore is bringing in the bucks, but only pathetic streams of fruits are given to the population? (most of the fruits are hogged in the reserves, which grow and grow, while the average Singaporean's payrise may not even beat inflation rates)<br><br>Compared to Finland or New Zealand, they may not do as well economically as our country, but their society is more stable, with more people happy, and the standard of living better than Singapore.<br><br>My greatest fear is that Singapore places too much emphasis on material success, that the very foundations of society are now getting affected. Right now, you may not see much. However, the day might come when the floodgates will open, and I cannot see how Singapore can recover from that sort of catastrophe.</div>
