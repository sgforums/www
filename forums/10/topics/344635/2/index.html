              <p>there is something seriously wrong about "don't hoard money"</p>
              <p>we are supposed to accelerate consumption?</p>
              <p>there's something seriously wrong about that philosophy coz it brought the world to this sorry state now..</p>
              </div>

              <p>Consumerism is the way to spread wealth ethically.</p>
              <p>It is economics that led the way to evolution of mankind. Moderate religion helped to dampened the excesses thru moral and ethical conduct. Politics, either democracy or communism in its <span style="text-decoration: underline;">purest form</span>, helped in the equal distribution of wealth to everyone.</p>
              <p>Since the dawn of civilisation, it had always been economics that drove mankind to evolve based on needs. Shelter, fire, food were the a necessity and the mother of invention and improvisation.</p>
              <p>Those who had the knowledge to contribute to growth were greatly rewarded, from the stone aged flint maker right thru to the masons who built towns and castles.</p>
              <p>As economies grew, so did conquests as well as scientific discovery to make better use of lands, right up to today's discovery of specific genes and its manipulations.</p>
              <p>Thus , it was economics that uplifted and evolved mankind, with religion and politics to keep it in check. There is still untold wealth on Earth waiting to be tapped.</p>
              <p>Singapore may be a small nation, but our brains are not small. We have similar sizes to amass and process knowledge as any american, russians, anyone and even Einstein.</p>
              <p>Open up your minds, my fellow Singaporeans, for thousands of years we had only tap less than 30% of Earth's resources and yet had provided  sufficiently for all and more through the years.</p>
              <p>70% of Earth is covered with water. What lies beneath the seabed, if not as similar to our current 30% land mass?</p>
              <p>Who is to say we cant tap the seabeds? Continents and islands are not straight drops into the seafloor. At least another 30% lies within shallow waters waiting to be resourced.</p>
              <p>We have nuclear powered cities called aircraft carriers and even nuclear submarines that do not need to refuel for years. We have successfully modified the genes of ornamental fishes to the colours of our choice and grown human parts from genes.</p>
              <p>Who is to say we cannot manipulate genes to enable man to adapt and live under water?</p>
              <p>Earth is still abundant in riches. We all have needs to be at least morally satisfied. Consumerism will help to evolve mankind as we scientifically leap to cultivate and satisfy those needs.</p>
              <p>The rich who worked hard for years, earned their money and paid millions for frivolities such as trips into outer space. If these millions were not used, it would have only sat at home or banks and benefitted no one.</p>
              <p>We must encourage people to get rich and seek a better life. It is through such satisfaction and meeting of needs will wealth and improvement be spread to all mankind, provided religion and politics play its part.</p>
              <p>Religion alone will only cause us to remain as we are and only grow spiritually. Misused, it may even cause genocide. Politics will only lead to power and when misused, it will only destroy mankind.</p>
              <p>A balance of economics and the other 2 factors will help us evolve to our eventual destiny - the stars.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Alan Greenspan was wrong because he believed that economics <span style="text-decoration: underline;">alone</span> will power mankind's weath and evolution. One needs the hand of moderate religion and politics to keep it in check, as the financial crisis had provened. Cheating widows and old folks is outrageous!</p>

              <p>Economics had or will be playing its part and governments are doing all they can to convince its citizens on the need to open their reserves for spending. Only 1 final factor is necessary to save economies now.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>That factor is religion.</strong> During normal times, religious leaders exhort its congregations to donate to charities, which is right, be they Buddhists, Christians, Hindus, Muslims, etc.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Charity is good for it takes care of the unfortunates in life. But these are not ordinary times. As millions go jobless, there will be lesser donations. The rich will still contribute but their contributions cannot compare to that of the millions or billions whose combined donations would be larger to help more.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The financial crisis is upon us now. There is a loss of trust in financial systems, even for those companies whom are innocent, for the massed herd make no distinctions and simply hoard money. Prevention is better than cure is the current philosophy.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It may seem unbelievable, but many in our world is more attuned to religion than realized. <strong>Even bankers</strong> go to church, mosques, temples, etc. Many are aware and believed in the existance of a greater Being than themselves and seek for His blessings.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thus, one word from religious leaders is better than a thousand page analysis from credited economists, for the masses need to know that their actions would be blessed and is right.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is only right now, in the light of this current crisis. Many will become jobless, hungry and may even die from starvation. This is not what an Almighty would want to happen for His creations. Thus there is a need for religious leaders of all faiths to help spread the message to the masses to spend rationally and not selfishly hoard money.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It would save the world now, espacially with a new world leader in Obama whom had taken the oath to ensure responsibility of financial leaders to prevent greed and take good ethics more seriously.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Religious leaders must help</span>. This will be the final act to successfully get a market recovery in the real economy where jobs lay. Without it, means trust and confidence will take a longer time to build. Lives may be lost if that happens.</p>

              <p>"They don't know what they're doing, do they? With every step taken
                      by the Government as it tries frantically to prop up the British
                      banking system, this central truth becomes ever more obvious.</p>
              <p>Yesterday
                      marked a new low for all involved, even by the standards of this
                      crisis. Britons woke to news of the enormity of the fresh horrors in
                      store. Despite all the sophistry and outdated boom-era terminology from
                      experts, I think a far greater number of people than is imagined grasp
                      at root what is happening here.</p>
              <p>The country stands on the
                      precipice. We are at risk of utter humiliation, of London becoming a
                      Reykjavik on Thames and Britain going under. Thanks to the arrogance,
                      hubristic strutting and serial incompetence of the Government and a
                      group of bankers, the possibility of national bankruptcy is not
                      unrealistic.</p>
              <p>...</p>
              <p>It is finally dawning on the Government that the liabilities of the
                      British banks grew to be so vast in the boom years that they now
                      eclipse the entire economy. Unfortunately, the Treasury is pledged to
                      honour those liabilities because it has guaranteed not to let a
                      British bank go down. <strong>RBS has liabilities of £1.8 trillion, three times
                      annual UK government spending, against assets of £1.9 trillion. </strong>But
                      after the events of the past year, I wager most taxpayers will believe
                      the true picture is worse.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, the assets are falling in value. This matters, because post-nationalisation these liabilities are now yours and <br>mine.</p>
              <p><strong>And
                      they come piled on top of the rocketing national debt, charitably put
                      at £630 billion, or 43 per cent of GDP. </strong>The true figure is much higher
                      because the Government has used off-balance sheet accounting to hide
                      commitments such as PFI projects."</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>"The tactics, however, betray a nervousness in <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/labour">Labour</a> circles that the public will simply not understand why there is a
                      second tranche of help going to Britain's bankers, who have already
                      received billions of pounds of loans, guarantees and capital. There is
                      also a worry that Brown's inadvertent title as saviour of the world
                      might be slipping.</p>
              <p>Opinion polls show government popularity
                      falling in the new year. David Cameron may be internationally isolated
                      in his opposition to a fiscal stimulus, but it does not seem to be
                      hurting him. A YouGov poll in the Sunday Times showed Cameron's Tories
                      rising four points to take a 13-point lead.</p>
              <p><strong>Privately,
                      something close to desperation is starting to develop inside
                      government. After watching the slide in bank shares on Friday, one
                      cabinet minister did not altogether joke when he said: "The banks are
                      fucked, we're fucked, the country's fucked."</strong></p>

            <div class='col-md body'>You are right. Crisis ? What crisis?  Don't focus on the world crisis.  The crisis for Singapore began long ago way back, when Singaporeans started flocking overseas for holidays and travel, and especially going to Malaysia and Batam and spending almost their entire monthly pay there on shopping, entertainment, leisure, medical, motor, sports, education, etc  The result?  Singapore domestic economy is near dead, with almost all retail and consumer spending almost nil.  Singaporeans should only blame themselves.</div>

              <p>those who are banking on Q4 recover, you are going to be very disappointed.</p>
              <p>this recession would at least last beyond that.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>the stimulas package that dish out by various govt are not really going to work wonders. various forumers has already pointed out the amount of toxic asset that the banks still hoarding will make the problems worse.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The TARP that initally set out USD 700billion has already spent 350billion on various bailout but some top economist think another 1 trillion USD could be needed to clear out the all the toxic assets that these banks still hoarding. but then if the housing prices has not bottom how do they value this assets?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i strongly believe, credit cards defaults is definitely on the rise , banks will have to prepare provision for bad debts , further reduce their ability to make loans dispite govt help.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>jobs loses are mounting in the US and across the world, housing pricing are falling across the world. if both dont stop, the credit crunch will get worse.</p>
