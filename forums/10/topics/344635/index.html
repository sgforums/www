              <p>There are some optimists who say we may see a recovery at the Q4 this year (best case scenario that means we have not seen the worst yet ) and there are some like expert pessimist saying this is just the beginning of the beginning and not even the end of the beginning of this MegaTsunami , more negative news and events are waiting to unfold over this year, STI may dip below 1000 pts this year (good chance I think)</p>
              <p>I personal take is that of the middle ground, I believe the economy will recover sometime Q2 or Q3 of next year , once  STI really approach 1000 points. we are near the end . Hopefully I still have my job by then.</p>
              <p>And my deep seated hope that the optimist will be proven right this time</p>

              <p>Crisis? What crisis?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The effect has yet to be felt by many. Most are right now <strong>hoarding their money and not spending</strong>, not that there is NO money. Those that continue to do so will only see their savings wipe out in a matter of time, as companies close down, meaning competition roll over and die, leaving the stronger companies around to cut throat.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Singapore's unemployment rate is till below 10%, which means there are still more than 90% whom are employed and have money to spend, that is, if they do not <strong>hoard </strong>up money instead. But as they <strong>hoard</strong> up money, companies will have to close and the unemployment rate will climb.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The world had reacted quickly in October and threw an obsene amount of money to shore up over leverage banks. Now that the banks are cash rich, they <strong>hoard up money</strong> and are very very stringent with lending, if they lend at all.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>They are hoarding up money, and letting companies die. Continue along this line, when existing companies default more and new companies are not given loans to expand, people will draw out their savings and banks, like any other commercial entity will die too.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The only bright ray of hope is the money govts will spend on the people instead. China had reacted fast and started on infrastructure projects worth billions and will keep many china citizens employed.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>US had approved spending, but the money has yet to go into the hands of consumers. Once that happens, it is trillions of dollars, and would certainly drip our way.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Singapore, as usual, cautious to the point of kiasu, has yet to do anything concrete about actual spending, prefer to wait until legislated. To their credit, they did offer up thousands of govt jobs that will keep unemployment low, so long as those employed <strong>DONT HOARD MONEY!</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So when will the crisis be over? Depending on how long actual World govt spending on citizens and infrastructure will come. Eu is a basket case right now, cant even get their act together to decide on anything.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Planet Earth's fundamentals are still fine. Plenty of resources to tap and food to be grown and harvested. People still have needs and must spend eventually to satisfy those needs.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As for Singapore, the 90% employed will keep the domestic economy humming, as long as they <strong>DONT HOARD MONEY</strong>! For those who are retrenched, govt jobs await. For those in foreign companies, majority are awaiting their govt's spending and easing of credit by their banks. If that doesnt come fast enough, they will close down.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The stock market is now normal, with its regular ups and downs. It is afterall just another gambling centre, more high class and called 'investments'. All kinds of people play the stock market, some go for long, some go for short. Unlike black october when it was a total disaster of panic scrambling out of the market at all costs.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In summary, there WILL BE NO CRISIS if Singaporeans spend normally. I aint kidding. Our external trade is currently being diversified to other nations instead of depending heavily on uS. It may not be much, but it is still revenue for social spending and jobs.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>PS: For those who worry about running up huge deficiets, rest assured, Planet Earth's resources combined with scientific technology advances will reap back those money spent. Better cheaper and more productive use of land and mining, fertilisation, etc, etc. The world's economy is after all - resource based.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The only worry is that we may discover how to live forever. But that would probably come with technological advances on how to tap the vast universe with its abundant planets' resources. But first, we need to evolve as a species and not as individual barbarians.</p>

              <p>There are some optimists who say we may see a recovery at the Q4 this year (best case scenario that means we have not seen the worst yet ) and there are some like expert pessimist saying this is just the beginning of the beginning and not even the end of the beginning of this MegaTsunami , more negative news and events are waiting to unfold over this year, STI may dip below 1000 pts this year (good chance I think)</p>
              <p>I personal take is that of the middle ground, I believe the economy will recover sometime Q2 or Q3 of next year , once  STI really approach 1000 points. we are near the end . Hopefully I still have my job by then.</p>
              <p>And my deep seated hope that the optimist will be proven right this time</p>

              <p>As yr newly appointed economist, i suggest that we should not dwell on the current poor economy, instead, we should relax and think wisely on how to make the best out of these poor economy. For every downturn, it create new millionaires/billionaires when the upturn come around. As my Guru Alan Greenhorn said, "instead of preparing for depression, prepare to take opportunity, the economy at times, need re -enginnering inorder to recover"</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There my advise is think of what to do best now, maybe we can open a casket company, cos many will look for suicide during depression, and our old age population sure need casket one, yet it is a business that few venture, what say you, my Fuhrer??</p>
