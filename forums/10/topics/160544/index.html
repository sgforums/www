            <div class='col-md body'>Avoiding the topic of welfare- a Disaster for Singapore.<br><br>Â“Â…people demanding state to provide essential services and aid even at the expense of state going bankruptÂ…Â”Â… Â“clutch mentalityÂ”Â—true? http://72.14.203.104/search?q=cache:UJIvzgmT7eoJ:info.channelnewsasia.com/bb/viewtopic.php%3Ft%3D16559%26+welfare+resource+singapore&amp;hl=en<br><br>As an average citizen- IÂ’m faced with several concerns/ perspectives... some of which others might share Â– (concerns which may have implications for the future of Singapore.)<br><br>The 2 main concerns are Â‘1.welfareÂ’ and Â‘2.social cohesivenessÂ’- that (1)govt has put inadequate consideration into welfare and that (2)Singaporeans are NOT a cohesive community.<br><br>My observations are that<br>Â‘WelfareÂ’ isnÂ’t transparent as it should be- in so- leaving the questions about what subsidies are available grossly unanswered:<br>i.e.- eligibility/ subsidies/ assistance pertaining to:<br>a)	Child born with birth defects/ compromised intellect/ cancer/ special education.<br>b)	Bankruptcy/ Poor.<br>c)	Homelessness<br>d)	Orphans.<br>e)	Ex-Convicts seeking employment.<br>f)	Unskilled worker seeking jobs (structural unemployment).<br>g)	Serious disease- cancer, heart disease/ requiring transplants/ HIV<br>h)	Those severely injured in industrial accidents.<br>i)	Injuries etc due to National service.<br>j)	Elderly sick with no care giver/ relatives.<br>k)	People abused by their spouses/ other abused persons.<br>l)	Compensation due to assault/ robbery by unknown assailants.<br>(i.e. I find no comprehensive webpage detaining the qualifying criteria/ available help wrt a/m problem cases.)<br><br>Misfortune strikes anyone, anytimeÂ… and Singapore doesnÂ’t seem to have a publicized and transparent rescue package for those inflicted by misfortune.<br><br>People in general- frequently fear the unknownÂ… answering these (dreaded) concerns in advance would therefore put many SingaporeanÂ’s minds at ease should misfortune strike. (Or should individuals consider our society to be one with NO second chanceÂ…)<br><br>Already people are complaining- high costs of living- for profit public transport, high medical costs, high housing costs, loss of jobs to foreigners etc. Â– that many might consider SG to be an Â‘incorporated companyÂ’- ruled by an authoritarian govt.<br><br>So it is the challenge of the govt to infuse confidence into the minds of Singaporeans that there IS ENOUGH WELFARE should citizens need itÂ… because otherwise in times of misfortune/ when the terrorist strikeÂ… people will run amok in all directionsÂ… because they would be people who think that the gov doesnÂ’t care/ wonÂ’t provide welfare to victimsÂ… Because in SgÂ… there are NO SECOND CHANCES- under Â‘SG govt incorporatedÂ’!<br><br>AnyhowÂ… the consequence of a fearful (NO 2nd chance) citizenry would be-<br>1)	Lower birth rate then is already- 1.05(2005est)- [ranked 224/226 in the world])- http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/rankorder/2127rank.html<br>- Because people are afraid that their progeny/ their lives might suffer. / would having a mentally subnormal child be a painful and expensive affair?<br>- Uncertainty about competency of SG govt in view of itÂ’s vague standpoint on Â‘welfareÂ’<br>2)	Lower entrepreneurship because of fear of misfortune.<br>3)	Lack of commitment to the sovereignty of Singapore because Singapore govt is perceived to care adequately for the needy. (accentuated by perceived SG govtÂ’s Â‘incompetenceÂ’ regarding Â‘welfareÂ’/ in regulating living costs )<br>4)	Rich vs poor gap increases- will cause social instabilityÂ… many people disenchanted Â…and maybe religious violence also?...<br><br>Everybody is borned with potential powers of doing good to others.<br>Let us bring them out so that other people can enjoy their brightness and warmth.<br>Late Venerable Yen Pei, Founder- http://www.sbws.org.sg/<br></div>
