            <div class='col-md body'>India opened up its economy for liberalisation in the year 1990. From then onwards Indian economy is growing at an astonishing rate. Earlier the growth rate was around 5-6%. Now it has increased to 8% and the goverment want it to be around 10%. The saying that foreign investors are not succeeding is wrong. It is said that more than 95% of those who invested in India is happy about the return they get. There was a greater reform after the first one and now the government is trying to bring down the tax level to that of ASEAN nations. The tax is already very low.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>When George W.Bush visited India, it was a mixed reaction from this country. While the Government was laying vacuum cleaned red carpet, its allies were protesting on the streets. A section of progressive liberals was joining them and different shades of Muslims protested under different banners. Most of media was jubilant, and only a miniscule of commentators raised the question as to why after decades of ignoring India why US administration is deciding to become pro India? One recalls that India had to slog the hard way to build its industrial and educational infrastructure without any help from the US. This biggest democracy of ours was not in the right books of the US, so why this current oozing of warmth from the mightiest of mighty nation?<br><br>The signing of the nuclear deal is just a small part of the whole relationship. US is roping India into its camp. Indian government, overwhelmed by the glamour and power of US might, has a feeling that it is getting its due from the most powerful country. The global equations are changing and this one marks the serious turn. So far till the decades of 1980 US was battling and demonizing the USSR, which happened to be the other mighty pole of World power. During the cold war era US faced a stiff challenge to its agenda of World domination from USSR. US did replace the declining colonial states like UK, France and Holland at places. Its policies during this time mainly supported the dictators and despots, it propped up the regimes which were dead opposed to democratic values and went on to the extent of mauling the Vietnamese nationalism with napalm bombs.<br><br>It is another matter that Vietnam turned the tide and US had to bite the dust in its hegemonic ambitions. US is the only power in the World to have used the nuclear bomb so far. It had unleashed a massive propaganda war against communism to back up its global policy. It could smell a communist rat every where before it had to launch its military cat to pounce on the independence of small and weak countries. Examples abound, Iran 1953, Chile 1973 being two standing out and showing the intent of US imperialism and its lust for global resources. Its policies in due course led to rise of fundamentalism in various countries. In Iran when it overturned Mossadeq and installed Raza Shah Pehlavi as the ruler, whose policies in turn led to frustration and rebellion which got usurped by Ayatollah Khomeini. Taliban was another outcome of US policies.<br><br>It propped up AL Qaeda to fight against the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. As per the Kissinger doctrine, "Asians should fight Asians". It did not want to repeat its mistake in Vietnam and set up mechanisms to train the young Muslims as fighters under the garb of Jihad. The support to Al Qaeda, Osama, its ally, was to the extent of 8000 million dollars and 7000 tons of armaments including the dreaded stringer missiles. With the defeat of USSR the subsequent events led to the rise of Taliban.<br><br>US intervention in the world, after the collapse of USSR was much easier. It now floated the theory of 'Clash of Civilizations', the battle between the advanced Western civilization and the backward Islamic civilization. The intensity of propaganda and doctoring of mass consciousness was intense and formed the base of US aggression against Iraq (1991) Afghanistan (2001) and Iraq (2003). Now it is planning to occupy Iran on one or the other pretext. The battle in the World is projected as the clash of civilizations, religions to hide the basic aim of controlling the oil resources and political hegemony.<br><br>Islam is a threat to World is the new slogan coined by US to occupy the oil rich zone, which also happens to be Muslim. This slogan has replaced its earlier one of communism as the threat to democracy and freedom, whose custodianship is supposed to be with this friend-in-chief of most of the dictators. It has trampled UN, by bypassing it to begin with and now by totally ignoring it in the new designs as the World emperor.<br><br>The changing dynamics of development is seeing that China is coming up strong and fast as a potential super power. US will undertake every possible move to create and alliance which is formidable and can take on the other superpower in case it comes in the way of US designs on the political and economic control of the World. India by now has come up with a substantial industrial and military prowess to act as one of the junior partners of US in the new scenario. The new found love of US for India is based on this practical calculation; it is based on its own ambition to be bale to continue its domination on the World.<br><br>The section of Indian elite and middle class is in total awe of this super bully. So from last one decade it has been making all overtures to US to be accepted as its cohort. It offered its bases during its aggression on Afghanistan and now has voted against Iran on the nuclear issue. Not to see this long term interest of US to checkmate China and to be overwhelmed by US gestures will be suicidal for India's interests in the medium and long term. The need is to strengthen the global peace movement and to build a non aligned movement which can take on the might of US, to strive for a global democracy amongst nations of the World, by the revival and improvement in the norms of United Nations as a potential World government, and also to bring back the aspiration of the people of the World as enshrined in the United Nations Charter of Human rights.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>On March 2, 2006 the USA and India singed an agreement in New Delhi for the cooperation of the two countries on the issues of the nuclear reactors, nuclear fuel and expertise. The agreement has met with mixed reactions in both countries. Even the US congress has tabled the possibility of seeking conditions to the nuclear deal (1).<br><br>The 2nd of March agreement of the US with India is undoubtedly a serious blow to the regime of the Non-Proliferation of the Nuclear Weapons (NPT). The concerned agreement is clearly against the spirit of the NPT. This move has sent a wrong message to countries that plan to develop nuclear weapons. The wrong message is that: you do not need to join the NPT and go through the International Atomic Energy Agency's inspections and observe the rules of Additional Protocol of the NPT. You just go ahead and follow your nuclear programs out of the framework of the NPT and disregard the calls of the international institutions (like IAEA) for making your nuclear program transparent and eventually when you achieved the nuclear bomb capability (and the capability to deliver them on the potential targets), the big powers will accept you in the nuclear club and give you some of advantages that they have reserved for themselves.<br><br>The agreement for nuclear cooperation of US and India also sends a wrong message to the International community and especially the countries close to the USA. The wrong message is that: we (the US) are pushing Iran and the countries like that to observe the NPT and you should do the same, but sometimes we do not observe what we say ourselves. We are different from you and NPT is for you, not for us. This double standard will damage the US position towards the NPT and give others more grounds to criticize the US policy in this field.<br><br>Now the question pops in mind: India has a well-developed nuclear energy program from the military point of view. The US is concerned about the NPT and the importance of stopping the spread of the nuclear weapons now more than ever. So, why this agreement is concluded between the two sides at this juncture?<br><br>The answer lies in several elements. Some of these are more important than others:<br><br>1- The expansion of globalization. Economic inter-dependence between the two countries is increasing. The Indians and Americans need and are ready to use the market of the other side. The Indians are thirsty for access to the latest technologies in the fields like computer sciences and the Americans are counting on the large market of the middle class Indians. "India has more than 300 million middle class consumers, more than the entire population of the United States". (2)<br><br>2- Outsourcing policies of the USA are expanding. These days it is very usual that you call in the USA the office of HP, for example, to order a print head and someone in the New Delhi takes your order and arranges for the delivery. Some of the US industries are outsourcing their whole operations to the countries like India. With the great manpower in India, this country is an ideal place for the outsourcing. At the same time, a great number of the skilled people from India travel to the USA for working. So the outsourcing is two sided here. "Over 65000 Americans live in India, attracted by its growing economy and richness of its culture." (3)<br><br>3- The possibility of persuading India to put its nuclear program under international supervision. According to the new agreement of the US and India almost 65% of the Indian nuclear program will be put under the international safeguards. "8 out of India's 22 power reactors will remain outside international controls, along with a new breeder reactor." (4)<br><br>4- Persuading India to continue its policies in the field of non-proliferation. Unlike Pakistan (and its semi-official underground network of selling all kinds of nuclear technology and equipment), India has a good reputation in the world in this field. However, there are strong voices in India that call for export of the nuclear know-how in order to gain more financial resource for India. Therefore some sources claim that the US-India agreement of the 2nd of March 2006 in fact ? is strengthening the NPT." (5)<br><br>5- India needs to import uranium (at least until it changes the nuclear systems in India) and the US can answer to those needs. India faces shortage of uranium for the moment.<br><br>6- India has millions of Muslims (even more than Pakistan) but it is a Hindu state. The US and India have mutual feeling of threat from the religious extremists, especially the Muslin ones. Therefore, the US hopes to get the assistance of India against extremist Islamic moves. The recent vote of the Indian representation in the IAEA against Islamic Republic of Iran (in the case of the nuclear crisis of Iran) showed the importance of these concern. India put the proposed gas pipeline of Iran-Pakistan-India (which is very important for India due to its energy needs in future) in jeopardy, at the cost of voting against Iran.<br><br>7- Expansion of the relations between India and Israel. These relations have several implications. Except than contacts with Israel per se, the concerned relations affect the Indian relations with the USA, the Arab countries, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Islamic extremity groups and institutions.<br><br>8- India wants the US support in its struggle to gain a seat among the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council. India has been trying for this goal (along with Germany, Japan, and Brazil) for several years. India has even proposed to change the place of the United Nations Headquarters from New York to New Delhi. (The US may welcome this idea if gets disappointed from the UNO).<br><br>9- India in considered a major democratic country in the area that democracy is not established in many parts of it. The USA, according to its policies, seek to strengthen the security by expanding relations with India<br><br>10- New relations of the US-India as a balance against China.<br><br>11- The new relations gives a chance to the USA to Change the old structure of the Indian armed forces from an army mainly organized and equipped in the Russian lines to a western one.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>United States President George Bush has not handed India Â“The BombÂ” by agreeing to sell that country nuclear technology. That's because India has had atomic weapons for decades. But the new pact between Washington and New Delhi undermines 35 years of nuclear arms control, and that stark reality poses a real risk to global security.<br><br>By treating India as an acceptable nuclear partner, Bush has signaled the U.S. is prepared to do business with Â“strategic partnersÂ” such as India or Israel, even as it continues to treat Pakistan like a nuclear pariah and blasts North Korea and Iran as threats to world peace. Bush is not alone in this selectivity. Canada, Britain and France agreed last year to resume civilian nuclear co-operation with India, despite the risks for arms control.<br><br>Why shouldn't Pakistan or Israel now seek similar bilateral deals outside the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT)? And what incentive have North Korea and Iran to comply?...<br><br>Rather than cut one-off deals that destroy the NPT in stages, the Â“Big FiveÂ” the U.S., Russia, Britain, France and China plus nuclear-capable countries like Canada would serve the world better by being firm with nuclear mavericks. They should sell nuclear technology only to nations agreeing not to develop weapons. That's been the NPT bargain since 1970 and has served as a brake on the spread of nuclear weaponry, dissuading places like South Korea and Saudi Arabia from building a bomb.<br>Yet Bush has agreed to sell civilian nuclear technology to India, subject to U.S. Congress approval, even though just 14 of its 22 reactors will be under international scrutiny. The rest stay closeted in military hands.<br><br>The U.S. administration has tried to rationalize this Â“exceptionÂ” with several arguments: India is a democracy; India is a potential ally of 1.1 billion people with a 300-million-strong middle class and a fast-growing economy that needs nuclear power to replace coal and oil which generate greenhouse gases; India has a good record on not selling nuclear technology to unstable regimes; India has agreed to partial inspections. All true. ...<br><br>That still does not make the deal right. The world has had real success, under the NPT, persuading South Africa, Brazil, Argentina and Libya to give up their bomb-making programs. That will be a harder sell in the future, given that the U.S. has now winked at India's bomb, after winking at Israel's bomb. And it comes at a time of genuine concern not only about proliferation, but also about the theft of nuclear materials, and terrorism.<br><br>This is bad policy, regardless of how much India matters to the U.S.</div>

The only point is how it is implemented. As singapore is grown into a modern city it is not a problem for Singapore. But for India there are many issues that need to be addressed. Like enviromental issues and social issues. Since India is democratic everyone has a voice. The media is a free one. So the government cannot go on destroying something to create any new things. The growth rate that India is showing is not by flattening farmlands and giving it to builders, but by finding unused land and using it for development.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>But frankly speaking,i dont think so.Becoz India is a very slacking n complicated country.Their official languages got 100+,their culture n their government administration is lack of efficiency. </blockquote>India is a complicated country but is not a slacking one. We speak many languages(English, Hindi, Gujarati, Marathi, Assamese, Bengali, Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Konkani, Malayalam, Oriya, Nepali, Marathi, Urdu, ..........................), We have many religions (Hindu, Muslim, Christian, Sikh, Parsi, Bhuddism, Jainism, Bahai, .....). All these things make India one of the unique nations in the world. The most multiplural society in the world. Indian culture cannot be described by religion, or languages there is something more complicated that requires a lot of study to understand. India is a united world for more than one billion people who wish to live in a peaceful, democratic, pluralistic society. Who wish to live side by side another person whose religion or language is different because he believes in cooperation and mutual understanding. This is the basis for India many a centuries. India exited many centuries before the British came. India still exists and the culture and the good work of Indians is still appreciated world over. India will remain since its strength lies in a plural society.<br><br>Goverment apathy is very much there. But let me tell you that there is a lot of change taking place. Today's India is much much better than yesterdays India. Politicians are much more responsible than they were yesterday, because people have changed. The Indian IT industry grew without much help from the government. It is progressing rapidly without much help of the government, since regulations are not there these industries will keep on growing without much government support or initiatives. Thankfully government is also extending small help<br><br>If Indian's can excel in other countries if the required things are provided they can also do it in India. And the same thing is happening in India after the liberalisation of the economy</div>
