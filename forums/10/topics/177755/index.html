Therefore there is more restrictions and higher taxes and less freedom to do business in india.<br><br>FROM THE 2006 INDEX OF ECONOMIC FREEDOM<br>According to the World Bank, India's weighted average tariff rate in 2004 was 28 percent, up from the 21 percent in 2001 reported in the 2005 Index, based on World Bank data. The U.S. Trade Representative reports that non-tariff barriers remain <strong> extensive</strong>, including a high level of confusing bureaucracy, onerous standards and certifications on many goods, discriminatory sanitary and phytosanitary measures, and a negative import list that bans or <strong>restricts</strong> imports. Based on the revised trade factor methodology, India's trade policy score is unchanged.<br><br>How can business flourishes in such a place where the government there have EXTENSIVE non- tariff trade barriers, HIGH LEVEL of confusing bureaucracy and BANS or RESTRICTS imports of raw materals that industries need.</div>

And I don't think GCT is wrong about India.<br><br>It is becoming more prosperous because it makes very strong progress in computer software and is the preferred country for outsourcing by many MNC. It is also a hugh market for pharmaceutical.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>India is a very huge country with a very very large population growing very rapidly. India has a very strong tradition in empahizing in education and industrialization. Despite the fact the India has been opening up for the foreign investment, the conservative protectionism &amp; nationalism mindset  has taken deep roots in majority of the indian elites.<br><br>It is weel known fact in India that the Indian gov had been taking pride in providing a relatively stable economical growth of 2-3% from her independence til today. The indian population are well insulated in the pasdt global finance crisis. Thus, it would be a labourous task to change the mindset of the Indian elites on unlock the potential of the Indian market to foreigners.<br><br>India will continue to grow and develope at her own steady pace. The Indian politics are dominated by nationalism. It would be the best interest for the Indian gov to selectively opening up her market, and tap the international resources (human, knowledge, money &amp; opporunities) to develope her weak economic sectors. But in forseeable futures, India, like many developing nation, are quite reluctant to hand-on the preciously guarded agriculture market priced by many analyst. Just imagine the prize ripped from the agriculture market from India....<br></div>
