You could benchmark the tyrants' paycheck against other politicians on the planet or even that of the CEO's (which obviously warrants no comparison with their net worth) of the world's leading MNC's.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Arapahoe:</div><div class="quote_body">But i think in this day and age, when talking about public listed CEO compensation package, it is reasonable to take option into account and not seperate. net worth is just accademic n politically correct terms.<br></div></blockquote>It isn't. As a matter of fact, I was hardly deliberating the merits of compensation packages with regard to CEO remunerations in the corporate world.<br><br>As this regime would like you to believe, they're benchmarking their pay against the <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-style: italic;">wages</span></span></strong> of the leading professionals. That, in truth, is what their pay is benchmarked against(or so they claim). In truth, this has nothing to do with compensation packages, stock options and ultimately, their net worth.</div>
