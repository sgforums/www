              <p>I agree and disagree,<br><br>I will say this, Singaporeans are smart, but not bright. Not bright because they tend to stop themselves from forging ahead and put a limit on their own potential. Singaporeans will follow a company procedure, but do more than what is required. Not an ideal employee for me. I blame the government for this.<br><br>Yes, I made a sweeping statement, but fair statement. For me, a Singaporean is not an ideal employee, not even in Singapore and sad to say but I wonder if even Lee thinks this? It's been said before, the people are like sheep, follow follow. And for that, I blame the government again. Why do you think he now has to "search" for leaders? Would not a leader stand out... you won't find a leader in a flock of sheep. Again, this is the governments doing.<br><br>I do have to say in fairness that if Singaporeans just believe in themselves, and they take control of their own lives and destiny and let no man restrict their freedoms, their minds will open up so much more. Singaporeans are smart, and if given the chance to raise and free their mind they can adjust and be the best at anything they want. But the chains that hold them back have to be broken. <br><br>This is what Gopalan has done, this is what others have done, this is what my friend Aaron has done. Aaron is a Singaporean who left a month ago from Singapore to live in Australia. I asked him why are you leaving? He told me he just cannot live in Singapore anymore. He recently got married, and he wants to have children. He also says that he does not want to raise children in Singapore.<br><br>He says, "Yes it is clean and it is safe, but look at the price i paid for this... there are many clean, green places in the world, and these places are free. I cannot believe our government anymore. Like any parent I want my children to have more than me. Some people think bringing a child into wealth is good and the end-all. For me, I think brining up a child with freedom is better." And with that statement, Aaron said, "By giving him (his child to be) the chance to grow up as a free person, he will already have more than I did as a child growing up in Singapore. My father's money did not make me happy, why should I think mine will do any better for my child?" <br><br>And so another one of Singapore's best left the country never to return. You see, Lee does not get it, this is how out of touch the government is. Money, incentives, clean, green, and safe, a first class airport and transportation system are only parts to an equation of what people look for. The answer educated people seek is freedom. I am waiting to return home country before I have my children. There is absolutely no way I would raise my children in Singapore. And I am sorry to say, but unless you come from a third world or do not know what freedom is, I would not know really why anyone would raise children here. I apologize if I offended anyone, but this is my opinion. There is nothing that can buy or I would trade my child's freedom for... and this is why Singaporean's leave. So am I arrogant for saying that, or is there truth in what is being said? <br><br>You call it a brain drain, but let's speak the truth. it is not a brain drain, it is a freedom march. Singaporeans are leaving the country to be free. Do not acknowledge the propaganda by calling it a brain drain because it about a flight to freedom, a freedom march. It is a freedom march, it is a Singaporean protest. <br><br>Let it sink in... this is a freedom march!</p>
