I think eradicating fear is also very much an individual effort, as much as the ruling or opposition parties are expected to or accused of not doing anything about it.<br><br>The key is to be observant and logical of the surroundings.<br><br>Firstly, a quarter to a third of Singaporeans vote for the opposition in every election, but I do not see a quarter to a third of Singapore children being denied entry into PAP kindergartens.<br><br>Secondly, I do not see a quarter to a third of Singaporeans become homeless because HDB refused to grant them a flat for voting opposition. I had a friend who had to wait 7 years to get a flat because he voted SDP in Braddell Heights in 1991. He attributed this to the way he voted. But at that time, HDB was less inefficient in granting new flats. My parents who were PAP voters had to wait 6 years before a new flat finally came in 1990.<br><br>Thirdly, you can't get into any soup buying an opposition publication on the street because every one of them has a registration number from MICA (Ministry of Info, Comm and the Arts). Oppositionists would have been first to get arrested for selling an illegal publication before any buyer gets any repercussions.<br><br>Regards</div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Do not expect the ruling party to do the citizens a favor. It has its own hidden agendas to serve. So even if it knows that a 30-40% opposition members will be genuine oppositions who could then put pressure on entrenched ministers to get out of their comfort zone and self-interests and protectionism and work hard to serve the people with better decisions and better performance do you think it will try to create the right conditions to make this happen.<br><br>My short answer is a big no because the ruling party is too self-serving and self-centred judging from its past performances to change.<br><br>The only way is for opposition parties to unite by one common objective - to hunt for talents with true ability and not shut out people who may be vocal with leadership and charisma and try to make it their utmost common goal to support the rise of stars and use their collective resources to use such stars to lead them to form coalition or merge parties so as to offer the real alternatives to the ruling party.<br><br>Hu Jin Tao and Wen Jia Bao of China have just nominated some new blood with potential to succeed them by the next election following what Deng Xiao Peng has done to sacrifice for the political evolution of the whole country.<br><br>This should be what politics at the end is all about - sacrifice of self for the good of the country.

            <div class='col-md body'>Let me relate a contrasting story today. It might make no sense but here it goes.<br><br>I met my Norwegian contacts for many rounds of beers. They appreciate what we have here even when we have erm "no democracy". Whats happening there is, they have social welfare for all and they have the same population  as us. However they have many homeless people despite the welfare. These homeless people choose to lead their lives that way as they would have more money for drugs. In their society, criminal offences like drugs trafficking, murder, rape etc warrants a less penalty like corruption or general corporate crimes. Don't ask me why but thats what i was told. They have different "precedences" there and my contacts wish that there was less "democracy" as in what we have in Singapore. Such thing perpetuate there as their politics is 50-50 and no political parties want to offend if you would like. I was convinced that the ruling party(PAP) is doing a very great job.<br><br>I had to take a cab and had a cabbie who was very much into politics. Somehow i kinda instigated him into talking about politics. I remembered that many years ago, cab rental rates were about $90 per day. Today, i sat in a Skoda and his rental is about $110 per day and diesel rates are of course much more than it was when he first started out. He started to KPKB about the government not caring. However i realised that he is worse off than before. Somehow i felt that competition is bearing fruit as the benificiaries are consumers. However, who gives a damn about the taxi driver ? Every form of price increase is a bad word to consumers. What hit me was that the government managed to make the taxi driver worse off and make the consumer feel worse off. Something is wrong is it not ? I leave you people to decide whats happening today. I'll come back and hope that there is a fruitfull discussion.<br><br>Is everybody worse off ? Is it due to the government ? Will we better off as a "true democracy" ? We need to answer these questions. If we feel that we are getting a rough deal, how do we need to make it better ?</div>
