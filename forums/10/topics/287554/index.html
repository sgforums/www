I think eradicating fear is also very much an individual effort, as much as the ruling or opposition parties are expected to or accused of not doing anything about it.<br><br>The key is to be observant and logical of the surroundings.<br><br>Firstly, a quarter to a third of Singaporeans vote for the opposition in every election, but I do not see a quarter to a third of Singapore children being denied entry into PAP kindergartens.<br><br>Secondly, I do not see a quarter to a third of Singaporeans become homeless because HDB refused to grant them a flat for voting opposition. I had a friend who had to wait 7 years to get a flat because he voted SDP in Braddell Heights in 1991. He attributed this to the way he voted. But at that time, HDB was less inefficient in granting new flats. My parents who were PAP voters had to wait 6 years before a new flat finally came in 1990.<br><br>Thirdly, you can't get into any soup buying an opposition publication on the street because every one of them has a registration number from MICA (Ministry of Info, Comm and the Arts). Oppositionists would have been first to get arrested for selling an illegal publication before any buyer gets any repercussions.<br><br>Regards</div>

He is a PhD, on the science of the mind, he knows how to affect people.<br><br>There are anti government forumers here who know pretty well that the fears are unfounded, but nevertheless, still go all out to make political mileage out of it.<br><br>Its good that the WP, through LTK and formerly JBJ, tell the electorate to vote without fear, for their vote is secret.
