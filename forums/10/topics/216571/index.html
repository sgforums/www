            <div class='col-md body'>Job Market is at its best lah!<br>Every year is the best one.<br>From Ministry of Manpower:<br><br>Employment Rate in Singapore: Highest Local Employment Rate in 15 Years<br><br>5 October 2006<br><br>Reflecting the robust job creation as a result of two years of strong economic performance, the proportion of resident population in employment has risen to a record high, with gains being most pronounced among the older population.  This is the key finding of the occasional paper on Â“Employment Rate in SingaporeÂ” from the Ministry of Manpower's Research and Statistics Department.<br><br>2  In June 2006, 76% of the resident population aged 25 to 64 were in employment, up from 73% in 2005 and 72% in 2004.  This is the highest in 15 years since we started keeping records in 1991.  While the buoyant economy has lifted employment prospects across all age groups, the improvement is most pronounced for the older population aged 55 to 64, where the resident employment rate rose by 5% points or more from 2004 to a record high. This suggests that efforts to improve the employability of older persons, amid a tight labour market when employers would be more willing to turn to older workers, have helped more of them secure employment.<br><br>3  The gains in employment rate are observed for both males and females, with females registering a significant increase from 2004 of 4.1% points compared to 2.6% points for males aged 25 to 64.  The strong employment performance of women partly reflects the improvement in their educational profile as higher educated women are more likely to participate in the labour market. Women have also benefited considerably from the increase in services jobs over the years.<br><br>4  Nevertheless, the proportion of men (89%) at work is still higher than women 63%).  Internationally, Singapore males have among the highest employment rate.  For instance, the proportion of men aged 25 to 64 in employment in Singapore at 86% in 2005 is significantly higher than 76% in Germany and 78% in France , both of which have a more rigid labour market characterised by strict employment protection measures and an extensive social safety net.  However, the employment rate of our older population still lags behind many of the developed countries including the United States, the United Kingdom, Sweden and Japan.  Despite the gains in employment of Singapore women, the proportion of women in employment here is still lower than many of the developed countries, except for the younger cohort aged 25 to 39.  In many of the developed countries, flexible work arrangements such as part-time work which can better accommodate women and older persons are generally more widely available.  The relatively lower employment rate of mature women and older persons in Singapore suggests there is scope to enhance their employment.  If successful, this will in the long run help more of them contribute to the workforce and also help meet the challenges arising from a rapidly aging population.</div>

Many people do. Do foreign workers wake up late and take cabs to work?<br><br>[<blockquote><strong>Of course occasionally I spoilt myself have a better meal with friends, family colleague cant expect me to eat $3 mee everyday</strong></blockquote>You have to watch your budget and the number of times you have a 'better meal' then. You can have a better meal in a hawker centre rather than a restaurant.<br><br><blockquote><strong>Obviously you do not pay the bills for a five room flat where you need to cook etc I do not run air con fyi  breakdown as  eletricity , gas , water $150 , conservancy $65, telephone $ 30 hanphone $100 , internet $50  </strong></blockquote>If you are working till 9pm every day I fail to see why you spend so much on utilities. If you have both meals outside, there is no need to cook apart from weekends. Your handphone bill is also excessive. Use a pre-paid phone if you lack discipline.<br><br><blockquote><strong>$300 include my expenses such clothing shoe , personal stuff etc</strong></blockquote>I buy one pair of shoes ($60) a year and I am still wearing the pants I bought 10 years ago. In UK, I am a regular customer of charity shops where I buy second hand clothes. You can save alot if you try.<br><br>Lots of Singaporeans live on less than 1.5k a month and they work just as hard, if not harder. Your pay depends on the economic value of your work, not just how hard you work. The farmer may work 10 times as long to earn the equivalent of 10 minutes of a lawyer's time. If you desire a higher quality of life, you have to increase the economic value of your work.<br></div>
