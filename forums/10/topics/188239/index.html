            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE : Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew has said that if the People's Action Party is not in government, Singaporeans' lives will be gravely affected.<br><br>Mr Lee was speaking at a question and answer session at the Foreign Correspondents' Association's 50th anniversary celebration on Friday evening.<br><br>Addressing a 300-strong crowd, Mr Lee threw up a scenario -- what would happen if the PAP lost this general election, and the opposition members of the likes of Low Thia Kiang and Chiam See Tong took over?<br><br>Mr Lee said, "You have a hodgepodge of the Workers' Party, four parties in the SDA and Mr Chee Soon Juan's SDP, and they're the Finance Minister, they're the Minister for Trade and Industry, they're the Minister for National Development. You just wait (and see) what happens. <span style="color: red;">You'll find your property prices sink, and if you haven't paid your mortgage, you may have negative estate value. And when it comes to elections, on the quiet, we tell them, just think what will happen if your estate is not run properly?" </span><br>Mr Lee also said if the opposition rose against the PAP, they had to be a world class opposition and not this "riffraff."<br><br>He said Singapore is what it is today because he had tweaked the system, and he would continue to do so, to improve Singapore.<br><br>With many foreign journalists wanting to participate in the question-and-answer session, Mr Lee gamely obliged.<br><br>"Since they're going to have a field day, have a go," he said to applause.<br><br>On opposition parties, Mr Lee said they should compete on the competence of the candidates and the basis of policies; an example is to debate the Workers' Party manifesto.<br><br>Mr Lee said, "You put out a manifesto, we put out a manifesto. This is what we say we believe in, you say it's motherhood statement; we say fine, you tell us how you would create jobs. But they're not, they don't want to discuss their manifesto, because even before the campaign started, we explained publicly what would happen if we adopted their policies. So he doesn't want to talk about it anymore."<br><br>Mr Lee stressed that the Workers' Party manifesto was flawed. - CNA /ct<br><br>Maybe if the oposition takes over, they would do a better job. Property prices are artificially high, maybe the opposition could lessen the impact by reducing taxes.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It is a highly presumptuous statement : "If" such and such is the case then "Something" will happen.<br><br>His "If" and "then" assumptions in governing the country are auto-piloted for years but did not work in many of our policies as pointed out by Ngiam Tong Dow, retired senior civil servant many years ago.<br><br>Why? "If" "then" assumption allowed him to put up something easier and convenient to proceed with so that people will at least follow some direction rather than being unguided.<br><br>This is what he said in the past, "If we have "meritocracy", then we will build a strong and stable society based on the best getting ahead, this is what he had been saying for years.<br><br>The trouble is: his definition of "Meritocracy" is too academic. The real world of "Meritocracy" is not just those who are in the EM1 or Top schools with so many "A"s but he judged everybody said to be talent by the book cover. So since 1970s, every election we have all the academic "MPs who are of a certain calibre measured by the degrees or status.<br><br>So today, we need practical talents in every field and many practical talents who started businesses and new technologies are not of the academic categories and many of them in fact score poorly in examinations. They are people who are passionate and interested in something of use to starting a business or trade. This kind of talent is what we really need and this kind of people know how to do something with what they have learned. Many of them are our innovators and inventors of new products and new systems.<br><br>So after many years of academic meritocracy, MOM produced a lot of students who are high on academic but with little to offer in applying practical knowledge and start new technologies to create new jobs.<br><br>Broad-based education has been neglected for years by the MOM. Many people posted views about this neglected aspect of our education because very few people dared to disagree with his systematic push for meritocracy and assumption.<br><br>One man being too strong in promoting his ideas can lead to narrow academic auto-piloting without anyone being able to correct the mistakes until it is too late.<br><br>Other major policy errors of MM Lee are posted in the "20 Major Policy errors of the government" The feedback unit did not bother to acknowledge these problems nor reply to people who wanted change. Now there is some change to pro-foreign assumptions which hit the locals real hard. But his system is to copy ideas and keep quiet and come out to say his system is working again. Sincerity is not there to manage acccording to true talents but only by many book worms who mess up the economy with no ideas that work, as seen in the 1970s. If we have more choices there will be mass participation and practical knowledge application in all fields and Singapore today could have become a far more competitive and vibrant society.<br></div>

PAP party members cannot disagree withe the party's consensus in parliament or they risk being expelled. So the only way to oppose is through a non-pap member.</div>
