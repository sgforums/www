              <h1>PAP MP Seah Kian Peng argued for more spending to help new immigrants “integrate” with Singaporeans</h1>
              <div class="date">
              <div class="dateleft">
              <p><span class="time">March 4, 2010</span></p>
              <p>In yet another sign that the ruling party is fast losing touch with the ground, another PAP MP Seah Kian Peng has spoken out forcefully in support of immigrants.</p>
              </div>
              </div>
              <p>Not satisfied with a mega $10 million dollar Community Integration Fund unveiled by Minister Dr Vivian Balakrishnan last year to tackle a snowballing problem that is largely its own doing – the inability of the immigrants to assimilate into Singapore society as too many of them have come within too short a period of time, Mr Seah now calls on more spending to make the newcomers feel “part of us.”</p>
              <p><em>“First, we need to make sure that they are called new Singaporeans rather than new migrants. They are not even new migrants – they are an old hand at migrating, and want a new life. They want to settle down and to make Singapore a new home,” </em>he said during the parliamentary session yesterday.</p>
              <p>Due to the PAP’s liberal immigration policies, foreigners now make up 36 percent of Singapore’s population, up from 14 percent in 1990. Of the remaining 64 percent who are citizens, an increasing number are born overseas.</p>
              <p>According to figures from the Home Affairs Ministry, there were over 70,000 PRs and 20,000 new citizens in 2008. Two out of every three PR applicants are successful and there is no minimum residency period unlike in other countries.</p>
              <p><em>“We have not done any large scale survey, we do not know their problems but we have already gone ahead and decided that the funds will go towards organizing activities…..What we ought to do is first – find out what new Singaporeans need, and then target funding at helping them meet these needs,” </em>he added.</p>
              <p>Instead of spending precious public resources to find out what the new immigrants need, why not ask what Singaporeans really need?</p>
              <p>Why should taxpayers’ monies be used to pay for a glaring mistake made by the PAP? If it had not opened the floodgates to accept so many foreigners at the same time, will we be experiencing problems in integrating them now?</p>
              <p>There are few incentives for the newcomers to fraternize and reach out to the native Singaporeans as so many of their compatriots are already in Singapore that they don’t feel out of place.</p>
              <p>As a result, they tend to congregate among themselves within a closely-knitted community leading to the emergence of ethnic enclaves in the HDB heartlands.</p>
              <p>Had the PAP slowed down the intake of foreigners and exercised more discretion in the selection of those to become new citizens, we will not need to spend a single cent more on such ineffective integration policies.</p>
              <p>With elections around the corner, this may be another gimmick to woo the new citizens to the PAP’s side and shore up its flagging support base.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans should send a strong message to the PAP in the next general election that they will not allow anymore public monies to be spent on the immigrants.</p>
              <p>Perhaps Mr Seah should set up a fund contributed by all PAP MPs to sponsor his own “integration” programs since he is so infatuated with the new citizens and whatever.</p>

              <p>The funniest part about singaporeans is tho they act strong and macho in public, but deep inside all fear the govt, so it end up all talking in forum, nets and other channel using different nicks here and there, but that is not going to work. The Deaf Frog can't hear you.</p>
              <p>Let me tell you truly, if the kind of situation, that is bringing mass foreigners in the country, happen in Taiwan, my birthplace, i think the national assembly will be put on fire and the govt running for their life, you can see mafias, butchers, bar girls, teachers and all walk of life going after them. But in Singapore, all talk only. So easy for the govt. Haiz, no wonder my Taiwan's Uncle Li Aw said, "singaporean are stupid"</p>

              <p>New citizens will surely be impressed by MPs who suddenly go all out to help them now.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But after a few years when these new citizens become old citizens, their problems will play second fiddle to another batch of new citizens entering the country.</p>

              <p>I am sure if history is to be repeated, the Taiwanese will swim to Sg when communist decide to cross the strait to land at your ports. I am dead sure because Taiwanese is so economically intergrated with your PRC motherland that no Taiwanese will ever lift a hand to fight off your communist money godfather.</p>
              <p>Yes, we are not as demoratic as compare to Taiwan but at least we dont have Parliament wayang show and kick boxing like that in Taiwan.</p>

              all talking in forum, nets and other channel using different nicks

              bringing mass foreigners in the country, happen in Taiwan, my
              birthplace, i think the national assembly will be put on fire and
              the govt running for their life, you can see mafias, butchers, bar
              girls, teachers and all walk of life going after them. But in
              Singapore, all talk only. So easy for the govt. Haiz, no wonder my

              <p>I agree. So many complain and complain, but when it comes to their turn to vote, they say scared PAP will trace their votes so they still vote for PAP. Useless buggers. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
