            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Office didn't check to see if there was permit even though he was assigned to do so </strong><br>28 Nov 07<br><br>Police witness Charles Soon Fook Kong indicated that even though he had been despatched to Woodlands MRT Station on 8 Apr 07 to check on whether SDP members were giving speeches without a permit, he did not do so.<br><br>This, according to Mr Soon, was because when he arrived at the scene he saw a large crowd and was more concerned whether there would be disorderly behaviour.<br><br>After about 10 to 15 minutes, however, the officer said that the crowd was well-behaved.<br><br>"After you concluded that the crowd was well-behaved, why did you not check to see if the SDP had a permit for the activity?" Dr Chee asked on cross-examination.<br><br>"There could be still be potential disorder," replied the witness.<br><br>"Would you have warned us to stop speaking if you had discovered that we did not have a permit?" Dr Chee asked.<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>"If that's the case then wouldn't it have made more sense to quickly check with the SDP if there was a permit and if there wasn't, advise the members to stop the activity right away to avoid potential problems?"<br><br>"No, the checking could be done later on," Officer Soon insisted.<br><br>Earlier on, Mr Soon had said that he not seen the copy of The New Democrat that was being sold that day.<br><br>When presented a copy on the stand, Mr Soon said that this was the first time he had seen the newspaper.<br><br>But Mr Yap Keng Ho noticed that Mr Soon was seen in the video-tape carrying a newspaper that looked like The New Democrat.<br><br>When asked if the newspaper Mr Soon was carrying was indeed The New Democrat, the police witness replied: "Maybe."<br><br>"How do you conduct your investigations if you don't even have a copy of the evidence?" Mr Yap wanted to know.<br><br>The witness avoided the question.<br><br>Mr Yap then asked for more time to review the video-tape because he wanted to see if there were more discrepancies between the officer's testimony and what was captured in the video-tape.<br><br>The hearing continues.<br><br><a href="http://www.singaporedemocrat.org/articleWoodlandsMRT_trial3.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.singaporedemocrat.org/articleWoodlandsMRT_trial3.html</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Prosecution makes a hash of evidence; DPP confers with witness outside courtroom </strong><br>28 Nov 07<br><br>The second day of the trial of Dr Chee Soon Juan and Mr Yap Keng Ho saw the police making a hash of their own evidence.<br><br>The two men are being charged with speaking without a permit on 8 April 07 at the Woodlands MRT Station while selling SDP's newspaper, The New Democrat.<br><br>The second prosecution witness, Station Inspector Charles Soon Fook Kong, took the stand and testified that he had directed his colleague, Sgt Lam Tien Chiang, to take photographs of the area where the SDP members were selling its newspaper.<br><br>Mr Soon said that he did this at around 5 pm after the SDP had left the area. The photographs were tended in court as exhibits.<br><br>Deputy Public Prosecutor Lim Tse Haw affirmed that the time the photographs were taken (as indicated on the envelope containing the photographs) was 5 pm.<br><br>Upon cross-examination, however, Dr Chee pointed out that one of the photographs showed a clock on the MRT Station which showed 3:47 pm.<br><br>During the lunch break the DPP, upon the defendants' request, had the photograph enlarged.<br><br>Upon closer scrutiny, DPP Lim agreed that the time shown on the photograph was indeed 3:47 pm: "The hand on the left side is between 9 and 10, and the hand of the right side is between 3 and 4".<br><br>"In conventional terms," Dr Chee added, "the clock indicates three forty-seven pm. Is that right?"<br><br>"Yes," the Prosecutor said.<br><br>Turning to SI Charles Soon, Dr Chee asked if the witness agreed that the time in the photograph shown was 3:47 pm. Mr Soon agreed.<br><br>"Then why did you tell the court that the time the photographs were taken was five pm?" Dr Chee asked.<br><br>"You must ask Sgt Lam this question. He was the one who took the photographs," Mr Soon replied.<br><br>Which was what DPP Lim Tse Haw did. During the lunch break, the DPP had approached Sgt Lam about the "discrepancy".<br><br>Sgt Lam replied that it was a typographical error but added that he was not the one who had typed the information on the envelope. That was the Crime Department's job.<br><br>Be that as it may, what was DPP Lim doing talking to Sgt Lam who was going to be one of the witnesses?<br><br>"Is it proper for the DPP to communicate this to Sergeant Lam during the break?" Dr Chee enquired.<br><br>Judge Jasvender Kaur replied that the DPP knows the rules of court and that there was nothing wrong for the DPP to communicate with a witness as long as he didn't coach or influence the witness.<br><br>"But the DPP was communicating with a witness who had yet to take the stand about proceedings that had taken place in the courtroom," Dr Chee argued.<br><br>In the ensuing exchange with Judge Kaur, Dr Chee pointed out that in his previous trial, an investigation officer who was present in the courtroom was seen communicating with other police witnesses who had not yet testified.<br><br>The judge, Eddie Tham, had then said that the incident was "regrettable" and admitted that it was "not proper" for the officer to be in the courtroom while his colleagues gave evidence.<br><br>The only different in the present case was the DPP, and not the investigating officer, who had communicated with a witness about something that had transpired during court proceedings.<br><br>"Why couldn't the DPP ask Sergeant Lam the question in court when the witness took the stand and was under oath?" Dr Chee asked.<br><br>The Judge turned to the DPP.<br><br>"My point is that I saw the need to clarify with Sergeant Lam," DPP Lim replied.<br><br>"I think we all saw the need for Sergeant Lam to clarify the discrepancy," Dr Chee countered. "But that's not my question. The question I asked was why couldn't you ask the sergeant the question on the stand instead of during the lunch break?"<br><br>DPP Lim replied: "Sergeant Lam hasn't come to the stand yet."<br><br>"Again you have avoided answering my question. I know Mr Lam hasn't taken the stand yet. But my question, once again, is: Why could you not have clarified with Sergeant Lam the discrepancy when he takes the stand instead of doing it out of court?" Dr Chee repeated.<br><br>Judge Kaur stepped in, declared that the DPP had answered Dr Chee's question and adjourned the hearing.<br><br>Readers can judge for themselves whether the DPP was prevaricating or not.<br><br>The hearing continues tomorrow at 9:30 am at Subordinate Court 7.<br><br><a href="http://www.singaporedemocrat.org/articleWoodlandsMRT_trial2.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.singaporedemocrat.org/articleWoodlandsMRT_trial2.html</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Who's lying Â– DPP or police sergeant?</strong><br>28 Nov 07<br><br>The controversy over a mistake made by the prosecution team deepened on the third day of Dr Chee Soon Juan's and Mr Yap Keng Ho's trial at the Subordinate Courts.<br><br>The fourth police witness, Staff Sergeant Lam Tien Chiang, took the stand today and gave evidence that directly contradicted what DPP Lim Tse Haw told the Judge.<br><br>At issue were four photographs that were stapled together inside a pink paper jacket. Printed on the cover was the time that the photographs were taken.<br><br>The copies that were given to the Judge and the defendants were marked 1545 hrs (3:45 pm). The DPP's copy read 1700 hrs (5 pm).<br><br>When queried by defendants, DPP Lim said in court yesterday that there was an error and the correct time was 5 pm and not 3:45 pm.<br><br>Mr Lim told the Judge that he had checked with Sgt Lam during a break yesterday about the discrepancy and Sgt Lam had told him that it was a typographical error and that the time indicated should have been 5 pm (see here).<br><br>Shockingly when Sgt Lam took the stand today he said under cross-examination by Dr Chee that no one, not even DPP Lim, had mentioned to him about the time error on the pink cover sheet.<br><br>This was what transpired according to Judge Jasvender Kaur's record:<br><br>Dr Chee: Did anyone talk to you about the error here (holding up the pink sheet and pointing to the time that the photographs were taken)?<br><br>Sgt Lam: No.<br><br>Dr Chee: Did the DPP talk to you about this error?<br><br>Sgt Lam: No.<br><br>Dr Chee: Did the DPP mention to you at all about the error or discrepancy?<br><br>Sgt Lam: No.<br><br>Dr Chee: At anytime before you took the stand today did the DPP mention anything to you at all?<br><br>Sgt Lam: No.<br><br>The police witness had earlier testified that it was the first time that he had come to know of the errors when he went into the witness box.<br><br>This directly contradicted what DPP Lim Tse Haw told the court yesterday. He said (again from the Judge's record): "With respect to the typographical error on the cover sheet of why my copy showed 1700 hours and others showed 1545 hours, Sergeant Lam told me that he did not prepare the cover sheet. That was done by the crime clerk."<br><br>At this juncture Dr Chee asked the Judge to send Sgt Lam back to the Witness Room so that he could clarify the matter with the DPP out of the witness' earshot.<br><br>DPP Lim then explained: "I think Sergeant Lam was there when I spoke to ASP Jeremy Koh and Inspector Jason Lim..."<br><br>Dr Chee interjected: "What do you mean 'think'. If Sergeant Lam had spoken to you, how can you only 'think' he was there."<br><br>The DPP would only repeat: "I think he was there." And then added: "The situation was very dynamic."<br><br>Judge Kaur then explained to the DPP what Dr Chee was getting at: If Sergeant Lam had spoken to Mr Lim as the DPP had indicated, then he cannot say he 'thinks' Sergeant Lam was present.<br><br>It was only then that the DPP was willing to confirm that Sergeant Lam was present at the meeting.<br><br>The flustered DPP even objected to the use of the word "meeting". "It was not a meeting!" Mr Lim insisted.<br><br>"All right," said Dr Chee, "is 'a get-together' any better?"<br><br>Dr Chee pursued: "And why is it only now that the DPP is telling us that he had met with ASP Jeremy Koh and Inspector Jason Lim when he said nothing at all about these two yesterday. Remember, Your Honour, both ASP Koh and Inspector Lim are also witnesses who have yet to give evidence."<br><br>Given that the information was coming out in bits and pieces and contradictory with Sgt Lam's testimony, Dr Chee asked for the DPP to take the stand.<br><br>"I would like DPP Lim to tell the court under oath exactly what happened when he met with the officers. Otherwise he should give a sworn statement as to what transpired," Dr Chee said.<br><br>Judge Kaur said no to both applications.<br><br>And when asked when did he meet the officers, the DPP said he could not remember.<br><br>"What do you mean you can't remember? You must have met with them either yesterday or the day before. The trial started on only Tuesday. Did you meet them on Tuesday or Wednesday?"<br><br>The Prosecutor thumbed through his notes, turned to his assistant who was furiously checking through her notes on her laptop, and then said that he could not remember.<br><br>He then asked the Judge for help as to when the error on the pink cover sheet was first raised.<br><br>"I think it was raised shortly after the trial began on Tuesday," Judge Kaur said, referring to her record.<br><br>Incredibly, Mr Lim replied: "Yes, then it must have been Tuesday or Wednesday."<br><br>An exasperated Dr Chee said: "We know that it was on Tuesday or Wednesday! It has to be, because the trial started on Tuesday and today is Thursday. So when did the get-together take place: Tuesday or Wednesday?"<br><br>Then came the mother of all prevarications: "Yes, either Tuesday or Wednesday."<br><br>(A interesting test: Can readers remember whom you met and where you were either yesterday or the day before? Is it so hard to recall events over the last two days?)<br><br>"I am not asking you something that took place a year ago. I am asking you to remember events that happened only one or two days ago," Dr Chee pointed out. "Besides, we were in court all day these past two days. Surely it can't be difficult to remember which day you met with the witnesses."<br><br>"I can't remember," DPP Lim insisted.<br><br>"You can't remember or you don't want to remember?" Dr Chee said.<br><br>Judge Kaur came to the rescue: "He said he can't remember."<br><br>Since he couldn't get a straight answer from Mr Lim, Dr Chee then turned to the DPP's assistant, Ms Wendy Yap, who was seated beside Mr Lim taking notes.<br><br>Dr Chee had wanted to know if Ms Yap had spoken to any of the police witnesses and, if yes, when.<br><br>"I am the lead prosecutor and any questions should be asked of me," Mr Lim insisted.<br><br>"I just want her to confirm if she had spoken to any of the witnesses on her own without DPP Lim knowing," Dr Chee said.<br><br>Judge Kaur turned to Ms Yap and asked if she would like to respond.<br><br>"I was in and out of the room and saw DPP Lim talking to some of the witnesses but I didn't hear what was being said," the assistant DPP replied.<br><br>The Judge ended the session which had gone past 6 pm.<br><br>Will Sgt Lam Tien Chiang change his testimony? Or will DPP Lim Tse Haw change his story? Or will some other explanation be found overnight?<br><br>Find out when the hearing continues tomorrow when Sgt Lam gets back into the witness box.<br><br><a href="http://www.singaporedemocrat.org/articleWoodlandsMRT_trial4.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.singaporedemocrat.org/articleWoodlandsMRT_trial4.html</a></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Singapore's Political Judges</strong><br><br>Ladies and Gentlemen,<br><br>The Singapore state owned and controlled newspapers report that Dr. Chee Soon Juan, Secretary General of the Singapore Democratic Party, an opposition political party and Mr. Yap Keng Ho, an opposition political activist are being tried in Court No. 7, Subordinate Courts Singapore.<br><br>This is the second of a series of 8 related charges against them, on having violated an inappropriately worded legislation, Public Entertainments Act, which requires a permit for anyone who wishes to speak in public in Singapore. The charges relate to Dr. Chee and Mr. Yap asking passers by in Woodlands MRT to buy a copy of the newspaper Â“The Singapore DemocratÂ” which is the official newspaper of Dr. Chee's political party.<br><br>The Judge is Jusvender Kaur.<br><br>But even though the Singapore state owned and controlled newspapers say this, what is happening in Court No. 7 is not a trial at all. It is a complete farce, a mockery of justice, a theatrical performance. Court No. 7 is actually a classroom. A classroom in which the teacher, Mr. Lee Kuan Yew is teaching Dr. Chee and Mr. Yap a lesson.<br><br>That lesson is that Singaporeans should not ever criticize him or his government. And since these 2 individuals had the temerity and gall to do it, they must be punished. And they will be punished. And the punishment will be meted out by his agent, Judge Jusvender Kaur who is presiding in Court No. 7, who has been commissioned to carry out the dirty work.<br><br>And Mr. Lee Kuan Yew wants this lesson to be learnt not only by these 2 individuals who were, in his opinion, stupid enough to challenge him; but by all of Singapore. The moral of the drama which will conclude soon with both Dr. Chee and Mr. Yap going to jail, is for all Singaporeans to fully understand that if any of you are so silly as to go about criticizing Mr. Lee Kuan Yew, he will release his attack dog, Judge Jusvender Kaur upon you. So beware.<br><br>I am going to tell you this. Judge Jusvender Kaur has already made up her mind to convict these 2 men even before she had ever stepped into the courtroom the first day. It does not matter what the evidence is, these 2 men will be convicted anyway. They are the 2 sacrificial lambs going to the slaughter because they have offended Mr. Lee Kuan Yew.<br><br>Judge Jusvender Kaur in this perversion is not a judge at all. She has now adopted the role of a PAP politician. And as an enforcer for Lee Kuan Yew, it is her duty to polish off these 2 men because that is what Mr. Lee Kuan Yew wants. She will do anything that he wants, since the whole exercise here is not to seek justice. It is political work. The purpose is to demolish Lee's political opponents.<br><br>This is what is happening in the courts of Lee Kuan Yew's self proclaimed first world country.<br><br>I had earlier written a post on the movie Judgment at Nuremburg about Nazi judges being tried at the Nuremburg war crimes trials in 1948 after the war. Please refer to the post: Judgement at Nuremburg and the trials in Singapore Courts. The reader will see the similarities. As in the Feldenstein case in Judgment at Nuremburg, it really did not matter whether the old Jew had defiled the 16 year old German girl. No, that did not matter at all. What mattered was that Feldenstien must be punished not for anything he did but simply because he was a Jew.<br><br>Just as in Dr. Chee's case, it does not matter if in fact the evidence was in his favor. No, that does not form part of the equation at all. What matters is that Dr. Chee was bold enough to publicly criticize none other that Mr. Lee Kuan Yew. That alone, in Singapore of today, demands punishment. And Jusvender Kaur has been commissioned to carry that out.<br><br>I am of course speaking as if the trial is over and the Judge had delivered her verdict, even though the trial is still going on. But you see, in the entire history of Singapore, there has not even been one case where the government has proceeded against a political opponent and lost. Therefore I am prepared to bet a million to one that both Dr. Chee and Mr. Yap will be convicted of the crime; as sure as the sun will rise tomorrow. Similarly for Feldenstein before the Nazi judges, the Messiah would himself have to come from Heaven to save Feldentstein from the gallows.<br><br>But if Jusvender Kaur had been a real judge, you can see there are several reasons why the charge should be thrown out.<br><br>First look at the title of the Statute! Public Entertainments Act! Anyone can see that it was never the intention of Dr. Chee and his colleague to provide entertainment to anyone. This was serious business. They were selling their newspaper which contained important news that Singaporeans would want to know. A real judge can say that as it was not "entertainment", and since the statute was about entertainers and since neither was one, the defendants should be released.<br><br>Second, the Judge should say that since Lee Kuan Yew claims that Singapore is a first world country and even a wrote a book about it; first world countries all allow their people freedom of speech, and therefore, since prosecuting these 2 men goes against the very definition of the country being Â“first worldÂ”, they should be acquitted.<br><br>Third, since the Constitution is the supreme law of the land, and since it permits freedom of speech, these prosecutions are without basis.<br><br>Four, since the Public Entertainments Act requiring permits for public speaking is a direct violation of the Constitutional provision of the right to free speech; the Act itself is illegal and should be struck.<br><br>Five, what the men did, did not amount to making speeches at all. They were selling their newspaper. Look at the dictionary for the meaning of Â“speechÂ”.<br><br>Six, since throughout the entire history of Singapore, the police have never even once given the opposition any permits to do anything in public, the defendants are absolved from requiring permits. This law is a political law to demolish opponents.<br><br>Seven, the equal protection clause in the constitution is violated. If the fishmonger can ask passers by to buy his fish, Dr. Chee should be able to ask passers by to purchase his newspaper, keeping in mind that the fishmonger had not written to Central Police Station for a permit, before he committed his act.<br><br>But of course, this line of reasoning would only be in the mind of a real judge. Jusvender Kaur as you know is not now in that role. Her job is to finish off both these men and send the correct signals to all Singaporeans in the island. Behave yourself, or else.<br><br>But is Dr. Chee, after all, learning any lesson from all this? Has Mr. Yap learned anything? It appears entirely the contrary. It appears that Dr. Chee and Mr. Yap are determined not to learn anything from their teacher Mr. Lee Kuan Yew. Instead they have both told me personally that they will criticize this Lee Kuan Yew as many times and as and when they like, if criticism is warranted. This is where the problem for Lee Kuan Yew lies.<br><br>Lee Kuan Yew has himself admitted in his Machiavellian way that unless his subjects fear him, he is nothing. This is the problem. These 2 men are not prepared to be afraid of him. So in the end, Lee Kuan Yew's actions become counterproductive. I write this blog in criticism of him. Others the world over read it. Others become emboldened. There begins to sprout more and more Dr. Chee Soon Juans and Mr. Yaps. Others begin to see the injustice in this case. They see the injustices of Lee Kuan Yew. As a result in disgust Singaporeans emigrate. European countries begin to shun Singapore as a dictatorship which they can easily avoid. Foreign businesses begin to leave.<br><br>On the whole, Lee Kuan Yew should understand that it is not in his interest to prosecute these 2 men, since in the end, justice always triumphs and justice is on the side of Dr. Chee and Mr. Yap.<br><br>And so is common sense.<br><br>Gopalan Nair<br><br><a href="http://singaporedissident.blogspot.com/2007/11/singapores-political-judges.html" rel="nofollow">http://singaporedissident.blogspot.com/2007/11/singapores-political-judges.html</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>this is really getting ridiculous<br><br>from what i see, the entire defence is made up of logic a child would use. If you want to be an opposing force to the government, at least act like adults.<br><br>1) other hawkers aren't arrested. That's as valid a point as the one my mom made this morning, that she should have run the red light because the taxi next to her did. Just because you got arrested and others didn't doesn't mean you're innocent bud.<br><br>2) Time of offence. Hello, how is that in any way relevant to your case?<br><br>3) Selling political newspapers vs political speech. Hello? Does either of them sound like they'll get you off the hook?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If the DPP or police witness is telling the truth, the testimony should be simple and direct and easy to remember. If they lie, there's contradiction in their evidence. That's the universal fact.<br><br>Of course, in a kangaroo court, it becomes false.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by Poh Ah Pak:<br><br><strong>[b]Who's lying Â– DPP or police sergeant?</strong><br>28 Nov 07<br><br>The controversy over a mistake made by the prosecution team deepened on the third day of Dr Chee Soon Juan's and Mr Yap Keng Ho's trial at the Subordinate Courts.<br><br>The fourth police witness, Staff Sergeant Lam Tien Chiang, took the stand today and gave evidence that directly contradicted what DPP Lim Tse Haw told the Judge.<br><br>At issue were four photographs that were stapled together inside a pink paper jacket. Printed on the cover was the time that the photographs were taken.<br><br>The copies that were given to the Judge and the defendants were marked 1545 hrs (3:45 pm). The DPP's copy read 1700 hrs (5 pm).<br><br>When queried by defendants, DPP Lim said in court yesterday that there was an error and the correct time was 5 pm and not 3:45 pm.<br><br>Mr Lim told the Judge that he had checked with Sgt Lam during a break yesterday about the discrepancy and Sgt Lam had told him that it was a typographical error and that the time indicated should have been 5 pm (see here).<br><br>Shockingly when Sgt Lam took the stand today he said under cross-examination by Dr Chee that no one, not even DPP Lim, had mentioned to him about the time error on the pink cover sheet.<br><br>This was what transpired according to Judge Jasvender Kaur's record:<br><br>Dr Chee: Did anyone talk to you about the error here (holding up the pink sheet and pointing to the time that the photographs were taken)?<br><br>Sgt Lam: No.<br><br>Dr Chee: Did the DPP talk to you about this error?<br><br>Sgt Lam: No.<br><br>Dr Chee: Did the DPP mention to you at all about the error or discrepancy?<br><br>Sgt Lam: No.<br><br>Dr Chee: At anytime before you took the stand today did the DPP mention anything to you at all?<br><br>Sgt Lam: No.<br><br>The police witness had earlier testified that it was the first time that he had come to know of the errors when he went into the witness box.<br><br>This directly contradicted what DPP Lim Tse Haw told the court yesterday. He said (again from the Judge's record): "With respect to the typographical error on the cover sheet of why my copy showed 1700 hours and others showed 1545 hours, Sergeant Lam told me that he did not prepare the cover sheet. That was done by the crime clerk."<br><br>At this juncture Dr Chee asked the Judge to send Sgt Lam back to the Witness Room so that he could clarify the matter with the DPP out of the witness' earshot.<br><br>DPP Lim then explained: "I think Sergeant Lam was there when I spoke to ASP Jeremy Koh and Inspector Jason Lim..."<br><br>Dr Chee interjected: "What do you mean 'think'. If Sergeant Lam had spoken to you, how can you only 'think' he was there."<br><br>The DPP would only repeat: "I think he was there." And then added: "The situation was very dynamic."<br><br>Judge Kaur then explained to the DPP what Dr Chee was getting at: If Sergeant Lam had spoken to Mr Lim as the DPP had indicated, then he cannot say he 'thinks' Sergeant Lam was present.<br><br>It was only then that the DPP was willing to confirm that Sergeant Lam was present at the meeting.<br><br>The flustered DPP even objected to the use of the word "meeting". "It was not a meeting!" Mr Lim insisted.<br><br>"All right," said Dr Chee, "is 'a get-together' any better?"<br><br>Dr Chee pursued: "And why is it only now that the DPP is telling us that he had met with ASP Jeremy Koh and Inspector Jason Lim when he said nothing at all about these two yesterday. Remember, Your Honour, both ASP Koh and Inspector Lim are also witnesses who have yet to give evidence."<br><br>Given that the information was coming out in bits and pieces and contradictory with Sgt Lam's testimony, Dr Chee asked for the DPP to take the stand.<br><br>"I would like DPP Lim to tell the court under oath exactly what happened when he met with the officers. Otherwise he should give a sworn statement as to what transpired," Dr Chee said.<br><br>Judge Kaur said no to both applications.<br><br>And when asked when did he meet the officers, the DPP said he could not remember.<br><br>"What do you mean you can't remember? You must have met with them either yesterday or the day before. The trial started on only Tuesday. Did you meet them on Tuesday or Wednesday?"<br><br>The Prosecutor thumbed through his notes, turned to his assistant who was furiously checking through her notes on her laptop, and then said that he could not remember.<br><br>He then asked the Judge for help as to when the error on the pink cover sheet was first raised.<br><br>"I think it was raised shortly after the trial began on Tuesday," Judge Kaur said, referring to her record.<br><br>Incredibly, Mr Lim replied: "Yes, then it must have been Tuesday or Wednesday."<br><br>An exasperated Dr Chee said: "We know that it was on Tuesday or Wednesday! It has to be, because the trial started on Tuesday and today is Thursday. So when did the get-together take place: Tuesday or Wednesday?"<br><br>Then came the mother of all prevarications: "Yes, either Tuesday or Wednesday."<br><br>(A interesting test: Can readers remember whom you met and where you were either yesterday or the day before? Is it so hard to recall events over the last two days?)<br><br>"I am not asking you something that took place a year ago. I am asking you to remember events that happened only one or two days ago," Dr Chee pointed out. "Besides, we were in court all day these past two days. Surely it can't be difficult to remember which day you met with the witnesses."<br><br>"I can't remember," DPP Lim insisted.<br><br>"You can't remember or you don't want to remember?" Dr Chee said.<br><br>Judge Kaur came to the rescue: "He said he can't remember."<br><br>Since he couldn't get a straight answer from Mr Lim, Dr Chee then turned to the DPP's assistant, Ms Wendy Yap, who was seated beside Mr Lim taking notes.<br><br>Dr Chee had wanted to know if Ms Yap had spoken to any of the police witnesses and, if yes, when.<br><br>"I am the lead prosecutor and any questions should be asked of me," Mr Lim insisted.<br><br>"I just want her to confirm if she had spoken to any of the witnesses on her own without DPP Lim knowing," Dr Chee said.<br><br>Judge Kaur turned to Ms Yap and asked if she would like to respond.<br><br>"I was in and out of the room and saw DPP Lim talking to some of the witnesses but I didn't hear what was being said," the assistant DPP replied.<br><br>The Judge ended the session which had gone past 6 pm.<br><br>Will Sgt Lam Tien Chiang change his testimony? Or will DPP Lim Tse Haw change his story? Or will some other explanation be found overnight?<br><br>Find out when the hearing continues tomorrow when Sgt Lam gets back into the witness box.<br><br><a href="http://www.singaporedemocrat.org/articleWoodlandsMRT_trial4.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.singaporedemocrat.org/articleWoodlandsMRT_trial4.html</a>[/b]</blockquote></div>
