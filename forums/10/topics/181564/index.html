            <div class='col-md body'>Straits Time<br><br>March 11, 2006<br>Opposition guns for 57 seats after reaching electoral pact<br><br>By Peh Shing Huei and Ken Kwek<br><br>OPPOSITION parties last night met to carve a pact and settled on an ambitious line-up of 57 seats that they intend to gun for at the coming polls.<br><br>If this best case scenario happens for them, the People's Action Party (PAP) will not be returned to power on Nomination Day for the first time since the 1991 General Election.<br><br>Who wants what<br><br>Workers' Party: Hougang, Joo Chiat, Nee Soon East, Aljunied GRC, Ang Mo Kio GRC, East Coast GRC, Sembawang GRC<br><br>Singapore Democratic Alliance: Chua Chu Kang, MacPherson*, Potong Pasir, Yio Chu Kang, Jalan Besar GRC, Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC, Tampines GRC<br><br>Singapore Democratic Party: Bukit Panjang, Nee Soon Central, Holland-Bukit Timah GRC, Jurong GRC<br><br>Democratic Progressive Party: MacPherson*<br><br>Note: *MacPherson single-seat ward is under neogotiation between DPP and SDA<br><br>After meeting for nearly an hour, more than 20 opposition figures agreed to take up nine out of the 14 group representation constituencies and all nine single-seats.<br><br>Whether they will eventually field candidates in all 57 seats remains uncertain. A more realistic figure would be closer to the low 40s, sources told The Straits Times later.<br><br>The agreement was arrived at amicably, said veteran opposition figure Chiam See Tong at an impromptu press conference after the pow-wow at PKMS building in Changi Road.<br><br>'We had a very good, fruitful meeting. We have come to a happy conclusion that there will be no three-cornered contests,' he said.<br><br>Last night's meeting marked a watershed of sorts for the opposition for reaching a pact early on and for revealing their choice of possible seats to boot.<br><br>In previous polls, opposition parties tended to keep their cards completely hidden until Nomination Day. It appears to stem from a desire to want to be known to voters in advance and not be accused of being political Johnny-come-latelys to their wards of choice.<br><br>But a little element of surprise remains. For example, the Workers' Party (WP), deemed the party to watch because of its concerted groundwork over the past few years, openly reserved four GRCs.<br><br>These are Ang Mo Kio GRC, helmed by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, Aljunied GRC, Sembawang GRC and East Coast GRC.<br><br>But WP chairman Sylvia Lim said: 'We have named four GRCs, but in the end we may go for three.'<br><br>The dropped GRC will likely be either Ang Mo Kio or Sembawang.<br><br>It is also aiming for three single-seats: its own Hougang, led by WP secretary-general Low Thia Khiang, Joo Chiat and Nee Soon East.<br><br>The Singapore Democratic Alliance (SDA) led by Mr Chiam settled on the Pasir Ris-Punggol, Jalan Besar, and Tampines GRCs, along with his own Potong Pasir seat which he has held since 1984.<br><br>The Singapore Democratic Party (SDP) got Jurong GRC and prevailed over one new single-seat - Bukit Panjang.<br><br>Mr Yip Yew Weng, president of the National Solidarity Party, which is part of the SDA, had made first bid for the seat. But last night he deferred to SDP chairman Ling How Doong, whose PAP opponent may be Mr Teo Ho Pin.<br><br>Mr Yip will move to the other new single-seat, Yio Chu Kang, where the PAP's Mr Seng Han Thong may be fielded.<br><br>Only one single seat, MacPherson, still has two bidders - the Democratic Progressive Party and the Singapore People's Party. It will be settled amicably, said Mr Chiam.<br><br>The most prominent opposition leader in attendance last night was Mr Chiam. Mr Low had a prior engagement, said colleague Miss Lim.<br><br>The 57 of 84 seats the parties reserved last night is the best case scenario, but unlikely to come to pass. Sources said that the parties may give up as many as three GRCs due to a lack of resources. If so, the contested seats would drop to 41.<br><br>But two unknown factors remain: the emergence of independents and the play that veteran opposition figure J.B. Jeyaretnam is likely to make. He said he intends to contest, provided he can annul himself from bankruptcy at a hearing on Tuesday.<br><br>He sent a representative to last night's meeting, who gave nothing away.<br><br>'He has a very bad sore throat and could not speak properly,' said Mr Chiam.<br><br>ADDITIONAL REPORTING BY AARON LOW AND SUE-ANN CHIA<br></div>
