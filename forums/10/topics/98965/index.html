            <div class='col-md body'>Oct 21, 2004<br>Election fever hits some opposition parties<br>Recruitment drives and ward visits stepped up; PAP takes note<br><br>By Azhar Khalid and Sue-Ann Chia<br><br>ELECTION fever appears to have infected some opposition parties, with<br>symptoms such as more intense ground activities recruitment drives for<br>candidates.<br><br>And this has not gone undetected by the men and women in white.<br><br>The Straits Times understands that a confidential People's Action<br>Party report circulated to its MPs early this year had commented on<br>how opposition activities 'have intensified'.<br><br>The National Solidarity Party (NSP), for instance, started gearing up<br>for election late last year, said Mr Steve Chia, a Non-Constituency MP<br>and central executive committee member.<br><br>'We knew then that there was going to be a political handover and the<br>new prime minister could call for an early election,' he said.<br><br>While he is now expecting it to be called after the presidential polls<br>next September, the NSP is not taking any chances. It has been holding<br>almost monthly tea receptions to reach out to potential members and<br>stepped up constituency visits to once a week recently.<br><br>Mr Chia said the areas targeted are those which were contested by the<br>Singapore Democratic Alliance (SDA) - a grouping of opposition parties<br>which includes NSP - in the 2001 polls.<br><br>These are: Chua Chu Kang, Bukit Timah, Jalan Besar GRC and Tampines GRC.<br><br>But he lamented that it has been difficult to sustain the pace of<br>visits due to a lack of resources and manpower.<br><br>The leader of SDA and veteran Potong Pasir MP Chiam See Tong said that<br>likely changes in electoral boundaries made planning difficult.<br><br>Still, his Singapore People's Party announced on its recently revamped<br>website that it was looking for new candidates and volunteers.<br><br>As for Mr Chiam himself, the 69-year-old said he is not retiring and<br>is focused on retaining Potong Pasir, which he has held since 1984.<br><br>A third member of the four-member SDA, the Singapore Malay National<br>Organisation (PKMS), has been a lot quieter, with the party content to<br>wait for directions from Mr Chiam, said party president Borhan Ariffin.<br><br>Over at the Workers' Party (WP), members have been pounding the<br>streets, almost on a weekly basis.<br><br>According to the information posted on its website, it has conducted<br>close to 100 visits, covering 17 constituencies ranging from its<br>Hougang stronghold, helmed by its chief and MP Low Thia Khiang, to<br>wards led by heavyweight ministers.<br><br>These include Ang Mo Kio GRC, which is headed by Prime Minister Lee<br>Hsien Loong, and Sembawang GRC, led by Deputy Prime Minister Tony Tan.<br><br>Aljunied seems to be a target Group Representation Constituency (GRC)<br>for the WP.<br><br>It has made 17 visits there so far, 11 of which were to areas in<br>Hougang, which fall within the GRC's boundaries.<br><br>As the GRC surrounds Mr Low's Hougang ward, the aim is to make<br>campaigning easier for the party should there be electoral boundary<br>changes before the next polls.<br><br>Next on the WP's target list: Jalan Besar GRC, which it has visited 16<br>times, 10 of which have been in the Geylang Bahru area.<br><br>But party executive council member Yaw Shin Leong would not confirm if<br>such activities, started soon after the 2001 polls, have escalated<br>recently. He was equally coy about the nature of these visits.<br><br>Instead, he referred The Straits Times to its website, which has a<br>notice for volunteers to help out in ground campaigns in the east<br>which it plans to ramp up.<br><br>The website also shows pictures of WP members - including top<br>office-bearers like Mr Low and chairman Sylvia Lim - out and about on<br>various activities, including door-to-door visits, market and food<br>centre tours, and selling or distributing party flyers and newsletters.<br><br>Unlike the WP, some opposition parties, such as the Singapore<br>Democratic Party (SDP), have not revved up their election engines.<br><br>Assistant secretary-general Wong Hong Toy said that the party has not<br>called a central executive committee meeting since party chief Chee<br>Soon Juan returned in mid- September after months abroad.<br><br>Said Mr Wong: 'Nothing has been discussed. So far, party activities on<br>the ground have been on an ad-hoc basis.'<br><br>But he insisted that the SDP is prepared if elections are called early.<br>Copyright ?2004 Singapore Press Holdings.

As his constituency boundaries<br>changed after the 2001 election, some of his activists moved to<br>neighbouring branches.<br><br>A quarter of his 40-strong election committee is new, he said.<br><br>He held a meeting recently at which he parcelled out duties and<br>appointed a new group to take care of logistics.<br><br>Cranking things up at the branch level also means checking that<br>equipment like fax lines and photocopiers are in working order.<br><br>But some older MPs are reluctant to kick-start the process too early.<br>Among them is Minister of State for Education Chan Soo Sen.<br><br>Recalling the many false alarms in the lead-up to the last election,<br>Mr Chan said he has honed his own way of gauging how quickly he can<br>mobilise his team.<br><br>If on National Day more than 200 of his Joo Chiat branch activists<br>show up for a flag-raising ceremony and breakfast, he knows he is in<br>good shape.<br><br>He gets them to wear party whites to the event.<br><br>'That way if an election is called, I can be sure they have uniforms<br>that fit,' he quipped.<br>Copyright ?2004 Singapore Press Holdings.
