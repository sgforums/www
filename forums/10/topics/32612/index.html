Bu t not so about their "simple minded presants" but more to do with their educated ruling class and trend towards Islamisation based on the ME's militant model. Dr Mathathir decades old affimative actions in Malaysia's NEP has helped the country  much, but his use of Islam to promote pro-bumi and Malayness had actually backfired as claimed in a recent AWSJ article.<br><br>They do have smart and hardworking bumis. Trouble is all we need is a few with extremist idea and their resourcefulness to carryout the orders or plan. Coupled with Singapore being the usual whipping-boy by the moderate Malaysian politicians, this Islamic radicals certainly find great convenience to paint the Republic as another "Israel".<br><br>I think recent escalation of event points to eventual flashpoint between the two countries not so much due to miss-communication or hidden agenda, but more do to with the political infightings when Dr M steps down after this yr GE elections.<br><br>Things will get very hot in KL, and consequentially so will the relation  with Singapore as the Malaysian rulers josal for influence in the coming months.<br><br>Singapore better brace themselves for more salvos from these<br>Malaysia politican zealots and their media .  Last thing we want is  to lost our cool by those JI-style plan and we start sending our  own 155mm salvos to  them.<br><br><img src="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/army/artillery_images/arti_picture_4.jpg"><br><br></div>
