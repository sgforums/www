              <p>A few years back it was $1600-1800.</p>
              <p>FTs are here to fill jobs that require experience and jobs that we lack talent in. They are not here to fight with fresh grads. A couple of years ago i remember someone kpkb about ang moh rig workers earning 10K+ even if they had no qualifications. Thing is these people risk their life/limbs working on the rigs for many many years, starting from the bottom..do we have people of their experience here or do we have students aispiring to be roustabouts on oil rigs and working their way up ?</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>i agree it was 1.6k to 1.8k few years back. some grads of this batch did contract jobs, temp jobs or had a day job and supplemented their income by giving tuition in the evenings. some employers are willing to pay more 4 this batch in current times due to their experience rather than pay more 4 fresh grads with no experience.</p>

              <p>They really destroyed our cultural identity with their destructive social engineering policies.</p>
              <p>Since no more identity, people find it easier to leave the country.</p>
              <p>Threat us as economic pawns and the country becomes lifeless and soulless.</p>

              <p>u all need to differentiate the old PAP and the new gang.</p>
              <p>the old PAP members did alot for the nation building, whom i respected well.</p>
              <p>the new gang just ride on the success of their predecessors and enjoy all the fruits of the past labour.</p>
              <p>if the old PAP guards are still alive today, they will definitely kick the arrogant new lots out.</p>
