              <p>Saw many threads here critising the PAP government mainly for the foreign talent and gst increase.</p>
              <p>While I am not a great supporter of PAP, I will like to offer some perspective on these 2 issues.</p>
              <p>GST increase</p>
              <p>- I think increasing GST is really no need for us to have such a big hoo ha reaction towards it. Afterall, prices including GST will increase. Moreover, the government will be giving us money too from the funds generated from increase in gst</p>
              <p>Foreign talent</p>
              <p>- Low wage foreigner workers doing jobs which singaporeans do not want such as construction worker etc.</p>
              <p>I think there is no need for us to be jealous of them as they are doing jobs which we singaporeans do not want.</p>
              <p>-High wage workers doing professional jobs such as Accountants etc.</p>
              <p>While we maybe angry that they are here to snatch jobs from us, why not think about it in this way.</p>
              <p>When these people come to singapore to work, being high wage earners, they will spend alot of money on food,education, rental or some may want to buy houses, leisure etc. When they spend money, these will generate the economy of Singapore which will in turn create more jobs for us.</p>
              <p>Moreover, these foreigners maybe earning alot of money but after deducting all the expenses, they do not really have that much money left.</p>
              <p>So why be jealous of them?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The only thing that I am not happy with these foreign talents is the government sponsoring their education fees in polytechnics and university which is alot of money</p>

              <p>A few years back it was $1600-1800.</p>
              <p>FTs are here to fill jobs that require experience and jobs that we lack talent in. They are not here to fight with fresh grads. A couple of years ago i remember someone kpkb about ang moh rig workers earning 10K+ even if they had no qualifications. Thing is these people risk their life/limbs working on the rigs for many many years, starting from the bottom..do we have people of their experience here or do we have students aispiring to be roustabouts on oil rigs and working their way up ?</p>

              <p>Singapore is trying to model after Switzerland.  Citizens of switzerland are migrates from all parts of Europe. This policy is both for economic and security reasons.  China will soon take over Japan as the second largest economy. There must be a blend of their breeds or settlers here in Singapore to prepare for more initimate relationship.</p>
              <p>Singapore and China are very close right from the start.  Have you ever questioned why we learnt the Simplified Chinese includes of Traditional Chinese used by Hong Kong and Taiwan?  Why Singaporean never need a Visa when traveling to China while the rest of the world need?</p>
              <p>I am not from the government.  But rest assured my fellow Singaporeans, one thing we can be comforted our government is not stupid.</p>

              <p>Things moved very fast in Singapore for the past couple of years. At one time STI doubled its value, more businesses set up base in Singapore etc. The boom in the finance sector was very apparent. Investment banks shifted operations to Singapore and you see more people wanting to go into wealth management as well. In fact, 3/4 of the people i know are either Personal Bankers/Financial Consultants/Relationship Managers/Private Bankers. Some started after poly/uni or switched lines.</p>

              <p>Foreign Talent is a concocted term. The US called these workers migrant workers. It is pronounced with a bit of detachment. Here the lable is used so that it goes down well with the citizens. Foreign talents, sounds much better than migrant workers.</p>
              <p>Tens of thousands jobs were reported created last year, and it was declared most of the jobs went to Singaporeans. Recently it was declared 61% of the jobs created went to foreigners.</p>
              <p>How is it that our citizens are not talented?</p>
              <p>Is it that India and China, even the Philippines and Vietnam, have got the right education policy, 10 years ago?</p>
