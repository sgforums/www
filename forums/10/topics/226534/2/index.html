Say you managed to save another $250,000 for CPF, monthly expenses for you and wife after retirement $1,500 p.m. ($18,000 p.a.). Interest rates of 3% (meaning you earn 3% when you leave your money in bank or cpf)<br><br>$250,000 = ($18,000 / 0.03) - ($18,000 / (0.03)(1 + 0.03)^n)<br><br>LN (18,000 / 10,500) = n LN (1.03)<br><br>0.538996501 = n 0.029558802<br><br>n = 18.23 years<br><br>Provided you don't have any medical contingencies, your CPF will be just enough to cover you and your wife's basic necessities.<br><br>Good luck.</div></blockquote>Bugger , didn't you know?.....

I already migrated to Australia...... Got superannuation funds and dump money into the funds  to reduce the taxes .  Got 2 super funds - one is high risk portfolio which has grown from 8k to 26K now while the other is moderate-low risk portfolio to balance the loses from the high risk- that new one  worth about 4k now but has a built in income protection ( which means they pay out an amount  per month to I am 65 if I cannot work due to health ) and a free health/total disability insurance  . With continued growth - I think sufficient enuff for old age since employer dumps 17% into the super and both I dump about 200 dollars per month into. My CPF in Singapore still earning interest - about 10k inside there.<br><br>Refund of taxes is about 2-3k from ATO (Australian taxation office)  every year because I study part time to claim more taxes. Only had to return them money for a year because I forgot to declare my HECs for study and I got hexed by it. So for as long as I have lived here , ATO returned me about 10k <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  in total which I use to push my mortgage down to 30%.<br><br>Can save ....graduates like me have to see whether they are willing to get out of their comfort zone and work damn hard.
