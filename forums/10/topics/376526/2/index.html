              <p>I think the prs are still limited by <a href="http://www.hdb.gov.sg/fi10/fi10201p.nsf/WPDis/Buying%20A%20Resale%20FlatEligibility%20Schemes%20-%20Summary?OpenDocument">certain critieria </a>like Singaporeans too.</p>
              <p>But one notable scheme that is in the PRs favour is the <strong><em><span style="font-size: medium;">Citizen/SPR Siblings Scheme.</span></em></strong></p>
              <p>The criteria is The application must comprise at least two single siblings <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><em><strong>whose
                  parents are not Singapore Citizens or Singapore Permanent Residents</strong></em> </span></span>and
                  are not residing in Singapore permanently.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">This favours the PRs whose parents are still in their home country and has a sibling in Singapore. Its gives them the right to buy HDB resale flats outright even though they have newly arrived in Singapore. </span></p>

              <p>Hi Webben,</p>
              <p>Thats a sharp observation. A single PR would not be able to buy a flat based on the criteria listed in the HDB website.</p>
              <p>However, most foreigners from third world countries ( at least those i know) are bringing their friends, their wives, their family and siblings to Singapore. <strong>The age of marriage is quite young</strong> in these developing countries, so a significant proportion are married already.</p>
              <p>One notable characteristic about the PRs couples/siblings is that they are willing to share the flat they buy, hence their willingness to pay high prices for HDB. They may buy a 4 room flat at a high price and lease out 2 of the rooms to cover mortgage.</p>
              <p>Singaporean married couples on the other hand are less willing to explore such an option as they value privacy.</p>

              <p>Yeah, I reckon most of these PRs who have bought flats will rent out the additional rooms to their friends. Rentals can easily cover part of their mortgage loan.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Singaporean couples on the other hand would want a home to start a family, so unless they really needed money, they would not want to rent out to strangers. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Actually essentially, the cost to the PRs is probably 10-20% of the price of the flat that they need to pay up.  Renting out the other 2 rooms might actually cover their loan from then on.</p>
