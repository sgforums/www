            <div class='col-md body'>Singapore might have done well for the first 15 - 20 years. The government has industrialised the country and upgraded it from an entrepot trading point to a industrailing nation.<br><br>After that it stagnated experiencing many disappointment in its climb to an value-added and upstream economy.<br><br>Such a competitive economy required mass participation in all fields by every kind of talents. Government only knew one type of talent - the grade talents.<br><br>There was a lack of new ideas in promoting a vibrant and entrepreneurial new economy to replace the older model based on attracting foreign investments and jacking up government fees and charges.<br><br>This was a big mistake on the part of the old leaders. A lot of rhetorics but very little progress. Throughout the whole period 1970s - 1990s, the small and medium businesses in Singapore had stagnated. There was little help if all from the government who only knew how to promote everything foreign. Its only economic strategy was to attract foreign investments.<br><br>Government did not know or failed to appreciate the actual problems caused or the real solutions. Three most important reasons were responsible for this laggard performance:-<br><br>(1)    Brain drains - thousands of practical non-A or non-mother-tongue talents left the country every year. Entrepreneurs did the same because they cannot survive in a place with costs going up skyhigh. They were all being pressuriszed to losses and unable to make a living due to high costs, discrimination from over-emphasising on grade talents. There were over-promotion of foreign companies and foreign talents year after year.<br><br>(2)   High costs -  over-emphasised non-welfarism governance has resulted in oversealous civil servants and ministries practising taxing and cost recovery in every facet of governance based on cost-centre approach.<br><br>Lands paid for by tax payers were charged again at market place at various ministries and servicces allowing government to succeed at the expense of businesses or people. Vehicle taxes, COEs and ERP constituted triple charges depriving citizens of saving for retirements.<br><br>(3)   Meritocracy or promoting EM1 to gain all the educational and job opportunities without regard for mass participation by all depriving growth of entrepreneurs through broad based educations as practised by advanced countries in Europe.<br><br>These three major errors were not admitted today resulting in continuing brain drains. Government cannot really blame the people if they are the party which had committed these three major policy or self-centred errors which forced many citizens to adopt a poor regard of government despite some past limited achievement which government claimed as its own.<br><br>Actually by taxing S$500,000 in the form of triple vehicle taxing and S$200,000 per family in the form of double land taxing, success in the form of surplus the only claim the government can make is not of government making or leadership. It is sheer extraction or enforcement takings.<br><br>Alternatives are available as posted by many. A system of accountable governance will have drawn open and entrepreneur participation by all citizens. However many smart ones have left. How to get them back is now a real problem. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>We would not have a specific direction, and might have become one of the failed nations, with slower economic growth, and internal bickering of ideals. At that stage, we could not have afforded that (surely that would have destroyed our country, given the strong communist streak in some of the people, just as Russia was as part of USSR.)</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>PAP might have been good for the formative years but not really benefical at this time and age.<br><br>For one, they have too many old farts who refuse to retire- despite the fact their views are getting more &amp; more irrelevant as years pass. There are also a lot of hypocritics- who talk one thing but do the exact opposite. There are also a lot of hugely inflated egos in the upper elchons of the PAP- no doubt after years of indirectly riggling the election system in their favour and what not.<br><br>My point is- it is time to find an alternative if we can through lawful means. We cannot continue being controlled by one party and be allowed to be controlled by one's whims and fancies.<br><br>You all know of whom I speak.</div>
