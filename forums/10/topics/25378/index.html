            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Am relatively new to this forum, and found it interesting that there seems to be a large interest here on the possible outcome of a Singapore-Malaysia war.<br><br>Personally, I have done my part serving in the SAF. Let me share my 5 cents worth of what I think is the SAF's role - that of being a doomsday device.<br><br>If we are attacked, the SAF will punch into the enemy (e.g. Malaysia) with its superior firepower (esp air force and armour), cohesion of its combined arms as well as its technological edge (e.g. C3 - command, control and communications). With our early warning systems we'll probably be even doing a pre-emptive stike.<br><br>Given the SAF edge in combat readiness (if our reservists think our guys are bad, check out how well the Malaysians are faring when their mechanised equipment, planes and ships have problems retaining minimum combat operativeness), early success in initial engagements seems very likely.<br><br>But our goal of a swift and decisive victory is not easily reached. The enemy have the strategic depth which Singapore lacks. Once they pull in, the situation may very well end up in a war of attrition. How long can we afford to mobilise our NSmen, who are simultaneously playing important roles in our economy? How many NSmen can we afford to lose? Essentially, the activation of the SAF in war comes with a terrible price.<br><br>The SAF acts as a force of deterrence. When attacked, we possess the ability to retaliate - to hit back and do so much damage as to outweigh any possible gain the attacker might have in starting the conflict.<br><br>A earlier model of deterrence was that of Singapore being a 'poisoned shrimp' causing whoever who eats it a serious case of stomachache. But we have come far since then, and now possess the firepower to do some really serious damage.<br><br>Hence the SAF is like a doomsday device. When attacked, we go *boom!* - we hit you hard, we get hit hard, everyone gets hit. But get this fact straight - when the war starts, everyone loses.<br><br>Hotheads on both sides of the fence should be aware of this fact, this price to be paid by both sides if hot-air rhethorics and military adventurism get carried away too far one day.....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Any attempt to hold on to Malaysian territory will effectively force both Indonesia and Malaysia to unite against us. For all their ups and downs in diplomacy, Islam will be a strong unifying factor, as well as the fact of common interest against an aggressive expansionist Singapore.<br><br>Given the size of their combined territories, it would be impossible to overrun them. As they pull in and engage in guerilla warfare, we would be drawn into precise the type of war we would want to avoid - a war of attrition.<br><br>Elements within the Middle East can be counted to support them with arms etc given that Singapore has always been aligned staunchly with the US.

They will begin to step on each other's tail after awhile and start killing each other instead.<br><br>Case in point: WW2, Germany and Japan.

            <div class='col-md body'>The topic post does not give room for external forces. It simply reflects on our defence doctrine which is largely true to the post. If we take a moment and think about it, the region is not a stable place. As CX has pointed out, Islam is the dominant "force" in the region, but that has its limitations and fragilities. However it does pose a certain threat to Singapore and other non-Islamic countries if our neighbours become "extreme". As for the Chinese and Spratly Islands, I doubt China would come into the picture due to the Spratlys should war occur between Singapore and Malaysia. The Chinese would not want to be implicated in a war which they may be seen as "chance-takers" and also the Islamic factor stands to this point. Thailand, on the other hand have a high possibility of joining the conflict as they have strong ties with Singapore and Malaysia.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well Singapore has always play the balancing act between the two tigers (Indonesia and Malaysia) eyeing the fat meat (Singapore). There is seldom a time when Singapore has a very good relationship with both countries at the same time. When the blind fool and Habbie cause the relationship come to a low point (anyway only the leaders are having problems with us because their army was embrassed with their leaders remark as we are on a goodwill mission in Indonesia at that time), we are on quite good terms with Malaysia.  and vice versa.<br><br>Of course there is no guarantee that we will not be attack as other factors will come into consideration. Issue like having troops in Brunei might come into play.(Without our troops in Brunei, it will have become the 14th state of the Federation of Malaysia)<br><br>However if the motive of attacking Singapore is occupy the country for economic purpose, then the enemy will not be so stuipd as to bomb the whole country. This is because the infrastructure of Singapore is the most valuable asset that we have. But if they attack just because we annoyed them then they will pay a heavy price in their action. I think the SAF doctrine is to wage war in the enemy ground and to cause so much damage that they will regret their hostile action. Well we might not win but the enemy will not have it easy either</div>

The USA is a factor to our defence posture. However we cannot expect other countries not to attack us because US is on our side. We cannot expect full military support from the US  as well. To include the US in all of our defence doctrines is a stupid thing. It means we rely too much on the US, and it will show that we are incapable of defending ourselves when the need arises. If you notice, MINDEF does not release news or information on how the US will integrate with our forces.</div>

America does not like people to obstruct commerce. It violates the very basis of the freedom of the seas and commerce which they hold so dear... and it costs American businesses big bucks too... business losses don't contribute to campaign contributions. How many countries had tried to implement a hostile blockade and succeeded without inviting the American inteference? The last time China held missile tests in the straits, it invited a similar response from the white men as well.<br><br></div>

Even training that time we use terms like Red Force or The Aggressor. But yes, the most likely military threat to us would be Malaysia....<br><br>Actually I think that the above exchange got abit messy. Essentially, the point I am trying to make, is that while we might win in the initial engagement, we cannot win the war if :<br>1) Singapore is the aggressor.<br>2) Singapore is holding onto Malaysian territory.<br><br>Anyway, there's a possibility of Singapore attacking without being invaded first - when our water supply is being threatened.<br><br>In the past, a tricky situation would be if Malaysia cuts off the supply of water and claimed that it is the sabotage of rebels. Singapore would be in a dire situation because the only way to get the water would be to invade JB and earn the tag of the 'aggressor'.<br><br>Now that we have our recycled sewag... errr Newater, a direct military response to the cutting off of water might not seem as inevitable as before.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks Reggi, i see your point, but i agree with CX as well, except for 1 point. The poison shrimp image is not suitable to describe Singapore's defence posture any longer. We will not go into battle with the objective that "we will kill you if you eat us." The key line there is "if you eat us". It suggests that we are already destroyed in any aspect, only then will the military exercise "extreme measures." I fully agree with your point on going to war. There is no point going into war and not getting anything in return, and it is impossible to go to war one day, and the next day everything returns to normal. In that i don't necessarily mean geographical gains from a battle, but more importantly, stability.</div>
