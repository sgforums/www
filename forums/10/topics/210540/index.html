            <div class='col-md body'>To: Singaporeans<br><br>On 24 Aug, Wong Geng Thong, an air con technician was sentenced to serve 8 weeks in jail for torturing and killing a cat. This may not have been his first offense of this nature.<br><br>What he did:<br><br>1. Befriended a cat by feeding it then took it in his van to Blk 93A Jalan Dua off Old Airport Rd.<br>2. Tied a noose around the cat�s neck and lifted the wire to hang the cat by the neck<br>3. Everytime the cat lost consciousness, Wong revived it by massaging its chest. He repeated this cruel act till the cat could not be revived anymore.<br>4. He then removed the wire noose, grabbed the cat by the neck and bashed it�s body against the wall several times<br>5. Then he threw the cat�s body on the floor and kept kicking it<br><br>All that he did in the car park was captured by a spy camera.<br><br>Cleaners in the area have found the grisly remains of 10 cats in the neighbourhood over the past 5 months which is what triggered a group of volunteers to put up the spy cameras. These volunteers, along with the help of animal welfare organizations, have taken the time, money and effort to find the perpetrator of these senseless and cruel acts.<br><br>Yet when Wong Geng Thong was caught, he was sentenced to only 2 months in jail for what he did despite the fact that the psychiatrist who examined Wong was concerned he might abuse people too.<br><br>Most serial killers and murderers start their macabre �career� by torturing and killing animals. If unchecked, the likelihood of them progressing to hurt and kill people is very high. (Please read article written by Lynn Lam, Today Online http://www.todayonline.com/articles/127238.asp).<br><br>Under the Animals &amp; Birds Act, the maximum penalty for abusing an animal is a fine of $10,000 or a maximum jail term of 12 months, or both. Question is, what does it take to incur the maximum penalty? Doesn�t such a calculated and cruel act as seen in the case of Wong Geng Thong deserve the maximum penalty?<br><br>If you feel that Wong Geng Thong deserves a harsher or the maximum penalty for what he did, please do the following:<br><br>1) Sign this petition<br>2) Tell your friends about this and get them to sign the petition<br>3) Write a letter to:<br><br>ATTORNEY-GENERAL'S CHAMBERS<br>Address : 1 Coleman Street, #10-00, Singapore 179803<br><br>Tel : 63361411<br>Fax : 63325984<br>Internet Website : http://www.agc.gov.sg<br>Email Address : agc@agc.gov.sg<br>(Please make sure your letter is polite and rational)<br><br>The SPCA is appealing for a harsher sentence for Wong but it�s not just the responsibility of the SPCA, they need the help and support of the public at large. We are all responsible for making our society a safer and better place to live in. Please do something today before it�s too late.<br><br>For more information and pictures of what the case is about, log on to this public Gmail account to download the files.<br><br>http://gmail.google.com<br>Username: CatKillerPetition<br>Password: Petition80<br><br>Sign the petition here: http://www.petitiononline.com/killer75/petition.html<br><br>People like these shouldn't be allowed to exist!!!</div>

He will still go and brutally kill animals.

Don't underestimate the painful reminders of caning.<br><br>Councilling alone may not help so perhaps, the recall of pain will stop him if he wants to kill animals again.</div></blockquote>I'm not sure whether caning would actually help. If killing cats is some form of compulsion for him, it's going to take more than just caning to prevent him from doing it again.Given that he has a difficult psychological disorder, it would be best to put him in an asylum.<br><br>Hence I disagree with the campaign for a harsher sentence in this case, as the offender is mentally disturbed. I would support harsher sentences though for sane offenders who torture or kill cats for fun.</div>
