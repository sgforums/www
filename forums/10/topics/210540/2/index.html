Hang them! There are more than a hundred queuing up to be hanged, you know that?<br><br>[Minister For Law] Jayakumar said, Â“I have plugged the loop-hole whereby they could escape being hanged and just have twenty years of imprisonment!Â”<br><br>Oh, wacko the ducks Â– you need a monument!<br><br>The joy of hanging people; flogging them, every stroke must break the skin. I donÂ’t like it. I donÂ’t believe it is a deterrent. I see no proof. Look, it seems to me logic! If every year we have more death sentences, how can you say death sentence is a deterrent? If it were, there should be less death sentences.<br>............................................................................................................................................<br><br>And IÂ’m according to Lee Kuan Yew in Parliament when he sought the abolition of the jury, Â“David Marshall is responsible for 200 murderers walking freely the streets of Singapore.Â”<br><br>IÂ’m proud of that. I told him to put it on my tomb. If there are 200 people walking freely the streets of Singapore, it means they are contributing to Singapore. Singapore would have been poorer by hanging them. I have no compulsion.<br>............................................................................................................................................<br><br><strong>Look, the purpose of criminal law is really two-fold: as a deterrent and as a catharsis of society to express its vengeance.</strong> If you escape it, youÂ’re no harm to society so long as you maintain a good police force and so long as you maintain a certain human justice in understanding.<br><br><strong>For me, the punishment must not fit the crime, <span style="color: red;">the punishment must fit the criminal and the punishment must fit the needs of society.</span></strong><span style="color: indigo;"><br>............................................................................................................................................<br><br>There are more than a hundred people queuing to be hanged. There are decent people there.<br><br>Look, thereÂ’s a lovely phrase Â– I forgot who coined it Â– who said, <strong>Â“There but for the grace of God go I, I know no man who stood totally spotless that he can say I committed no anti-social act.Â”</strong><br><br>And so in our criminal code, if some escaped, thatÂ’s an asset.<br><br>IÂ’m reminded of a lovely story of Sir Walter Raleigh. On the scaffold, he went up and tested the axe with his thumb and turning to the master executioner, he said, <strong>Â“This is the surest cure for all diseases. If you want to eliminate all crime, you got to eliminate all humanity.Â”</strong><br><br>I have absolutely no bad conscience about the men I have helped escape the gallows and escape the prison. IÂ’m grateful for the opportunity to have done that.<br></span></blockquote></span><br><br></div>
