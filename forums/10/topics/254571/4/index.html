People don't like the ruling party, do not agree with some policies, and put all the blame on Singapore the country. Some people talk about leaving Singapore when war starts, many are migrating because they dont want their sons to suffer from learning the second language, Chinese, and they are Chinese. If anybody talk about singapore nationalism, that is the biggest B S, it does not exist, though PAP has been trying to promote that for donkey years; and don't believe the Chinese here are proud to be associated with PRC China as root. Not much virtues are not taught in Singapore schools , let alone virtues specific to Chinese culture.<br><br>I don't have to tell you. The bashing is ranment here against the FT, the Chinese FT, not the indian, not the bangladeshi. When job are taken by FT from Chinese, nobody accepts they were losing out to better persons, or fellow Chinese. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> In the same threads you also find much bashing against PRC Chinese nationals, not HK Chinese, Taiwanese Chinese. I don't blame them because of the way some of you behave. Besides poor personal behaviors, severe violation of international intellectual properties rights, immitation or adulterated food items with total disregard for human life, there is also the strong sense of chinese nationalism, especially when this is expressed in your intolerance against your brothers in Taiwan.<br><br>1.3 billion chinese are already very different, the overseas chinese or those outside of China are even more different. I don't look down on PRC Chinese, but I know enough about Chinese, the language, the history and culture to tell you people from PRC, you don't represent Chinese as a race, and you need to work hard if you want to be the leader of all chinese. Learn to accept the difference.<br><br>ST talked about justice, how much justice do you see in China? he talked about virtues, what are the virtues taught in China? He talked about respecting cultures and opinions, do you people from PRC respect the local cultures and opinions in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau and Tibet?<br><br>There is only one nation that need to learn from the Germans about WW2, the Japanese, on how to repent from what they did, and took action to eradicate the root of the problem. If you are for that then we are on the same side. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br></div>
