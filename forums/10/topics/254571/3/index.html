I was one of those who felt that there were a number of cogent reasons to question the wisdom of such an act. During his recitation of the relevant facts, I had been conscious of a feeling of depression and so I voiced to him my grave misgivings, first on the basis of my belief that Japan was already defeated and that dropping the bomb was completely unnecessary, and secondly because I thought that our country should avoid shocking world opinion by the use of a weapon whose employment was, I thought, no longer mandatory as a measure to save American lives."

Talking abt english, how good is urs....?Look at the bold part...broken sentence and lousy language.<br><br>Yes Us did used Nuke on Japan....but they save ur fellow prc comrades by doing so. Did u know the USA did sent many messages to Japan ,demanding for a surrender of the imperial army, but the way of samurai codes forbade the jap army to surrender. To save more lives and shorten the war, the US nuke them. After the war, American did her best to help Japan in developing japan's economy and that explain Japan economy strength. How abt PRC? Claiming and conquer TIBET and did nothing significant to improve life of the tibetians but on the contrary torture them.<br>War On Iraq and Afgan is a JUST war. Just that u a blind communist can never understand the importance of freedom. Yes China is not dropping bomb now and that is worse,not doing anything to help the world.(xiu shou pang guan, zi shao men qian xue) The typical selfish chinese style.<br><br>Yes my ethnicity is Chinese, and I am proud to be a chinese. I dont hate China but I hate narrow minded PRC like urself and TS. TS is obviously asking for trouble the moment he set up this kind of thrend. It makes ppl here uncomfortable abt what is the ultimate motive of the chinese govt if her civilian were to come to other  country's forum and start a loose talk on war.<br>Think about ur own action b4 condemning ppl. U are just farcically loyal to ur country and when a war broke out, U will be staying in spore and not going back to ur country to fight.<br><br>If u still think TS is right to start this kind of thrend then pls sit on ur yao rocket and fly back to China. BTW the Chinese here in spore and Malaysia dun owe China a living. We receive no protection nor aids from the chinese govt so dun try to think we should summit to the prcs....get this deep in ur head.<br><br>I must apologize if I ever sound too crude in my previous posts but what I said  reflects on the black sheep of the prcs....including urself. U cover up for ur fellow comrades (TS) and feels no shame in making such irresponsible remarks. This really show how uneducated u are.</div>

Both elected to positions according to each country's regulations. The fact the Hu was not elected by the people in a democratic way, and ah bian used tricks and cheats to get elected did not nullify their positions as leaders of both china. That is the similarity between the two.<br><br>Ah bian and WHATODO talked about war as if it would not affect them. One overestimated the ability of the US and its willingness to come to help during a straits war, the other overestimated the ability of PLA believing that PLA is now more powerful than the US. Such positions are dangerous to the region and both are equally stupid, not just similar.<br><br>I am no fan of US, but between USA and Japan in WW2, there is no question which side I am on. The way the Japs were willing to die for their emperor and Japan, as demonstrated in the way they defended useless islands like Iwo Jima, it would be months and hundreds of thousands of lives before Japan could agree to surrender. Even after the two bombs, many japs killed themselves instead of accepting the humiliation of surrendering, the samurai spirit? A devil is a devil, whether it is yellow face, white face, black face or red face. WW2 was not a racial war.<br><br>PRC was the devil to the people in this region during the 60s and the 70s. Sad to say, not many young Chinese from PRC are aware of this. Fortunately or unfortunately, the people hurt its people more than others.<br></div>
