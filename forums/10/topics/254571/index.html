            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by WHATODO:<br><strong>[b]U.S. vs. China</strong><br><br>Series of questions on this nightmare scenario:<br><br>1. Can the U.S. invade China in the first place?<br>2. Are America's technological and firepower advantages helpful in the long run against 1 billion people?<br>3. How effective would U.S. airpower be?<br>4. Is it safe to say every Chinese citizen would fight?<br>5. Can the U.S. hold up against a modern military supported by guerrilla warfare?<br>6. Any other thoughts?<br><br>I think China is one enemy the U.S. will need a miracle to defeat. I see it sort of as a whole bunch of people lining up against the Chinese coast to prevent an amphbious assault. An airborne assault is pretty dumb as well. The only advantage America will have is our airpower and sea-launched missiles, but that won't last forever.<br><br>In the end, I think it's a lose-lose situation for the U.S.<br><br>Also, does anyone know of any tactics or warplans the U.S. has in store regarding China?<br>[/b]</blockquote>If you don't know whatodo, go learn from your mother how to cook.<br><br>If you want to start a discussion on military issues, go to the Military Nuts.<br><br>If the word is to "invade", then it is the USA who have the capability to send thousands of soldiers thousands of miles away, with air and sea support to invade another country, China do not.<br><br>But to invade is one thing, able to defeat and conquer is another thing. USA can come and invade some parts of China, will it defeat or be defeated? If China were invaded, it certainly will fight, every citizen will fight.<br><br>Why do the US want to use nuclear warhead to annihilate one billion people, it gains nothing? it loses all the cheap manufacturing facilities, .... and the american people are not that crazy.<br><br>Can the U.S. hold up against a modern military supported by guerrilla warfare? WHERE? in china or in USA? US will not hold up to the PLA supported by guerrilla fighting in China; the modern PLA will never land in USA, even on tourist visa, and the ABC will not be the guerrilla.<br><br>Do China think they can defeat USA? no! but will they fight, yes, if Taiwan declares independent, and USA supports it. Who will win? does it matter? ask the americans how many of them are prepared to die for getting caught in other country's civil war. It will not be by the hundreds, but by the thousands, tens or hundreds of thousands!<br><br>Will the whole region go to war? for whom? PRC, for ROC, or for USA? What if the Russian and Vietnam supports PRC, as old comrades against the american imperialists? What if North Korea take this opportunity to unleash its power on Japan, leaving south korea alone? and South Korea would be glad to stay neutral if it can stay away from the fire. Who else is around the region who can make a difference in a war? The RSAF? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>China, with its economic booming, will not risk a war, its people are busily visiting HK and Macau, making money from the stock market, no time for war. It is some people in Taiwan, who should not let their local politics get out of hand, and some americans, who should not over estimate the american military power. The danger is in these people making silly moves.<br></div>
