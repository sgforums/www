            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://i22.photobucket.com/albums/b328/easterknight/lift1.jpg"><br><br>NATIONAL Development Minister Mah Bow Tan has come out to clear the air on the upgrading of opposition wards, saying that their lifts will be upgraded by 2015 at the latest, but PAP wards will still get priority.<br><br>His comments will surprise those who thought that the policy of upgrading PAP wards first was ripe for change, after the ruling party failed to win back Hougang and Potong Pasir at the recent polls despite offering $180 million in improvement works for the two ageing estates.<br><br>After the election results on May 7, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said the People's Action Party (PAP) would have to review its strategy in the opposition wards.<br><br>But in an interview with The Sunday Times on Friday, Mr Mah made it clear that this review would not affect the policy of giving lift upgrading priority to PAP wards. 'There is no change, that policy still remains. We've looked at it and we believe that that is still something we have to do,' he said.<br><br>Giving PAP wards priority does not mean that the Government intends to deprive opposition wards of upgrading, he added, although this point might have been lost in 'the heat and the noise of the elections'.<br><br>The Government has pledged that by 2015, all HDB blocks will have lifts that stop on every floor, with the exception of a small number of blocks whose designs make such works too costly.<br><br>Mr Mah said this includes blocks in opposition wards.<br><br>'We intend to honour this commitment, 2015, all eligible blocks will have their lifts upgraded,' he said.<br><br>The ramping up of the lift upgrading programme means a close to two-fold increase in the national upgrading budget over the next few years, to between $500 million and $600 million per financial year.<br><br>About 130 blocks in Hougang and Potong Pasir are eligible for improved lifts but they are not the oldest blocks to have gone without upgrading.<br><br>Mr Mah said about 800 blocks in PAP wards are as old or older and have not been upgraded at all. They are located in areas such as Queenstown, Bukit Merah, Tiong Bahru, Marine Parade, Serangoon, Woodlands, Marsiling, Yishun and Kampung Ubi.<br><br>'I can't put the opposition blocks at the head of the queue, ahead of these 800. Surely not,' he said.<br><br>To select precincts for upgrading, the ministry uses three criteria: the age of the blocks, the geographical spread to ensure upgrading is not concentrated in only a few constituencies and support for the Government.<br><br>While acknowledging that many thought it unfair to link votes to upgrading, Mr Mah defended the policy as 'not unreasonable'.<br><br>He said the massive and costly upgrading programme was only possible because of the Government's policies, which generated economic growth and the Budget surpluses needed to fund it.<br><br>And these policies could only be implemented if the Government received the people's mandate.<br><br>'We really need to be fair to the people who voted for the PAP candidate. Upgrading has been a major election platform for the PAP and those who support the PAP candidate expect their MPs to deliver on their promises.'<br><br>This news article is extracted from THE SUNDAY TIMES of 11th june 2006. Do you feel his decision is fair for Singaporean?<br><br></div>

Well, I was kind of expecting PAP to play an angel role this time by allowing the opposition wards to be upgraded first until the news took me by surprise. But in closer examination, I think the policy of 'upgrading for all wards, but PAP ones first', is a fair one. There is no denial of upgrading for opposition wards but or rather to shelf it to a later date. The eventually outcome is that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">ALL</span> will get upgrading benefits. This does not violate the one people, one nation or social equailty framework. Beside, how you expect PAP to answer to her supporters who casted the vote for them? Someone mentioned before that we are master of our MPs, now I want my MP to upgrade my estate first not opposition!...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

They have the majority in parliament. They can literally pass any policy they like. The opposition does not support the PAP so why will u want to help someone who will not support u? As they are the government they shld. One will always put the thing they dislike most to the last. Tax payer's money are in their control so why not use it to their best agenda?</div>
