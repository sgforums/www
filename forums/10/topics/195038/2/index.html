            <div class='col-md body'>There is this concept in law called Judicial Review.  JR is the way in which executive decision making and discretion is reigned in by the judiciary.  Generally, the executive is given wide discretion to decide on policy matters, but nonetheless, the decision making process must only take into account relevant factors.  When the executive takes into consideration a matter that is irrelevant, then JR can be taken up against the executive to quash that decision.<br><br>So if HDB is in charge of upgrading, the relevant factors for prioritising upgrading will be the age of the flats, the need for upgrading etc.  I can't imagine party-partisan votes to ever be considered a relevant factor.  Hence, I believe that if HDB prioritises Marine Parade flats over Hougang flats for upgrading because of the votes, it can be quashed by JR.<br><br>The issue is who has the locus standi, money and balls to take out JR against HDB.</div>

'There is no change, that policy still remains. We've looked at it and we believe that that is still something we have to do,' he said.<br><br>Giving PAP wards priority does not mean that the Government intends to deprive opposition wards of upgrading, he added, although this point might have been lost in 'the heat and the noise of the elections'.<br><br>The Government has pledged that by 2015, all HDB blocks will have lifts that stop on every floor, with the exception of a small number of blocks whose designs make such works too costly.<br><br>Mr Mah said this includes blocks in opposition wards.<br><br>'We intend to honour this commitment, 2015, all eligible blocks will have their lifts upgraded,' he said.<br><br>The ramping up of the lift upgrading programme means a close to two-fold increase in the national upgrading budget over the next few years, to between $500 million and $600 million per financial year.<br><br>About 130 blocks in Hougang and Potong Pasir are eligible for improved lifts but they are not the oldest blocks to have gone without upgrading.<br><br>Mr Mah said about 800 blocks in PAP wards are as old or older and have not been upgraded at all. They are located in areas such as Queenstown, Bukit Merah, Tiong Bahru, Marine Parade, Serangoon, Woodlands, Marsiling, Yishun and Kampung Ubi.<br><br>'I can't put the opposition blocks at the head of the queue, ahead of these 800. Surely not,' he said.<br><br>To select precincts for upgrading, the ministry uses three criteria: the age of the blocks, the geographical spread to ensure upgrading is not concentrated in only a few constituencies and support for the Government.<br><br>While acknowledging that many thought it unfair to link votes to upgrading, Mr Mah defended the policy as 'not unreasonable'.<br><br>He said the massive and costly upgrading programme was only possible because of the Government's policies, which generated economic growth and the Budget surpluses needed to fund it.<br><br>And these policies could only be implemented if the Government received the people's mandate.<br><br>'We really need to be fair to the people who voted for the PAP candidate. Upgrading has been a major election platform for the PAP and those who support the PAP candidate expect their MPs to deliver on their promises.'<br><br>This news article is extracted from THE SUNDAY TIMES of 11th june 2006. Do you feel his decision is fair for Singaporean?<br><br></div></blockquote><strong>From what Mah Bow Tan said, so is it that the Potong Pasir and Hougang people even if they voted for PAP also have to wait till near 2015? Then all the bullshlt regarding the $10m or $15m they say they will give/use for upgrading is like 5-6 years later also?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"> </strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Straits Time, Tuesday, 13 June 2006 - FORUM<br><br><blockquote><br><strong>PAP policy belies 'Staying Together, Moving Ahead'</strong><br><br>IN THE wake of General Elections 2006, various senior People's Action Party (PAP) leaders pledged to respect voters' choice.<br><br>At the Cabinet swearing-in ceremony on May 30, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong pledged that his Government would work with all Singaporeans, including those who voted for the opposition.<br><br>Singaporeans who hoped that the PAP would therefore remove its votes-for-upgrading strategy got a lightning bolt of reality with the Minister for National Development's statement over the weekend that, basically, nothing has changed.<br><br>Minister Mah Bow Tan's main argument was that the Government had to be fair to those who had voted for the PAP wards. But the bigger question on voters' minds is a very simple one - whether such a promise is a legitimate use of taxpayers' monies. To state the obvious, everybody pays taxes, whether they live in PAP or opposition wards.<br><br>Mr Mah had previously said that he could not "look PAP MPs in the eye" if he gave the same priority in upgrading to opposition wards. But how, then, does he look these taxpayers in the eye?<br><br>No one living in an opposition ward expects special treatment, that is, to jump ahead of PAP wards with older blocks. But, all things being equal, it should not matter whether a PAP or an opposition MP is the incumbent.<br><br>The same objections apply to how the public funds entrusted to his ministry under the community Improvement Projects Committee (CIPC) for estate improvements are disbursed.<br><br>Further, to say that disbursing CIPC funds through the citizens' consultative committes is not political because they are made of residents, makes as much sense as saying that residents' committees are politically neutral when they are heavily mobilised to help PAP candidates campaign.<br><br>On this vexed questions of selective upgrading, the recent conflicting messages from the PAP are telling. For instance, the day after the Polling Day, Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong praised Potong Pasir and Hougang residents for having loyalty towards their MPs, which was a "better (characteristic) than for them to be chasing after every goodie which we offer them".<br><br>After this dose of honesty from SM Goh, what kind of values is the PAP promoting by continuing with its votes-for-upgrading policy ?<br><br>The overarching theme of the the PAP's 2006 Election Manifesto is "Staying Together, Moving Ahead".<br><br>As a Singaporean who decided to stand with the Workers' Party, I look forward to the day when election campaigns will be fought by all parties over the long-term national policies which affect Singaporeans' lives deeply.<br><br>Let Singaporeans reflect and decide elections on these questions, which are surely far more important for the nation's future than the selective use of public funds to ensure that the PAP stays in power.<br><br>Sylvia Lim Swee Lian (Ms)<br>Non-Constituency MP (Elect)<br>Chairman, Workers' Party<br><br></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>Straits Time, Tuesday, 13 June 2006 - FORUM<br><br><blockquote><br><strong>Ruling party's fiduciary duty is to all S'poreans</strong><br><br>I REFER to the article, "Upgrading for all wards, but PAP ones first" (The Sunday Times, June 11).<br><br>The ruling People's Action Party (PAP)'s defence of its lift-upgrading priority is two-fold : First, funds for lift upgrading are generated by government policies, which have brought about economic growth and Budget surpluses, and thus those who have voted for it deserve priority; and second, that PAP MPs have promised to upgrade their constituents' estates if elected, and it is "not unreasonable" for these constituencies to be "in the front" of the upgrading queue.<br><br>There is, however, a fundamental difference between the role of a political party when it seeks to win an election, and the role of the same party when it acts as the government of Singapore. As the Government, it has a fiduciary obligation to act on behalf of all Singaporeans, who pay taxes, undergo national service, and so on. It should be completely apolitical in the disbursement of public funds for the betterment of lives.<br><br>it is certainly true that good government has helped to generate economic growth and Budget surpluses, and the PAP could, during the election, have campaigned strongly on its track record in this regard, without any necessity to link this to upgrading priority at the constituency level.<br><br>Thoughtful Singaporeans would then have to balance its track record - with its implications, among other things, for the availability of funds for the betterment of lives - against other considerations, such as the desire for checks and balances in Parliament.<br><br>The discussion would then have revolved around consideration of what is good for the nation as a whole, rather than what is good for my constituency or me. Indeed, a major purpose of a general election should be to help focus voters' attention on the former, which is an important step in our evolution towards a more enlightened society. (The PAP keeps saying it wants Singaporeans to put nation before self, but what happens during election time ? )<br><br>The fact that voters clearly differentiated among opposition parties during the election shows that they are capable of thoughtful consideration of the issues.<br><br>The foregoing discussion shows up the flaws in the PAP's first defence. The flaws in the second defence follow logically: it was not fair for its MPs to have made such promises, as public funds are involved.<br><br>To summarise: the PAP could, and should, have campaigned comfortably on its track record and its plans for the future, without resorting to unfair tactics to unfair tactic. I hope there will be a careful rethink of the policy regarding upgrading priority.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Basant K. Kapur</span><br><br></blockquote></div>
