Gleneagles is for those who have money to throw.<br><br>Medishield was the issue if I am not wrong - as for any private health insurance would cost against the amount least expected to pay and Medishield is costed against 3 parameters - you pay the gap. So if let's say someone goes to B2 class and have to get a cardiac bypass - they pay around (for example) 6k - 1.4k is to ward off the costs. The gap is 4.6k and that is what the person has to pay off themselves . If they chose to go to a private hospital - that costing will have to apply to be fair to all , or else everyone would go and receive private treatment - that way any insurance company would go bust like that. Medisave - you can use it up to a certain limit if there is money in the account.<br><br>If they have said oh their mom-in-law went to a restructured hospital and  stayed in a subsidised class and yet the bill goes to 50k  ....I would been in their direct defence and totally outraged .<br><br>As for a doctor who cannot account for his bill - I say that is his wrong.<br><br>Bear was talking about why govt cannot improve the health system - that is what I am answering to.

The only thing that will change if she admits her mother-in-law to a govt hospital is that gap of 4.5K instead of some 49k or so bill at gleneagles.<br><br>She paid for a medishield basic - so the set standard is at B2 class bill - premium don't change across the board. Surely you don't expect A1 class or B1 class to be covered as well when she chooses a basic plan?<br><br>I do not sympathise with this lady at all and that is why the newspaper probably published her letter. Easy for one to read Gleneagles and she is asking for MORE while the rest of the population are staying in B2 beds and using medishield because they know their finances cannot take the battering of a private class hospital bed.</div>

Just because my parents choose govt restructured hospitals to get admitted in doesn't mean that I don't love them more than the son of the lady who chose Gleneagles.<br><br>The medical cost when you talk about private hospitals are barely affordable unless you have alot of cash reserve or you choose to go into debt. If you choose to go into debt for the treatment of a parent - it is your responsibility to pay it up , don't expect the government to use tax payer money to pay for the luxury of a private hospital. They choose private and they shouldn't expect any rebate of  any great and wonderous value from a basic coverage plan.<br><br>Besides I worked in a private hospital for a specialist as well as a public hospital in Singapore, and there is absolutely nothing great about private hospitals except they are a status symbol - "Oh My relative is staying at so and so hospital" .<br><br>Big deal - no difference between a public or private hospital - the privilege in a private hospital is just seeing the same specialist who treated you and will do your dressings for a couple of hundred dollars.<br><br>Even the best cardiothoracic surgeons are in SGH.

It is the public perception that fuels the high medical bills in private hospitals. If you are prepared to pay 50k for Gleneagles, it will be daft of them to charge 25k, even if that is what it costs to provide the service.<br><br>But the people are completely entitled to choose private hospitals, select their own surgeons, have their surgeons remove dressing instead of a staff nurse; so long as they are prepared to pay for it.<br><br>If you haven't got the dough, you have no right to demand that others contribute the flour.</div>

Would you simply sign a contract without checking what it entails? Would you buy insurance without checking what it covers?  Even when we buy fruits, we check for rot on the fruits . Insurance you pay for - when you don't check especially when it is a big sum of money - then I say that is pure stupidity on the part of the person signing it.<br><br>I don't blindly sign stuff because it has the insignia of the government . I always check what I sign up for.</div>
