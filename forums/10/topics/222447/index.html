For a series of consultations, he charged me a huge lump sum. After payment, I requested a breakdown of the charges.<br><br>To my surprise, the doctor told me he had no breakdown and needed time to draw one up.<br><br>A week later, I received a breakdown and I was horrified to discover that I was charged for days I did not visit his clinic. I wrote to the doctor and, instead of addressing the errors, he gave me a new breakdown.<br><br>This manner of charging seems to go against the grain of professional ethics.<br><br>Shouldn't a doctor have a breakdown of work and charges before billing his patient, and not the other way round?<br><br>Li Jian Hua (Mrs)<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>

[/b]</blockquote>The crux of the issue is the amount of subsidies, not the cost of the treatment.<br>If your mother is sick, wouldn't you want the best that you can afford? Would you ask the hospital how much is the subsidies before committing your mother for treatment?<br><br>The hospital would have brief them about the estimate cost before treatment and they should be well enough to afford it. The payout from medishield would be a bonus but it turn out to be a shocking disappointment.<br><br>Ask me. I terminated (opt out) my medishield, healthshield, medicare, medisave, medishit etc.<br><br>This brings about another topic. My mother was given $800 progress package before the election but did not receive a single cent because she was automatically opt into a health insurance by CPF. The best part is, the premium is more than $800 annually. What a joke. She canceled the insurance and bought 4D instead.<br></div>

Sorry to hear about your slipped disc however we are not talking about slipped disc here . I have 2 slipped discs (cervical and lumbar)  and that is what they do to me in Australia - pump me up with muscle relaxants and painkillers then wait 4 months to see a neurosurgeon for assessment . Depending on the severity ...like loss of function , you are categorised according to priority to be seen. Nothing can be done unless they are severe. Even with surgery , the risk is high - loss of life, paralysis etc  .  It is a lifelimiting condition unless it fully collapses which results in total paralysis. So they often opt for a conservative treatment with the hope that it will subside by itself before they even attempt to open you up. The neurosurgeon told me to look after my back and not to worsen it  .  Ask Rhonda if you don't believe me.<br><br>We are talking a medical emergency and failure to treat a medical emergency means negligence. No doctor in his right mind will send a patient with a life threatening cardiac condition home. I had 2 relatives who had cardiac symptoms and they were retained and monitored in a high dependency unit ,in a government restructured hospital. 1 survived and the other did not because of multi illness.<br><br>I am not defending the system . I don't like the way polyclinics work . Now someone said something about UK having free healthcare - well ....in UK you are likely to WAIT for your free cardiac bypass  - by that time - you mati liow. Their oncology waiting list is ridiculous as well - some wait til 6 months - by then the cancer already spread.  And in the UK , NHS assigns you to a doctor , meaning you get one lousy doctor - too bad....<br><br></div>

I remember not being able to move for 2 days because of the pain . I didn't seek a private specialist in Melbourne because I knew the public hospital neurosurgeon was one of the best in the country.  And he told me that it is life long - nothing to do unless I cannot feel or move my arms or legs.<br><br>I don't trust any hospitals at all  - private or public - I remember being forgotten in the Emergency Department in Canberra for 4 hours prior to being treated for red back spider envenomisation (doctor told me she forgot) and forgotten in Sydney for 6 hrs when my liver was swelling to an allergic reaction. I was also ignored at the triage in a hospital  until I nearly went into respiratory distress (psychologically distressing when you can see the nurses rushing to get intubation equipment ready for you ) . 2 of these incidents landed me in resuscitation bay - hooked to machines . In Singapore, that never quite happened to me. I get seen and I get treated and x rayed.<br><br>People do get forgotten and left in the shaft all the time everywhere   - that is unless you are some BIG SHOT millionaire or you know the magic phrase like " IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG, I AM CALLING MY LAWYER" or " I am going to make a HUGE fuss which will make you regret"  .<br><br>In the USA , no insurance means no specialist to see you ....that one also lagi bad. In UK , you get a crap doctor for free and you cannot change him unless NHS reassigns you to another doctor.<br><br></div>

So those with more urgent medical problems end up waiting in corridors because of these selfish bastards.  I worked in a medical ward where at least 60% of the inpatients can be dischardged but family is racking up excuses after excuses . One I remembered  had this one memorable fabulous reason " don't bother calling us, we are on our cruise for 3 weeks"  ....another winner was " I am going on holiday overseas for 2 weeks- can't look after her" .

USA has the best advanced medical technology yet the way they take care of their lower socioeconomic classes are shocking as you can in Hurricane Katrina. Australia has a health for all system yet there are waiting lists and some of their hospitals ( especially rural and regional) are shocking in terms of technology and staff shortages. UK NHS has already broken down so many times that it is not funny.<br><br>Let me explain why : Pharmaceutical companies and Medical Technology companies are capitalist corporations . The latest pill or tool comes out - they charge a bomb for it. A patent lasts for 20 years so they put an exorbitant pricing on it. Who are buying these technologies? Most developed nations because their government cannot ignore the cry of the people for it. Take Herceptin (the breast cancer drug) for an example , around 60 k AUD for a treatment regiment . And the Big Pharma exploits the fact that it is the new miracle cure ...so you have women with families trying to sell their houses for it and Big Pharma doesn't care as long as you can pay. They say they have to cost it because of their R&amp;D investments. So what happens - onus is thrown to government ?  I don't blame people for turning to all avenues to save their own lives. I would do it too !  I would expect the government to save my miserable ass if there is an expensive cure which I cannot afford but could save my own life .....when I think of all the taxes I pay !<br><br>Not only on the Pharma and Tech side , you have people shameless exploiting public systems for their own good as in Granny Dumping cases or FREE DRUGS!<br><br>And plus you have a shortage of doctors and nurses world wide now. Why? To be a doctor now , you risk negligence charges so you have to pay professional indemnity fees . In Australia , professional indemnity for general surgeons cost 3 months of their pay in total - higher for the plastic surgeons. If they are getting  sued - the cost rises after settlement. They cannot afford to pay so they quit and do lecturing.<br><br>In USA , doctors and nurses get sued all the time. Nursing is no glamour job so not many want to do it . Most people think because you are a doctor or a nurse, you should forgo the money to help - then what about their living expenses , professional insurance?<br><br>Things are worse for the consultants in private practice- they have equipment purchased from Big Tech Companies and to maintain them is very costly ( because those are diagnostic/treatment tools and you do not want just any ordinary mechanic or electrician to fix or check it) . They have to get insurance for those equipment as well. Then 2 years later, the tech company says WE HAVE THE LATEST and BETTER VERSION PLUS we placed a time limit on how long we can maintain your equipment since it is going to be obselete ... so they have to upgrade which means money. So let's throw in maintenance costs!<br><br>For hospitals , they have to get their own biomedical engineers on call all the time and upgraded to maintain so many equipments in good condition. All these machines need to be checked for errors since they are involved in saving human lives.<br><br>And let's not even talk about supplies! Paper work very important to prevent court cases - so let's add even MORE paperwork<br><br>So unless you want a third world country hospital - you pay to keep hospitals up and running plus continual upgrade and maintenance of their technology .<br><br>The only non essentials you can get rid of are the hospital administrators and CEOs who are overpaid IMHO. They are a waste of space. PLUS the overpaid health 1 million dollar a year minister with lifelong pension ... Win already lor ....<br><br></div>
