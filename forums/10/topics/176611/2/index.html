            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Atobe, nice to hear from you and I am impressed with your knowledge  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>"The US Citizens actually supported the Vietnam War in the 1960s until the war stretched on with too high a toll due to the political failure to understand the use of the military to win a decisive war, and allowed the Vietnamese to stretch the manpower resources for too long and wear down the will of the Americans to "sue for peace". "<br><br>I disagree with the fact that the US citizens supported. While some of them believed in the Domino Theory, there are others who were opposed to the war. This was especially true when conscription was increased dramatically during the Vietnam War, atrocities committed against the Vietnamese civilians, etc. Human rights?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_war<br><br>"Afghanistan continue to receive firm positive support from the US Citizenry in its continued hunt for Al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden - to settle scores for the attack to the Twin Towers of the New York World Trade Centre"<br><br>Fair enough.<br><br>"In any case, have you missed the "heart beat" of this thread in that the US Citizens will have at least the COLLECTIVE INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS to launch a protest - physical or verbal - towards the policies of a Government which they have elected and gone astray."<br><br>From Singapore's route to independence til the early 1990s, the top priority was to transform a third world Singapore into a first world city-state. Given a choice, would you like to live in a Phillipines-alike democracy today, or the Singapore as it is of today? I believe the success of Singapore today is achieved by implementing harsh, unpopular yet effective policies. Singapore is considered a miracle today by forgoing certain human rights, whereas other Western countries took much more time to achieve their first-world status as of today.<br><br>I am not a student in politics, but what I see is that by forgoing "COLLECTIVE INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS", the govt has less time to deal with dissent and more time to implement harsh, unpopular yet effective policies. Of course, if the ruling party is ineffective, most probably they will lose their ground in the following election. But during those years, the PAP literally won every single seat except Anson.. and its a testament that the citizens are willing to forgo these rights for the sake of economic growth. Phillipines have a democracy and they achieve independence earlier than us, but why are'nt they as rich and successful as the USA?<br><br>Of course, the above mentioned discusses bout the early years of Singapore nationhood. Nowadays with the high literacy rate among the young Singaporeans, the fast changing economy, the governing method has TO CHANGE in order to bring the best out of us to keep Singapore competitive. I am an economic idiot, so don't expect me to suggest ideas and ways to improve Singapore's competitiveness.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>"Do not let "one bad apple, spoil the entire barrel" is a common sense approach to such a situation.<br><br>In which society can we claim to be perfect ?<br><br>Even in the very forgiving and hospitable Thai society of devout Buddhists, we see two deviant Thai fishermen raping and murdering an innocent Irish girl holidaying in Thailand"<br><br>Its a common fact that the crime rates in US is very high despite the fact that they are first world. If you are telling me that a third world country has high crime rates, it is understandable since starvation can turn a hungry man into a hardcore criminal. If the law and order in US is so good, why was it that over half of the Americans supported the stance of the Singaporean govt in caning Michael Fay? Why is it that the US citizens living in suburban areas are somewhat apprehensive when going out in the late hours of the night?<br><br>"At least, in the USA they do not sentence its Citizen to jail and 3 strokes of the cane (if you are below 50 years old) for a minor offense of renting a room or a house to an illegal immigrant."<br><br>Agree. Especially when it is harsh to punish a illiterate old person who rent a room out without knowing how to identify real work permits from fake permits. I only hope there are mitigating factors being considered instead of mandatory caning involved.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>"In any case, right or wrong, should the World stand silently on the sideline while Saddam Hussein rape and kill his citizens, much as Idi Amin had done to his Ugandan citizens - eating their brains and heart as well ?"<br><br>I prefer to see this as a game of chess, where the US can establish influence in the oil rich Middle East region. I don't see US invading Rwanda in 1994 to stop the Rwandan genocide, since Rwanda is of little economic value to the US. Most of the military action that the US get involved in is either of strategic or economic uses e.g. Taiwan, South Korea, Iraq, etc.<br><br>"With FREEDOM - of speech, of the press, of gathering, of political participation, of political discourse - one has to accept the total pot of soup in any form.<br><br>It also comes with the FREEDOM OF CHOICE - to walk away and not listen to the antics of anyone or any event whom you choose not to pay attention to."<br><br>+1  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised"><br><br>"Can this be done in the present Singapore system, if you decline to attend an important event involving some big wig from the Ruling Party - will retribution come to you in some other form if you reject the invitation?"<br><br>Retribution?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br>ISA ah?<br><br>"The problem with the Speakers' Corner is that of the authority closely policing the speakers and the contents of the speeches to be made.<br><br>Is there any FREEDOM to be spontaneous at Speakers' Corner ? "<br><br>That depends on what topic you are discussing. If you are making animated speeches like "Mr xxx minister is stupid! He is idiot to implement such a policy!" That's downright defamation.<br><br>If you are talking about race issues, then good luck to you for meddling with a time bomb. These issues are very sensitive, given Singapore's past history. And more so if you consider that we are surrounded by two large Muslim-dominated countries. Try denouncing Christianity or praising Osama in US and let's see what will happen to the speaker.<br><br>There should'nt be any problems if you are addressing a social issue (exclude religions, race) or suggesting alternative ideas towards a govt policy. Criticize is one thing, but a good speaker should also suggest ideas or alternative solutions if he or she really want to comment on a govt policy.<br><br>"Singapore has been in the making for FORTY YEARS - and we are supposed to have achieved FIRST WORLD status as observed by MM LKY, yet the political minds of the Ruling Elite is that of a Third World political culture of "kiasuism" - with all the gerrymandering of election boundaries, fear of losing even a single seat to the Opposition, overkill even to an HONEST Opposition Manifesto."<br><br>+1. I am somewhat disturbed by the ministers' reactions to the opposition Manifesto. I hope you can see that I do agree with the gerrymandering issues, the rising costs, education and FT issues.</div>

You quite rightly mention the cons of a censored press and the pros of a free press, but you have not mentioned the cons of a free press, which I did.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Atobe<br><br>"You are correct in your statement concerning the Citizen's support to the Vietnam War; however you must recall that the American involvement in the Vietnam War span across more then TWENTY YEARS - from the Eisenhower Administration of the 1950s to Nixon in the 1970s."<br><br>Not only did the Vietnam War took a toll, there was increased conscription and there were also reports of atrocities committed against the Vietnamese civilians. These factors caused a large number of US citizens to stage protests against the rise in conscription and the atrocities committed against the Vietnamese civilians. The US govt instead began investigations of U.S. citizens who were suspected of aiding the NLF. This occurred in mid 1960s.<br><br>"You will probably have heard the lamenting regrets of LKY in recent years of an over aggressive Family Planning Program, and the Law that protects Women's Right preventing 'Second Wives' to be taken by any successful male to expand his genetic pool."<br><br>+1  A developing country (just like Singapore that time) will have a large, youthful population and the demographc curve would be a pyramid, meaning if the trend continues, there would be a risk of over-population and unemployment.<br><br>"If you did not hear of this, you must have heard the more current lamenting of the lack of talent, of entrepreneurship, of low birth rates?"<br><br>The lack of talent and entrepreneurship are due to the rigid and inflexible education system imposed by the MOE. You should see that I have always lamented the Singapore education system.<br><br>Low birth rates? ALL first world/developed countries have this problem. Japan, France, Singapore, etc have a large aging population and low birth rates. Even US, UK and France--the countries that pride themselves on human rights, face the problem of low birth rate. Then let me ask you, if you are the leader of the country, what would you do to solve this problem? And things are worse during a recent findings that Singapore is ranked last in terms of erm.. number of love-making sessions!<br><br>"The period towards Singapore entry into Malaysia, there were loud debate against the terms and conditions for Singapore's entry as a member state of the proposed Malaysia. In the tussle for public opinion, LKY had several Opposition members arrested and jailed, allowing his Party to dominate the Singapore Parliament to this day."<br><br>You mean Operation Coldstore? Well, LKY invoked the ISA, which was introduced by the BRITIsH THEMSELVES, to arrest Barisan Socialis members before the merger. In those days, communists were viewed almost in the same light as how we view terrorists right now. I would say he was shrewd enough to use a law introduced by the British tO round the members up so that Singapore could be broken free of British control.<br><br>Of course, the merger was a mistake. And no less LKY's fault. His promise not to engage in Federal policies was broken and Malaysia and Singapore ties continue to be strained til this day.<br><br>Come to think of it, the preacher of human rights, USA, also has a similar law as ISA, except that it is better-named-- Patriot Act.<br><br>"The dominance and election success was partly helped by the many insidious and calculated moves that prejudiced a fair election process with the numbering of voter slips - which remained pervasive to this day."<br><br>Gerrymandering, etc issues, which I have acknowledged.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The US Citizens support of the Singaporean caning of Michael Fay is not a reflection of the increase in crime but the frustrations towards a Law that prohibit the use corporal punishment as part of parental guidance."<br><br>You may ask, why would these Americans want to use coporal punishment? Are they somewhat disillusioned with their law? Or could it be that their penal system is way too lax? As I mentioned earlier, a convicted murderer has the opportunity to have a holiday out of the prison. Please don't tell me you will feel very very safe walking alone with him in the dark.<br><br>"Even the Chief Justice of Singapore has also expressed similar sentiments that unless Parliament amend the legislation, the Judiciary is bound by the Law."<br><br>+1. Oral sex is a crime?!<br><br>"In his early years in Politics as an Opposition, LKY had so eloquently stated :<br><br>"Repression, Sir, is a habit that grows. I am told it is like making love - it is always easier the second time!<br>The first time there may be pangs of conscience, a sense of guilt. But once embarked on this course, with constant repetition, you get more and more brazen in the attack and in the scope of the attack" "<br><br>I have always viewed him as a stern leader. Not flinching an eye even when implementing the most unpopular policies, he was quoted to be preferred to be feared than to be respected. To me, a developing country needs a stern, no nonsense leader. The result of Singapore just before he stepped down as PM says it all. He used the most un-orthodox method of governing and implemented controversial policies, but Singapore become prosperous. You can't deny that, do you? And Singapore's route to success has been being studied by other countries.<br><br>Now that Singapore has become a developed country, what's the route? Seriously, nobody knows. Even other developed countries are not sure of the answer since technology, globalization, etc happens in the twinkle of the eye. IMHO, a new way of governing should ensure that the people's wishes be conveyed to them. So I agree partly with you about the PAP holding power for too long.<br><br>"It all boils down to the 'survival instinct' and the 'law of the jungle' where the fittest survive.<br><br>In a global competition that is largely driven by industries and commerce, it will also require that one's trading partners will share a certain degree of similar values - which at times require a blinkered vision, out of politico-economic expediency"<br><br>So is invading another country on the pretext of "liberating" people who are under a cruel regime deem justified when in actual fact they are trying to gain economic advantage? Come on, we are talking about the USA, the world leader and the preacher of human rights. I hope you can still remember the prisoners' abuse, etc.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>"The Civil Rights Movement forms the basis from which the US Federal Law was formulated to take precedence over ride the State Law that any offender can find protection, and has been used to prosecute all racist crime and discrmination occurring anywhere in the USA.<br><br>Similarly, in Europe - from the experience of the Holocaust, the European Union and its Agencies are mobilised to combat any acts of racism or discrimination, where agencies such as EUROCONE has been formed to eradicate racism.<br><br>"An European Commission against Racism and Intolerance (ECRI) was set up following a decision of the First Summit of Heads of States and Government of the member states of the Council of Europe"<br><br>Similarly in Australia, racist (Paula Hansen) has been ostracised by the larger Australian community, and Australian Federal Law will allow the severest punishment to be meted out to any racist offender.<br><br>Efforts have been made by the Australian Federal Government to change social attitude by setting up a new department headed by an Acting Race Discrimination Commissioner<br><br>However, racism should not be confused with the respective Government policy towards foreign immigrants who attempt to enter the country illegally."<br><br>Sure. They do set up quite a number of govt-based organisations with fanciful names to counter racism. So has the racism situation over there improved? Hope you can provide me with some statistics.<br><br></div>
