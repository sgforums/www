Invest in education of Singaporean, SG GOV should not continue raising the burden of it's citizen on education cost. Don't fall on deaf ears.<br><br>By the way, MIW are you the copycat on solution to health care cost woes? laugh or the Americans are the copycat?</blockquote>America has been a great country where the people support the government at every turn of crisis because its government has a tradition of respecting its people's views and caring for its people.<br><br>Just compare what the American government has done over the last 40 years for its people it is not difficult to see why they are behind their government. It is not difficult to understand why Singaporeans are a bit of switch-off and generally unhappy with its government.<br><br>But the people are always blamed as whiners or rude. What cause these behavior? I thought among so many scholars some would come out to speak out against the uncaring and disaffective policies and corrections made but none of them have spoken up so far.<br><br>The only people who will look after the people will be the people themselves as seen in the NKF saga. Even after horrendous wrong doings were disclosed of the NKF board and its ex-CEO, it looks like the government is not going to listen to people's problems and soon close the chapter with some utterances uncaring denials or justifications like "there was no legal wrongs committed" and "case closed" and "let's move on".</div>

It should admit its mistakes of its many past policies as posted causing disaffection and dividing the people.<br><br>If it still is unheeding of the people's causes it is for sure the people will remain switched off and not willing to make changes of their past attitude toward the government.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, I am generally being nosy down here.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Mr Robert, do the Americans generally support the government during the Vietnam war, Afghanistan war and the invasion of Iraq? I remember there were widespread protests staged by the American citizens themselves. How about Hurricane Katrina incident?<br><br>Applying the principle of individual above society is commendable. Most law offenders have the chance to repent and hopefully, contribute to society in the future. Unfortunately, the deterrent purpose of the law is somewhat sacrificed in the process-- high crime rates such as murder, rape, etc since such principles also applies to hard core criminals as well. I have watched a Discovery documentary whereby a convicted murderer was serving his sentence and he was once given a holiday. And guess what, he murdered two young children (without any motive) during his holidays. And yes, its in USA.<br><br>Maybe I am making a generalization, but human nature is degrading. The world leader, USA, promotes human rights, moral values etc all over the world yet they are the ones who invade another country despite strong international objections. While religions all around the world preach peace and inculcate positive moral values, yet armies all over the world are manufacturing and inventing deadlier weapons.<br><br>Freedom of speech? I do have reservations bout this. I can imagine CSJ making animated speeches for hours  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  On a more serious note, how many Singaporeans are willing to spend the time to listen to lengthy speeches? Most of us are either busily making $$ or making love (encouraged by our govt!). The mindset of most Singaporeans is that earning money is the top priority than having the Western human rights. I have'nt been noticing, but I bet the attendance for the Speakers' Corner must have been disappointing.<br><br>To me, changing the mindset of the population should be achieved through education. That's why I am a fervent supporter of a complete overhaul of the current education system and encourage creativity, entrepreneurship and social awareness, etc. Our population have to be more matured in order to practise rights such as freedom of speech, etc. You can try chatting with the local university undergraduates and understand their mentality. Watching the latest movies, shopping, rushing projects and assignments are the topmost priorities rather than discuss human rights and politics. How do I know? Cuz I am one of them as well and they started to alienate me if I ever chat politics or human rights issues with them  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Censored press? Pros and cons. Rightly pointed out by Atobe and Mr Robert, most Singaporeans do not have the chance to read bout the failings of Temasek Holdings, our local govt, etc. Having a totally free press does have its cons as well. How bout the debacle on England team manager Sven-Goran Eriksson? It just shows that a free press is profit-oriented and it prefers to over-sensationalize trivial issues regarding big-shots and celebrities.<br><br>That doesn't mean I am a PAP supporter. Far from it. In fact, I know who to vote for in the incoming election-- that is, provided there are opposition candidates.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> Having oppositon parties in parliament can always  provide some form of opposing yet constructive views to a party that hold too long in power. I do agree with most of the points mentioned by Atobe and Mr Robert bout rising costs, gerrymandering, FTs issues, etc but please do not protray US like a utopia. Maybe we should wait for the results of a poll to judge whether the American people are truly behind their government or not.<br><br>As I say, I am just being nosy <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> And now back to hit the textbooks! Feel free to reply but hopefully no salmanization pls!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Erwin_Rommel:</div><div class="quote_body">Hi, I am generally being nosy down here.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Mr Robert, do the Americans generally support the government during the Vietnam war, Afghanistan war and the invasion of Iraq? I remember there were widespread protests staged by the American citizens themselves. How about Hurricane Katrina incident? </div></blockquote>The US Citizens actually supported the Vietnam War in the 1960s until the war stretched on with too high a toll due to the political failure to understand the use of the military to win a decisive war, and allowed the Vietnamese to stretch the manpower resources for too long and wear down the will of the Americans to "sue for peace".<br><br>The present wars in Afghanistan and Iraq are two different wars fought for different reasons when comparison is made with each wars, and that of the Vietnam War.<br><br>Afghanistan continue to receive firm positive support from the US Citizenry in its continued hunt for Al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden -  to settle scores for the attack to the Twin Towers of the New York World Trade Centre.<br><br>Iraq war had received the support of the US Citizens despite the doubts and questions concerning the WMD issues touted by the first Bush Adminnistration; and Bush continued to enter the Second Term despite the Iraq War.<br><br>In any case, have you missed the "heart beat" of this thread in that the US Citizens will have at least the COLLECTIVE INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS to launch a protest - physical or verbal - towards the policies of a Government which they have elected and gone astray.<br><br>Can the Singapore Citizens ever dreamed of protesting in any form ?<br><blockquote>:<strong><br>Applying the principle of individual above society is commendable. Most law offenders have the chance to repent and hopefully, contribute to society in the future. Unfortunately, the deterrent purpose of the law is somewhat sacrificed in the process-- high crime rates such as murder, rape, etc since such principles also applies to hard core criminals as well. I have watched a Discovery documentary whereby a convicted murderer was serving his sentence and he was once given a holiday. And guess what, he murdered two young children (without any motive) during his holidays. And yes, its in USA. </strong></blockquote>Do not let "one bad apple, spoil the entire barrel" is a common sense approach to such a situation.<br><br>In which society can we claim to be perfect ?<br><br>Even in the very forgiving and hospitable Thai society of devout Buddhists, we see two deviant Thai fishermen raping and murdering an innocent Irish girl holidaying in Thailand.<br><br>Should we condemn Thailand, its society, its culture, it national credo, or its religion ?<br><br>At least, in the USA they do not sentence its Citizen to jail and 3 strokes of the cane (if you are below 50 years old) for a minor offense of renting a room or a house to an illegal immigrant.<br><blockquote>:<strong><br>Maybe I am making a generalization, but human nature is degrading. The world leader, USA, promotes human rights, moral values etc all over the world yet they are the ones who invade another country despite strong international objections. While religions all around the world preach peace and inculcate positive moral values, yet armies all over the world are manufacturing and inventing deadlier weapons. </strong></blockquote>You are generalizing to a certain extent, but not too far from the truth.<br><br>The world of the "big fish eat small fish, and small fish eat shrimps" is a real world.<br><br>In any case, right or wrong, should the World stand silently on the sideline while Saddam Hussein rape and kill his citizens, much as Idi Amin had done to his Ugandan citizens - eating their brains and heart as well ?<br><blockquote>:<strong><br>Freedom of speech? I do have reservations bout this. I can imagine CSJ making animated speeches for hours  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  On a more serious note, how many Singaporeans are willing to spend the time to listen to lengthy speeches? Most of us are either busily making $$ or making love (encouraged by our govt!). The mindset of most Singaporeans is that earning money is the top priority than having the Western human rights. I have'nt been noticing, but I bet the attendance for the Speakers' Corner must have been disappointing. </strong></blockquote>With FREEDOM - of speech, of the press, of gathering, of political participation, of political discourse - one has to accept the total pot of soup in any form.<br><br>It also comes with the FREEDOM OF CHOICE - to walk away and not listen to the antics of anyone or any event whom you choose not to pay attention to.<br><br>Can this be done in the present Singapore system, if you decline to attend an important event involving some big wig from the Ruling Party - will retribution come to you in some other form if you reject the invitation ?<br><br>The problem with the Speakers' Corner is that of the authority closely policing the speakers and the contents of the speeches to be made.<br><br>Is there any FREEDOM to be spontaneous at Speakers' Corner ?<br><blockquote>:<strong><br>To me, changing the mindset of the population should be achieved through education. That's why I am a fervent supporter of a complete overhaul of the current education system and encourage creativity, entrepreneurship and social awareness, etc. Our population have to be more matured in order to practise rights such as freedom of speech, etc. You can try chatting with the local university undergraduates and understand their mentality. Watching the latest movies, shopping, rushing projects and assignments are the topmost priorities rather than discuss human rights and politics. How do I know? Cuz I am one of them as well and they started to alienate me if I ever chat politics or human rights issues with them  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  </strong></blockquote>Singapore has been in the making for FORTY YEARS - and we are supposed to have achieved FIRST WORLD status as observed by MM LKY, yet the political minds of the Ruling Elite is that of a Third World political culture of "kiasuism" - with all the gerrymandering of election boundaries, fear of losing even a single seat to the Opposition, overkill even to an HONEST Opposition Manifesto.<br><br></div>
