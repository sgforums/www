"In yr 1980, life expectancy of a singaporean male is 69. If you retire at 60, you only have 9yrs and your CPF or whatever savings should be enough to last. In yr 2000, life expectancy of a male singaporean is 81. If you got retrenched at 55 and have no job, you are expected to depend only your CPF for 26 yrs!!!" Think about that.<br><br>Raising the retirement age to 65 is only meant to justify the government's decision to delay paying out our CPF. The reality is how many of us will continue to be employ after 50??  I was told in Singapore, if you were retrenched or have no job after 45, it is not likely that you will find another job. In this world, only in singapore are jobs created with title like MM for ppl like LKY. If those with MBA are driving taxi, then we may need a degree to sell karanguni.<br><br></div>

In today's context, making changes to a system that has already produced benefits for some elite with spillover for the rest is certainly much more difficult. Especially so when this must be done in a democratic and peaceful manner. Discussions in such forum are to bring to the awareness of the people of singapore what we do not know and what we should be striving for, the high moral objective of freedom of speech, etc.....<br><br>If everyone with such awareness run away, no change will ever take place. Imagine if LKY, GKS, TCC, Rajaratnam,....all ran to UK, India, Malaysia or Australia, and Lee SC ran to China....nothing would happen to singapore independence.<br><br>We are here talking only, many are putting their theories here for discussions only, how many of us here are actually prepared to take actions? I hope nobody is thinking that by talking here PAP will scrap GRC or make changes.<br><br>It is never easy, but if all we think of is to leave this country if things don't change, then leave, why bother to come back when you are rich? to show off to those who can't make it?<br><br>Get your mindset right or you lose your moral ground in discussing singaporean issues.</div>

You are really not coping with a 3 member family, you are coping with a house and a car. Most ppl in major cities in the world don't own the house they live and they don't drive, and they are proud to be Hongkonger and Newyorker.  if renting a house and take MRT makes your family happier would you do it?<br><br>If you can't even make it renting a house then forget about staying in hotels.<br><br>You wanted to contribute to singapore? how? done any social work? fund raising? participated in any activities that give no monetary returns??
