            <div class='col-md body'>This sounds scaring isn't it?<br><br>CPF<br>A paltry payback<br>Up to 75% have insufficient funds to retire on. By Wayne Arnold. IHT<br>May 18, 2005<br><br>AS President George W Bush tries to persuade the US Congress that some Social Security payments should go into a personal investment account, the island state of Singapore is grappling with an extreme version of what he has proposed.<br><br>Singapore's national pension program places every penny a worker contributes - 33 percent of total pay - into a personal account.<br><br>Workers can choose whether to accept a guaranteed deposit rate from the government or chase higher returns in the property or stock markets.<br><br>Called the Central Provident Fund, Singapore's programme has succeeded in increasing home ownership and virtually eliminating the cost to the government of funding retirement by taxing the young.<br><br>But is the fund adequate for retirement? Not according to Leo Lim Tong, who after working 16 years as a hotel cook finds himself at 60 embarking on a career as a security guard at a local shopping center.<br><br>The returns on the fund, known locally as CPF, he said, are "only a little bit, not enough."<br><br>Nor did it work for Shu Ting Hoe, a career banker who retired at 57 thanks to an early retirement package from his employer. "Depending on CPF alone, it's not enough to retire," Shu said.<br><br>When the governing party took control of a newly independent Singapore in 1965, it rejected the idea of a welfare system that would drain public coffers and adapted the fund system left by the British, expanding it to channel savings toward social goals.<br><br>"Singapore doesn't purport to have a perfect system," Ng Eng Hen, the manpower minister, said. But he disputed the notion that the CPF provided inadequate returns.<br><br>Workers contribute 20 percent of their salary and their employers the equivalent of 13 percent, all of which goes into three accounts, including one for medical insurance and health care.<br><br>Once workers reach the retirement age of 62, they can either take their savings as a lump sum or begin drawing it down in installments.<br><br>If they have saved more than a minimum set by the government, they can begin withdrawing at 55.<br><br>The government pays a guaranteed interest rate on fund deposits that works out to about 3.4 percent.<br><br>Depositors can also invest their savings in mutual funds, insurance products or, to a limited extent, in individual stocks. Whatever they contribute, as well as any interest or profit earned on their money, is tax-free.<br><br>Mukul Asher, an economics professor at the new Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy here, estimates that as many as 75% of fund members end up without enough to retire on and that the fund delivers on average less than 30% of the average depositor's last salary.<br><br>That compares with 70 % in France and 45% in the United States.<br><br>Economists say the government uses the fund as a fiscal tool, periodically changing the contribution rates the way a central bank changes interest rates.<br><br>In the 1980s, the government pushed contribution rates as high as 50 percent to fight inflation.<br><br>After the Asian financial crisis in the late '90s, it halved the contribution from employers, to 10 percent, effectively giving the entire country a pay cut.<br><br>Allowing members to withdraw their savings for such government-ordained investments opens another hole in retirement planning, economists say. Asher calculates that 70% of all funds deposited end up being withdrawn, often to buy property.<br><br>In the 1960s, to enable its population to move out of slums, the government began allowing citizens to withdraw CPF savings to buy public housing.<br><br>Singaporeans today withdraw more to pay for property than they do for retirement, a situation that leaves many asset-rich and cash-poor. Many are loath to sell, economists say, because property values have fallen by roughly a third in the past decade.<br><br>Ng said that most elderly property owners were sitting on profits that could fund their retirements. Cultural pressure to own and pass along a home dissuade many from selling, but "they can live with their children," he said.<br><br>Although caring for the elderly is part of traditional Asian values, critics of the system say relying on the young to care for the elderly amounts to just the kind of generational tax that Singapore's system was supposed to avoid.<br><br>Perhaps the most worrisome feature is the record on Singaporeans investing their own funds.<br><br>According to Asher, CPF members on average lose 15 percent on their investments. When they pick individual stocks, they lose even more - about one-third.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Compare the current interest rates and inflation rates -- we'd get a pretty good idea how fast the value of our money is shrinking in the bank.<br><br>The 75% would most certainly become a heavy burden on the greying nation of Singapore. However, while it is never too early to start planning, this is not a problem that could be solved easily just through financial planning. While some are spending too much to bother on any planning, some are earning too little to spare any on planning.<br><br>Hope the Finance Minister could come up with a more constructive plan than gambling on Singapore's future and warming to rich neighbours for scraps.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I am glad most Singaporeans have woken up to this sad fact- the non-elitists are all going to retire with a huge HDB mortgage to worry about, and nothing much left in their bank accounts.<br><br>Most Singaporeans will be left  with very little precious except devalued S$ in the bank.<br><br>So you see, this is the plan - ensure ordinary people don't get too rich.  Too many rich people equates more financial support for the opposition parties.<br><br>The only  people allowed to be richer are bankers and board directors in Government Linked Companies.<br><br>And many MPs and ex-Generals are board directors.  All receiving big fat bonuses and directors salaries.<br><br>The absolute control and utilisation of CPF moneys can only be conjured by a heartless and cunning politician, and Lee Kuan Yew is one such man in history.<br><br>I am waiting patiently for his era to be over, so that life can return to normalcy, minus all the interferences and control by an aging despot and his band of elitists.<br><br>I accept this claim that LKY  built Singapore to what it is today - a massive slave camp for working Singaporeans.</div>

Most of us are trying to make ends meet. When we hit 65, our bodies are so worn out, I don't know if we would be visiting CPF on a wheelchair or walking support.<br><br>the system always favour the employer. So be not surprise if anothe crisis comes around, employers might rally and drop their contribution further and freeze our wages. Meanwhile, some transport company will sing some tunes and then prices of necessities will go up, cost of living will also go up.. But then during those long winded wayang sessons they like to play on TV, someone will say, the cost of living compare to that base year 1998 (which is the boom year) shows that it is level and in fact might be down. *fake chuckle* And all the dogs also chuckle together.<br><br>When disasters struck our neighbours, somehow there's always funds for them. Then when our own people ask for some help, somehow the funds are not accessible to us. Then to ensure the funds are topped up, ERP rates are increased, perhaps tax laws adjusted to cream deeper, gst increase to get more and whatever combination you can some out .. and maybe the system might get creative, tax the air we break or the farts we let out. Maybe we have to install a cash card on our heads so that we are charged when we walk in and out our own HDB flats.<br><br>Ah the CPF is a large large pool of monies that is invested everywhere. The returns on these investments are pretty hugh but the interest rate is sadly pitiful but then there is a lot of hierarchy to feed. As long as we don't see it, even not paying a single cent of interest, is also possible as long as the system can explain away the people's doubts which I am sure they can, afterall most of us don't know these instruments well enough .. and who dare to talk back?<br><br>Well they can raise it to a point where we can never see it, touch it or feel it. In fact, I had this gnawing feeling that by the time I am an ancient dino, I doubt very much I will get it back ... because the current bb-boomers are getting to that point and will drain the system. Once the govt learn of it, policies will be put around drawing out cpf and so can you imagine the many barriers we will face when we are eligable to draw our CPF?<br><br>Thinking of the worse case scenarios...  Best case scenario...  maybe N Korea might get crazy and boom everyone in the region... hahaha!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The idea of working beyond 62 yrs of age is appealing when you're working in a highly paid cushy white collar type job while being chauffered around and surrounded by bodyguards and lackeys.

Like AV said, now old folks are so poor they had to turn to scraping left overs, drink cans, cardboard boxes, working in poorly paid janitorial service and get yelled at by youngsters and bullied by employers. My own parents had hit 70 and guess what, my dad had to pick drink cans, scrap metal and cardboard boxes from factories and rubbish dumps to survive. You can say I am a bad kid to let my folks do that but family survival is at stake and the govt will never pity us if we fail to pay the bills.<br><br>By the time all we all get to 60s, because of changes in medical science and that we are better educated/sound of mind and actually be able to contribute to society but are we able to get jobs that allow us to contribute? My operations team in US had a 50 year old lady and the youngest in the operations team is in his id 30s (no one employ youngsters cause they are really unreliable and inexperienced - we don't like youngsters cause they like to do cowboy things and let us oldies clean up). We have 60 year old System Admins who is asked to stay on cause his service is valuable to the company. Age is not a concern nor a factor and in fact there is a law that states that age discrimination is disallowed. So because of his age and years of experience, he is one of the highest paid SA in office.  But over here, the first to get the chop is always the older folks and staff are though of as a burden to the company, not assets. we can never compare to other developed world in terms of dealing with labour issues because the system here does not work this way.<br><br>But would this mindset change happen at all in the employers? Is there an example that is set by the govt for the employers (who are mostly following the leader)? Birth rates are not going to supply enough people but most asian employers management style and mindset are really narrow and stubborn.  Most pay lip service that they "change" but actually, underneath its still doing the same thing and calling it a different name. (Isn't that what our 'leaders' do - so employers learn fast). Therefore, my humble opinion is that it might change perhaps 3 generation after me and all i know is that when I get old, I will have to settle for a janitorial job even though I might be a MBA.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Our govt seems to have this strange obsession with "keeping the workforce young" that is paving the way for ageism in Singapore.  It is however not applied across the board as you can see many ancient specimens still sitting on their asses in parliament and other top positions in both the private sector and GLCs.<br><br>It is ironic, to say the least, that the cpf scheme, with its monthly deductions, high minimum sum requirement, late withdrawal age(assuming you even have anything left to withdraw) causes the most suffering for the very people that cpf is supposed to help, the lower income group.<br><br>I also know some people, who for one reason or another have been unable to get employment after being laid off, are finding it hard to make ends meet. Now, they have very healthy cpf balances (200k ++) but they can't touch a single cent for another 15 years or so.  One commented that he'd probably have to kill himself to get the govt to release the money to his family.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Very true.<br>All our CPF already gone into paying for our hse./ HDB.<br>By the time we reach 55, there isn't much left to withdraw.<br>We also have to support our elderly parents + kids so our Medisave  would have dried up.<br><br>Interest from bank savings are low, investment in shares &amp; unit trusts don't give good returns + salary not keeping up with increases in cost of living.<br>In fact expect to be jobless when u get older cos nobody wants to employ old workers.<br>U cannot downgrade cos prop. prices are still down, also if u sell, where to stay?<br>Very depressing, that's why govt wants casino cos less taxes to collect in future.<br></div>
