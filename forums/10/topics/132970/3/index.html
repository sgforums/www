Most of us are trying to make ends meet. When we hit 65, our bodies are so worn out, I don't know if we would be visiting CPF on a wheelchair or walking support.<br><br>the system always favour the employer. So be not surprise if anothe crisis comes around, employers might rally and drop their contribution further and freeze our wages. Meanwhile, some transport company will sing some tunes and then prices of necessities will go up, cost of living will also go up.. But then during those long winded wayang sessons they like to play on TV, someone will say, the cost of living compare to that base year 1998 (which is the boom year) shows that it is level and in fact might be down. *fake chuckle* And all the dogs also chuckle together.<br><br>When disasters struck our neighbours, somehow there's always funds for them. Then when our own people ask for some help, somehow the funds are not accessible to us. Then to ensure the funds are topped up, ERP rates are increased, perhaps tax laws adjusted to cream deeper, gst increase to get more and whatever combination you can some out .. and maybe the system might get creative, tax the air we break or the farts we let out. Maybe we have to install a cash card on our heads so that we are charged when we walk in and out our own HDB flats.<br><br>Ah the CPF is a large large pool of monies that is invested everywhere. The returns on these investments are pretty hugh but the interest rate is sadly pitiful but then there is a lot of hierarchy to feed. As long as we don't see it, even not paying a single cent of interest, is also possible as long as the system can explain away the people's doubts which I am sure they can, afterall most of us don't know these instruments well enough .. and who dare to talk back?<br><br>Well they can raise it to a point where we can never see it, touch it or feel it. In fact, I had this gnawing feeling that by the time I am an ancient dino, I doubt very much I will get it back ... because the current bb-boomers are getting to that point and will drain the system. Once the govt learn of it, policies will be put around drawing out cpf and so can you imagine the many barriers we will face when we are eligable to draw our CPF?<br><br>Thinking of the worse case scenarios...  Best case scenario...  maybe N Korea might get crazy and boom everyone in the region... hahaha!<br><br></div></blockquote>Yes!!! You are right!!! Just because someone lived beyond 80.  They assumed that all singaporeans will be the same.<br><br>Someone, who have swimming pool at home, best medical attention, best food, worries free, increlible fortune, living in luxuries, enjoying live, travelling free and in high profile.

            <div class='col-md body'>Personally, I believe that running your own business of any size, certainly beats be employed. Why??<br><br>Being self-employed or in business, with business failures due to poor judgement or financial management aside, ensures you can eat 3 meals a day so long as you are hardworking, not lazy, and don't expect to become some business tycoon.  Expectations must be grounded, frugal and humble.<br><br>Being employed these days means nothing. There are so many "high-fliers" who in their hey days, earned up to S$8,000 - S$15,000 per month, got replaced and are now sunken by depression into obscurity, gone abroad for greener pastures, became Taxi drivers, turned to the bottle, or became business people.<br><br>I see a lot of loud characters around, flaunting their achievements in their fancy cars and flashy lifestyles - they just don't know that the next ride after you crest the hill, is downhill.<br><br>Employers are largely hiring foreigners, so where do locals find jobs? As a business person, you'd also be tempted to hire foreigners, simply because they are cheaper. Do we see the problem here????<br><br>Locals can perform too. But they need time out to be with family, must have the best market rate salary, and cannot stay late most of the time.<br><br>So where do we go from here...?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Let's take a step back, and look at this scenario objectively:<br><br>If you do your job well in the EYES OF YOUR EMPLOYER (not yours), they would have no reason to retrench, much less fire you, and if the company was downsizing, they'd still give you a great recommendation letter that would put you up for employment somewhere else. May not be as great but hey, you still have a job.<br><br>You carry on making your CPF downpayments but somewhere along the way you meet your partner in life and you decide to buy a house. You deplete your CPF almost completely to pay it off. Is it worthy immediate investment ?<br><br>CHOY! but Singaporeans lifestyle isn't all too perfect, people fall sick and undergo medical treatment, once again you pay out of your CPF. Just like you pay for your family's and their other misc fees such as school fees.<br><br>And you expect to have CPF left?<br><br>CPF IS sufficient for a reasonable lifestyle that you had (e.g. if you earned 15k/mth u roughly have 5k/mth now, if you earned 3k/mth, u roughly have 1k/mth now) provided you do not waste your CPF away.<br><br>Since Singaporeans are so fond of drawing and paying out of their CPF, what is the next best step?<br><br>I feel that upon reaching 21yrs of age, everyone should open a retirement fund whereby 10% of their monthly salary is deposited. This over 44yrs (65 std) will grow into a tidy sum through guaranteed deposits. 43% of salary gone now (10%+33%).  57% left. Save up 27% for immediate usage should there be a need (including insurance; I CANNOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH! Life insurance is very important! The odds of accidents happening are 1 in a million, but everyone dies, note LIFE INSURANCE and not accident insurance, I mean take both policies out but in proportion, along with your car,house blah blah insurance). 30% is left for immediate spending. 30% is enough to live within your means. Some people i know spend only 20% of their salary a month. I know everyone needs pampering so that 10% is for the weekly restaurant outing or family trip to the beach.<br><br>The reason why Singaporeans often run dry is they buy unnecessary stuff (even me), I feel that the govt is blamed wrongly in this case, although I do not like their way of looking through rose tinted glasses. So what, you think Singapore will have a better future in your hands? If you can't even manage your own retirement fund, you expect that you will do a better job with the lives of 4million?<br><br>The model I provided above is just one that I constructed through nights of careful thoughts and observation.<br><br>Good luck and all the best.<br><br>SupaFatty</div>
