So what was she so upset about? I suppose she was afraid that mentioning her along with Goldplus in the book would have drawn attention to the details of the transaction. That was unfortunate for us as we were out of Singapore's bookstores and National Library.<br><br>It was unfortunate for Helen Yeo as well. We did not care about the details surrounding Helen Yeo in the book, but, once she attacked us, we brought them to light on the website.
