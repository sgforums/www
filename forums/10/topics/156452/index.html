            <div class='col-md body'>At $200 pm the total ERP paid will come to $24,000 excluding interest over 10 years.<br><br>When LTA adds ERP gantries, the per trip ERP fee for the same journey goes up by the quantum unrelated to traffic congestion. For example when the original ERP gantry fees say at Orchard Road is $1.50 and another is added further upstream at $1.00 what is the percentage increase of ERF fee. Simple arithmetic shows that the ERP fee for the same journey now goes up by 1/2.5 x 100 %.<br><br>Does traffic congestion really increase by such heft 40% to justify such increase ? So whenever additional gantry is added and the original ERP fee remains and new ERP fee is simply added on, there will be hefty jump in ERP fee by the assumption that the new ERP fee represents the additional traffic increase. Isn't this kind of collecting ERP fee logical and if not isn't it pure profiterring?<br><br>To be fairer and more related to traffic congestion, the total ERP fees for the whole journey should reflect the additional congestions measured by the computerized meters not by this kind of add-on fees. Whenever new gantry is added the rest should be adjusted to reflect the actual traffic flow for the whole journey not by add-on unrelated to actual traffic congestion supposed to be controlled.<br><br>Cheaper COE does not hurt the government revenue as it will increase the ERP tolls and enrich the government salaries and bonuses.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Sg_Review/message/1961<br><br>By: Mellanie Hewlitt<br>Singapore Review<br>15 Jan 2005<br><br>COE, Parf, ARF - confused? Characteristics of The Great COE Scam<br><br>It is glaring that although Singapore has the world's most expensive<br>cars, the vast majority of car owners remain confounded by the<br>complicated pricing and ownership system. (See artcile from the New<br>Paper 14 Jan 2005 "COE, Parf, ARF - confused?")<br>http://newpaper.asia1.com.sg/top/story/0,4136,81225,00.html?<br><br>In all developed countries, buying a car is a simple and transparent<br>affair that is concluded between buyer and seller. The only other<br>third-parties involved are the insurance company and the finance<br>company. In Singapore a series of bureaucratic shields and paperwork<br>complicate the process.<br><br>The system is massively complicated, designed to confuse the average<br>car buyer. The objective is to disguise the underlying scam which<br>involves siphoning funds from the car owner into the bloated coffers<br>of the government.<br><br>The latest tender saw car COE premiums ending at $18,400 (up to<br>1,600cc) and $14,002 (above 1,600cc) - the lowest in over a decade.<br>The government is set to release between 100,000 to 120,000 COEs this<br>year. At an average COE "price" of approx SGD16,201 per COE this<br>amounts to a whopping SGD1,944,120,000/- in COE revenue for the<br>government.<br><br>Although the supposed objective of the COE system was to regulate<br>traffic flow and reduce traffic congestion, a number of<br>characteristic reveal the actual COE scam which has the hidden<br>purpose of siphoning funds from car owners.<br><br>The scam is Revealed via the following formulae:<br><br>COE Revenue = COE Price X Number of COE issued.<br><br>Regardless of the price of the COE, the total COE revenue collected<br>remains generally stable at approx SGD1.994 billion. This is because<br>any fall in price is compensated by issuance of more COEs hence<br>keeping the COE revenue relatively stable.<br><br>Below are some of the characteristics of the COE scam:<br><br>1) The illusion created by the Scam is that the price of the COE<br>flustuates as a result of demand and supply. In reality Car Owners<br>are actually providing a buffer for the government and ensuring a<br>steady COE income stream.<br><br>2) The scam also effectively encourages Car Owners to scrap perfectly<br>good vehicles early. 3-4 year old cars in mint condition and<br>purchased at very high COE prices are scrapped early when COE prices<br>fall. With a greater number of vehicles "retired prematurely" the<br>government can then issue more COEs at lower prices creating the<br>illusion of a COE market that is driven by demand and supply.<br><br>In the above scenario, the constant that is maintained is the COE<br>revenue. In a market that is truly driven by Demand and Supply, a<br>fall in demand will eventually lead to a fall in supply which will<br>translate into reduced sales reveunes.<br><br>3) It is Impossible to actually own a car in Singapore.<br>To ensure continuity of the COE income stream, the PAP government has<br>effectively made freehold car ownership in Singapore impossible. Car<br>Owners never actually "own" the car per say, even after spending so<br>much money on a piece of paper, all they actually hold is a lease<br>giving them a conditional revocable right to drive a car for 10 years.<br><br>At the expiration of this lease, the COE certificate is either<br>renewed via payment of additional fees by current owner, or (in event<br>the old owner chooses not to renew the lease) it is "purchased" by a<br>new bidder. Either ways the PAP government is assured of a never<br>ending income stream.<br><br>4) The scam is also revealed when a car owner attempts to scrap<br>prematurely. The system does not allow the car owner a cash rebate on<br>the balance COE. Instead, the car owner has to purchase another car<br>(and another COE) and deduct his COE rebates from the final purchase<br>price. This ruse ensures that COE money remains with the government<br>even when a COE is scrapped prematurely, thus assuring them of a<br>steady income stream, albeit at the expense of car owners.<br><br>5) This ruse has been used successfully for over a decade in<br>conjunction with a series of other hidden "taxes" (like the ERP, CPF,<br>GST etc) all designed to provide a cheap and ready source of revenue<br>for undisclosed government activities.<br><br>6) The scam is given a veil of legitimacy with the support of laws<br>and regulations. The local government owned media regularly report<br>that the COE system "is tightly regulated and very competitive".<br><br>7) A plethora of technical terms are used also add layers to the scam<br>and hide the underlying ruse. Terms like "COE", "PARF", "ARF", "OMV"<br>etc.<br><br>The COE scam also works in conjunction with other scams and is part<br>of a more elaborate process. On top of the COE, car owners also have<br>to pay Road Tax (which is reasonable) and also ERP (Electronic Road<br>Pricing) which imposes a further cost for road usage.<br><br>So Car owners are penalized not just for leasing a car but also for<br>the road usage.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> Other countries like Hong Kong also successfully control traffic<br>and the COE concept is conspicuously absent from these countries. In<br>fact in Hong Kong although there is a high cost to owning a car, this<br>is contained in the parking fees and charges which are paid to<br>landlords. The main difference here is that the parking fees are<br>collected by land lords and channeled back into the private sector.<br><br>In Singapore the COE revenues totaling SGD2 billion are channeled<br>directly into government coffers. No one knows what happens to this<br>massive amount of money.<br><br>9) How does the government justify the existence of such a system in<br>the first place? After years of implementation, the original<br>objective of the system (which was to control traffic congestion) has<br>long since been lost. Traffic jams are a common occurence all over<br>the island especially during peak hours and even the implementation<br>of additional penalties like the ERP have failed to address this<br>problem.<br><br>So what exactly are Singaporeans paying for when there is no concrete<br>proof for justification of the system? Such an obvious scam would<br>have risen many questioning eyebrows in other developed nations. But<br>here in Singapore part of the reason for the success in the deceit<br>lies in the social political circumstances which are unique only to<br>Singapore.<br><br>There is basically no accountability in government administration and<br>the political system effectively discourages any calls for<br>clarifications. Law suites are used as a convenient tool to silence<br>political opposition members and the international press.<br><br>After decades of indoctrination, local citizens have adopted a spirit<br>of apathy and unquestioning obedience to any enforced regulations and<br>policies. Indeed the government scammers are sound very legitimate.<br>They are usually polite, friendly, personable, sincere, convincing,<br>and controlling; formidable foes for more trusting average Car Owner.<br><br>10) Social and Psychological Indoctrination are important tools in<br>the scammers arsenal. In Singapore, a car has been portrayed by the<br>government as a "luxury item" in order to justify its high price.<br><br>On the other hand, government policies place immense pressure on<br>families to reproduce and more than one child. This, coupled with<br>uncertain employment (and high unemployment rates of 4.50% p.a.) have<br>necessitated dual income families with both spouses working long 12<br>hour work days. The hectic lifestyle and multiple roles of both<br>spouses (as wage earner, parents and care-takers of their own<br>parents) have rendered a car a very necessary asset.<br><br>11) Whilst the average con artist and scammer can be reported to the<br>authorities, how does one seek recourse when the local authorities<br>themselves are part of the elaborate hoax? The picture remains bleak<br>for Singaporeans as there seems no way out for them from this system.<br><br>12) According to a BBC article, not all scams are illegal by<br>definition. In fact some software scams are perfectly<br>legal. "Unscrupulous software suppliers have been taking advantage of<br>software license agreements to trick customers out of anything from<br>Â£10,000 to Â£100,000 plus. There is nothing illegal about it - some<br>of the world's largest software companies have been doing it to some<br>of the biggest companies in the world."<br>http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/the_economy/365065.stm<br><br>The COE scam falls within this special category.<br><br></div>

(Unless you are rich or wealth from your parents)   <span class="large"><span style="color: red;"><strong>Why let the gov make so much of our hard earned money?</strong></span></span><br>I've been driving for almost twenty years, I calculated, I've spent a least S$700K, instead, if I were to take public transport I would have saved more than half of the money.  Now, I would save the money by taking public transport, but not very cheap also. (The gov subsidizing their ass to us._) At least I have more disposable income and I would rather spent in elsewhere like Malaysia, Thailand, New Zealand or might be thinking of migrating there.<br><br>Take example for the fuel price; the percentage of tax are peg against the fuel price that floating with price fluctuation. In fact, everytime when the fuel price gone up, there will be an increased in tax revenue. So the gov always gain more whenever fuel price increases.<br><br>One thing to note also, during school holidays you will see much much lesser vehicles and less congestion on the roads. This shows that the people in Ministry of Education and schools own loads...of transports.  In my schooling days, I seen almost every teacher owns or drive a car. That shows that many people want to be glory in life to show people that you are more capable and richer.<br><br>Sg gov only care for themselves and thinking that they are the mighty gods of singapore. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"></div>
