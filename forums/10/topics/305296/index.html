Article overlooked the government's objective of pumping up population size in SG to 6.5 million...<br><br>... it wouldn't be called congestion then...<br><br>==============================================<br><strong>Congestion will have long-term impact on productivity and health<br>By Asha Popatlal, Channel NewsAsia | Posted: 26 January 2008 1722 hrs<br><br><span class="large">SINGAPORE: Congestion is a problem that affects most big cities.</span> </strong><br><br>If not resolved, it will have a long-term effect on the economy, loss in productivity as people get stuck in traffic, and even health.<br><br>Associate Professor Eustan Quah, an economist, said: "Congestion may mean that people would be more stressed up - they may return from work later than is normal and this in turn may leave little time for whatever time there is for relaxation and leisure and this in turn also affects health and family unity.Â”<br><br>He added: "Congestion is like stationary pollution and if it's big enough, it is going to release more emissions of carbon dioxide and various car pollutants and this is going to have an impact on people living around certain roads."<br><br>In Singapore, the solution has been two-pronged.<br><br>Get people to use more public transport while controlling vehicle growth and pricing busy roads - where rates have mostly gone up.<br><br>But with the benefits of an effective public transport system still some years away, is a never-ending spiral of higher road use costs then inevitable?<br><br>"We don't expect this to remain stagnant because people are more affluent, people change jobs, people change neighbourhoods and this is all going to have an impact on traffic volume and whether road pricing works or not at that price. So I don't think there is any one magic formula," said Quah.<br><br>An announcement on the review of managing road use - the last of three major policy changes - is expected soon. -CNA/vm<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'd like to present a way of looking at this problem for your consideration.<br><br>I think congestion arises at times when people travel to their destination along a route with insufficient capacity or efficiency.<br><br>So:<br><br>Stagger working hours to change times when people are on the road.<br><br>People, so reducing the number of people, with all else being equal, will reduce congestion.<br><br>Travel, ie traffice flow may be examined to allow for smoother traffic flows. Examine for and remove bottlenecks. Synchonize traffic lights. Look at locations where vehicles filter in or out of expressways.<br><br>Destination, the idea of the business park was to create a place where people could live and work in the same place, reducing congestion. If more people worked out of their homes it would lessen congestion. Decentralize the workplaces.<br><br>You can provide alternate routes so vehicles may opt to use other roads.<br><br>You can widen the road to increase it's capacity or make cars smaller or have alternative to cars, eg motorcycles etc.<br><br>Or study a way to make traffic move faster increasing efficiency or getting people to car pool. Or using public transport as buses carry more people and take up less space.<br><br>So there you have many valid points of views and many alternatives to choose from.</div>
