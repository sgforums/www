            <div class='col-md body'>I was reading the wat u guys were saying and i felt i might wan to add this in the reason why our government subsidise our school fees is because other countries like US UK and some European countires are doing so.... And because we were previously colonised by Britain which is following the welfare state policy which provides cradle to grave protection gives their population free education up to primary lvl and then continue to subsidise their further educations.This is why singapore's school fees are being subsidised because we tend to follow Britain in our administration even our english is british english and our parliament is also structured very similar to Bratian's parliament and even after government's subsidise of our sch fees, think abt it in poly u still need to pay up to 2k+ per year so ur still paying alot of $ to educate urself for a brighter future</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, happy lunar new year to all.<br><br>The gov, the trade societies, the religion and social groups, temples and the public have done a good job as can be seen from the recent activities going on here. The challenges come from the world outside of sg. We should concentrate in bringing more jobs and tourists to make this country more fun and an enjoyable one. Not forgetting also in developing more enterprises like creative tech. We need more talented people to create wider job field. If u r talented in some field, pls get started n do it. Dont have to drop your job now, concentrate in what u r doing now n change it gradually. Avoid abrupt changes please. start small and grow from it. Goto to the gov service to get help if u need it. We should work as one nation irregardless of race or religion.<br><br>If I have offended any body in my postings, I apologised for that. The above are just something that I observed, need not reply.<br></div>
