The issue was debated on by MPs. </div></blockquote>Salman,<br><br>Oh ya, I do rmb the star comments made by some of the ministers. "Casinos are a matter of maturity". I am aching to ask why Press Freedom and Freedom of Speech and criticising the govt (with respect toward race and religion of course) is not a matter of maturity too. And Balakrishnan is running as leader of GRC!!! Someone who makes such lame comments certainly doesn't have any credentials for leadership, apart from academics perhaps!!!!<br><br>I remember watching a former talk-show-cum-documentary series on Star World (Starhub Cable 1<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> called "Focus Asia". The topic happened to be racially-based job discrimination in Singapore. What struck me was what a Singaporean sent in when the program started its audience interaction statement i.e. the part where they start receiving and reading emails, faxes and SMSes from viewers of the show. His email began with the line "Everything in Singapore is a facade. Singaporeans live in a massive pipe dream built up by propaganda." And I'm inclined to believe that. So take this "debate" by MPs as part of the great Singaporean Dream. And start living in the real world for goodness sake!!!<br><br>Usually, I try to be rational in posting arguments for debate, but you simply veer off so much into irrational discourse that I ahve no choice but to resort to this.<br><br>Pls wake up Salman,<br>the (enlightened) pikamaster<br></div>
