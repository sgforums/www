            <div class='col-md body'><br>Before WW-1 and WW-2 broke out, there was economic hardship and recessions, nations were competing for the available raw materials and natural resources to enable their industries to grow; which in turn require them to compete with other nations for market shares throughout the world.<br><br>During those early days, Free Trade and Global Competition were unheard of; when ideologies and economics dictate that each nation that is powerful enought should have its own colonies to consume the industrial and consumer goods produced by the Motherland (or Fatherland).<br><br>With Globalisation, competition between suppliers for market share and dominance is no longer confined to one's own domestic borders. The cheapest place to manufacture, with the best equilibrium of low material and labor costs, infrastructure superiority, market size, will supercede even domestic politics.<br><br>With this comes, instability in the home countries of the multi-nationals that take advantage of Globalisation to the extreme limits and milk every gram of benefit from this new world order.<br><br>With instability, comes economic chaos, radical politics, nationalism, protectionism, and the full cycle of politics take on a full turn.<br><br>The instability of economies and politics based on failed ideologies, have shaken the foundations of developed and undeveloped countries.<br><br>The World will see a shaking up of the political systems, and a realignment of forces. Where will it bring us all, will depend on the wise counsel of National Political Leaders and their expert advisers whom they depend on.<br><br>With each country having its own priority for self-preservation and self-interest, it will be a slow process, with all the ups and downs.<br><br>Hopefully, with this globe having experienced two major world wars, and countless wars of varying scale, it is hoped that wisdom gained from past failures and successes will help to bring us forward to a better future.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>25Mar03 - Bilderberg Meeting - 2003 - set for Versailles<br><br>Annihilation of Palestinian People? Financial Meltdown Coming?<br><br>Leaks from last May's [2002] Bilderberg meeting were one of the first indications in the world that Iraq had been selected for the transatlantic alliance's next military outing.<br><br>Bilderberg appears to be where plans for U.S. imperial adventurism are run past the handful of people powerful enough to stop them. As the illegal Iraq invasion crawls on, what will be the next staging post in the global crisis being engineered by the governments of Britain, The United States and Israel? Judging by last year's leaks, a fly on the wall in Versailles might well discover the answer.<br><br>The lower echelons of the ruling class are being told right now that the world is facing total financial meltdown. The only way to save their hard earned investments, they are told, is to throw their weight behind this global crisis centred around the Middle East to replace the time-expired East-West cold war crisis.<br><br>In fact, one other way out is to abandon global capitalism altogether (apologies for starting it in the English Civil War by-the-way) and introduce state-sanctioned local money systems controlled and owned by the people of all nations. Instead we (in Europe) are being railroaded into the Eurodollar. If you were ever under an illusion that the Euro was different to the dollar then look on the back of each note - it shows a bridge stretching out from Europe across the Atlantic.<br><br>One can never be 100% certain about a venue and dates for Bilderberg but it does seem pretty likely that this is the spot:<br><br>The Trianon Palace Hotel - 1, Boulevard de la Reine, Versailles, Paris, France. May 15-18 2003. Kenneth Clarke, in a letter to a Scottish anti-Bilderberg campaigner, has confirmed the venue.<br><br>The Trianon Palace Hotel<a href="http://%20http://www.s-h-systems.co.uk/cgi-bin/www.s-h-systems.co.uk/brochure.pl?id=129705&amp;t=versailles&amp;s=&amp;c=FR" rel="nofollow"> http://www.s-h-systems.co.uk/cgi-bin/www.s-h-systems.co.uk/brochure.pl?id=129705&amp;t=versailles&amp;s=&amp;c=FR</a><br><br>American Free Press <a href="http://www.americanfreepress.net" rel="nofollow">http://www.americanfreepress.net</a> will be covering developments in the run-up and during the conference. The annual task remains to break Bilderberg's wall of secrecy at Versailles this May.<br><br>And see <a href="http://www.bilderberg.org/2003.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.bilderberg.org/2003.htm</a> for the latest Bilderberg gossip.<br><br>Where will the global crisis end? It seems likely a 'Christian'/'Jewish' vs. 'Moslem' conflict will emerge from this Middle East crisis which is ironic, since the political leaders of all sides, Bin Laden, Bush, Sharon, Saddam etc. appear to be secular, with little love for God, the poor, or for their fellow man. Misguided marionettes Bush and Blair certainly show contempt for the ten commandments which indicates their professed Christianity may be nothing more than a cover story.<br><br>Keep a close eye too on Zionist attempts to rebuild Solomon's temple in Jerusalem, to expand Israel's borders and to wipe out the Palestinian people. The Zionist eye is firmly on the main chance: feeding the fire of interreligious hatred amongst the worlds three monotheistic religions.<br><br>Oh, and if you are despairing, like I am, at what passes for film or television these days, remind yourself that it really did used to be much better. Watch a seventies conspiracy movie such as 'The Parallax View' or Robert Redford's 'Three Days of the Condor'.<br><br>Tony Gosling - 25Mar03<br><br></div>
