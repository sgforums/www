There is also a need to remember that the inflation rate of money per year is higher than that of the safety interest rate of the bank. This means that the money kept in the bank is constantly depreciating along with the purchasing power. With pay being stagnant for most worker and the price of goods increasing it can be concluded that the cost of living have risen considerably. However whether they have enough to spend depends largely on the person lifestyle.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>CNA forums i saw this:<br><br>"Well in my opinion NS enlistment age should be changed to <strong>23 or 24</strong> to allow young Singaporeans to pursue tertiary education locally or overseas &amp; for some who managed a trade cert.,a chance to gain some work experiences before enlistment.With the changes it means that MINDEF will have a group of better trained enlistees,hence SAF vocational training period should be reduced drastically and at age <strong>23 or 24</strong>,youngmen are more mature and have a better understanding of the real working environment,reducing the risk of serious accident.In fact,with this changes MINDEF may see more of the NSF signing on to a SAF career because they are placed in a vocation that's relevant to their course of study which are normally their interest as well.<br>So all we need is 3-months basic military training and 9 months vocational SAF unit attachment to utilise &amp; sharpen thier knowledge &amp; skill acquired from their study.<br><br>Last &amp; not the least,reservist liability should also be reduced to 36,even Taiwan &amp; S.Korea in much more riskier zones have their military liability up to around this age; <strong>a 12 years reservist liability is more than enough because at age 36</strong>,most are at the peak of their career and in a global economy,many are required to be posted overseas,under normal circumstances for long term overseas posting the exit permit is on going,ie approved every year,so it just like finishing his reservist liability at age 36,so why not make it accross the board to be fair to all NSF,otherwise it's those working locally serving a longer period of reservist than those posted overseas. "<br><br>the govt will not put the enlistment age to anything above 21 so that guys cant denounce citizenship and escape Ns...</div>
