His father died when he was only 3 years old. His own mother was even rejected by her own next of kin and prevented from attending her husband's funeral. Yet credit to her own fortitude for bringing up Confucius. I call that great motherhood. She died when Confucius was 23 yrs old.<br><br>Right now the civil service hasn't done anything except to give handouts to FTs, then tax and control the locals to death. Is that call bringing us to the future? They don't even want to accept responsibility for losing our own money, but very quick to take credit.</div>
