            <div class='col-md body'>well, juz had sth in my mind abt the law...i feel tat though the law is there to ensure order in the country, it has many flaws...below i cite a classic case which i believe do happen in real life n the victim is the one jailed instead...<br><br>a woman was walking home one day...as she passed by the park to her home, a man emerged from nowhere n pinned her down...the man then tried to strip her n molest her...the woman struggled hard and fought to protect herself...in the midst of the struggfle, the man was pushed hard backwards...unfortunately, he slipped n fell...he rolled down the slope, bumped his head against the railing n died...<br><br>the woman was tried in court...though she acted out of self-defence...the law states tat when u kill someone unintentionally, its considered manslaughter...hence a jail term awaits u...the woman was sent to jail...<br><br>my pt is tis...does the case above warrant a jail term for the woman? she acted in self-defence rite? tis rigid law is implying to us nt to act out in self-defence...cos in a struggle, u dunno wad wil happen...so how? shld women juz let the men molest/rape them without putting up a struggle? tis is juz one of the exceptional cases...there r others...wad r ur views? is the law fair for tis case?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>the law is mostly unfair here because they enforce the governments policies and their dictatorship rule... do you think its fair? being a threat to the govt and you get F KED till you rather die.... and all you did to be a threat is gain public support against them.... that is true dictatorship.  i believe if its self defence , that the lady should not even be arrested or charged. raises the question why defensive products such as pepper spray and tazers are not sold here , why ? cuz the govt thinks its an offensive weapon... I think they help the females more...</div>

Contrary to popular belief, fault in a marriage has very little to do with the award of alimony. The British court has recently ruled in two landmark cases which affirm this long-held principle. Faithfulness in a marriage is not an issue. However, to claim alimony the partner must be seen to have contributed to the marriage...non-financial contribution such as housework and bringing up children is considered sufficient for this purpose.<br><br>Men can claim alimony as well as wives...so the trick is to make sure you marry a richer spouse. If you separate, you stand to gain up to half the assets. That's why in the US, rich people resort to pre-nuptial agreements. Unfortunately, both in British and Singapore courts, pre-nuptial agreements are not binding and are not usually respected by the judge. For this reason, it is financially illogical to marry if you are much wealthier than your partner. Divorce is a very expensive gift to your partner.<br><br>That is one reason more and more couples choose to cohabit rather than get married in the UK.</div>
