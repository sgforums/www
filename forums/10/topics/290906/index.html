It was created to legitimise the regimeÂ’s rule. The 147th running dogs and prostitutes, of which you implied that you were part off, saw it as their duty to promote the new political running dogs of the PAP regime when LKY dogwhistled to the 147th that the WP Baru was not to be savaged but instead promoted.<br><br>He did this because he saw the future, a future that sees the inevitable; the opposition gaining  more Parliamentary seats as information sources available to the electorate, thanks to the Internet, exploded as never before. To manage the opposition, he needed a pseudo-opposition. The useless and worthless WP Baru riff-raffs fits the bill. They would fulfill the electorateÂ’s hunger for an opposition presence in Parliament without being any threat to the PAP regime. They would not only help legitimise the regimeÂ’s rule to the world but help defend the regime, as we have all seen, before the world when it came to the crunch.<br><br>Anyone who doubt this need only to ask themselves a simple question and be honest with the answer. If you were LKY or part of the PAP regime, who would you rather have in Parliament? Heavyweight intellectuals and fighters like CSJ and FS asking penetrating questions and people movers like JBJ and TLH challenging your power or political psycophants and worthless riff-raffs wearing the masks of opposition figures and praising you when it mattered?<br><br>They are clearly embarassed that there are people out there who hate them as much as they hate the PAP and who were prepared to do what they did.<br><br>They are now trying to milk something out of this embarassing episode, trying to market the idea that it was carried out by the regime instead of the ordinary men in the street who are disgusted by them. This would help them convince themselves and legitimise their proclamations that they are indeed an Â“oppositionÂ” party. Not only an opposition party but one so dangerous to the PAP hold on power that they claim the regime has to hire two young boys on the sly to distribute flyers against them.<br><br>George Yeo is in now in a precarious position. I am sure he knows that he will be made the sacrifical lamb in the larger interest of the regime as the regime do want their political running dogs, the useless and worthless WP Baru riff raffs, to succeed in capturing a GRC. This would fulfill the hunger of the electorate for a more visible Â“oppositionÂ” presence.  Look out for George Yeo standing down before the next election with some face saving reasons for the regime as he works to save his own face and rebel against the idea that he has been chosen to be the sacrificial lamb.<br><br>ScroobalÂ’s modus operandi is simple. He butters everyone (even me!) with the hope that he can be popular, he wonÂ’t be countered and that he can be the voice of Â“reasonÂ” and hence be able to influence opinions.<br><br>As they say, old habits die hard. The 147th running dogs and prostitutes like him used to have a monopoly on information and how they manage public opinion. With the Internet, they now know they face a loosing battle and have tried to worm into Internet forums such a this. They know WP Baru, which they have helped to promote on behalf of the regime, have had their wool ripped off and have been shown up to be the duds that they are.<br><br>As I have advised everyone many times in the past, be wary and beware of the WP Baru. Beware the PAP wolf draped in opposition clothing. Beware the PAP 147th running dogs and prostitutes in cyberspace trying to market the PAP wolf to you.<br><br></div>
