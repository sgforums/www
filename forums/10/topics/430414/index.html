              </h2>
              <div>
              <div><strong>This is to confirm that I have, on 13 May 2011, tendered my resignation from my position at Temasek Polytechnic, after more than twelve years of service.
              <p> </p>
              </strong></div>
              <div>The move is prompted by what I anticipate to be an increased workload after being elected as part of the Workers’ Party team for Aljunied GRC in General Elections 2011.
              <p> </p>
              </div>
              <div>My role at the Polytechnic included teaching full-time and part-time students, as well as co-ordinating continuing education initiatives for adult learners undertaken by the Polytechnic’s School of Business. To fulfill these responsibilities well would require sufficient time, focus and dedication.
              <p> </p>
              </div>
              <div>Already in the last 5 years as Non-Constituency Member of Parliament, working hours have been spent on Parliamentary activities such as sittings and the occasional overseas trip. While the Polytechnic management has supported these national platforms, I foresee that the years ahead as an elected Member will be even more demanding.
              <p> </p>
              </div>
              <div>After due consideration, I have concluded that it would not be fair to the Polytechnic management, colleagues and students for me to continue in my post at Temasek Polytechnic as an elected MP. I will henceforth explore other career options.
              <p> </p>
              </div>
              <div>This decision to leave Temasek Polytechnic was arrived at with decidedly mixed feelings, as I have enjoyed my work and colleagues there tremendously. I would like to record my sincere thanks to the Polytechnic management and colleagues for their kind understanding and friendship all these years.</div>

              <p>From MM's record I believe he doesn't feel remorse for anything. Not for the people he jailed, remarks he has made.</p>
              <p>I believe he was cajoled / pleaded with to go by party and family, due to the damage he has done. And nobody wants to side with a man in his very old age.</p>
              <p>Maybe PM Lee wants to move in the direction of a normal country before he dies, so that he can die as merely a distinguished MP. He doesn't want any statues, public holidays for mourning etc. Plus he is fed up of repairing the damage done by his mouth.</p>
              <p>He is not useful anymore. Nobody wants him to provide rash and
              unconsultative judgment in crises, or even speak internationally and
              offend other countries.</p>
