            <div class='col-md body'>Below is my interpretation of the public housing in singapore.<br><br>a) Stage 1 :HDB flats are public from brand new to resale ie people would buy with HDB loans and HDB reposession is very seldom even when the people default on payments.  After speaking to some lawyers, i understood that HDB repossessions occurred so far were only on the occupiers doing criminal things.<br><br>b)  Stage 2:  Resale market.  HDB flats at resale market is priced based on demand and supply, willing buyers and sellers.  At this point, buyers might choose to take commercial bank loans and let their HDB flats be mortgaged to commercial banks.  Based on posts above, it is possible for the private sector to seize HDB flats if there is a default on payments.<br><br>c)  Stage 3:  Old HDB flats are enbloced by HDB at market price and occupiers have a good discount to purchase new HDB flats directly from HDB.<br><br>The cycle goes round.<br><br>HDB flat prices are exposed to capitalism, both new and resale.<br><br>Question is :  How expensive is a 4 room HDB flat directly from HDB and resale today ?<br><br>Question is:  How many years would an average married Singaporean graduate couple take to fully pay up their 4 room HDB flat?  How many children can they raise?<br><br>Question is :  What type of quality is HDB flat?  As I know it, a new HDB flat is almost condo like quality nowadays.<br><br>Any comments?</div>

They are certainly not the people in the market looking for private property, doing what their parents could do. Do youths in Singapore have to worry about their bread and butter three meals a day concerns? ItÂ’s their parents who may be worried, not them.<br><br>Where did youth learn to use their brains, only in schools? their parents never taught them how to think? If you had passed your youth and you are blaming the schools you attended for not teaching you to think skillfully, I would fully agree that your schools did a lousy job.<br><br>Are our youths Â“marginalized and stepped on and nobody can say anythingÂ”, like Â“like Jayakumar threatening people like Silvia Lim even in parliamentÂ”? Silvia never thought she was threatened, it was just part and parcel of the daily game they play in politics. Youths should expect more of this in the real world, call it threat or challenge, depends on how matured you are and how you take them.<br><br>Yes, youths are idealistic and have dreams, by definition they are young, vigorous and lively, or immature and impetuous etc, they are in between childhood and maturity. Their future is an empty page, it is up to them to write or draw. They have to find their driving force and motivation, they have to plan what to do and what they dont (not everybody has everything), they have to realize how much risk they can take before they decide on one step at a time or taking a big leap. DonÂ’t expect anybody to guarantee a beautiful rosy picture. If the picture ended up a messy pc of S H I T, donÂ’t blame anybody either.<br><br>Youths in Singapore can pursue academic excellence, or you may want to stay at home and ask your parents to teach you how to think, your choice. They are exposed to multi racial multi religious and cosmopolitan society. They have access to news and info on most part of the world if they donÂ’t like or donÂ’t trust the local TV or newspapers. Here they have the opportunity to learn English and Mandarin, the two most spoken, used languages in the world. What they do with what they have is the question.<br><br>It is too early to say what they should do, who are you to say what they should achieve in life? Why should they be doing what their parents did, labored their whole life to buy a condo? WhatÂ’s wrong if they choose to stay with their parents? WhatÂ’s wrong if they are contented with HDB flats instead of a condo?<br><br>You can aim high to achieve high, but if you don't know how to appreciate what you already have, you have no respect for those who provide for you. No matter how much you achieve, if you don't know how to be contented with the things you have, you will never be happy.<br><br>You pity them? I pity you.<br></div>
