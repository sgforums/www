Whatever that is free, they have no control. <br><br>[/b]</blockquote>There is a big difference between need and want. There is also a difference between meeting the common needs of a community as a whole and satisfying the selfish desire of individuals. Dis-satisfaction is a driving force, what goes beyond do not necessary always lead to raising the quality of life.<br><br>What our youths have today, are mostly provided for by their parents.  It is only right that they show appreciation to those provided for them. They are entitled to be dissatisfied with the society, the schools.... and if such dissatisfaction drives them to improve for the benefits of the society as a whole, well and good. But if they grow up just want to "voice their opinion" and expect others to make the changes, huhhh....I'd tell them they are lucky to be born in Singapore, even if their brains may be dulled. if they were born in a small town in a remote region in China or India, they may think they can think skillfully but they would have a lot more to think than the youths in Singapore, they would still be dissatisfied with the society, the schools, blah blah blah but they won't make any difference to anybody. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Being contented does not necessarily means no motivation to progress in other areas. AndrewPKYap can be contented with an HDB flat, at least for the time being, and focus on earning to buy a car, if that is his priority. If he wants a big car, a big house, yearly holidays at the same time, and he is not born with a golden spoon then he better buy more toto and dream on.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>At the end of the day, some youths will wine and dine, some will whine and die.
