Singapore youths live in a culture of fear simply for thinking certain thoughts and expressing their views.<br><br>Dishonorable governments issue threats even to members of parliament.<br><br>After 40+ years of relentless price increases, youths need many more years to pay off their mortgage for something as basic as housing and yet they are constantly told that they have it good!

They are so fearful of them their brains do not work properly anymore. Like people with the "Stockholm syndrome"<br><br><strong>Stockholm syndrome is a psychological response sometimes seen in an abducted hostage, in which the hostage shows signs of loyalty to the hostage-taker, regardless of the danger (or at least risk) in which the hostage has been placed. Stockholm syndrome is also sometimes discussed in reference to other situations with similar tensions, such as battered person syndrome, rape cases, child abuse cases, and bride kidnapping. The syndrome is named after the Norrmalmstorg robbery of Kreditbanken at Norrmalmstorg, Stockholm, Sweden, in which the bank robbers held bank employees hostage from August 23 to August 28 in 1973. In this case, the victims became emotionally attached to their victimizers, and even defended their captors after they were freed from their six-day ordeal. The term Stockholm Syndrome was coined by the criminologist and psychiatrist Nils Bejerot, who assisted the police during the robbery, and referred to the syndrome in a news broadcast.</strong>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia<br><br>When fear grips people, their brain stops functioning properly. That is why any honorable 1st world government will tell their citizens to live boldly without fear even of terrorist for otherwise if you fear them, they have won.<br><br>Terrorist want people to fear them so that they can achieve their foul aims but I don't know the term that is applied to politicians that do that to achieve their hidden agendas (at least it used to be hidden, now they simply display their greed openly because the they have manged to instill the fear into the people's hearts).<br><br>Hey that is a very good idea for another article   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  but Pity the Youths for living in a culture of fear that robs them of their ability to think properly.</div>
