Surely it's because their doubts are still unresolved.<br><br>Why do you think his choice is without careful thought? I read his post and it clearly states that he has been to political rallies and heard both sides. Are you telling him that he should get a  written by the both sides of the camp and analyse it, coupled with every single report and comments from political analyst and <strong>to top it all</strong> consult a fortune-teller before casting his vote?<br><br>I think that's what you are trying to tell everyone here.</div>
