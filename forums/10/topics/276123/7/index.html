            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by sgdiehard:</div><div class="quote_body">I donÂ’t know what is your definition of Youth? They are certainly not the people in the market looking for private property, doing what their parents could do. Do youths in Singapore have to worry about their bread and butter three meals a day concerns? ItÂ’s their parents who may be worried, not them.<br><br>Where did youth learn to use their brains, only in schools? their parents never taught them how to think? If you had passed your youth and you are blaming the schools you attended for not teaching you to think skillfully, I would fully agree that your schools did a lousy job.<br><br>Are our youths Â“marginalized and stepped on and nobody can say anythingÂ”, like Â“like Jayakumar threatening people like Silvia Lim even in parliamentÂ”? Silvia never thought she was threatened, it was just part and parcel of the daily game they play in politics. Youths should expect more of this in the real world, call it threat or challenge, depends on how matured you are and how you take them.<br><br>Yes, youths are idealistic and have dreams, by definition they are young, vigorous and lively, or immature and impetuous etc, they are in between childhood and maturity. Their future is an empty page, it is up to them to write or draw. They have to find their driving force and motivation, they have to plan what to do and what they dont (not everybody has everything), they have to realize how much risk they can take before they decide on one step at a time or taking a big leap. DonÂ’t expect anybody to guarantee a beautiful rosy picture. If the picture ended up a messy pc of S H I T, donÂ’t blame anybody either.<br><br>Youths in Singapore can pursue academic excellence, or you may want to stay at home and ask your parents to teach you how to think, your choice. They are exposed to multi racial multi religious and cosmopolitan society. They have access to news and info on most part of the world if they donÂ’t like or donÂ’t trust the local TV or newspapers. Here they have the opportunity to learn English and Mandarin, the two most spoken, used languages in the world. What they do with what they have is the question.<br><br>It is too early to say what they should do, who are you to say what they should achieve in life? Why should they be doing what their parents did, labored their whole life to buy a condo? WhatÂ’s wrong if they choose to stay with their parents? WhatÂ’s wrong if they are contented with HDB flats instead of a condo?<br><br>You can aim high to achieve high, but if you don't know how to appreciate what you already have, you have no respect for those who provide for you. No matter how much you achieve, if you don't know how to be contented with the things you have, you will never be happy.<br><br>You pity them? I pity you.<br></div></blockquote>It is not just that they are not taught thinking skills but there is also a culture of fear and suppression of their opinions especially when it comes to criticisms of "authority". You seem to be such a product.<br><br>When I talk to the youths, they are like, "OMG aren't you afraid that "they" come after you?" "OMG you are trying to prevent people gambling at the casino when "they" are promoting their IRs?"<br><br>By their teachers', lecturers' omission to ever make mention anything critical of government policies, they would have been brainwashed from young that there are "dangerous" thoughts where one must not venture. How can youths that are afraid of "thinking dangerous thoughts" ever think properly? The culture encouraged by the dictators for their own narrow ends is to stop people from thinking by making it/promoting the fears that there are thoughts that can be "dangerous" to think.<br><br>That the youths faced increasing price pressures constantly would automatically curtail their ability to dream and their ability to fulfill their dreams because the policies are such that they must find money to survive and they must find money simply to survive basic needs like housing, transport and medical needs.<br><br>How can the youths dream when they find it hard even to meet their basic needs? The policies are shaped such that the youths will find it hard to meet their basic needs in Singapore. What a pity. A nation of youths that need to work like slaves just so that their basic needs are met and will never have a chance to realise their dreams and even more pitiful, dare not dream.</div>

That they do, the quality is, of course, moot point. This basic education is to help the masses to get on in life.<br>"But how to think", should that be the purview of the government? Should not that be the responsibility of the individual? The government can provide the opportunity for creative thinking, but eventually it is up to the individual to think, and ponder.<br>How did you manage to think?  Did the system miss you?<br><br>I asked how do we balance between pitiful Singapore youths and pitiful UK youth. My post was mostly misunderstood.<br>How do we balance between youths who, as you assert, can't think, and youths who, are creative, but can't write or do simple arithmetics?<br>One fifth of UK youths can't write, this means that these youths would be relegated to menial jobs. (for the upper crust?).  Not every one can be like Branson, the Virgin Airline guy.<br>Do we want such a situation here in Singapore? Can we have, say 10,000 youths every year who can't write or do simple sums, entering secondary schools?<br><br>The governments job is to provide the basic education. It is up to the individual to think.<br>The education system here produced many students that qualify for admission in foreign universities. Does our government's reach extend to these universities that they return still unable to think?<br>I don't think there is a concerted effort on the governments' part to supress thinking.<br>Frankly, those that can think, can. Those that can't, can't.</div>
