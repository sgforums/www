And for your knowledge, memory stays as a very important characteristics even with google around. The information of this world is overwhelming, our memory capacity is still far from enough and remains the fastest way of analysing and dishing out information especially at the important moments.<br><br>I've also always complained and hated the memory works in Singapore's educational system but after working for so many years, I realise and see the importance and criticality of the ability to remember and recall information.<br><br>Singaporeans are also no doubt thinkers and I definitely have no doubt that our youths will also be thinkers. I also see myself and my colleagues, some of whom are in their 20s, as better thinkers than most foreign talents and overseas colleagues in ASIA. For our closest competitor, Hong Kongers stands as another nation of hardworking ppl who thinks in their work and does not take things as it is, which was mostly the case for my SE Asian counterparts.<br><br>I am really curious as to what makes you feel that the youth today are not thinkers?<br></div>
