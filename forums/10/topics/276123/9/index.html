Was it sheer stupidity that the situation is now so bad for the youths?

The youths that are intelligent have to realise the treachery that is done on them and learn to think critically. They must not be cowed by fear or their thinking will be of lesser quality compared to if they think boldly.<br><br>I am sure you have heard of the saying work hard but also work smart. Working hard while THEY keep on taking your money is not very smart is it? They keep on taking your money and they keep on raising prices.<br><br>To ask the youths to never look at the other side of the equation and only concentrate of how hard they can work is not working smart is it? They must also look at the other side and that is, why are people taking away my hard earned money.<br><br>To tell the youths to concentrate on working hard and not care about how much money THEY keep taking; do not care how THEY keep making policies that force the youths to suffer just to cover their basic needs for housing, transportation and medical services; to tell the youths that, is like saying you should work harder and harder to earn money and not report the conman that keeps on taking your money, to the police.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Andreaw Yap, have you spoken to the Singaporean Malay and other Singaporean youths?<br><br>Before you go on talking away like an ignorant brat in a public forum, please stop and think whether you are writing based on your own assumptions of the situations for SG youth, and the foundations for these assumptions are heavily biased towards your own resentments against SG government.<br><br>at least quantify your claims with some published articles like what I did for "Pity the British youths".<br><br>Honestly, the future of SG youths are firmly and positively entrenched, and they have a choice to work and migrate outside of Singapore if they want, the country does not stop that.  If they want, they can stay.  But first, they must have a good education foundation to pursue this and everyone is given one fair chance to be educated in Singapore.<br><br>So study and educate yourself as all-rounded as possible.  There are places you can go to explore on this tiny island which is your home. For instance cable-ski at east coast park, sentosa, some mini forest, outward bound school, serve the dis-advantaged people etc.  Once equipped with education which you worked hard for, try your best to explore places outside Singapore.  You are free to go.  Balance your life properly with moral values in your heart.  Be a good person.<br><br>As I said, it is all up to yourself.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>try talking to Singaporean Malay youths about their feelings of being a Singaporean.  You will be hearing that most of them are PROUD to be Singaporean.  Dont forget, they are the minorities in Singapore.<br><br>Are you discussing Singapore's youths or are you discussing politics, Andrew Yap ?<br><br>There, you want to make use of the British youths to pay for your free NHS and retirement pensions.  Here, you want to make use of Singapore's youths to further your own agenda against SG government.<br><br>Do you know that by what you wrote, you might discourage youths in Singapore, extinguish fires?  Another SELFISH act of yours, all to further your agenda to dis-credit the government you hate.</div>

We Singapore youths are so dispassionate about the country's affairs because we're not idiots and we don't savour being treated as such.  We have our eyes, we have brains, we can see what's going on.  The internet helps provide an alternate voice, keeps things in perspective.  We don't need to be told what to think.
