They have a 1st world leadership there and the decisions of the politicians are transparent and well scrutinized and if the decisions are that bad, people can protest on the streets.<br><br>How can the politicians there make "bad" decisions when any decision is well debated, transparent and they are accountable for it? Not "sorry it was an honest mistake" and then pretend that nothing happened.<br><br>Even if over here we perceive it as "bad" decisions by their government, obviously the people that the decisions affect over there do not think so or they would be down on the streets to protest.<br><br>I think it is the Singapore youths that are marginalized and stepped on and nobody can say anything about it in the mainstream press or do much about it without having people like Jayakumar threatening people like Silvia Lim even in parliament.<br><br>Worse of all is that they have active supporters supporting such barbaric behavior.<br><br>So all in all, the Singapore youths are the ones with much to lose compared to their first world counterparts in the UK.<br><br></div>

Of course they have to study, problem lies with the education system and yeah everything is over priced.During the previous general elections,i think WP asked HDB to prove why a 5 room flat costs up to 300 or 400k when in fact when they checked with contractors was at most 80k.<br><br>Not many are worried about bread and butter. Parents=banks for many of them.If they were worried they wouldn't be spending aimlessly. Yes,there are some who work for it bust they are the minority.I am sure many of you have seen secondary school kids with a PSP,latest 3G cell phone and nike bag and shoes,erm you mean they work part time everyday? seems unlikely as not many parents would permit that and many of these students do well or average in terms of academics.Like someone mentioned child labor in other countries,compare that to SG and you get easy life.Singapore youths are smart but not intelligent.They may memerize an another entire book on science but they wont know anything to do with common sense.<br><br>So many top students in academics do not even know who the hell Vivian Balakrishnan is,do not know when the elections were held and so many other things.Why? Cos everything is taken for granted if you ask me. I speak all that cos i am a youth myself and it pains me to see the youths of Singapore of today</div>

This may put them at a disadvantage. They feel that the PAP government is able to help them out to get them out of a crisis when there is one.<br><br>This is due that they put their priority on their studies as this will determine on their future.<br>The way we study is meaningless where we will absorb like mad and store it in a cylinder, and pour it away once the exams are over.<br><br></div></blockquote>For those of you who think our youth have it good, have not really left this country and stayed/worked abroad for a bit.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I find it fascinating when people blame the youth for all manners of problems, when it is the system, and the parents who condition the kids in this manner and this is but the outcome of this... social experiment called Singapore.<br><br>So when the outcome wasn't how they wanted it to be, they cast aside their children, just as people of the past would cast aside disfigured children, or even females.<br><br>How quaint.</div>
