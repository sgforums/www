The engineer got married in 1974, wife a teacher, bought a corner terrace in serangoon garden, I believe he had been saving for that. I don't know how long they took to pay off the mortgage, this is very personal issue. But I do know by the time they retired they own a condo in upper bukit timah, raised 2 kids, all through local universities. The cars driven were all Ford in the early days, but later changed to Japanese.  Never travel on holiday except when overseas on business until after retirement. Talk to your older relatives and you will learn more.<br><br>You obviously are not PWNED by the MIW, but you sound a lot more pitiful than those kena PWNED.<br><br>Our youths have their future, some have more resources than others, some are more capable than the others, but they alone will write on the empty pages.

The engineer got married in 1974, wife a teacher, bought a corner terrace in serangoon garden, I believe he had been saving for that. I don't know how long they took to pay off the mortgage, this is very personal issue. But I do know by the time they retired they own a condo in upper bukit timah, raised 2 kids, all through local universities. The cars driven were all Ford in the early days, but later changed to Japanese.  Never travel on holiday except when overseas on business until after retirement. Talk to your older relatives and you will learn more.<br><br>You obviously are not PWNED by the MIW, but you sound a lot more pitiful than those kena PWNED.<br><br>Our youths have their future, some have more resources than others, some are more capable than the others, but they alone will write on the empty pages. They don't need anybody to pity them and before you pity them, look at what you wrote on the pages of your life, still blank, can't afford to buy house, ......still blaming the MIW, blaming the school, pathetic.......sigh.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> </div></blockquote>hahaha let me see the youths of today buy a "a corner terrace in serangoon garden" with an engineer's and teacher's pay.... and pay off the mortgage in 15 years and the fact that the youths of today cannot do that is not because they have been PAWNED by the MIW and deserve pity? hahahaha, that is your opinion and you are certainly entitled to it. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Of course you want to blame the youths, so what is new? Make policies that affect the lives of people negatively and then blame the people for the negative effects. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
