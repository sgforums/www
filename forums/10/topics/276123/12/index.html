Live as a free person. Free your mind."  This is your sub-consciousness talking to yourself.<br><br>andrew, lets draw an analogy to make you understand what you are.<br><br>A staunch Christian reads a lot of the bible and he becomes rather convinced that God is there and he starts to fear God.  Everyday, every night he prays.  So much so that he starts to think the rest of the world should also fear God and he starts to preach the word of God.<br><br>You are very much the same.  You allowed a dictator to enter your mind then you start to read a lot about it and you become very convinced that the dictator is real and you start to fear.  Everyday and night, you start to pray in front of a computer with links to internet web sites.  So much so that you start to think the rest of the world should also fear the dictator and you start to preach the word of "fear the dictator".<br><br>for you andrew,<br><br>Sky is white.<br>Trees are bare.<br>Been a while since you stood here.<br>You feel cold, so alone.<br>Yet the wind whispers 'hello' when it blows, when it blows.<br><br>Fallen angel with shattered dreams,<br>Trying to make some sense of all you've seen.<br>Let it go.

Most are armchair critics but these rare few individuals stoodup AGAINST all ODDS. Put ourselves in their shoes in the environment we are in, and we may appreciate their effort. They risk it all for us. How many have what it takes to do this? few and far between. most are waiting for someone to stand up for them. Me included.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>But for unknown reason, they LOST.<br><br>I think the turnout indicates a deep desire to have alternative voices that represents another group of the people.<br><br>The people may see that the system can be even better with a more substantial opposition.<br><br>A governement in a democracy is formed by ruling party and the Opposition.<br><br>This is undeniable truth that there is a real need for an effective Opposition.<br><br>Let the ruling and opposition parties debate in front of the people who then decides how the country can be better. How policies can be tweaked. If only 1 party decides everything for the People, what role does the people play in improving the country? This is where overwhelming control by 1 party is undesirable to me, from a Demoracy point of view. Ask yourselves. Is singapore based on Democracy or not? Does it want to be so? If so, lets make it vibrant, all encompassing and inclusive of all views.<br><br>non-violent activities to reach out to the people should be allowed in the name of democracy. This basic freedom should exist. And I see that only the Poeple can make or break this now. Since WP has been rejected already. Their only hope is if the people support them.<br><br>Large companies use tag team approach in that, a lead person presents his plans and solution. He will request for a 2nd opinion, and someone to challenge his plans and solutions so that they reach the best possible solution. Singapore INC. It should follow the same approach. Debate is positive and leads to the best possible solution. No leader should avoid debate by avoiding questions if he is indeed capable to handle the truth.<br><br>Anytime WP  need helping hand, I'll be there.<br><br></div>
