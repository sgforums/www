            <div class='col-md body'>In Singapore, the Malay minority is doing well and the Malays are proud to be Singaporeans.<br><br>SINGAPORE:<br><br>The Malay/Muslim community in Singapore is much better off today compared to 25 years ago, said Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong .<br>A comprehensive report detailing the Malay/Muslim community's progress over the last 25 years was given out on Sunday at the Mendaki's 25th anniversary celebrations.<br><br>More Malay students are pursuing post-secondary education and more in the community are also holding better-paying jobs.<br>Mr Lee gave an example - more than 80 per cent of Malay students now make it to post-secondary education such as ITEs and polytechnics.<br>From just 1.3 per cent 25 years ago, now 34 per cent of Malay students make it to tertiary institutions.<br><br>"Success in education has fed through and raised the socio-economic status of the Malay/Muslim community. There is a growing middle-class with increasing purchasing power. More Malay/Muslim households have upgraded to better housing too. The vast majority own their own homes Â– 93 per cent, that's about the same as the national average. Collectively, these indicators reflect a community enjoying higher living standards and better quality of life."<br>Although the community has shown progress, Mr Lee said it still has to tackle some pressing issues such as the problems of dysfunctional families.<br>Though such problems are not common, Mr Lee said they could affect the educational performance of the Malay/Muslim community.  Despite the high overall enrolment, he noted that some 300 Malay students still drop out from secondary schools every year.<br><br>So Mr Lee called on self-help group Mendaki to mobilise efforts for new programmes to tackle the challenges, to attract more young people to volunteer in programmes to help develop the community further.<br>"Beyond the statistics in the report, there is a new mood and self-confidence in the community. It is willing to seize opportunities and move ahead and just as ready to recognise the problems and tackle them openly and objectively, even when they are sensitive and difficult. That is why the community has made progress and is in a strong and confident position today."<br>Mr Lee added that because of globalisation, the Malay/Muslim community must understand they are not just competing against other Singaporeans, but people around the world as well.<br><br>He called on the community to seize the opportunities all over Asia, especially in the Middle East and China. He also insisted it is crucial to upgrade their skills and stay ahead. - CNA/ac<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>During this meaningful Yellow Ribbon Fair day, 2 september 07,  instead of doing something meaningful to his life and others lives, Andrew Yap was worshiping his computer spreading on the internet his fear of the dictator.  Worse, he called these ex-convicts "drunkards and gangsters".  What an unfeeling person.<br><br>SINGAPORE: Some ten thousand people put on their walking shoes and hit the street in support of former prison inmates Sunday morning.<br><br>The 3.5-kilometre walk at Pasir Ris Town Park was organised by the Yellow Ribbon Project to foster public support and acceptance of ex-offenders.<br><br>Former drug addict Simon Neo was in and out of prison before converting to Christianity.<br><br>"I thought drugs can help me forget all my problems and worries,Â” he said. But when he became hooked, drugs only brought him pain.<br><br>Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong wanted to change people's hearts and minds about ex-offenders who had taken a second chance to turn their lives around.<br><br>"If you have made a mistake, if you have offended, then there has to be punishment. But if you have taken the punishment and you are prepared to correct yourself and make good and come back onto the right path - if you make the effort, we should give you the second chance," said PM Lee.<br><br>There was also a fair at Prison Link Changi Centre that showcased how ex-offenders and ex-inmates are reintegrating into society.<br><br>A book of short stories and poems by inmates was launched as well. - CNA/ac</div>
