            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Forum,<br><br>I like to move a motion to condemn TWC2's proposal for additional benefits for Maids working in Singapore UNTIL and UNLESS the following are met:<br><br>1) Our Government removes all maids levies which is extremely high at $ 345 per month. This is dirty tactics and money making by our dear government. Some maids are only earning $ 230 per month. Where is the heart of our Government and the brains of TWC2?<br><br>2) Proper protection of employers against lazy, dishonest and stupid maids that cause problems in the households, moonlight, get themselves pregnant and steal from Singaporeans.<br><br>3) Make TWC2 responsible for their proposal and should there be any cost related to maid's abuse of benefits as submitted by TWC2. Members of this group shall pay for all cost of re-employing (in the case of force repatriation should maids moonlight &amp; pregnant during their day offs) and paying any hospital bills whether to abort babies or got themselves into accidents during their off days.....etc.<br><br>4) Proper training of maids and allow only experienced maids to work in Singapore. Government MUST remove levies!!!!<br><br>5) The implementation of minimum wage system (still lower than the levy and the maid gets to bring home and becomes more motivated) for maids after the removal of the government levies so that Singaporeans can retain good and experienced maids.<br><br>In this way Hong Kong and Taiwan would not take our good maids away due to cometitive reasons.<br><br>6) The removal of $ 5000 penalty levied by our government if maids are found to have moonlight, run away and pregnant.<br><br>With the above in placed can we then talk about better general terms for maids working in Singapore. All employers of maids ARE SICK and TIRED of having to retrain and endure these NEW and INEXPERIENCED maids. Until these inherent problems are resolved can TWC2 try to act as saints without considering the majority plight of Singaporean Employers.<br><br>It is ridiculous to blame employers who pay for the Maids' empolyability here and make a decent saving to bring home. It is not the fault of employers when maids faces problems here. It all started with having less to pay them- ITS A VICIOUS CYCLE!!!<br><br>If you look at all abuses of maids it all started with employers having poorly trained and inexperienced maids. WHY BLAME US THE EMPLOYERS WHEN OUR AGENTS COULD ONLY GET POOR QUALITY MAIDS!!!<br><br>TWC2 should stop its campaign  against the employers of maids BUT to focus on these issues and tackle it with our government. THEY are the real cause of all these maids issues and abuses because WE DON"T HAVE THE MONEY TO EMPLOY EXPERIENCED MAIDS DUE TO THE HIGH LEVIES COLLECTED BY PAP GOVERNMENT and all their ridiculous rulings.....!!!!!<br><br>ALL employers want to give the best to the maids but Maids must first give good service to their bosses.<br><br>SURE there are a few bad eggs BUT surely not use these examples which are less than 1% of all maids employed here in SIngapore to raise such an issue and proposal to inconvenient all employers of maids.<br><br>There is also no guarantee that maids will not be abused and treated fairly in implementing TWC2's proposal because the root of the problem (ie $$$$) is not resolved.<br><br>So whoever supports this motion- kindly reply and support and get the bloody government to pay attention to this issue!!!<br><br>Thank you<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Chill! Brother chill! I agree with some of your points of views but what can you do with the governments' ruling?<br><br>Flooding and spamming the whole speaker's corner doesn't helps you but people here will get annoy and ignore your points of views as though as you were barking like a mad dog.<br><br>Personally if you feel there is unfairness for employers here, just don't hire a maid and do the household yourself. I for one who don't feel like hiring a maid to do household for me.<br><br>(Mod, please close the "TWC2 go fly kite!" topics made by the same person)</div>
