              <p>Excuse me Mr. Malaysia , if u r trying to say that Singapore is
              a better place to live as compared to your birth country, I have no
              doubt it is true.</p>
              <p>Just like Viietnamese referring to USA as "heaven". We get
              it. </p>
              <p>But we r not third world citizens, neither r we really first
              world yet. </p>
              <p>I think people like u should just stop preaching to Singaporeans
              about how wonderful our country is as compared to your shit hole
              that u once called home.</p>
              <p>If  Singapore can have a better standard of life , people
              like u will also get to benefit from it.</p>
              <p>U think our government is so great, why don't u hire them to go
              run your country at one million a pop ? We'd be happy to farm em
              out, surely that will help raise GDP too.</p>
              <p>They look successful because of what Our people r willing to
              give. Strip away their hats n they r no different from u or
              me. </p>
              <p>Nowadays these people r too busy admiring themselves and tooting
              their own horns to be effectively serving the people. </p>
              <p>If u r happy with your current life relative to what u once had.
              Good for you, just keep quiet n enjoy it. oK? Good. </p>

              <p>I know you are very frustrated with life, with the government, but if

              <p>You're free to do so, in fact Sing Govt will be very happy if you do so os you are no longer productive.</p>
              <p>I hope all retirees choose this option. Maybe the economy will collapse.</p>
              <p>If you're interested, Malaysia has a MM2H / Malaysia My Second Home scheme. Just have to invest a small sum in Malaysian property or have some funds in your Malaysian / Singapore bank account, you get the right to long stay. It's for anyone, not just retirees. I think you also get a MyKad IC for faster immigration clearance.</p>

              <p>go talk to a Malaysia about Malaysia, I am sure they have a lot to talk to you about Bersih. The Malaysian government don't recognize me as Malaysian, and I don't call myself a Malaysian, you are barking up the wrong tree, mate.</p>
              <p>Is Singapore good or bad? I say it is good and bad, there are something good, there are something bad. What is good and what is bad is also relative and also depends on what you expect. You feel betrayed by the PAP, then next time don't expect too much from them.</p>
              <p>I am in the right position where I can exercise my right to vote, and I think that made a difference, and I hope the people in Hougang exercise their votes correctly. For those who didn't have the chance to vote or were outnumbered, you have to find other ways.</p>
              <p>The worse you can do is to run away to oz or nz and kpkb, it doesn't change a damn thing to those living in Singapore.</p>

              <p>no disagreement with that, but you can't expect your opposition to put what you want on a platter for you, and the ruling party always have the advantage. you need to fight to get it.  It can be done, the WP has done it in single constituency, and now in a GRC.
