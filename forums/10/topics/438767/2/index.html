              <p>Mainstream education is cheap and affordable, as compared to other countries. That is until you factor in the "optional" components, like enrichment classes, tuition etc</p>
              <p>You only need to pay $5 in actualu school fees, but the enrichment lessons, such as piano lessons, art lessons, martial arts lessons, swimming lessons can easily cost up to $200/month per course.</p>
              <p>When it comes to tertiary education, well, $7-8k/yr for 4 years means that uni education is quite costly, and graduates join the workforce with a crushing debt to repay, interest-free or not.</p>
              <p>All that is still tolerable. But something that I'm very unsatisfied with is that after graduation from school (at any level), we do not seem to be drawing first-world level pay? Comparing the wage level with other developed countries, it seems that we are still stuck somewhere between a developing country and a developed country.</p>
              <p>Yes, we make more money than our neighbours in the asean region, but still pales in comparison to the regional first world country in this part of the world. Namely, Japan and Australia.</p>
              <p>something is missing somewhere, with a discrepancy between our educational level and our pay scale.</p>

              <p>income supplement has a serious flaw. It discourages people from being productive.</p>
              <p>To give out income supplement, a wage cap will have to be imposed, with different tiers of people receiving different amount of wage supplements.</p>
              <p>In terms of generating employment, it works well, since people would first have to find a job before qualifiying for wage supplement.</p>
              <p>However, it also discourages people from working beyond that cap, or else they would risk not qualifying for the supplement, and thus limiting productivity.</p>
              <p>There are often news report of people who work long hours, or worked in multiple jobs, to improve their income. These are the people who ended up being penalised by their hardwork, where their increased income causes them to not qualify for income supplements. "Laziness" is rewarded while "productivity" is penalised.</p>
              <p>Would it be better if we just ensure that everyone makes more money by increasing the basic pay? The more they work, the larger their income.</p>

              <p>Obedient, no. We go by common sense, with a <strong>do, but don't get caught </strong>mentality.</p>
              <p>Naive. Yes. Very. Some people have been so utterly brainwashed, in school, in church, by their family(also brainwashed as well), that they believe that singapore is a perfect world.</p>
              <p>They are sheltered from many things, and really take things for granted, and perceive that whatever policies Singapore has are the right ones, and everyone else is wrong.</p>
              <p>E.g.</p>
              <p>The belief that paying politicians well will prevent corruption.</p>
              <p>The belief that its just a coincidence that Temasek's Ho Ching; present and former PM Lees; President Tony Tan; ex-ceo of Singtel, Lee Hsien Yang are either from the same family, or are related in one way or another.</p>
              <p>The belief that the government is not responsible for the gains and loss of GIC, where LKY serves as senior advisor, LHL serve as chairman, with a couple of ministers serving as directors.</p>

              <p>they don't aim to take over the government in the short term, that shows a total absence of personal agenda. They are credible.</p>
              <p>they speak of the same vision. They are united.</p>
              <p>theyÂ are clear in their vision and goals, they knows what they want for Singapore.</p>
              <p>theyÂ develop themselves, with more qualified people and younger people. They have foresight.</p>
              <p>some of their mp give up their jobs to serve fulltime....they don't take serving the people as a career that demands high salaries, that is what something the PAP can learn.</p>
              <p>Comparatively, Tan JS thought he can form an opposition alliance to take over the government in the next election. Just this alone, WP stands out as a credible opposition for the people of Singapore, as compared to the politicians riding on the dissatifaction of the people to achieve their own personal ambition.</p>

              <p>Singaporeans are more sophiscated than many of us thought. So can't use "majority" to describe what you see here.</p>
              <p>Naive? yes, many who think because the PAP is no good, so anybody anti PAP would be good.</p>
              <p>Obedient? no, Singaporean don't follow what the government says if they do not agree, and often they do not object to the government policies simply because there is no better alternative. This is life, and majority of Singaporeans know what is life!</p>
              <p>You must tell your Chinese friend that it is naive to believe 100% what he read on the internet, that is the problem with many Chinese now.</p>

              Thank you for your active participation.
              
              Conclusion
              
              Singaporeans are unhappy because of the following reasons:
              
              High cost of living,
              
              More competition from immigrants for jobs, scholarships etc,
              
              Our concerns are not being heard by the ruling party,
              
              Therefore we want an alternative voice to represent us in parliament.
              
              Wishing you good luck and good health. And lastly be happy.
              
              :)
