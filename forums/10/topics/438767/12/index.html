              Elitism.
              Favouring the 'better ones' and leaving the 'weaker ones' behind. The 'weaker ones' are given less opportunities to improve.
              Definition of elitism from wikipedia:
              Elitism in the context of education is the practice of concentrating attention on or allocating funding to the best students, or those students who rank highest in a particular field of endeavour. For example, a politician who promotes advanced classes for students deemed to be highly intelligent might be accused of elitism, even if this were argued to promote an egalitarian goal, such as curing disease. Elitism in education could be based on conventional assessment of learning ability, knowledge, or other abilities. However, an "elite" school can also mean a school which is wealthy, or hard to enter.

              <p>
              </p><p><br>By Toh Yong Chuan</p>
              <p>GOOD jobs and wages backed up by an array of targeted schemes to help lower-income households are part of the Government’s plan to tackle the wage gap, Minister of State for Manpower Tan Chuan-Jin said yesterday.</p>
              <p>  In the first Parliament sitting since Professor Lim Chong Yah’s radical proposal to push up wages at the bottom, Mr Tan laid out the multi-pronged approach to helping low-income families, saying wages are only part of the equation.</p>
              <p>  What the Government has put in place, he said is a “comprehensive and active strategy to help low-income families improve their overall quality of life and share in Singapore’s continued progress”.</p>
              <p>  The help includes subsidies for housing, education and health care, income top-ups through Workfare, funds for re-training, and support for companies that pledge to share their productivity gains with lower-wage workers.</p>
              <p>  The Government’s policies to grow the economy have also yielded dividends for lower-income households, Mr Tan made clear. The bottom fifth of Singaporean households enjoyed real income growth per member of 13.6 per cent over the last five years.</p>
              <p>  Last year, those in the bottom fifth saw the highest percentage growth in income per member, as compared to households in the upper quintiles. This is before Workfare and other subsidies.</p>
              <p>  The increase reflects not just the rise in wages but also the fact that more household members are employed in an economy that has created many new jobs. “It is also worth recognising that this significant growth in incomes in the last five years occurred despite the rise in the proportion of foreign workers in the workforce,” Mr Tan said.</p>
              <p>  The Minister of State was responding to questions from four Members of Parliament on wage growth.</p>
              <p>  At the same time, Mr Tan also acknowledged that incomes of some Singaporeans in specific low-wage jobs have not gone up.</p>
              <p>  Addressing Moulmein-Kallang GRC MP Denise Phua’s question on whether the Government would consider “shock therapy” for wages, Mr Tan said the Government believed in a balanced approach.</p>
              <p>  That means intervening to support businesses in restructuring, raise workers’ skills, and ensure lower-wage workers get a fair share of productivity gains. This is done through schemes such as the Workfare Training Support and the Inclusive Growth Programme, with its focus on sectors where wages have lagged, such as cleaning, food and beverage and retail.</p>
              <p>  Mr Tan also said that to force wages up suddenly, as recommended by Prof Lim, would be to put at risk small and medium enterprises, the major employers of lower-wage workers.</p>
              <p>  The Government is also tackling practices such as cheap sourcing, which has depressed wages of workers in the cleaning and security sectors. Details for an enhanced accreditation framework for cleaning companies that requires them to pay “appropriate wages” to cleaners will be ready soon, he added.</p>
              <p>  Workers’ Party Non-Constituency MP Yee Jenn Jong asked about the impact of the current high inflation on the Government’s target to raise real median wages by 30 per cent in the decade from 2010.Mr Tan said the Government does not expect the current high levels of inflation to persist in the years to come.</p>
              <p>  Earlier, Trade and Industry Minister Lim Hng Kiang reiterated that inflation, which was 5.2 per cent in March, is expected to ease gradually in the second half of this year.</p>
              <p>  The Government has allowed the Singapore dollar to appreciate to curb imported inflation and taken steps to cool the property market, and is now reviewing COE supply, as rents and COEs are two major contributors to current high inflation, Mr Lim said. He also stressed that while food prices have risen, they are no-where near the peak in 2008.</p>
              <p>  Responding to concerns about whether productivity improvements would lead to wage increases, Mr Tan said that has been the trend over the long term. Since 2000, productivity grew at 1.7 per cent a year and real wages grew by a comparable 1.6 per cent a year.</p>

              <p>  The increase reflects not just the rise in wages but also
              the fact that more household members are employed in an economy
              that has created many new jobs. “It is also worth recognising that
              this significant growth in incomes in the last five years occurred
              despite the rise in the proportion of foreign workers in the
              workforce,” Mr Tan said.</p>
              <p>  The Minister of State was responding to questions from
              four Members of Parliament on wage growth.</p>
              <p>  At the same time, Mr Tan also acknowledged that incomes
              of some Singaporeans in specific low-wage jobs have not gone
              up.</p>
              <p>  Addressing Moulmein-Kallang GRC MP Denise Phua’s question
              on whether the Government would consider “shock therapy” for wages,
              Mr Tan said the Government believed in a balanced approach.</p>
              <p>  That means intervening to support businesses in
              restructuring, raise workers’ skills, and ensure lower-wage workers
              get a fair share of productivity gains. This is done through
              schemes such as the Workfare Training Support and the Inclusive
              Growth Programme, with its focus on sectors where wages have
              lagged, such as cleaning, food and beverage and retail.</p>
              <p>  Mr Tan also said that to force wages up suddenly, as
              recommended by Prof Lim, would be to put at risk small and medium
              enterprises, the major employers of lower-wage workers.</p>
              <p>  The Government is also tackling practices such as cheap
              sourcing, which has depressed wages of workers in the cleaning and
              security sectors. Details for an enhanced accreditation framework
              for cleaning companies that requires them to pay “appropriate
              wages” to cleaners will be ready soon, he added.</p>
              <p>  Workers’ Party Non-Constituency MP Yee Jenn Jong asked
              about the impact of the current high inflation on the Government’s
              target to raise real median wages by 30 per cent in the decade from
              2010.Mr Tan said the Government does not expect the current high
              levels of inflation to persist in the years to come.</p>
              <p>  Earlier, Trade and Industry Minister Lim Hng Kiang
              reiterated that inflation, which was 5.2 per cent in March, is
              expected to ease gradually in the second half of this year.</p>
              <p>  The Government has allowed the Singapore dollar to
              appreciate to curb imported inflation and taken steps to cool the
              property market, and is now reviewing COE supply, as rents and COEs
              are two major contributors to current high inflation, Mr Lim said.
              He also stressed that while food prices have risen, they are
              no-where near the peak in 2008.</p>
              <p>  Responding to concerns about whether productivity
              improvements would lead to wage increases, Mr Tan said that has
              been the trend over the long term. Since 2000, productivity grew at
              1.7 per cent a year and real wages grew by a comparable 1.6 per
              cent a year.</p>

              <p>I voted for pap before.</p>
              <p>I am partly to be blamed for the policies pushed down our throats for giving them the super high mandate such that they have too much power for opposition to block any bill.</p>
              <p>I WILL vote against pap in the next election no matter what.</p>
              <p>Even if they try, I do not believe for a second that pap can undo the damage.</p>
              <p>Especially within the next 4 years.</p>
              <p>Reasons :</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1. CECAs and FTAs signed cannot be undone. they are contracts.</p>
              <p>They may say they want to reduce the infux. But can they? WILL THEY?</p>
              <p>Unless I Audit their claims, I will not believe what they claim.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. New Citizens cannot go away. They are permanently citizens of this land.</p>
              <p>3. PRs cannot go away because they have taken away many job opportunities such that for example, the IT departments all over the country are mainly and majoritily occupied by foreigners , many are PRs here for 10 or more years. They never become citizens. These jobs are permanently occupied and permanently, citizens are DENIED these jobs. Over time, like the last 15 years or so, singapore CONTINUES to rely on these foreigners.  See my point? Singapore has now permanently become addicted to PRs to survive. These lost job experiences are forever taken away from citizens and forever with the foreigners.</p>

              <p>I am switching to Opposition because of numerous bad performances that woken me up, FINALLY!!</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>There are 40% voters who voted Opposition. YET!  only 5 or 6 MPs from Opposition now sit in Parliament. And you think that is progress? PAP increased the total number of seats. The small increase in opposition voice there is neutralised by this increase. Opposition has no way to block pap bills.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Therefore, its not inline with the wishes of the 40%.</p>
              <p>With another FAILURE under pap's history books, I am sure they will not change fundamentally. This is something nothing will change my believe in.</p>
              <p>Yes, they will be telling us, they are changing from now on.</p>

              <p>By 2016, more fiascos could happen and they will have to work harder for the people.</p>
              <p>Well, world highest salary. No one would pitty them. Not even Obama.</p>
