              <p style="margin-top: 0in;"><strong><span style="color: #ff6600; font-size: medium;">A Double Portion of Tan’s
              Spirit</span></strong><span style="font-size: medium;"><br> Innovative education is of course nothing new at XMU. Our
              university has been pioneering all elements of modern education
              ever since it was founded in 1921 by the “Henry Ford of Asia,” Mr.
              Tan Kah Kee. This famous Overseas Chinese patriot gave an estimated
              USD 100 million to education, thanks his business acumen and frugal
              lifestyle. But Mr. Tan left us much more than mere
              money. <br> <br> As I teach in Organizational Behavior, organizations’ personalities
              often reflect those of their founders, and XMU is certainly no
              exception. XMU’s 85 years of success show it has inherited a double
              portion of Mr. Tan’s spirit and vision for a better China, a better
              Asia, and a better humanity.<img src="http://www.amoymagic.com/Tankahkee/tan_veryyoung.jpg" alt="" width="84" height="326"></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Our
              university’s founder, Mr. Tan Kah Kee (Chen Jiageng, 1874-1961),
              gave an estimated 100 million USD to education over his lifetime
              but he was born into a humble family of merchants in the village of
              Jimei, on the mainland across from Xiamen Island. Tan worked the
              fields and the fishnets until he started school at the age of nine,
              and in the fall of 1890 he moved to Singapore to help in his
              father’s rice shop. His father’s business went under in 1904, but
              the savvy son pulled together enough capital to buy 500 acres of
              forested land in Singapore and started a pineapple
              plantation.<br> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amoymagic.com/tankahkee.htm#top">Back to top</a><img src="http://www.amoymagic.com/Tankahkee/tansingfactory.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="197"><br> <strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">The Rubber
              Magnate</span><a id="rubbermagnate" rel="nofollow" name="rubbermagnate"></a></strong> Tan rapidly expanded into rice
              milling, manu-facturing, sawmills, real estate, and ocean
              transport, but it was rubber that really stretched his fortune. He
              set aside a few acres of his pineapple planta-tion and eventually
              had 10,000 acres of rubber trees. His expansion from rubber
              planting to rubber manufacturing helped create the rubber industry
              and made him one of the four great Rubber Barons. <br> <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">By the mid 1920s,
              the Rubber Magnate’s Singapore-based empire em-ployed over 30,000
              people, had 150 offices on 5 continents, and did business with 48
              countries. But prices plummeted after 1926 and rubber never quite
              bounced back.</span></strong> Even worse, after Mr. Tan protested
              Japan’s brutal “Jinan Massacre” (May 3rd, 1928), his factory was
              burned to the ground. Yet even as he struggled through the Great
              Depression he continued to finance Jimei School, Xiamen University,
              and Chinese and English schools in Singapore—a feat he managed in
              part because of his frugality.<img src="http://www.amoymagic.com/Tankahkee/tanfrugal2.jpg" alt="" width="209" height="300"></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">The
              Frugal Philanthropist</span><a id="frugal" rel="nofollow" name="frugal"></a> </strong>Rich philanthropists generally give but
              a fraction of their wealth while alive, but leave behind large
              foundations since the only thing they can take with them when they
              die is their reputation. But Mr. Tan quite literally gave like a
              prince while living like a pauper, subsisting on little more than
              rice porridge and potatoes, and using the same umbrella and
              battered suitcases for decades. Other rich Chinese of his day built
              luxurious villas on nearby Gulangyu Islet, but Mr. Tan contented
              himself with a sim-pler home in his native Jimei. As he wrote to a
              relative, his hometown still had great needs and “I cannot put
              myself before the community.”<br> <br> The Japanese destroyed Tan’s home in 1938, and when the Chinese
              government offered to rebuilt it after Liberation, Tan insisted
              that war-damaged school buildings be rebuilt first. His home was
              finally renovated in 1955 and he lived there from 1958 until 1960,
              when he moved to Beijing. Tan’s house was restored to its original
              design in 1980 and is now a museum and meeting place for the Jimei
              School Committee. I think the most moving exhibits are the battered
              suitcases, umbrellas and worn-out shoes that the “pauper
              millionaire” used for decades.<img src="http://www.amoymagic.com/Tankahkee/tan_sun.jpg" alt="Tan Kah-kee met Sun Yat-sen early in life and at one time accounted for 1/3 of the Kuomintang's revenues--which he probably regretted when Chiang Kaishek absconded to Taiwan with his money, and everyone else's" width="300" height="199"></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mr. Tan’s Vision for China Mr.
              Tan was a social and political reformer from youth. He supported
              Sun Yat-sen, and at one point accounted for about 1/3 of the
              Kuomintang’s finances (a feat he no doubt regretted when Chiang Kai
              Shek absconded to Taiwan with his money and everyone else’s). But
              Tan’s greatest hope for China was in modern education.<br> <br> <strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><img src="http://www.amoymagic.com/Tankahkee/tan_nehru.jpg" alt="Tan Kah kee was a social reformer, and helped Nehru in India" width="249" height="167"></span></span></strong>In 1894, at age 21, Tan began
              a family school in Jimei. In 1912, during the first year of the new
              Republic of China, Tan returned to China and on January 27, 1913
              opened the Jimei Primary School. Between 1920 and 1926 he opened a
              school a year until Jimei School Village had 11 schools, includ-ing
              a middle school and schools in agriculture, commerce, forestry,
              navigation, etc. In addition, Jimei School Village’s education
              promotion department donated to more than 70 middle schools and
              primary schools throughout Fujian province. <br> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amoymagic.com/tankahkee.htm#top">Back to top</a><img src="http://www.amoymagic.com/Tankahkee/tan_daonan_school.jpg" alt="Tan Kah Kee supported many schools in China and overseas, including English-language schools such as Raffles, and the Anglo-Chinese school of Singapore" width="300" height="198"><br> <strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">Supporting Education

              Singapore Chi-nese High School (1918), Nanyang Normal School (1941)
              and Nan Chaio Girls High School (1947). . His largesse was not
              limited to Chinese schools. He gave $30,000 to the Anglo-Chinese
              School in 1919 and in 1941 gave $10,000 to Raffles College, which
              later merged with the Medical College and eventually became the
              University of Singapore.</span></strong><br> <a id="appleofeye" rel="nofollow" name="appleofeye"></a><br> <strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">Xiamen University—Apple of
              Tan’s Eye</span></strong> In early November, 1920, Mr. Tan
              offered <img src="http://www.amoymagic.com/Tankahkee/tan_xmu1.jpg" alt="The first five buildings of Xiamen University; construction began in 1921" width="470" height="79">one million Yuan to start Xiamen University, which
              began with the Normal and Commerce Departments, and later expanded
              to five Colleges and 17 departments in Literature, Science, Law,
              Commerce and Education. Xiamen University captured the imagination
              of Chinese and foreigners alike. In the 1920s, Paul Hutchinson
              wrote,</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mr. Tan emphasized quality
              education. He sent students abroad, hired teachers from other
              areas, purchased the latest equipment, and emphasized sports. By
              the spring of 1937, his financial fortunes had so suffered that he
              allowed the government to take over Xiamen University, but he
              continued to subsidize it. Tan wrote to the minister of education
              that he had had “a fine start and a poor finish,” and would “live
              in perpetual regret.” [If only he could see XMU today!]<img src="http://www.amoymagic.com/Tankahkee/tan_changting1.jpg" alt="Tan Kah Kee visited Xiamen University while it was exiled in Changting, in West Fujian Province" width="300" height="211"><br> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amoymagic.com/tankahkee.htm#top">Back to top</a><br> <strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">XMU Retreats to

              University relocated to Changting in West Fujian to escape
              destruction by the Japanese, who had occupied Xiamen. [Read more in
              the next chapter, “Sa Bendong”]. The Japanese surrendered in
              August, 1945, and on October 21, 500 mass organizations in
              Singapore welcomed Tan’s return from a decade of exile in Java. A
              large meeting in Chongqing on November 18, 1945, celebrated Mr.
              Tan’s safety, and Chairman Mao inscribed a scroll about Tan which
              read, “Banner of Overseas Chinese, Glory of the Nation.”<img src="http://www.amoymagic.com/Tankahkee/tan_indonesia.jpg" alt="Tan Kah Kee's home while exiled in Indonesia" width="300" height="204"></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: medium;">XMU returned to Xiamen after
              Japan’s defeat and the new president and eminent biologist, Dr.
              Wang Deyao, immediately set out rebuilding and ex-panding the
              campus. Tan’s vision and money and Wang’s leadership paid off. XMU
              was designated a key national university in 1962 and has been
              mushrooming ever since. <br> <br> On October 1, 1949, Chairman Mao invited Mr. Tan to Tiananmen to
              participate in the ceremony of the founding of the People’s
              Republic of China. Tan settled down in his homeland in 1950 and
              devoted the rest of his life and fortune to its
              reconstruction. <br> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amoymagic.com/tankahkee.htm#top">Back to top</a><img src="http://www.amoymagic.com/Tankahkee/tan_zhouenlai.jpg" alt="Zhou Enlai visited the ailing Tan Kah Kee in Beijing" width="205" height="289"><br> <strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">Tan’s Final

              Chinese League, Member of the Standing Committee of the National
              People’s Congress, and Vice-Chairman of the CPPCC. He was also

              Pool, which has hosted numerous domestic and international aquatic

              Beijing, a special train transported his body to his hometown of
              Jimei. Tan left behind three million Yuan in banks, but the man who
              gave like a prince and lived like a pauper evidently expected his
              descendants to do the same—or make their own fortune. He left no
              money to his family, but gave half a million to Jimei School
              Foundation, half a million to construct Beijing’s Overseas Chinese
              Museum, and over two million Yuan for
              education.<br></span><span style="font-size: medium;"><img src="http://www.amoymagic.com/Tankahkee/tan_funeral2.jpg" alt="Tan Kah Kee died in 1961 in Beijing, and a State Funeral was given for him" width="299" height="232"><br> <strong>Tan’s International Legacy </strong>Altogether, Mr.
              Tan gave an estimated 100 million USD towards education, both in
              China and abroad, and the Tan Kah Kee Foundation has been awarding
              a Postgraduate Scholarship since 1983. In 1986, Nobel Prize
              Laureate Prof. C.N. Yang set up the Tan Kah Kee Inventors’ Award,
              and in 1992, Prof Yang and two other Nobel Prize Laureates, Prof
              Samuel C.C. Ting and Prof Li Yuan Tseh, together with Prof Changlin
              Tien, former Vice-chancellor of the University of California at
              Berkeley, and Prof Wang Gungwu, former President of Hong Kong
              University, set up the Tan Kah Kee International Society Foundation
              to the advancement of education and culture in the spirit of Tan
              Kah Kee.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: medium;"><img src="http://www.amoymagic.com/Tankahkee/tan_mao.jpg" alt="Chairman Mao wrote that Tan Kah Kee was a Great Banner of the Chinese Overseas and a hero of China" width="299" height="238">In 1991, Singapore’s president, Dr. Wee Kim Wee,
              launched the University Endowment Fund in honor of Mr. Tan, and set
              a goal of raising 1$ billion for education. On 11 March, 1990, the
              International Asteroid Center of China named Asteroid 2963 “Tan Kah
              Kee Star.” The naming ceremony was held at Xiamen University.<br> Lastly, the School of Chemistry in my home state’s University of
              California, Berkeley, has a “Tan Kah Kee Hall.” I hope more and
              more foreigners and Chinese alike will come to understand, and
              emulate, Tan Kah Kee’s spirit of sacrificial giving.</span><br> <br> <span style="font-size: medium;"><em>“A good traveler is one who
