              <p>Without us, he could never had come to power. He should not treat us like shit and go suck up to aliens.</p>
              <p>No political support from us dialects, no Harry Lee as PM.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: verdana, tahoma, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px;"> </span></p>
              <p style="color: #333333; margin-top: 0.7em; margin-bottom: 0.7em; line-height: 1.8em;">While the community can also be differentiated along other socio-cultural markers such as clan membership and dialect group, the distinction in language stream was especially salient as it engendered clear differences across various dimensions – the two sectors were distinguishable not only by access to opportunities in employment and higher education, but also by cultural outlook and political inclinations (Kwok 2001:495–6).</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; margin-top: 0.7em; margin-bottom: 0.7em; line-height: 1.8em;">Such differences were exemplified by the establishment of Nanyang University (abbreviated in Mandarin and referred to hereafter as Nantah) in 1955. Prior to its establishment, those who had completed Chinese high school education had to travel abroad to China or Taiwan to pursue tertiary education while their English-educated counterparts could enrol locally in the University of Malaya.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; margin-top: 0.7em; margin-bottom: 0.7em; line-height: 1.8em;">The call to establish a Chinese-language university drew financial support from “all classes in the Chinese community, from the richest magnates to the poorest drivers and prostitutes” (Hong &amp; Huang 2008:9), and culminated in the establishment of Nantah, the first Chinese-language university in Southeast Asia. Nantah thus represented not only a response to practical constraints confronting the Chinese-educated sector, but also a symbolic community project that demonstrated their solidarity (Kwok 2001:496).</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; margin-top: 0.7em; margin-bottom: 0.7em; line-height: 1.8em;">Besides the establishment of Nantah, the 1950s and the 1960s also saw increased political prominence among the Chinese-educated. There was, for example, a wave of student movements in those years, the most frequently remembered amongst them is the ‘May 13th Incident’ of 1954 when Chinese-educated middle-school students protested against the colonial government for implementing mandatory military conscription. Such social movements were not simply isolated reactions to specific events, but were fuelled by “a wider sense of exclusion for the Chinese-educated with a colonial society in which fluency in English was the route to employment and advancement” (Harper 2001:15).</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0.7em; margin-bottom: 0.7em; line-height: 1.8em;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">It was from such movements that ‘Intellectual-Politicians’ such as Lim Chin Siong emerged.</span></span></strong><span style="color: #333333;"> Lim attended Chinese-medium schools, but he never completed middle-school education. In 1951, he was expelled from his school for participating in examination boycotts. His subsequent employment as a trade union official continued to develop his oratorical and organisational skills, and eventually led him into the leadership of the left wing faction of the People’s Action Party (PAP). </span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0.7em; margin-bottom: 0.7em; line-height: 1.8em;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">It was Lim and his allies from the left wing faction who drew support for the PAP from the Chinese-educated electorate</span></span></strong><span style="color: #333333;"> (Harper 2001:13–25).</span></p>

              prison and another 9 years under restrictive orders in Sentosa.
              Upon his release in 1998, he publicly called for the abolition of

              <p>Got Harry Lee, no Harry Lee, the dialects in Singapore would still prosper.</p>
              <p>In fact we would be stronger. Our schools won' be destroyed, our languages won't be suppressed.</p>
              <p>But no dialect chinese support, there won't be a Harry Lee Kuan Yew as prime minister of Singapore.</p>
              <p>You talk about political leadership, Harry Lee also couldn't lead the masses. It was Lim Chin Siong and others who mobilised the masses.</p>
              <p>You talk about fight, Harry Lee also didn't fight. It was dalforce and others who fought.</p>
              <p>You talk about business, industry, Harry Lee also worked for a british law firm, he was not in business.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">The largest Chinese dialect group in the late nineteenth century were the<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Hokkien, who were traditionally involved in trade, shipping, banking, and industry. </span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">The next largest group, the <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Teochiu, engaged in agricultural production and processing, including gambier, pepper, and rubber production, rice and lumber milling, pineapple canning, and fish processing.</span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Cantonese served as artisans and laborers and a few made their fortunes in tin. </span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">The two smallest groups, the Hakka and Hainanese, were mostly servants, sailors, or unskilled laborers. Because wealth was the key to leadership and social standing within the Chinese community at that time, the<span style="color: #ff0000;"> </span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Hokkien dominated organizations</span> such as the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and supplied most of the Chinese members of the Legislative Council and the Chinese Advisory Board. </span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">The latter, established in 1889 to provide a formal link between the British government of the colony and the Chinese community, served as a place to air grievances but had no power.</span></p>
              <p><a href="http://countrystudies.us/singapore/6.htm">http://countrystudies.us/singapore/6.htm</a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">In a pattern common to Chinese urban society in China and in Southeast Asia, groups defined by common place of origin or dialect also tended to specialize in certain trades or monopolies. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">Exactly which regional group dominated which trade varied from place to place and represented historical accidents and contingencies, but the principle of a regional group also acting as an occupational group was common. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">As late as the 1980s, the <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Singapore Hokkien were dominant in banking, insurance, shipping, hardware, real estate, and other lucrative fields. </span></span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">Within the Hokkien community, smaller subgroups controlled particular trades. For example, 96 percent of the merchants dealing in China tea in the 1980s traced their ancestry to Anxi County in southern Fujian. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">Teochiu dominated the fresh produce trade and the jewelry and antiques business; Cantonese predominated in furniture making, watch and clock repair, and operating drug stores and restaurants; and the Hakka were pawnbrokers, tailors, and dealers in Chinese herbs and medicines. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">The Henghua people from northern Fujian, a small component of the Chinese population, controlled the very important bicycle, motorcycle, and taxi businesses. Over the years the speech groups competed for the control of trades, and the pattern of dialect- specific occupations was a dynamic one, with, for example, strong competition for shares of the textile trade. In the 1980s, four textile trade associations represented Teochiu, Hokkien, Hakka, and Cantonese traders. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">The competition between speech groups reinforced both their internal solidarity and the social boundaries between them. Regional associations were, to a certain extent, also trade associations. For the large proportion of the Chinese population employed in regional commerce, service trades, or small-scale manufacturing, there remained a close relation between ethnicity and occupation, each aspect reinforcing the other.</span></p>

              <p>the country wouldn't be where it is without the PAP....me thinx this is something we should be grateful for. We're doing alot 'better' than many countries.</p>
              <p>however, perhaps they need to revise the continuation of the way things are done in this day and age and acknowledge the current and emerging issues...otherwise the trend of the last GE may become an increasing factor.</p>
              <p>the other thing is that it's easy to want change and all...but fact is...is there anyone else out there that will be able to do a better job? I'm not saying one way or the other, but change for the sake of change is not always good.</p>
