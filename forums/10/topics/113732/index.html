Just look at the big picture which ministerrs or civil servants will be creative given so many benefits by being not creative.<br><br>(1) Pay is so good - who wants to bear responsibility for mistakes.<br><br>(2) Annual budget surplus is ultimate aim - results are not measured for spinning of monies to keep the economic wheeling going, wealth creation, number of jobs created or costs of living lowered.<br><br>(3) Performance is affected by number of mistakes not successes. Ministers are setting the pace in demolition or debunking of ideas or arguments irrespective of creativity and OB markers remain planted in the political golf courses.<br><br>(4) Value creation, investment potential, job creation or social cohesion are not the goals but surpluses.<br><br>(5) Incentives to foreigners and foreign investments are normal and helping of citizens may give rise to queries by anti-corruption agencies.<br><br>These are new governance and social values that need to be created in the system if there are to be creativity and entrepreneurship. Where are the leaders to lead in such total creative management.</div>
