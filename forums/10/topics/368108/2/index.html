              <p><strong>Singapore says economy jumps 20 percent in second quarter, raises 2009 growth forecast   </strong></p>
              <p><em>By Alex Kennedy, Associated Press Writer</em></p>
              <p><em>On Monday July 13, 2009, 11:45 pm EDT</em></p>
              <p>SINGAPORE (AP) -- Singapore's economy grew for the first time in a year, soaring 20 percent in the second quarter, a sign Asia is emerging from the global slump.</p>
              <p>&lt;!--- Insert the sidebar information --&gt;</p>
              <p>&lt;!-- Article Related Media --&gt;</p>
              <p>Gross domestic product jumped an annualized, seasonally adjusted 20.4 percent in the three months through June from the previous quarter, the Trade and Industry Ministry said Tuesday in a statement. It said GDP fell 3.7 percent from year earlier after a 9.6 percent drop in the first quarter.</p>
              <p>The ministry now expects the Southeast Asian city-state's economy to shrink between 4 percent and 6 percent this year, better than its previous forecast of a contraction between 6 percent and 9 percent.</p>
              <p>"The Singapore economy is back and back with a vengeance," said Robert Prior-Wandesforde, senior Asia economist for HSBC in Singapore. "We very much doubt that today's Singapore GDP release will be the last in Asia to provide a sizable upside surprise."</p>
              <p>The island's economy -- which relies on exports, finance and tourism -- had contracted the previous four quarters as it reeled from a collapse in global trade triggered by the financial crisis. An annualized 16.4 percent drop in the October-December period was the nadir of its deepest recession since splitting from Malaysia in 1965.</p>
              <p>Singapore is the first major Asia economy to report second quarter GDP results. The second quarter GDP estimate was calculated using data largely from April and May and is subject to revision.</p>
              <p>The ministry revised its first quarter economic figures to an annualized contraction of 12.7 percent from its initial estimate in April of a 19.7 percent contraction.</p>
              <p>A surge in pharmaceutical production helped boost growth in the second quarter. Manufacturing fell 1.5 percent from a year ago compared to a 24 percent contraction in the first quarter. Construction rose 18 percent in the second quarter while services dropped 5.1 percent.</p>
              <p>The ministry warned that the rebound in manufacturing could wane over the rest of the year.</p>
              <p>"A sizable part of Singapore's manufacturing uptick came from a spike in biomedical manufacturing output and electronics inventory restocking, both of which may not be sustained," the ministry said.</p>
              <p>Demand for exports from the U.S., Europe and Japan remains weak, but Singapore's sales to Indonesia, Malaysia and China have picked up, said Irvin Seah, an economist with DBS bank in Singapore.</p>
              <p>"The main driver for this recovery has been our exports to the region," Seah said. "We're seeing strong demand from Asia, especially China."</p>
              <p>"Asia is showing signs that it is able to drive its own demand, which is a good sign for the region's growth."</p>

              <p>Note that as one read deeper into the text, the author has made several careful retracing of the enthusiasm first screamed out.</p>

              <p>Still a note of caution was again made to dampen the loud enthusiasm that caused the loud hoopla.</p>

              <p>While Singapore's sales to the region have picked up, these cannot possibly replace the larger markets of US, Europe and Japan that have a combined market that is far bigger then what the region has been able to help sustain Singapore stellar growth over the years.</p>
              <p>This alone would have given a reality shake-up that would have made the hoopla a total irresponsible announcement that delude less informed Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>We will need to ask - if this is the best that can be produced by the sum total of all the super talents in the PAP leadership that are paid individually paid their million dollar annual wages ?</p>
              <p>For all the boast made about the Super Talents in the ranks of the Super PAP elites, they remain as impotent as ordinary Singaporeans, who are advised to wait for the USA to pull themselves out and become the engine of growth for the world.</p>
              <p>Obama has given his administration a time frame of 2 years for the US economy to get back on track.</p>
              <p>Can the super talent in the PAP perform miracles, when the USA cannot turn around the USA in less time, and when Singapore's main trading partner are the USA, Europe and Japan - all three being mutually dependent on each other's economic viability and stuck in the present financial meltdown ?</p>

              <p>Sigh.....People, it's all about confidence. The entire global market is driven by confidence.</p>
              <p>Planet Earth's resources are still abundant. Crops are rotting on the ground because no one wants them. Food produced are thrown away overnight because people are not buying them.</p>
              <p>It's not that there's no money around. Trillions and zillions of dollars are no longer circulated in economies, because everyone had lost confidence, and hoarded their money. Money printed DON'T disappear into thin air!</p>
              <p>The rich are swimming in it in their personal vaults, frightened and dare not invest. The poor are starve and hungry of it, because it did not get to their hands in earnings thru jobs.</p>
              <p>In any case, our economy surge is largely based on  pharmaceuticals, which is only reasonable due to the H1N1 scare, as more turn to bio-med products to protect themselves, fortunately which we Singapore had invested large sum in its production here, which in turn accounted for the rise in our economic earnings.</p>
              <p>A large proportion of funds had been circulated in asia, for most asian govts had learnt alot from the recession of 97 financial crisis, amassed huge warchest of US dollars to circulate among the population, which accounted for asia's spending.</p>
              <p>This is good news, real news based on fact and not on politics. We the people need something to cheer, and to push ourselves further to bring home food on the table.</p>
              <p> Why pooh pah good news and spread despondency and ill feeling, when we need more such true motivation to face the uphill climb to reach our former heights, not just for ourselves, but our families, relatives and friends?</p>
              <p>Sigh.....</p>

              <p>GDP again? GDP doesn't means the citizen will 100% benefit from it. If we are to compare GDP, then we are only 4xxx lower than Japan's GDP per capita in 2008. So, our economy is almost as good as theirs? However, Tokyo's GDP alone is 4x of ours. So, is GDP that reliable?</p>
              <p>Malaysia GDP in 2008 per capital is only 14xxx, so are their poorer than us? Yet again, if we use KL GDP, ermmm, i can't find KL GDP, anyway, it should be that much different from us.</p>
              <p>GDP don't determine the citizen's standard of living, it will never will. We can have our GDP double the next year but we are still getting the same paid and no bonus.</p>

              <p>GDP again? GDP doesn't means the citizen will 100% benefit from it. If we are to compare GDP, then we are only 4xxx lower than Japan's GDP per capita in 2008. So, our economy is almost as good as theirs? However, Tokyo's GDP alone is 4x of ours. So, is GDP that reliable?</p>
              <p>Malaysia GDP in 2008 per capital is only 14xxx, so are their poorer than us? Yet again, if we use KL GDP, ermmm, i can't find KL GDP, anyway, it should be that much different from us.</p>
              <p>GDP don't determine the citizen's standard of living, it will never will. We can have our GDP double the next year but we are still getting the same paid and no bonus.</p>
