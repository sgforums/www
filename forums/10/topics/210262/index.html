At todays age, Singapoeans and broader, Asians can hold their own against the ang mos.<br><br>bcos of this event, police, doctors, almost everyone involved must be activated, have their leave cancelled, ppl working in Suntec is forced to take leave (for some), if not, they hve to bear with traffic diversion, closed off areas, etc.  Its crazy, you are in Singapore, you are Singaporean, yet you are not allowed to use the bridge to go to a public place bcos some foreigners are here ??<br><br>If its for security reason, then for goodness sake, dun hold it at the Suntec Convention centre, hold it at Changi Exhibition Centre where Asian Aerospace is held, its far off, you can build a big cage to isolate the delegates if you want and you won't inconvenience the public or the inconvenience caused is minimal.  Or even better, hold it at Pulau Sudong or Pawai, for sure no soul will be inconvenienced.<br><br>There is no inconvenience to the delegates because they are personally driven.  mind you the poor public that are affected are not compensated.  Seek our understanding ?  How can I understand ?  I don't.  Reading the reports in the media, I know the crowds that is supposed to spend MICE money did not materialise, the shops are empty, sales staff are smiling to the air, the food courst are empty, the limo taxi are at the airport, waiting for no body...and Suntec basically becomes a forbidden city, a ghost town.<br><br>And I don't see how hosting the event can boost Singapore to the world map.  Already, ppl knows Singapore exist.  And hosting the event is not going to make someone who, previously dun noe Singapore is not part of China, suddenly wake up and realise his mistake.  what I mean to say, those who need to know Singapore already know Singapore.  What can we prove by hosting such a event ?  That we can host a major International event ? Or just want to show-off ?  sure, hold events but not at the expense of inconvenicing the locals pls.  </div></blockquote>you couldnt have been more right!!!<br><br>do our govt really think they will be impressed.  they might smile on the outside but deep inside they are probably laughing at us - our stupidity.  i dont understand the necessity to impress them at the expense of so many singaporeans.<br><br>imagine people around the world catching suntec on tv.  a ghost town because of one event.<br><br>we made a laughing stock out of ourselves.<br><br>again, who is the overall-in-charge?<br><br></div>

And I bet at the end of it, other than the main issues to be settled by IMF, all that they are going to remember is that we banned some activist and that SG is a police state.<br><br>All the effort all these while...down the longkang</div>

You know it was like briefly announced and quickly some other news came on...<br><br>heheheheee.. so typical....<br><br>so many years of high-handedness they have accumulated a lot of Humble Pies to eat....<br><br></div>
