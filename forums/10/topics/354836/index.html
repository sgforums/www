              Recession-hit Singapore splurges on extravagant cultural show for rich Arabs
              
              http://www.albawaba.com/en/countries/UAE/243188
              
              A cultural event organized by the Singapore International Foundation (SIF), Singapore Encore is a showcase of Singaporeâ€™s finest arts, culture and cuisine around the world. This year, SIF has partnered the Singapore Consulate-General in Dubai to present Singapore Encore in the United Arab Emirates.
              
              Held at the Atlantis, the majestic focal point of Palm Jumeirah, Singapore Encore kicked off the evening with an exhibition by the Photo-Art Association of Singapore. Singapore jazz diva Claressa Monteiro and singing sensation Kareema Ramli provided the entertainment for the evening. A dinner reception prepared by Chef Mohammad Ali Kunhi, Chef de Cuisine of Saffron Restaurant at the Atlantis, served up delicious Singaporean cuisine like laksa, satay and Hainanese chicken rice. The event was compered by Mr. Moe Alkaff, a well-known Singaporean entertainer-host.
              
              Singaporeâ€™s Acting Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts, Rear Admiral (NS) Lui Tuck Yew, was the special guest at this yearâ€™s Singapore Encore. Over 300 top government officials and distinguished guests from the diplomatic, business, social and cultural strata of the Emirati and Gulf society attended the event.
              
              Singaporeâ€™s Consul-General to Dubai, Mr Dileep Nair, said, â€œI am indeed happy that Singapore Encore has come to the Middle East and made its debut in Dubai. As a hub city of the region, Dubai is ideally suited to showcase Singaporeâ€™s unique cuisine and artistic talent. Awareness of Singapore as a destination of choice for business and leisure has been rapidly growing in this part of the world. Singapore Encore will certainly enhance Singaporeâ€™s profile amongst our friends in the region and be a milestone event in cultural diplomacy between Singapore and the Middle East.â€�
              
              
              SIF Governor Michael Gray elaborates, â€œSingapore Encore is a wonderful platform for us to showcase Singaporeâ€™s exciting developments in the field of arts and culture, which complements our exponential economic growth. Although Singapore is a small and young nation, its cultural and ethnic diversity has helped to fuel a flourishing local arts landscape. SIF is privileged to be able to play a role in sharing Singaporeâ€™s rich cultural talents with the rest of the world. We were happy to partner the Singapore Consulate-General in Dubai in bringing Singapore Encore to the Middle East this year. I hope that our Middle Eastern friends found much pleasure as they became acquainted with the delights of Singaporean arts, culture and cuisine.â€�
              
              Since its inception in 2004, Singapore Encore has travelled to cities such as Los Angeles, San Francisco, Vienna, New York, Washington, Tokyo and Manila. Past performers include Jacintha Abisheganaden, Nuradee Brothers, Jeremy Monteiro, Alemay Fernandez and the Huqin Quartet.
