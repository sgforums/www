But that argument simply doesn't accord due credit to FT for helping Singapore develop into what it is today. We have always had FT. Maybe there are more of them these days and hence they may be more visible. But they are vital for any open capitalist society like Singapore.<br><br>Let's face it. One way or other, there are many jobs that are far better done by FT. I am sure there are some jobs occupied by FT that could be done by locals. That is an unfortunate by-product of govt policies. But by and large, Singapore as a whole benefits from the presence of all these FT.</blockquote>Whether a policy is good or bad is not the simplistic generation as often made out to be.<br><br>Often while a policy may seem good but when carried to excess without control it will become bad. The key criterion to any policy often is in the implementation.<br><br>For example it is a good policy to avoid welfarism as that will make people over-dependent on the state resulting in laziness and deterioration of the work ethics and causing loss of economic competitiveness.<br><br>However by going to the opposite of taxing and recovering all possible costs of government services, it will drive up costs of living and bankrupt the citizens' saving and retirements and eventually the state may still have to look after the hapless retirees and aged population unable to lead a normal life.<br><br>Today we are suffering from the reverse of welfarism with the citizens being heavily taxed with direct and indirect taxes of all kinds by the state.<br><br>Our domestic sector of the economy is unable to grow because of extremely high costs of essential government services ranging from housing to transportation and utility.<br><br>Meritocracy is good but we are now practising meritocracy narrowly to the extreme which only benefit a few elites and this has becomes bad.<br><br>Foreign talents may be good but again we have a government which does not understand the full implication of over-liberalizing employment of foreigners like tripartism when carried to the extreme will lead to large-scale abuse and destablise society causing discontented and disllusioned citizens and eventually unrest.</div>

One must not expect to other giving them food. They must learn to fight for it.</div></blockquote>You sure a not? It's one thing to earn your keep, and another to not get back what you have put in as hard work.<br><br>With the rising costs of living, workers being constantly told to accept lower wages, having the rules constantly changed that often renders years of experience and work for naught, is the common man really getting the fair share of the food he fought for?<br><br>There are many ways to manage globalization, I am not convinced the way we are currently doing it is actually the best for the common Singaporean... I have a distinct feeling we are tanking the damage for someone else.<br><br><blockquote><strong>Yes indeed. Give me a party that do better than PAP and I'll gladly vote for it. Political restrictions made by PAP government?<br><br>The only restrictions they made GRCs and SMCs, which I think is a half f**k system. Which they say GRCs can have a common source of resources to building up the constituencies, might as well make every GRC. </strong></blockquote>Define better. In the last elections the opposition parties made an effort to field credible candidates.<br><br>And what makes anyone think that they will do any worse if they run the country? Last I checked, where has all the talk about the incompetence of the opposition's suggestions really come from? Their natual opponents, the Ruling Party of course.<br><br>To truly see if they are capable, one needs to take their points in and weight the pros and cons of it- and a lot of them make perfect sense.<br><br>And political restrictions? I think we just need to look at how other democratic countries conduct their elections to see the vast difference in our own system. Right here from the start any person wanting to present an alternative government, no matter how valid his ideas were would face staggering odds.<br><br>And look at our newspaper, rated 154th in the world. Is is a source of good information? I'm not too convinced.<br><br>Our economic "prosperity" has come at a great price- basically we have made a faustian deal to trade our freedom for prosperity. We have choosen to be politically ignorant, and to blindly trust in wherever the bandwagon is going for better or worse, on the faulty assumption that the way things are now are currently the best that they can be.<br><br>The question is this: can another political party provide the same economic prosperity at less cost to the Singaporean soul?<br><br>Also all these trends are disturbing, as Sun Tzu pointed if the general is corrupt (lacks morals), eventually this attitude will filter down to his soldiers and he will be unable to lead them because the ideological center uniting the men would have been lost and the men would not fight with or they are, or might even defect.<br><br>I am not saying our current government is corrupt, but what I am pointing out is that in their bid to prove their point they have done many things that a true democracy would cringe at: declaring ideas like "freedom" and "democracy" non bread and butter issues, constantly showing to the people that the sole idealogy is survival of the self... all this in all filters down to the Singaporean, and not surprisingly the common man becomes pragmatic: nationhood is no longer a value and some simply leave.<br><br>This is not that Singaporeans are not proud of their nation, but one needs to realize our allegiance is to the flag and state of Singapore, and not whoever's in power who is suppose to serve it. Hence not all dissent is invalid or uncalled for.<br><br>Just look at many of the arguments in here: are they all the work of people who oppose for the sake of opposing or do they see something wrong with Singaporean soceity that needs to be fixed?<br><br>Have our traditional "official" channels for getting "feedback" to the ruling party been effective? I'm not too sure about that.</div>
