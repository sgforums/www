            <div class='col-md body'>Talking about that Ah Goat, he became the new shepherd when the sheep got astray being too frightened of the old fox. So old fox got too tired and had to hand the sheep to Ah Goat who began shepherding quite well with his own "kinder pad" and "topping up" or "sharing of prosperity" stuff. The sheep were following Ah Goat the new shepherd regarding him perhaps like their new savior but Ah Goat laid back after getting his own millions perhaps lost his own intellect and forgotten his own ward. So the sheep ran down the valley and got a bit astray. Lau Goat must have got his own arm twisted so he started to go foxy himself forgetting how to tend to the sheep and challenged Catherine to stay inside the OB. His true color came out like another foxy so lost his sheep. After he lost the sheep he was probably told not to waste time with playing kinder tricks and handed everything nicely back to the dynasty after that.<br><br>I thought he was like hero so I even sent him a congratulatory message thanking him for walking down the valley with the sheep as he said he did in that last national day rally. He actually had a chance to break away from the foxy way but sad he lost his intellect after getting the candy.</div>

Do we know of any NKF over Shin Corpse.<br><br>Consultants are consultants and mentoring someone is to tell someone what is good to do but if it is not good the mentor could walk away.<br><br>Mentor or consultant is one step remote from advice or result. But over in the little red dot people say never mind it is good to have a compromise so that we will not lose good experience.<br><br>It is not just allowing a family dinner to become a national meeting - but ministers are losing the clout as someone has put it or losing their ministerial accountability to the nation because among them there are seniors or mentors or consultants who are also ministerial but one-step remote from performance.<br><br>Voting of CEO's salaries by CEOs or putting in motion to approve one's own salaries in any Company Act is a conflict with directors guilty of an offence.<br><br>How about ministers' writing their own pay checks or leeching a life pension on people's hard-earned monies is that a conflict. But here only in the little red dot do citizens seen such ministerial exercise of power to increase their own salaries as a conflict.<br><br>It looks like they will believe that it is good to keep talent and let them write or say they have the mandate. What mandate - the old emperor issuing a batch to some one to kill execute anyone with it first and report to him later,<br><br>So the cabinet is full of such compromises and little red dot means anything can for heaven or goodness sake,<br><br>With what is executive ministerial and whatnot so entangled with entwined do we now have an effective and people-serving cabinet to begin with.<br><br>Not one vote is cast or needed to be cast on increasing one's own pay or writing one's own different pay check.<br><br>What we got is a blurred cabinet with rose-tinted vision we people have allowed things like these to happen without saying anything.<br><br>So who is at fault if tomorrow they wrangle some more law and say they owned all your monies or they will govern with their own rule of law.<br><br>Even chief justice will have a big headache as he probably will have a hard time to answer this question whether mentoring is ministerial or paying own salaries like this is a conflict.</div>
