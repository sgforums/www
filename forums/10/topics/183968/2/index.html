            <div class='col-md body'>Upgrades...when will they change this tactic. Actually, quite a number of singaporeans now will support PAP because, basically they have perfom well and nothing major happened. But have they consider this, if inside the parliment has only 4 seats of oppositions, when they have things to debate, wouldn't that be a 4 against 80 votes.<br><br>There are some debates which need more rational votings, imagine, a house with 95% same group of pple normally will support one an other which already decides the votes. There are some debates which requires a more balance votes. Singapore will need more pple in the house to cast their comments and thinkings. To some, maybe they agree to the outcome, but to some it may differ.<br><br>Since I live in HG, pap has kept on using upgrades as one of the main topics but if you look closely at the few previous elections, always before voting, the government gives out so-called "freebies", but after voting, they win the house, will start to see hikes or change of rules.<br><br>For the so-call upgrades, the goverment should not just decide on their own to approve or disapprove, they should take the response of the citizens into considerations too. If the response is high, they juz need to look deeper into it for considerations. Not juz because they themselves decide. And I believe pple living in those estates which requires upgrading would be quite interested in it. Just that they are worried how much of the cost would be bound by the citizens.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkred;">In the <a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/200168/1/.html" rel="nofollow"><strong>Channelnewsasia report</strong></a>, SM GCT remarks were printed as follows:</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">If Mr Sitoh is elected into Parliament in the upcoming General Election, Mr Goh says he will offer himself as a resource person to push the ideas in Cabinet.<br><br>But he stressed that Mr Sitoh will be the main person in the fight for Potong Pasir.<br><br>Mr Goh also elaborated on what he means by raising the whip in Parliament so that Mr Sitoh and Mr Eric Low can raise opposing views.<br><br>Mr Goh says: "Actually I was trying to find a way out to a question where somebody said that there are people who wanted an opposition. They also want upgrading, so in my mind I thought well we can have the best of both worlds - we can have upgrading and if they elect Sitoh Yih Pin and Eric Low, we can lift the whip for them. That means we can also have an opposition voice in Parliament.<br><br>"Let's make it clear, I mean they are PAP MPs so it is not quite the same as an opposition MP. But what I hope Eric Low and Sitoh Yih Pin would do regardless of whether the whip is lifted or not is to speak their minds frankly. Whatever views they have, even though they disagree with the government or with the party, they must voice them in Parliament - that's important. So it's my advice to Sitoh Yih Pin just now.<br><br>"I say, 'Look, in order to establish yourself later on as an MP, you must not come across as a 'yes' man. Come across as Sitoh Yih Pin, who has got a view, who has got a voice; <strong><span style="color: blue;">be prepared to raise difficult issues to the government so the whip is actually immaterial</span></strong>.' It's whether he is prepared to speak on policies when he has a different view <strong><span style="color: blue;">and whether the government will support it</span>.</strong>" - CNA/de </span><br><br><span style="color: darkred;">Unfortunately, SM GCT did not mention the all important part, that is -<br><br>will the PAP MPs regaining the Opposition Wards be allowed to vote according to their conscience, and if they can vote against their Party's Policies ?<br><br>Is it of any use to lift the Party's Whip for these PAP MPs to speak their mind and not be <strong>YES-Men</strong>, but at the end of the debate - all PAP MPs have to submit to the Party's Politics and end up as <strong>YES-MEN</strong>, as all have been for the last <strong>FORTY YEARS</strong> in the Singapore Parliament.</span><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think besides being paid the highest wages, Singapore is also the only country with 3 prime ministers in the garment, Harry Lee and Son and The Holy Goh.<br><br>When the Holy GOH was PM, he shut the gate to many students who wanted to study medicine. Degrees from some overseas medical schools were not recognised.  Now The flood gate is opened wide to let doctors with overseas qualifications to come work in Singapore.<br><br>NOL once hired a Dane to help turn the company profitable. The Dane brought his friends to take the high posts. The local staff joked that NOL means No Orientals Left.  Holy Goh then said that if he did not allow foreign talents in, NOL would mean No One Left.<br><br>After a few years, the Dane's contract was terminated early because he could not make NOL profitable. He left with some $4m in severence pay.<br><br>The ruling party can find candidates who can talk the talk. Can they walk the walk?<br><br>Dear voters, pls vote wisely in the coming GE.<strong></strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Singaporeans should learn to read behind the lines and see through the puff of smoke created.<br><br><span style="color: red;"><strong><span class="large">Unfair to discredit Chiam's good work </span></strong></span><br><br><span style="color: darkblue;"><br>March 28, 2006<br>The Straits Times<br><br>I READ the article, 'The gathering storm' (ST, March 25), with interest.<br><br>Besides the challenge from Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong who is 'storming into Potong Pasir and Hougang to win them back for the People's Action Party', opposition MPs probably face another obstacle: dismissive press reports.<br><br>Even though the article tried to highlight some of the good that Mr Chiam See Tong has done for Potong Pasir, it did more to cast a disparaging shade on the work done by him.<br><br>For example, because of its tranquillity and rustic charm, Potong Pasir was referred to as a 'dead town' that even the dead forsake, after they were 'exhumed from their century-old home'. For all that Mr Chiam has done in the past 22 years, Potong Pasir was described as a 'laid back' ward and the writer found it 'logic-defying' that the residents refused to be enticed by the PAP carrots.<br><br>Despite 97 per cent of the residents polled expressing that they were 'happy living in the ward', the writer expressed his reservations and summed up the work done in Potong Pasir as stop-gap measures: 'life in Potong Pasir during non-election season is hardly the stuff of fireworks'.<br><br>The use of rhetoric was most sarcastic: 'Sports facilities? Not even a park to jog in, unless you count Bidadari Cemetery's pavements' as fitting.<br><br>The fate of Potong Pasir was then decisively sealed: 'Mr Chiam is so old' and 'Toa Payoh Lorong 8 looks the worse for wear and suffers the curse of being compared' to a newer-looking ward across the road. And there is also the younger MP of the ruling party who is wielding the 'PAP's lightning bolt' and the keys to unlock funds to deliver upgrading.<br><br>I am not sure why most of the upgrading works in the 'PAP-held Lorong 6' were completed recently or what impact an article like this, with its uncanny timeliness and telling diction, has on the election outcome, but I think it is rather unfair, and even misleading, to dismiss Mr Chiam's hard labour in his ward.<br><br>I would like to point out the following with regard to the article:<br><br>Bus service No. 142 is not the sole service in the ward; others include service nos. 8, 13, 26, 31 and 151.<br><br>The Lorong 8 market was upgraded within the last five to six years and the playgrounds had also been upgraded.<br><br>No parks, but sporting facilities such as basketball courts had been constructed.<br><br>Residents can give feedback and suggestions for improvements to their MP via an online channel named 'Your Voice' in the Potong Pasir Town Council website, besides the Meet-the-People sessions.<br><br>Community events, including festive celebrations, have been organised, albeit without the sea life-unfriendly $1 shark's-fin soup.<br><br>Some towns, especially those in the western parts of Singapore, look equally, if not more, 'sleepy'. On the other hand, Potong Pasir contains an old-world charm, away from the maddening crowds.<br><br>In Melbourne, my friends and I sometimes travelled two hours to get to malls and cinemas from the suburbs. The 'plight' of Potong Pasir residents is nowhere compared to this.<br><br>In conclusion, one should note the absence of a level playing field for Mr Chiam as the Ministry of National Development channels Community Improvement Projects Committee funds for town improvements only to grassroots advisers who are all PAP leaders. Opposition MPs also do not have access to the community development council funds for community assistance.<br><br>I think it is ironic that the Potong Pasir residents pay taxes but are excluded from the good these funds bring. Supporting an opposition MP is no excuse for this.<br><br>The revolver might be old but the shots can still hit the right spots. Perhaps Potong Pasir residents should stick to their guns.<br><br>Lena Soh Kwee Kim (Ms) </span><br><br><a href="http://www.asiaone.com/st/st_20060328_381034.html" rel="nofollow">Asia1.com</a><br><br>One thing cropped up, why are opposition wards denied access to national development funds even though they won their elections fair and square?<br><br>Isn't that a crooked scheme bent on funnelling more financial power to <span style="color: red;"><strong>losing candidates</strong></span> of the the lightning party? How is that considered legitimate?<br><br>This should be brought up in parliament if it has not been raised already.</div>
