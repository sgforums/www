Degrees from some overseas medical schools were not recognised.  Now The flood gate is opened wide to let doctors with overseas qualifications to come work in Singapore.<br><br>NOL once hired a Dane to help turn the company profitable. The Dane brought his friends to take the high posts. The local staff joked that NOL means No Orientals Left.  Holy Goh then said that if he did not allow foreign talents in, NOL would mean No One Left.<br><br>After a few years, the Dane's contract was terminated early because he could not make NOL profitable. He left with some $4m in severence pay.<br><br>The ruling party can find candidates who can talk the talk. Can they walk the walk?<br><br>Dear voters, pls vote wisely in the coming GE.[b]</strong>[/b]</blockquote>Not concerned with the economy and business issues.. Just very angry at why the Singapore coffers belonging to fellow singaporeans are being denied just becos they voted the opposition.<br><br>Isn't upgrading a national interest? Maybe Hougang residents and PP residents are not singaporeans.. so they are denied the upgrading benefits.<br><br>So lame .

For all that Mr Chiam has done in the past 22 years, Potong Pasir was described as a 'laid back' ward and the writer found it 'logic-defying' that the residents refused to be enticed by the PAP carrots.<br><br>Despite 97 per cent of the residents polled expressing that they were 'happy living in the ward', the writer expressed his reservations and summed up the work done in Potong Pasir as stop-gap measures: 'life in Potong Pasir during non-election season is hardly the stuff of fireworks'.<br><br>The use of rhetoric was most sarcastic: 'Sports facilities? Not even a park to jog in, unless you count Bidadari Cemetery's pavements' as fitting.<br><br>The fate of Potong Pasir was then decisively sealed: 'Mr Chiam is so old' and 'Toa Payoh Lorong 8 looks the worse for wear and suffers the curse of being compared' to a newer-looking ward across the road. And there is also the younger MP of the ruling party who is wielding the 'PAP's lightning bolt' and the keys to unlock funds to deliver upgrading.<br><br>I am not sure why most of the upgrading works in the 'PAP-held Lorong 6' were completed recently or what impact an article like this, with its uncanny timeliness and telling diction, has on the election outcome, but I think it is rather unfair, and even misleading, to dismiss Mr Chiam's hard labour in his ward.<br><br>I would like to point out the following with regard to the article:<br><br>Bus service No. 142 is not the sole service in the ward; others include service nos. 8, 13, 26, 31 and 151.<br><br>The Lorong 8 market was upgraded within the last five to six years and the playgrounds had also been upgraded.<br><br>No parks, but sporting facilities such as basketball courts had been constructed.<br><br>Residents can give feedback and suggestions for improvements to their MP via an online channel named 'Your Voice' in the Potong Pasir Town Council website, besides the Meet-the-People sessions.<br><br>Community events, including festive celebrations, have been organised, albeit without the sea life-unfriendly $1 shark's-fin soup.<br><br>Some towns, especially those in the western parts of Singapore, look equally, if not more, 'sleepy'. On the other hand, Potong Pasir contains an old-world charm, away from the maddening crowds.<br><br>In Melbourne, my friends and I sometimes travelled two hours to get to malls and cinemas from the suburbs. The 'plight' of Potong Pasir residents is nowhere compared to this.<br><br>In conclusion, one should note the absence of a level playing field for Mr Chiam as</span> <span style="color: red;">the Ministry of National Development channels Community Improvement Projects Committee funds for town improvements only to grassroots advisers who are all PAP leaders. Opposition MPs also do not have access to the community development council funds for community assistance.</span><br><br><span style="color: darkblue;">I think it is ironic that the Potong Pasir residents pay taxes but are excluded from the good these funds bring. Supporting an opposition MP is no excuse for this.<br><br>The revolver might be old but the shots can still hit the right spots. Perhaps Potong Pasir residents should stick to their guns.<br><br>Lena Soh Kwee Kim (Ms) </span><br><br><a href="http://www.asiaone.com/st/st_20060328_381034.html" rel="nofollow">Asia1.com</a><br><br>One thing cropped up, why are opposition wards denied access to national development funds even though they won their elections fair and square?<br><br>Isn't that a crooked scheme bent on funnelling more financial power to <span style="color: red;">losing candidates</span> of the the lightning party? How is that considered legitimate?<br><br>This should be brought up in parliament if it has not been raised already. </div></blockquote>This abuse is only possible when the POWER OF ONE dominate all spheres of powers - that were supposed to be separated into the Executive, Legislature and the Judiciary.<br><br>While the Ruling Political Party can freely muscle the HDB to provide space at the HDB void decks to open PAP runned and managed Kindergartens, PAP managed Community Projects, and Office Space for the " Meet-the-People-Sessions " - the same has been refused to the successfully elected Opposition Members of Parliament when they apply for the same from the HDB.<br><br>These discriminatory policies forced onto the HDB to act negatively towards the Opposition Members of Parliament has been UNASHAMEDLY practiced since Chiam See Tong first came into Parliament.<br><br>Do we need to be surprised to the already well known farce of the Ruling Party about Singaporeans being in a Democratic First World Country, where everyone is treated EQUALLY without any discrimination due to Ethnicity, Relgion, or Language ?<br><br>Unfortunately, the one important word seem to have been INTENTIONALLY left out, and that is POLITICS.<br><br>The Ruling Party has surprisingly displayed a very THIN SKIN towards the slightest remarks of corruption and abuse of power, but remains unfazed with a THICKEST SET OF SKIN - grown over FORTY YEARS of Monopolistic Power - against any criticism towards all kinds of accusations of its execution of discriminatory policies towards the OPPOSITION, and blatantly executed in contempt towards the Singapore Electorate.<br><br>Consider the following report :-<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from"><a href="http://www.blogger.com/email-post.g?blogID=5448721&amp;postID=107857826399206107" rel="nofollow"><strong>The attitude of Singapore's rulers to the election and political process</strong></a> is perhaps best summed up by Lee Kuan Yew himself who stated:<br></div><div class="quote_body">"If I were in authority in Singapore indefinitely without having to ask those who are governed whether they like what is being done,<br><br>then I have not the slightest doubt that I could govern much more effectively in their own interests."</div></blockquote>Can any one Opposition challenge the POWER OF ONE from WITHIN THE SYSTEM ?<br><br>Is it any wonder that CSJ has to resort to publicising the abuses of the POWER OF ONE on the International Stage, while at the same time drawing attention to himself being abused by the System ?<br><br></div>

That was the reason why SDP could wrest 4 seats out of nothing. The residents were simply fed up of INACTION by the ruling party and with SMCs came more election opportunities.<br><br>I have always maintained that SMCs, not GRCs, are a better gauge to determine the mandate of the people. It is also the chance to judge a candidate's character and assess his qualities. In the case of GRCs, we have numerous nameless neophytes hiding behind heavyweight ministers to such an extent that the people think of it more as a minister's ward rather than a GRC and the campaign is made along that line. Media footage also focuses on THE MINISTER rather than THE TEAM to subtly relay the message that the team is the MINISTER and the MINISTER is the team.<br><br>Electorial boundaries should never be changed in the first place. What kind of govt gerrymanders in such unscrupulous politiking that they would carve out hot zones and annex them to favourable PAP-aligned wards? Such an act can be deemed <strong>cowardly politics </strong>since the likes of the now-defunct Cheng San GRC could very well have been in opposition hands by now.<br><br>In addition, the likes of Nee Soon could also have been under opposition control. Narrow wins forced subsequent Nee Soon South to be absorbed into AMK GRC, with Nee Soon North joining Sembawang.<br><br>If that isn't enough, why isn't ANY REASON STATED for re-drawing of electorial boundaries in the first place? How can anyone claim that the electorial boundaries committee is an IMPARTIAL BODY with no affiliation with the Ruling Party?<br><br>And the upgrading carrot is without doubt <strong>ONE </strong>of the <span style="color: red;"><strong>KEY CARROTS </strong></span>that attract residents to vote them. Without it, they aren't any better off (materialistically) compared to opposition wards. Low Thia Khiang has done an excellent job cleaning up Hougang even without national development funds that are otherwise available (unconstitutionally) to the losing candidate Eric Low of the Ruling Party. Can you imagine what he and Chiam could possibly achieve with such funds made available to them? Is it any wonder why the Ruling party continues to refuse the opposition wards access to these fundings?<br><br>You must be living in a fantasy world to think our ministers <strong><span style="color: indigo;">GAVE UP MILLION DOLLAR JOBS</span></strong> to run the govt?!?!? Utter rot.<br><br>I seriously doubt they will be earning this kind of salary in the competitive and merciless private sector.<br><br></div>
