            <div class='col-md body'>I did feel bitter if I 'kena' a sommon and need to pay a fine for it!However, if you look at the whole situation objectively, you mindset may change a little bit!Singaporeans are one of a kind that you see them everywhere. Just imagine if the local authority allows evey motorist to park along Orchard Road for free, you may see the same vehicle parks at the same spot for the whole day and you may even see the traffic there grinding to a standstill because of the chaos of fighting for a free parking lot! I would bet for my life that most Singaporean would  prefer to park at a free carpark if even there are bigger paid car park nearby!Sometimes it is puzzling to see those funny behaviours of car owner who prefer to pay a fine of $30 than to tear a coupon of $1! Many Singaporeans can afford to own car or cars but many cannot afford to pay car park charges!Is'nt that interesting?<br><br>To look at the many above complaints, what if you are the Cisco Officer on duty? I am not siding any of them, I share the same sentiment like many of you here. I too wish that the cisco officer could be more understanding and considerate, but if there were too many 'genuine cases', if you were in his position, how were you going to cope?Will the carpark or that particular location in chaos?Were you be sacked the next working day for your kindness and sympathetic behaviour, at the end who would sympathise you for being too kind to the over demanding motorists or 'incompetent' in you job performance?????</div>
