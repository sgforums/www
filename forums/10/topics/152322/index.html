            <div class='col-md body'>Like to share an incident that happened to me very recently. In fact so recent that I've yet received my mailed in summon!<br><br>I was at Guthrie House at Sixth Avenue to pick up a Jap client of mine. The carpark was full and the security guard didn't allow any cars to go in. The problem is that I told that Jap guy to wait in the basement due to his big luggage. Didn't want a big client to drag such a big luggage everywhere. I tried stopping at the driveway but there was another guard there telling me to move off.<br><br>I had no choice, that jap guy did not have a cell phone here, but to park on the single zig zag line. I switched on my hazard lights and ran to the lift lobby to catch the life to the basement carpark to help my client bring his luggage up.<br><br>KNS, just when I came out of the building, I saw a cisco guard about to enter my car licence into his handheld. I shouted at him that I am coming, but he ignored and continue to do his stuff. Guess what, I went up to him and started to explain why I had to park there, he didn't even looked at me, just continue punching in. KNNBCCB, what kinda of attitude is that!?<br><br>My Jap client was as bewildered as me. He asked me whether this behaviour of traffic wardens is common. There was another RX300 in front of me, that poor lady was actually helping her old mom push the Cold Storage trolley out to the car, she too was explaining to the other traffic warden, and got the same expressionless response.<br><br>All in all, the time taken by me from coming out of my car and coming back was barely 5 mins!!

            <div class='col-md body'>If this is your first time, there should not be a problem.<br><br>Just put in an appeal and explain the situation. I think you'll find the authorities quite flexible in such a situation. However, if you repeat the same excuse, forget abt your chances.<br><br>Just keep in mind that technically, the CISCO warden has done nothing wrong and has every right to book you, seeing as it IS a yellow zig-zag. Should you experience the same situation in US, arguing with the warden will result in a heavier penalty.</div>

With 'covert' methods to film and summon errant drivers, it seems the virtue to prevent accidents has now warped into a business-style attempt in a money-spinning venture. One wonders if this is truly an ethical means of prevention.<br><br>Firstly, is the main cause of accidents on the road speeding? Can the traffic police justify this? Not just with statistical figures but with in-depth case studies on specific cases?<br><br>Have they considered the design of the roads at accident-prone hotspots or are they merely too eager to shift the blame to drivers?<br><br>Is raising the age limit for drivers the best alternative? What other preventative measures can be brought in?<br><br>It seems that the role of the traffic police is very simple: Balance the equation of accidents vs summons. Simply put, if the rate of accidents goes up, introduce more measures to catch recalcitrants and offenders (money-spinning if possible) to bring it down.<br><br>Are there thorough studies conducted to properly examine the accidents on a case-by-case basis? If so, what are the findings? Why is it that our TP are all too eager to 'test' out their new 'state-of-the-art' gadgets?<br><br>Is that the right kind of investment we should be looking at?<br><br></div>

Numerous times, i see drivers who wait there on hazard lights.<br><br>These are people who SHOULD BE BOOKED AND FINED big time as they are INDEED potential trouble-makers. Either they will cause a JAM or an ACCIDENT.<br><br>Cars that park illegally at bus bays and do not move off even after a bus pulls in should also be FINED HEAVILY.<br><br>These are some things that TP are doing right but may need to focus more since motorists don't take the hint.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Today, I was parking illegally at a residental area at Orchard. Reason being is that the loading bay of the particular building I am going is full. My purpose of going to the building is to collect foodstuff which are meant for charity. I placed a sign at the windscreen stating that I will be back in 10 minutes. I know that is useless after all.<br><br>When I return, a saw a CISCO traffic warden(white uniform) using his handheld equipment. I told him that because the loading bay was full and I am collecting food for charity, he said that I should not park there. He said he have entered my vehicle's details. Later, i repeated myself and he say don't park here again. Then he walked away.<br><br>For such case, will I still get summon by post/mail?</div>
