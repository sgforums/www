              <p>How did your brilliance prevented you to note the ongoing and continuous crackdown of the Mafia in their own place of birth in Sicily, that threatens the democratic society in Italy ?</p>
              <p>How did your brilliance lead you to such lengths but failed to bring you any steps further to note that there are other democratic societies such as Switzerland, Denmark, and France - just naming a few - that put a stop to the muslims demanding minarets and projecting a higher profile in their respective societies ?</p>
              <p>These democratic societies have dealt with their drug problems in their own preferred and perceived humane ways that suits their social values and conciousness.</p>
              <p>Are we to question their values when we do not expect foreigners to question ours but to allow ourselves to develop into a more humane society ?</p>
              <p>Is Singapore a corrupt free country as matters stand ?</p>
              <p>Corruption may not be as rampant to affect the daily lives of Singaporeans as in the manner in which corrupt officials demand petty payments to get the job done - the worst part is that it is legalised by the shameless assault on our common sense that allow the Ministers to pay themselves through a legislative process that they control, and without any reference to the Citizens.</p>
              <p>In a democratic society such as Switzerland, the citizens are consulted by their Elected Representatives on legislations and politics that affect their lives.</p>
              <p>Their Elected Representatives DO NOT take it on themselves to think what is best for their Citizens and decide on their behalf.</p>
              <p>Referendums are conducted to allow the Citizens to participate in the process that govern their lives.</p>
              <p>It is the Citizens that decide in a Referendum concerning how their society is shaped and not by the Elected Representatives deciding how social engineering should shape the society to keep themselves in power.</p>
              <p>It is the Citizens that decide how the Referendum is clearly and transparently formed - that allow for dissenting views to be included - and not in the shameless referendum framed to push Singapore into a merger with Malaysia - that was the vain dream of an ambitious individual determined to see his own vanity succeed.</p>

              <p>It is of no surprise that in any formation of state, be it independent or newly form, there must be struggle, too bad some will fall and some will win, if not it is not a struggle. And of course the winner takes it all.  But the most important is not about wining or losing, it is about those who won, must and can rule well. PAP may had adopted certain unpopular decisions just to grip hold of power in the early years of Singapore struggling of independency, but that is politics, you got be shrew, smart and with a good foresight to opportunity and also be able to take the first step ahead of your opponents, otherwise, no shows, u can go back kampong and plant jagong.</p>
              <p>If u look into our asean countries, most of them, going thru struggling after struggling in forming new govts, but still remain in dire strait and poor condition, because most of their politicians have self interest, they not only bring down their opponents, which is common in politics struggling, but also the peoples/citizens who supported them. And that is very bad and sad. They cannot or failed to delivery what they promised to the citizens.</p>
              <p>PAP had gone thru a period of struggling, perhap from mid 50s to mid 60s, during this period, whatever dumbells, steamboat, rubbish, coffee, shit and fighting put in, the main purpose is to get independency and a solid govt. After 1965, we progressed. And till now, we are still progressing and living happily. An envy by most of the countries around us, to the extend some get jealous over us.</p>
              <p>The year is 2009, and 2010 coming soon, most of those who struggled in the 50s and 60s may be 3/4 gone by now. As a young citizen of singapore, i appreciate and honor these earlier peoples who all had a common mind, that is to build Singapore, but too bad, with a different believes. But from 1965 to present, our govt has make us richer, healthier, smarter and better in whatever condition. For that, i appreciate what they had done, in which, after taking full power, they proceed to bring up the people to be within one of the highest living standard around the region. Give yourself a thot, if you dun want to thanks PAP or LKY is ok, but dun hold the past with them. LKY may be wrong or right, but what he had given till now, we should thanks him.</p>

              <p>By your standards of political values - what constitute to be <em><span style="color: #0000ff;">"deserving political party</span></em>" when you do not even know what the present political ethos that the different political parties have for the interest of Singaporeans ?</p>
              <p>This is clearly seen in your superficial judgment of all the Alternative Political Parties - and the SDP in particular - and can only be the result of yourself being an armchair observer, a passer-by that absorb the flash images of events and forming your own skewed judgment based on political values that have been indoctrinated by years of PAP propaganda in setting the goals for what social values should be.</p>
              <p>If the SDP is paying mere lip service why will it adopt the most open and democratic constitution amongst all the Alternative Political Parties - and is not afraid of someone coming along to usurp power from the present leadership ?</p>

              <p>The long expose serves no better to improve the "Attention Seeking Whore" from its irrelevant and irrerevant habit of seeking attention to its own presence with persistent idiocy.</p>

              <p>Will you consider yourself as "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">any normal human being</span></em>" - when you prefer not to be pro-active and will lambast who will volunteer to set the course - while you will mire yourself in the frustrating status quo that can lead only to calamity into the future ?</p>
              <p>If the son does not share the father's vision, will he have stepped into the father's shoes and takeover the Reform Party ?</p>
              <p>By your standards of understanding - what possibly can be any more "lawful" and what is "legal change in power" when the process is consistently being thwarted by the PAP with its multiple methods at affecting the self-serving laws to disadvantage the Alternative Parties, and exercise its options to gerrymander the political process to further disadvantage the Alternative Parties ?</p>
              <p>By your standards of political values - what constitute to be <em><span style="color: #0000ff;">"deserving political party</span></em>" when you do not even know what the present political ethos that the different political parties have for the interest of Singaporeans ?</p>
              <p>This is clearly seen in your superficial judgment of all the Alternative Political Parties - and the SDP in particular - and can only be the result of yourself being an armchair observer, a passer-by that absorb the flash images of events and forming your own skewed judgment based on political values that have been indoctrinated by years of PAP propaganda in setting the goals for what social values should be.</p>
              <p>If the SDP is paying mere lip service why will it adopt the most open and democratic constitution amongst all the Alternative Political Parties - and is not afraid of someone coming along to usurp power from the present leadership ?</p>
              <p>Can this be mere lip service ?</p>

              <p>You are merely paying lip service to the people of Singapore. People on the streets can see that SDP is not caring for the welfare of the people but out to gain power for itself. Look at how SDP demonise PAP and not set up alternative strategies that  are workable for all Singaporeans.</p>

              <p>Haiz,</p>
              <p>Ladies and gentlemen, brothers and sisters,</p>
              <p>We must not take for granted what we have now and what we had achieved so far, deep inside everyone of us, we all should know the impact and fragility of Singapore subject to a revolution of Changes, changing of govt is not like changing clothing, that is what most young singaporeans thought, being young and naive, we understand. But we must tell them the implication of what they have now, can be gone in second if they do not take the right decision in getting the right govt to guide them.</p>
              <p>Comments and critics is easily to say than done, and opposition and their supporters are good in that, who dunno, even a 3 years old kid also knows how to ask for sweet but someone has to get for him/her. They can sing songs and tell tales of sad early days political stories in hope that peoples sympathise them and cast a vote for them, or they can keep humming on unpopular policies by the govt which main objective is for the future advancement, but politic is not about sad stories and self interest critics from empty vessels, it is about the real game, not an illusion nor a dream, but real life action.</p>
              <p>To make a decision, it is simple, dun alway at yourself, look around you, compare singapore with your surrounding countries, visit these countries to learn and experience more, start from their immigration to their buses and road condition etc etc, than you may appreciate your country more. Then decide on your own future, your family, relatives and friends, do you want what we had now to go into a Change of govt which dun hold any guarantee for your future and situation and can even give in to a freak result leading back to the 50s riots and unrest again?? If that is your decision, so be it.</p>
