              <p><strong>SINGAPORE</strong> – It would not be surprising if such a question has been weighing on every Singaporean’s mind at one point of time or another. This is by no means an exhuastive topic, and it may not be possible to cover every inch of ground.</p>
              <p>Singapore has always been governed using a top down approach. Put simply, the government decides every facet of a Singaporean’s life from the management of his national savings to the type of flat he is supposed to stay in. Ordinary Singaporeans have no part to play in the decision-making process. In a discussion on different types of citizenship participation and non-participation in a seminal piece titled “A Ladder of Citizen Participation”, Sherry Arnstein defined citizenship participation as a form of power re-distribution that enables under-privileged citizens who were excluded from the political and economic processes to be included. In a way, this will lead to the empowerment of such citizens.</p>
              <p>Sadly in Singapore’s case, all ordinary citizens inclusive of under-privileged ones have no say in the decisions that concern them. And it is ironical when the government turns around and exhort citizens not to be reliant on it. The problem is that if citizens are not empowered through their participation within the decision-making process, when will they ever learn to be independent of the government?</p>
              <p>That is not say Singaporeans cannot think in general. It is quite comforting to note that there are substantial number of Singaporeans who seek ways and means to highlight their concerns. In the past, it used to be sending forum letters to our mainstream media. The problem is that the chances of such letters getting published depends a lot on the political sensitivity of its contents and a huge dose of chance of course. Thus, the online media offers an attractive alternative. And it is pretty easy to set up an online interest group for individuals with a common interest to band together. In fact, the online media is fast becoming the collection vase for the thoughts of thinking Singaporeans.</p>

              <p>The kind of species that sit on fences are the birds that fly off with the change of the seasons, or the monkeys that sit on fences waiting for the scraps that come their way.</p>
              <p>Do these species learn to control or make the best from their own environment when compared to the Gorrillas and the Chimps ?</p>
              <p>With your own status in mind - can you possibly know anything about the present lot of politicians have not already become obedient and tamed "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">animals trying to make parliament into a circus</span></em>" - with the supreme Stalinist-Autocrat as the Ring Master keeping the actions in synch to his planned program ?</p>
              <p>How many of the current politicians have the interests of Singaporeans as their primary concerns even as they sit docile in Parliament - held in awe and trepidattion by the whip held in the Ring Master's hand ?</p>
              <p>Has anyone been effective to change the circumstances that have affected the entire political and social environment of Singaporeans ?</p>
              <p>The only basis for success that is even shared by Philip Jeyaretnam and his late father is that <strong>Singapore must return to a system of Law and Order</strong> - that has been perverted by the illegal laws passed by a rubber-stamping Parliament, which had bastardised the sacred tenets of the Singapore Constitution - and with these schemes crafted under the control of a Stalinist-Autocrat.</p>
              <p>Without Singapore having a system of Law and Order as defined in the Singapore Constitution, can the interests of Singaporeans be served ?</p>
              <p>It is back to basics to reconstruct Singapore, so as to turn the Singapore Ship from its "Titanic Course" as charted by the vain ambitions of a Stalinist-Autocrat.</p>
              <p>When will your kind learn to get off the fence and stop waiting for a political Messiah to change your own environment ?</p>
              <p>Even the animals in the Animal Farm had learnt to boot the cunning swines - who dared to takeover the Farmer's role to dictate over the Animal Farm - are you planning to continue your stand on the side of those damn "swines" ?</p>
