This can be seen from whether our top leaders truly share in the challenges/suffering of the people, whether policies are made with the intent of benefitting our people, whether they truly listen to our concerns and address them instead of making a pretense of listening.<br><br>The people have seen that our top leaders, already the highest paid in the world, will increase their salaries by as high as 20% when many poorer singaporeans struggle to cope with the rising costs of living. There are so many singaporeans, especially our old folks, who struggle to live decently.<br><br>Some nursing homes who take care of these old folks survive through donations from fellow singaporeans because the financial support from the government is oh so little. And you can see from those who are living in one room flats that their living conditions can be much improved. Many of these flats are so run-down with paint falling off the walls, and nonfunctioning corridor lights which are left unrepaired for months on end. We feel for them. If the MP knew about this situation, and rightly he must, then also rightly he should take action to address this. Financial resources are always limited but if they are truly concerned about people, then they will find a way to make sure money is used where it is most needed.<br><br>It's from all these big and small issues that the people make the judgment of whether their leaders are loyal to them.<br><br>Other issues of integrity (moral leadership) and transparency also follows.<br><br>Well, right now, im not sure exactly how loyal our government is to our people.</div>

This can be seen from whether our top leaders truly share in the challenges/suffering of the people, whether policies are made with the intent of benefitting our people, whether they truly listen to our concerns and address them instead of making a pretense of listening.<br><br>The people have seen that our top leaders, already the highest paid in the world, will increase their salaries by as high as 20% when many poorer singaporeans struggle to cope with the rising costs of living. There are so many singaporeans, especially our old folks, who struggle to live decently.<br><br>Some nursing homes who take care of these old folks survive through donations from fellow singaporeans because the financial support from the government is oh so little. And you can see from those who are living in one room flats that their living conditions can be much improved. Many of these flats are so run-down with paint falling off the walls, and nonfunctioning corridor lights which are left unrepaired for months on end. We feel for them. If the MP knew about this situation, and rightly he must, then also rightly he should take action to address this. Financial resources are always limited but if they are truly concerned about people, then they will find a way to make sure money is used where it is most needed.<br><br>It's from all these big and small issues that the people make the judgment of whether their leaders are loyal to them.<br><br>Other issues of integrity (moral leadership) and transparency also follows.<br><br>Well, right now, im not sure exactly how loyal our government is to our people. </div></blockquote>Bump .... bery bery well said ar  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
