Are you anti-processed toilet water?<br><br>You seem to be anti-PAP's "Pay and Pay" policy.<br><br>You really think what we paid is not useful. The taxes we paid is to help the country as a whole. Look things at different perspectives, please.  You think the next major party other than PAP will reduce taxes much if they are in government? No. Our government need that kind of money to make Singapore grow. We cannot be stagnant or we will lose out in the competitive world.<br><br>This problem of WATER is definitely would be broken, sooner or later. We have to be self-sufficient. Singaporeans does not wish to have a "weak point" held by another country.<br><br>PAP never stopped discussions. The bilateral relations never did end.The Malaysian Government did not too. It has only gone bad for a period. These up-and-downs are always there.<br><br>PAP only request that we talk all the problems as one package to have a win-win situation. The water problem and the Pedra Branca issues are the problems that ended in a way we all really did not like. The stirring of patriotic issues are made by Malaysian medias. Singaporeans only reacted in the way they should react as Singaporeans (We have heard long enough).<br><br>It was PAP who requested to review the water price, not Malaysia. Of course, PAP wanted a lower price. So people like you no need to pay so much. Both sides stood their ground and would not compromise. Malaysia kept increasing the price even though previously we have initial agreements by words and they wanted us to compromise. How can we give in to this bullying? We are patient enough.These was shown by Jayakumar reveal of the letters.<br><br>We have to take note that this patriotism is important to Singapore. It is part of our psychological defence to our Total Defence.<br><br>And guess what?<br><br>We had to give some of our water to Johor Bahru (hope they like our NEWATER  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> ) because some of their main water pipe is damaged. We helped them still. See how important to each other we are? But remember, important but not vital.</div>

There are other more pressing issues that need attention.  Whatever it is, and how much I do not like the PAP, they handled this situation well, except for Lau Lee's son yammering and bragging to the press about it.  That is the only thing I can fault the handling of the situation.<br><br>If you want to do something good, criticise the problematic and wrong policies and not indiscriminately slam everything the PAP does.

Welcome !<br><br>Politics aside, I do not see what other forces that had construded<br>the Sing gov to become self-sufficient in water which itself was<br>planned for even in 1970s. The KL's gov flipflopping of its<br>position during the water negotiation of the past 2 yrs had only<br>served to enhance suspicion on their intention to provide Singapore<br>until "doomsday".<br><br>And much to my amusement, some pple seek to ignore this and<br>only interested in sow distrust on Newater.

            <div class='col-md body'>Frankly speaking. The change in water price starts by Singapore. Singapore does not want Malaysia to be unhappy.<br><br>But, look again. There could be a plot by Singapore (for the sake of Singapore of course!) of why Singapore started this  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"> .<br><br>In my point of view, changing and getting a new water price for the future now was important. Inflation. Last time Malaysia set the water price in the 60s at few sens was because they are absolutely dumb, they forgot about a thing called inflation. Now they are smarter (nice realisation  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> ).<br><br>Change in the water price early meant that we could POSSIBLY get cheaper water for the future. But Malaysia fianlly got a bit smarter than they were in the past. They also got quite over-demanding (I think they realised they were stupid in the past and tried to recoup their past losses). When Singapore do not like the price, of course, we will not accept.<br><br>By fact, the water discussions (the rights of discussing water) was given by Singapore, or else Malaysia cannot really do anything about the current price. Singapore is a smart businessman. There things got out of hand. Malaysian media started to complain way too much. We say their media sucks. Malaysia shut down talks.<br><br>Singapore simply shrugs and says, "I think they finally got abit smarter, finally." <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
