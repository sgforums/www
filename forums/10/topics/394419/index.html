              <h1>Singapore teacher burdened by hefty mortgage loan for HDB flat before marriage</h1>
              <p>Dear TR,</p>
              <p>Thanks for publishing the article by Ms Judy Eng. It really strikes a chord in my heart as I am in the same situation as her too.<br>I am 28 this year now working as a teacher in a secondary school.</p>
              <p>My fiancee just found a job in a GLC as an engineer after six months of looking for one. The pay isn’t fantastic as there is an abundance of foreign engineers in Singapore. He considered himself lucky to finally secure a full-time job after months of being on contract.</p>
              <p>We are planning to get married in July and just bought a 4-room resale flat at Sin Ming. Guess how much it costs? You won’t believe it, we bought it at almost $500,000. No kidding, it’s true! All the flats in the vicinity cost above $500K. After paying about $30,000 in COV partially paid for by our parents, we do not have a single cent left for our wedding which we will have a simple afternoon tea buffet at our church instead of the traditional 8-course Chinese dinner.</p>
              <p>I am really worried about our future. We earn barely $5,000 together and the mortgage loan already took up 30 percent of our income. We still have to cough out some cash after using up the entire CPFs. The moment I think of this, I lost all the mood already.</p>
              <p>People used to say that marriage is the happiest moment in a girl’s life, but I am not looking forward to it. I feel very heavy, like a burden placeed on my chest, sometimes choking me, it is so suffocating. Can we buy a new flat? I do not  wish to wait for another 3 to 4 years, anything can happen to our relationship during this period of time. It is a risk I cannot afford to take.</p>
              <p>My hubby-to-be is burnt out everyday from work – OT, OT and OT and he is not paid for it. For me, my weekends are either burnt in school CCAs or marking the homeworks of my students. We hardly meet each other at all, sometimes just enough time to have a meal or catch a movie. Somehow I feel apprehensive startinig life together with  another person, am I ready for it? I don’t think we can start a family, at least for the next three years or so. How to have children when we are not financially stable?</p>
              <p>I will pay the loan mostly on my own as my hubby still have to pay for his student loan and car loan. I have only a few thousand dollars in my savings now and I  wonder how long they can last me. What happens when there is an emergency? Or if we are retrenched? I dread to think of the worst…but women being women, they always think alot.</p>
              <p>Every month, my pay gets used up almost immediately after it’s deposited into my POSB account – living expenses, allowances for parents, and now with housing loan, I  really don’t know how far we can continue like this. Did we do our Maths before we make the purchase? Yes, but what can we do, the flats are expensive everywhere and we want to stay near our parents. Even 4-room flats in Jurong are calling above $400,000 nowadays! The prices are really going crazy, the agents told us that they will only go up in the future as the govt will never allow them to come down.</p>
              <p>Sorry for the ramblings. There are so many things on my mind now, I can’t think or type clearly…..Thanks for providing me an outlet to vent my frustrations, who can understand what we are going through? Sigh, maybe I am one of those few unlucky souls.</p>
              <p>Please edit and publish this rant of mine as you see fit. Thanks again for listening.</p>

              <p>there are plenty of resale 4 rooms at other estates that cost less than 350k .... what's wrong with this couple ? ... if they think they were earning not enough to begin with, then why did they jump into such an expensive house in the first place ? ... and seriously, it's HDB we are talking about ... what kind of "prime" people want to talk about ?</p>
              <p>and got car somemore ?!?!?!?! ..... two person earn 5k can still buy car and half a million dollar flat ? ..... this couple really kiam gan ....</p>

              <p>well then good luck to the couple ........</p>
              <p>and if that is really the case, then she must be even dumber than she appears in this letter, cos her husband may have gotten her with his car ... but, as she has written, she now finds herself paying most of the mortgage by herself ! ..... thanks to his car .... </p>

              <p>No matter how much they earn, money will not be enough.</p>
              <p>You think they were caught by surprise by the $500,000 four-room flat and therefore find themselves with a monetary crisis.</p>
              <p>Live within your means, and save up.</p>
              <p>Not  live  above your capability, find yourself short, and blame the government for it. </p>
              <p>BTW, the one who sold the flat must be very happy. Maybe even apply for new 5-room flat at $350,000 form the HDB in newer estates.</p>
