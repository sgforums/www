              These 3 transactions were for flats above 6th storey. 
              
              Feb â€“ Blk 441 â€“ S$400K

              Although the price of her purchased flat may not yet be reflected in the resale transaction.  This is a good guide of the price range of the flats there. $100K difference is really very scary.
                      
              
              Of course 1 can choose to pay $700K or $800K for a $400K flat.
                      
              You make your decision and bear the consequences.  How can one buys an expensive flat and then start to complain that it is expensive?

              <p>funny how, these foreigners are messing up the markets and this can hurt sg buyers, HDB as heartlanders houses should not be price at such a high price, these foreigners do not bear the consquences of our citizens nor they understand our society and our wage tag, and with the govt turning a blind eyes to it, I get feeling that one of these, a reale HDB flat is going to cost 1 million.</p>
              <p>In my native land taiwan, the public houses, govt build for working class are price at a mini and max range, and as foreigners, you are not suppose to buy it unless one of yr spouse is a citizen there. Only when there is excess, then maybe thru a relative, you can purchase it. Freehold. Because these houses are mend for working class, the prices meet the wage level of these people, no way, any one can go in and manipulate it up as in a free market.</p>

              <p>In my native land taiwan, the public houses, govt build for working class are price at a mini and max range, and as foreigners, you are not suppose to buy it unless one of yr spouse is a citizen there. Only when there is excess, then maybe thru a relative, you can purchase it. Freehold. Because these houses are mend for working class, the prices meet the wage level of these people, no way, any one can go in and manipulate it up as in a free market.</p>
              <p>HDB had lost it true identity to service the working class singaporeans. Good luck to singaporeans</p>

              <p>But we are in the mid of it, my dear Fuhrer, we cannot assume a case of religion conflict or war, at least, there is a history in it, and people are more objective in their conflicts with an ultimate goal. However, my dear Fuhrer, we are in a mid of nowhere, they have smoked our identity, they had teaches us to be at  peace, harmony, racial tolerances, endurances, patriotic, courtesy, gracious and be good and loyal to the country we called our motherland. Then they influx foreigners in and ask us to bear with it, except it, tolerant it, bear with it, be courteous to them, guide them, and due to our good upbringing. we did as per told, but instead of appreciating what we are doing, they input more and more foreigners in with disregards to our livinghood, our culture, our wages, our diminshing patriotic senses etc etc...</p>
              <p>We are certainly not fools, but seem like being make a fool by them, them!, the one we supported, the one we praised, the one we embraced, the one we call our govt, our rulers, our master, our guidance...if Singaporeans, rich or poor do not have a single feeling of being betrayed, then i think Singaporeans are robots.</p>

              <p>It is of good luck that LKY knew and learned from history that people like Hilter, Stalin, Mao etc etc had failed miserably as dictators, if he has no knowledge of it, I think he is now a full dictator, but because he learned from history that dictator dun last long, he pulled his handbrake, go hide behind the curtain and rules in a more engaging way.
