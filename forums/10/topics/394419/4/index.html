              planning to get married in July and just bought a 4-room resale
              flat at Sin Ming. Guess how much it costs? You won’t believe it, we
              bought it at almost $500,000. No kidding, it’s true! All the flats
              in the vicinity cost above $500K. After paying about $30,000 in COV
              partially paid for by our parents, we do not have a single cent
              left for our wedding which we will have a simple afternoon tea
              buffet at our church instead of the traditional 8-course Chinese
              dinner"</span></p>
              <p>based on what TS said, we use $500,000 minus $30,000 =
              $470,000 </p>
              <p>Then if transacted price is around $400,000 for Sim Ming
              area</p>
              <p>we use $470,000 minus $400,000 = $70,000</p>
              <p>$70,000 as ancillary cost? i think can buy brand new car liao...
              no need loan, one shot pay all...</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>So how much is the real ancillary cost to purchase a flat in Sin Ming ?</p>

              <p>I think she represents a typical Singaporean, not exactly
              financially savvy and struggling to make ends meets. Coupled with
              poor work life balance in their jobs, they find life meaningless in
              the rat race. This is probably the average Singaporean story.</p>
              <p>Leaving all the flats to BTO, isnt a good policy. Its good for
              those that are still young. The median age of marriage for men is
              <span>31.2 in 2006. can they afford to wait another 3-4
              years? The govt wants us to plan in advance, but it is really so

              <p>this i agree with you, things do not always go as planned. </p>
              <p>true, if you can afford it and you NEED the convenience due to family reasons like near parents or near workplace, buy a resale. but buy within their abilities... i mean why are they paying $100,000 COV if it's going to kill them? or if it's not the COV then do they know the market price of flats at Sim Ming? </p>

              <p>so you are saying she already calculated the loan amount plus interest into the total amount of the HDB flat? let's work backwards and calculate then... the current HDB loan interest in 2.6%</p>
              <p>Total price is $500,000 after 30 years (let's take the maximum tenure)</p>
              <p>So definitely the purchase price is lesser than $500,000 since she already factored in interest of 2.6% per annual for 30 years. let me do the maths...</p>
              <p>if i'm not wrong (i'm pretty bad at maths... flunked my Engineering Maths during Poly)</p>
              <p>i estimate that the HDB was bought at a mere $347,000 which in my opinion is quite acceptable... the highest transacted is $395,000... why is she complaining then? Valuation of the place is then around $310,000. if we use the loan calculator at HDB website, we can see that the monthly instalment is $1,215 bore by 2 persons...</p>
              <p>if your pay is 2K, your CPF is as we know is $690 (34.5%) and 3K = $1035</p>
              <p>combine them together is $1,725. of course we know we have to take up certain percentage for medishield and Special account. $1.725 x 0.6667 = $1,150</p>
              <p>if we see the numbers, we can conclude that TS did not have a proper planning on her financials as she is still in the red after all the deductions.</p>

              <p>that is subjective... we have no kids yet and we do not plan on having yet anytime soon... also, for the 2 years, we were trying to save some money for the wedding and renovations... so we decided that BTO suits us better... </p>
              <p>we can wait - we need to raise funds for the wedding<br>we don't wish to pay $400,000 for something we can get at $250,000 for just waiting 3 years.</p>

              <p>If it's that bad, why the car and why not BTO?</p>
              <p>They clearly want to live above their means. Sure, my gf is a
              teacher as well, and the pay is not exactly fantastic for the
              amount of time put in... the workload is tremendous and she's
              thinking of quitting next year when her bond ends... But that isn't
              an excuse for the writer above not to have planned the finances
              properly...</p>

              <p>you should quickly go book one BTO first dude, even if you do not intend to stay in HDB your whole life. A brand new flat twice in a life time is every citizen's entitlement. Once you have fulfilled the minimum occupation period, value sure appreciate one, so it's a win-win-win situation however you look at it. Think of it as our backdated NS pay <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
