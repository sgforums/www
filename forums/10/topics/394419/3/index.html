              <p>HALF a MILLION BUCKS for a 4 room public housing??!!!  That's crazy!!! I feel sorry for you Melissa.  What were you thinking?  Considering you just started out, my guess is that you would have taken out the 30 years loan at least.  Add on the compound interest, at the end of that 30 years loan period you would have paid a total ONE MILLION DOLLARS +/- a few thousands!  Now ask yourself, can you sell your 4rm HDB flat 30 years from now at one million dollars just to break even?  By then your apartment would be at least 35 years old and public flats have only a 99 years life or lease.  The best thing you can do now is to sell off that car, it's a terrible waste of money.  You should also consider renting out a room or 2 to cover that cash portion you are paying every month.  Money can stress your married life to the breaking point.  You can thank the PAP for that.</p>

              <p>sell off the flat after the restriction is over so that they don't committed themselved to a life long loan payment.  Moved to a smaller flat.</p>

              <p>There must be some changes and new paradigms. The current system is broken.</p>
              <p>There must be conscious and deliberate effort to make life more family friendly.</p>
              <p>First, there must be strict enforcement of maximum working hours per week.</p>
              <p>Second, there must be a complete overhaul of the housing system. The status quo will not do. Housing supply and regulation must be tailored in a way which encourage and promote family creation.</p>
              <p>Third, CPF must be completely re-evaluated. Right now with the current system, there are some people who use up CPF to buy homes.
