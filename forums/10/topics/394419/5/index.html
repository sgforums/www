              <p>you should quickly go book one BTO first dude, even if you do
              not intend to stay in HDB your whole life. A brand new flat twice
              in a life time is every citizen's entitlement. Once you have
              fulfilled the minimum occupation period, value sure appreciate one,
              so it's a win-win-win situation however you look at it. Think of it

              <p>well isn't it time they change the policy to reflect the current trend ?</p>
              <p>In 1997, wat was the marriage rate, age of marriage/parenthood , birth rate like ? Higher than today yes ?</p>
              <p>Surely, the scholars are smart enough to link the dots together, yes?</p>
              <p>But if their current intention is to keep flat values sky high, there's really no reason to supply enough.  Then something's gota give.</p>

              <p>The govt like to give two extreme choices in the argument. Either zero foreigners or uncontrolled immigration like the last 3 years. Why cant it be gradual intake like what have are having in the last 2 decades?</p>
              <p>Either BTO or a huge over supply of flats like 97. There is no middle ground e.g. hold a smaller projected 1 year's stock.</p>

              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Grace Fu: PRs are “helpful” to HDB flat owners when they sell their flats</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong>Written by Our Correspondent</strong></p>
              <p>In an interview with Channel 8 Focus programme yesterday, Senior Minister of State for National Development Grace Fu admitted unwittingly that PRs are indirectly responsible for the sky-rocketing HDB flat prices.</p>
              <p><em>“”We have some Singaporeans coming to us and saying ‘I want to sell to a PR because the PR is giving me a better price than Singaporeans.’”</em> she said.</p>
              <p>PRs are allowed to purchase resale flats in Singapore without any restrictions and sell them for a profit later on. Some PRs have “spoilt” the market for paying higher than market rates for the flats they want.</p>
              <p>The state media reported an Indonesian PR who forked out $653,000 for a 4-room resale flat in Queenstown when he could well afford a condominium.</p>
              <p>Grace Fu also implied that PRs are “helpful” to HDB flat owners as they are willing to pay a higher price for their flats:</p>
              <p><em>“So even though we may not want to have many foreigners or PRs buying HDB flats, if you’re an HDB flat owner and when you’re selling the HDB flat, a PR is helpful for you as well. So for all our policies we try to take a very balanced view.”</em></p>
              <p>HDB has denied repeatedly that PRs are the culprits for jacking up prices of HDB flats. National Development Minister Mah Bow Tan said a few weeks ago in Parliament that PRs who make up “only” one in five resale flat buyers, have minimal impact on resale prices.</p>
              <p>Law Minister Shanmugam claimed that according to his “hunch”, Singaporeans are responsible for the escalating prices and not PRs and foreigners:</p>
              <p><em>“The first misconception is that somehow there are five million people and that is putting pressure on all of us. It doesn’t. Of the five million, 3.2million are citizens, and roughly 500,000 are permanent residents (PRs). The remaining 1.3million are here on temporary work permits, and they ‘impose no burden’ on the public housing system.” </em></p>
              <p><strong>[Source: Straits Times, 18 January 2010]</strong></p>
              <p>The prices of resale HDB flats grew by an astonishing 8.2 percent last year with median Cash-over-Valuation (COVs) doubling from $12,000 to $24,000 in the last quarter alone.</p>
              <p>Despite evidence showing otherwise, HDB continues to insist that public housing remains “affordable” to the majority of Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>As expected, Ms Fu made use of the opportunity to re-affirm the government’s “committment” to ensure that HDB flats remain “affordable” by their standards:</p>
              <p><em>“The hot topic has been affordability of flats and also what is the impact of foreigners on the prices of HDB flats. So I think we have explained that we’ll continue to focus on affordability. We’ll continue to push out the BTOs.”</em></p>
              <p>National Development Minister Mah Bow Tan who admitted that he was “caught offguard” by the climbing prices has come under increasing fire from disgruntled Singaporeans for his failure to control flat prices.</p>
              <p>When asked by the media on the possibility of Mr Mah losing his seat in the next general election, <strong>PAP strongman Lee Kuan Yew retorted that Singaporeans must be</strong> <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">“daft”</span></strong> <strong>if they cast a protest vote against his party over rising HDB flat prices.</strong></p>
