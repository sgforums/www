            <div class='col-md body'>only if you have the money to go to a private hospital will they hub around at you...<br><br>recently (19 Sep 2006), i suffered a relapse of a slipped disc.. i'm not a very rich person and if i walked into some place like Gleneagles, i'd be bankrupted...<br><br>so, i go to the polyclinics to get a referral to the specialist doctors at the hospitals because a GP sure as heck isn't going to be able to do anything about a slipped disc..<br><br>off i went... in severe and intense pain... still attempting to keep cheerful while the back and the left leg feels as if someone is driving a red hot spike through it and twisting it around...<br><br>the wait for the doctor is LONG... and i mean really long.. i waited close to about 1 1/2 hours to see the doctor...<br><br>he's a nice guy, did the correct checks and then suddenly, in the midst of the examination of my back and legs, he starts to lament that a lot of doctors were pulled out to stand by for the IMF meeting! they were to go to their stations wherever they were and sit there in case any of the idiots here for the meeting were ill (btw, it was the last day of the IMF meetings) and they are severely short of staff.. and that they were short of staff anyway...<br><br>i thanked him and went to the counter to get my appointment with the orthopaedic specialist...<br><br>guess what? the closest appointment at the hospital with my history of this condition was... Jan 2007!!<br><br>so, i was going to suffer intense and murderous pain for 3 months before i could see someone about treating the pain?? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>any others was at Alexandra Hospital.. Nov 2006<br><br>i said okay to the nurse trying to get the appointments, she was most apologetic.. i told her "you've done your best".. i'll try to endure it<br><br>unfortunately, it just got worse and i ended up unable to stand up and ended up at the A&amp;E where you could hear the doc there screaming into the phone trying to get an orthopaedic person to see me and only managed a week later.. so she jabbed me full of painkillers and sent me home..<br><br>the next day was even worse and somehow, folks managed to dig through their contacts and i got to see a doctor (finally) who put me through a whole lot of things and then with physiotherapy and all that, i hope i'm on the road to mending..<br><br>medical hub maybe... to others.. damn the citizens <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>
