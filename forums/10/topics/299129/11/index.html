Early Christianity blamed the Jews for not accepting Jesus as the messiah. This continued through mediaeval Christianity when Palestine was considered by the Church as the Christian "Holy Land." During the Crusades many atrocities were committed by the Crusaders against the Jews. A drastic change of this Christian attitude towards the Jews occurred in the 16th century with the emergence of nationalism in Europe and the arrival of Protestantism. New beliefs emerged to the effect that the Jews should return to their promised land before their conversion to Christianity, which will be the sign of the second advent of the Messiah. Later on, with the fall of the Ottoman Empire, British Christian Zionism gained more strength to reach its zenith in the Balfour Declaration of 1917, and continued to be effective through the British Mandate in Palestine and during and after World War II and disclosures of the Nazi atrocities of the Holocaust. In the U.S. the Evangelicals, and to a lesser extent the Catholics, stood wholeheartedly behind Jewish Zionism</blockquote><blockquote><span style="font-style: italic;">none of you actually provided an unbiased source. no sources in fact.<br>provide sources</span></blockquote><blockquote>I find it laughable that<br><br>Coming from someone who always insists on sources<br><br>Where're yours?</blockquote>you must be a funny man who finds it funny that i posted more than ten sources already.<br><br><blockquote>brainwashed moron, if you're talking of uk.usa etc as 'allied powers', you already are speaking english and your forefathers have been doing so for centuries now thanks to the bloody anglophones already colonizing you and nothing changed for you. your leaders llike you are actually such great bumlickers that you like getting colonized Laughing typical of shameless stateless roving nomadic barbarian creatures.<br><br>now you're all agog about usa and uk. i dont see what difference is there.</blockquote><blockquote><br>Undebatable <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> </blockquote>undoubtedly so.<br><br></div>
