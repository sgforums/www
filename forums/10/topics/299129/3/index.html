Analyze the dates.<br><br>Early History of the Region<br><br>Before the Hebrews first migrated there around 1800 B.C., the land of Canaan was occupied by Canaanites.<br>Â“Between 3000 and 1100 B.C., Canaanite civilization covered what is today Israel, the West Bank, Lebanon and much of Syria and Jordan...Those who remained in the Jerusalem hills <strong>after the Romans expelled the Jews [in the second century A.D.]</strong> were a potpourri: farmers and vineyard growers, pagans and converts to Christianity, descendants of the Arabs, Persians, Samaritans, Greeks and old Canaanite tribes.Â” Marcia Kunstel and Joseph Albright, Â“Their Promised Land.Â”<br><br>The present-day PalestiniansÂ’ ancestral heritage<br><br>Â“But all these [different peoples who had come to Canaan] were additions, sprigs grafted onto the parent tree...And that parent tree was Canaanite...<strong>[The Arab invaders of the 7th century A.D.]</strong> made Moslem converts of the natives, settled down as residents, and intermarried with them, with the result that all are now so completely Arabized that we cannot tell where the Canaanites leave off and the Arabs begin.Â” Illene Beatty, Â“Arab and Jew in the Land of Canaan.Â”<br><br>The Jewish kingdoms were only one of many periods in <strong>ancient Palestine</strong> (<strong><span style="font-style: italic;">There's no such thing as ancient Palestine. It's not mentioned in the bible ,it's not mentioned in the koran either.</span></strong>)<br><br>Â“The extended kingdoms of David and Solomon, on which the Zionists base their territorial demands, endured for only about 73 years...Then it fell apart...[Even] if we allow independence to the entire life of the ancient Jewish kingdoms, from DavidÂ’s conquest of Canaan in 1000 B.C. to the wiping out of Judah in 586 B.C., we arrive at [only] a 414 year Jewish rule.Â” Illene Beatty, Â“Arab and Jew in the Land of Canaan.Â”<br><br>More on Canaanite civilization<br><br>Â“Recent archeological digs have provided evidence that Jerusalem was a big and fortified city already in 1800 BCE...Findings show that the sophisticated water system heretofor attributed to the conquering Israelites pre-dated them by eight centuries and was even more sophisticated than imagined...Dr. Ronny Reich, who directed the excavation along with Eli Shuikrun, said the entire system was built as a single complex by Canaanites in the Middle Bronze Period, around 1800 BCE.Â” The Jewish Bulletin, July 31st, 1998.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Zbigniew Brzezinski on Islamic fundamentalism:<br><br>Question: The former director of the CIA, Robert Gates, stated in his memoirs ["From the Shadows"], that American intelligence services began to aid the Mujahadeen in Afghanistan 6 months before the Soviet intervention. In this period you were the national security adviser to President Carter. You therefore played a role in this affair. Is that correct?<br><br>Brzezinski: Yes. According to the official version of history, CIA aid to the Mujahadeen began during 1980, that is to say, after the Soviet army invaded Afghanistan, 24 Dec 1979. But the reality, secretly guarded until now, is completely otherwise Indeed, it was July 3, 1979 that President Carter signed the first directive for secret aid to the opponents of the pro-Soviet regime in Kabul. And that very day, I wrote a note to the president in which I explained to him that in my opinion this aid was going to induce a Soviet military intervention.<br><br>Q: Despite this risk, you were an advocate of this covert action. But perhaps you yourself desired this Soviet entry into war and looked to provoke it?<br><br>B: It isn't quite that. We didn't push the Russians to intervene, but we knowingly increased the probability that they would.<br><br>Q: When the Soviets justified their intervention by asserting that they intended to fight against a secret involvement of the United States in Afghanistan, people didn't believe them. However, there was a basis of truth. You don't regret anything today?<br><br>B: Regret what? That secret operation was an excellent idea. It had the effect of drawing the Russians into the Afghan trap and you want me to regret it? The day that the Soviets officially crossed the border, I wrote to President Carter. We now have the opportunity of giving to the USSR its Vietnam war. Indeed, for almost 10 years, Moscow had to carry on a war unsupportable by the government, a conflict that brought about the demoralization and finally the breakup of the Soviet empire.<br><br>Q: And neither do you regret having supported the Islamic fundamentalism, having given arms and advice to future terrorists?<br><br>B: What is most important to the history of the world? The Taliban or the collapse of the Soviet empire? Some stirred-up Moslems or the liberation of Central Europe and the end of the cold war?<br><br>Q: Some stirred-up Moslems? But it has been said and repeated Islamic fundamentalism represents a world menace today.<br><br>B: Nonsense! It is said that the West had a global policy in regard to Islam. That is stupid. There isn't a global Islam. Look at Islam in a rational manner and without demagoguery or emotion. It is the leading religion of the world with 1.5 billion followers. But what is there in common among Saudi Arabian fundamentalism, moderate Morocco, Pakistan militarism, Egyptian pro-Western or Central Asian secularism? Nothing more than what unites the Christian countries.<br><br><a href="http://globalresearch.ca/articles/BRZ110A.html" rel="nofollow">http://globalresearch.ca/articles/BRZ110A.html</a></div>
