In it he told viewers he had personally directed the 19 hijackers, and gave what he claimed was his motivation:<br><br><strong>I will explain to you the reasons behind these events, and I will tell you the truth about the moments when this decision was taken, so that you can reflect on it. God knows that the plan of striking the towers had not occurred to us, but the idea came to me when things went just too far with the American-Israeli alliance's oppression and atrocities against our people in Palestine and Lebanon.<br>According to the tapes, bin Laden claimed he was inspired to destroy the World Trade Center after watching the destruction of towers in Lebanon by Israel during the 1982 Lebanon War.</strong><br><br>In two other tapes aired by Al Jazeera in 2006, Osama bin Laden announces,<br>I am the one in charge of the 19 brothers Â… I was responsible for entrusting the 19 brothers Â… with the raids [5 minute audiotape broadcast May 23, 2006],<br>and is seen with Ramzi Binalshibh, as well as two of the 9/11 hijackers, Hamza al-Ghamdi and Wail al-Shehri, as they make preparations for the attacks (videotape broadcast September 7, 2006)<br></div>

In it he told viewers he had personally directed the 19 hijackers, and gave what he claimed was his motivation:<br><br>I will explain to you the reasons behind these events, and I will tell you the truth about the moments when this decision was taken, so that you can reflect on it. God knows that the plan of striking the towers had not occurred to us, but the idea came to me when things went just too far with the American-Israeli alliance's oppression and atrocities against our people in Palestine and Lebanon.<br>According to the tapes, bin Laden claimed he was inspired to destroy the World Trade Center after watching the destruction of towers in Lebanon by Israel during the 1982 Lebanon War.<br><br>In two other tapes aired by Al Jazeera in 2006, Osama bin Laden announces,<br>I am the one in charge of the 19 brothers Â… I was responsible for entrusting the 19 brothers Â… with the raids [5 minute audiotape broadcast May 23, 2006],<br>and is seen with Ramzi Binalshibh, as well as two of the 9/11 hijackers, Hamza al-Ghamdi and Wail al-Shehri, as they make preparations for the attacks (videotape broadcast September 7, 2006)  </blockquote>I just don't understand something<br><br>With all the conspiracy that Jews were responsible for the 9/11<br><br>And Osama declaring that he was responsible for it<br><br>Why haven't the Arabs invented the conspiracy that<br><br>Jews paid Osama for 9/11?</span><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
