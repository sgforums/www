unless you're a joker that is. this is the MOST sane aspect of property rights, personal ownership etc. otherwise everybody will be nomads, and granted illegal immigrants like israelis, singaporeans, etc wish it were acceptable and the norm, but this isn't in civilized world for understandable reasons like maintaining racial, religious, ethnic, cultural, culinary, civil, social, socioeconomic, political, sartorial, military, technological, educational, cohesional order among others.<br><br><blockquote>No one needs invitation to settle in any country they like</blockquote>----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>"does this mean I can settle in any part of the world I like"<br><br><blockquote>Why can't anyone settle in any part of the world they like?</blockquote>are you trying to be facetious? why can they? there is simply NO REASON for them to. otherwise there would be no legal framework, no international law, no respect for property rights, no individual rights, no individual cultural, religious, ethnic, racial, culinary, sartorial etc expressions unique to one group etc.<br><br>"no international boundaries should be respected?"<br><br><blockquote>You DON'T when you settle legally</blockquote>the laws can be changed at will by politicians etc. many countries were colonized like singapore, you being the result of one such misadventure. do you think it's okay that britain write your laws, institutionalize them, and criminalize those who violate britain's laws in asian countries and african ones etc since it's "illegal". britain made the laws, but who the hell made britain the lawmaker/legislator?<br><br>"or does this also imply I can let's say take over your house, your neighbours's etc so I dont need any legal instruments for that. as long as I "wish"?"<br><br>And<br><br><blockquote>so I can come to settle in singapore, usa, israel north korea, china, japan, taiwan at my will eh? including timmay's personal home eh? at will? </blockquote><blockquote>You are MORE THAN WELCOME to take over anyone's houses provided you do so legally<br><br>EG: Like buying their property with their PERMISSION<br><br>If we come to a good price, settle in my house!<br><br>But I don't own my house....(Too bad so sad)</blockquote>is this the pinnacle of idiocy? as stated above, singapore's laws are british derived laws, as a bloody anglophone's buml!cker it acts like and despairs and craves everthing quintessentially british. does it mean britain should take over all of the world since britain's law (can) say so?<br><br>britain did take over 1/4 of the world, and they did bl00dy legalize it?

then anything i do will be "legal" all the while i usurp your property and that of singaporeans (granted it's not the best of examples, as singaporeans are themselves descendants of illegal immigrants brought over from other regions by britain, they'd tend to support illegal immigration, however if recently others do migrate to signapore even if legally it becomes a problem, so it seems).<br><br>what about the anti-immigrant ruckus in singaporean media, this forum and elsewhere? hypocrisy at its best my friend, although i'm not surprised for this is what summarizes thieves, burglars, looters, pillagers, beggars who'd no homes and had to seek homes in british occupied lands until britain could 'grant' them those lands in other parts of the world, yet they dont go back to where they came from such is the leech that these anglo buml!ckers epitomize.<br><br>Hence<br><br><blockquote>No one needs invitation to settle in any country they like</blockquote><blockquote><br>( AS LONG AS THEIR IMMIGRATION IS LEGAL )<br><br>STILL STANDS   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></blockquote>you mean as long as legality is defined by uk?
