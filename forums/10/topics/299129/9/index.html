How they become extinct later you cannot blame the Jews because they(the Jews) had already vacated the land.<br><br><strong>Biblical context (their God is also your God)</strong><br><br>Specifically God was judging the Canaanites at that time, the Scripture says, for their gross idolatry, divination, witchcraft, sorcery, and mediums, i.e. those who call up the dead. In fact God says these "detestable practices" are the very reason they were driven out.<br><br>Likewise, God warned the Isralites "But if you do not drive out the inhabitants of the land, those you allow to remain will become barbs in your eyes and thorns in your sides. They will give you trouble in the land where you will live. And then I will do to you what I plan to do to them.' "<br></div>
