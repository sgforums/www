They faced persecution throughout history.<br>On the other hand, there are people who loathe them.<br><br>News networks like CNN, BBC and of course the Arab owned ones are biasesd against them. Even the UN under Kofi Annan was biased against them when it drafted the resolutions for peace.<br><br>Another instance is the Yom Kippur War. The Israelis were initially losing the war as the enemies launched a surprised attack when most of the Israeli citizen soldiers were congregated in the synagogues to pray.<br><br>Accept the US which swiftly shipped the war equipment to support the Israelis, no one else tried to stop the Arab Army's onslaught.<br><br>When the tides were turned, the Egyptian Army chief suffered a heart attack. A 20,000 strong Egyptian army was under seige by Sharon's tanks and was in danger of been entirely wiped out. The Russians and the UN quickly demanded a truce to negotiate a ceasefire.</div>
