Afghanistan was never conquered by the Arabs. Although the Islamic conquest is inevitable, but that was like 1400 years ago. we're talking about Modern history. Thus Arabs have never conquered them.<br><br>2. Afghanis and Pakistanis are not Arabs. We are talking about Palestinian Arabs and i dont understand why you people posted pictures of afghani women in burqa and pakistanis men in  a riot. why?<br><br>3. Although Lebanon is not a Secular State. The many sects and religions there live harmoniously like us in Singapore. and yes there are christians there because their forefathers were supposedly the Phoenicians. And the women don't wear burqas, the more conservatives one like those in the Gulf wear an Abaya. not Burqa. and i think the Lebanese stars dress more sexily than that of the Singapore's.<br><br><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/28/42634035_36603d1dd3.jpg"><br>The pic above is Lebanese Singer, Haifa Wehbe.<br><br>5. Iran dont have WMD. They dont. the Nuclear Power is for the peaceful means. Why dont u just get that?<br><br>6. Iranians are not Arabs. Altough we have similar religion. We are completely different ethnically.<br><br>7. I have read posts that say that they have not seen Israels attacking their Neighbor then i am saying that you are wrong. They destroy palestinian's houses so that they can make a segregation wall. or as a form of punishment for what they have never done aka Collective punishment, the punishment of an innocent Palestinian "for an offence he or she has not personally committed. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_demolition_in_the_Israeli-Palestinian_conflict#Purpose<br><br>8. the Berlin Wall? whoops. if you are to compare the Nazis regime with the Israel, i would somewhat agree. Look at the segregating wall,<br><img src="http://www.newspagedesigner.com/users/4026/israelwall.jpg"><br><br></span></div>

Palestinians who have a permit to work in Israel or those with permits allowing them to receive medical treatment or to visit immediate family in prisons use this crossing providing that it is open. [16]<br><br>At the moment the crossing is only open for foreigners and for a few Palestinians with residence permit for other country or treatment in Israel.<br><br>Though 5,000 Palestinians were permitted to use the Erez crossing to go to their places of work inside Israel, the crossing is frequently closed by the Israeli authorities, impeding their ability to get to work. [14] Additionally, the permits issued have not always been honoured by soldiers at the crossing and in some cases, have been confiscated by soldiers. - wikipedia.<br></span></div>
