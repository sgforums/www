              <p>I will vote NO as well. I think the PAP did well in mixing the races together in Singapore instead of dividing them up. All races eat at the same place, go to the same schools etc. There is shall we say a more united front as Singaporeans instead of race. I'm a Singaporean who happens to be Chinese.... instead of a Chinese that is from Singapore. </p>

              <p>I agreed with fymk.</p>
              <p>For Singapore context, I will give a resounding <strong>NO</strong>! I do know that Syriah Court is long established in Singapore and I hope its authority remains in Muslims' marriage, property affairs. If a Muslim and non-Muslim are to go to court over these issues, the case should be bring forward to a civil court.</p>
              <p>In Britain context( and numerous other Western nations too), I seriously do not see any need to create a separate judicial system for the Muslims. All man is <strong>EQUAL</strong> under the laws. There is the principle for British laws, isnt it?</p>
              <p>1) There are various contridictions between British civil laws and Syriah laws. For instance, a man can only marry one wife. All man is equal under the laws.</p>
              <p> 2) If you are in search for a better place to live, and people, <strong>out of kindness</strong>, take you in. You dun moved in and then demand this, demand that and take the kindess of the hosts for granted.</p>
              <p>IMO, Britain should provide the environmnent of religious freedom without any discrimination. Moreover, if the Muslims need additional help, such as building of mosques, Britain should help lend her hand. Moreover, the concept of Syriah laws should not be allowed.</p>
              <p>3) If Britain wants to create a Syriah court for Muslim, then she has to be fair and create other types of judicial systems to cater for other religions/ethnic groups. It shouldnt be a Muslims' prerogative only.</p>

              <p>While I believe it's not a good idea to have 2 laws in one country, I think there is a place for Shariah Law in Singapore.</p>
              <p>An additional application I see may be a little like arbitration for contractual disputes where both parties have agreed in advance of signing a contract that in the event of a disagreement a settlement may be made by an arbitrator that both parties agree on, they may also have the option to have it arbitrated by a Shariah court in accordance with Shariah Law.</p>

              <p>Double edged sword, i guess. looking in the newspapers with regards to Malaysia and the conflicts they had when a muslim and non muslim are embroiled in court case. Their civil court always say that they had no jurisdiction when the case involves muslim or muslim religious issues, or that the syariah court seem more often than not to sentence in favour of the muslim, I say that it is not a god idea. Currently we do have a syariah court though. I remember it is in the same building as MCYS in thomson road.</p>
              <p>End of the day, do we really need two laws for one country? nyah....</p>
              <p>However, if when cases involves muslim religious issues or betweens muslims such as religious practices or marriage/divorce, then I wouldnt disagree that the syariah court be the abritor. After all, currently marriage and divorce of muslims are already under syariah court purview.</p>
