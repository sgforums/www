            <div class='col-md body'>I do not agree with all of the government's policies and certainly not all of LKY's ideas. His policy on graduate mothers was particularly daft in my opinion.<br><br>However, he has contributed much to the progress of Singapore to where we are today. In 1959 when Singapore obtained self-governance, Ceylon was ahead of us in many respects. In fact, the government sent a team there to learn from them.<br><br>Over these 40 years, Singapore has powered ahead into the first world whilst Sri Lanka had regressed to the 1950s. Their hospitals are practising a standard of medicine that a third world nation would be ashamed of. Hospitals that offered open-heart surgery in 1976 now cannot afford proper treatment to cancer patients. In one hospital in Jaffna, less than 1% of cancer patients actually get treatment. These figures were provided by a Sri Lanka academic who now works in the US.<br><br>It is for this reason that LKY is held in high regard by Sri Lankans:<br><br>http://www.theacademic.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=20335&amp;sid=3dfbad459bc08524e59d87ff356372e6#20335</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://fotw.vexillum.com/images/s/sg.gif"><br><br><span style="color: darkred;">How did the <a href="http://fotw.vexillum.com/flags/sg.html#coa" rel="nofollow"><strong>Singapore Flag</strong></a> evolved and what does the symbols mean ?</span><br><br><blockquote><br>The colours of the Singapore flag represent red for brotherhood and equality; white for purity and virtue. The crescent moon <strong>originally</strong> served as a symbol of assurance to the Malays in 1959 Â—the year the flag was designedÂ— that Singapore was not a Chinese state. Today it is generally said that the moon signified a young nation rising. The flag was designed <strong>initially</strong> to have three stars, until leaders such as then <strong>Deputy Prime Minister Toh Chin Chye</strong> expressed concern that Singapore might be perceived to have associations with the Malayan Communist Party, the flag of which also had three stars. The flag was originally <strong>meant to be red as red</strong> is a very traditional Chinese color. But because of the fear of Communism in those days, a completely red flag was abandoned.<br><br>Jan Oskar Engene, 26 January 1998<br><br>Remember that Singapore with its 80% Chinese majority has always been aware of its <strong>sensitive positioning</strong> with the 15 million Muslims of Malaysia just a few kilometres North and with the 170(?) million of Muslim Indonesians just South. It has always been necessary to soothe and placate. For the home crowd, the crescent was <strong>a little bit uneasy</strong> and it has always been emphasised that this was <strong>not representation of Islam</strong> but represent a country on the ascent. These days, the sensitivities and touchiness of the past can be examined more honestly and it is politically correct to say that the crescent was put in to <strong>placate</strong> the Malays.<br><br>Thomas W. Koh, 27 January 1998<br><br>From the <a href="http://www.expatsingapore.com/general/flag.htm" rel="nofollow"><strong>Expat Singapore</strong></a> website:<br><br>For 140 years (1819-1959), the Union Jack flew over Singapore. Then, on 3 December 1959, the National Flag, an important symbol of independence, was unveiled at the installation of the new Head of State, the Yang di-Pertuan Negara. Also unveiled that day were the State Crest and the National Anthem. The flag was conceived and created by a committee headed by the then <strong>Deputy Prime Minister, Dr Toh Chin Chye</strong>.<br><br>The Flag consists of two horizontal halves, red above white. Red symbolises <strong>universal brotherhood and equality of men</strong>; white, <strong>purity</strong> and <strong>virtue</strong>. In the upper left corner, a white crescent moon and five white stars form a circle. The crescent moon represents <strong>a young nation on the rise</strong>. The five stars stand for Singapore's ideals of <strong>democracy</strong>, <strong>peace</strong>, <strong>progress</strong>, <strong>justice</strong> and <strong>equality</strong><br></blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">How close has the POWER OF ONE come near to <strong>the ideals of the symbols of the Singapore Flag</strong> when exercising its powers that Singaporeans have entrusted to their care ?<br><br>1. <strong>RED - Universal brotherhood and equality</strong><br>On paper they seem to follow the principle of brotherhood and equality, but in its actions there is a certain degree of caution in dealing with a minority SINGAPOREAN ethnic group, as their genuine commitment to Singapore's interest will always be in doubt when the crunch comes.<br><br>2. <strong>WHITE - Purity and Virtue</strong><br>Has the POWER OF ONE been pure and virtuous in their political acts ?<br>Judging by the ruthless political persecution towards political opponents, the actions can hardly be considered pure nor virtuous.<br><br>3. <strong>Crescent Moon - Young Nation on the rise</strong><br>More like the rise of the POWER OF ONE over all in their realm, than the rise of Singaporeans as a Nation.<br><br>4. <strong>Star #1 - Democracy</strong><br>A dismal failure in keeping to this symbol - as Democracy is a word not respected by the POWER OF ONE.<br><br>5. <strong>Star #2 - Peace</strong><br>Although Peace have been kept internally and externally, the surface is calm under the best of circumstances, but the under water temperature remains brewing to boiling temperatures within the communities, and with our regional neighbors.<br><br>6. <strong>Star #3 - Progress</strong><br>Is there any progress, when social development leaves Singaporeans as poor as when we first started out ?<br><br>Can there be progress when the Quality of Life require Singaporeans to continue working into their late sixties and seventies ?<br><br>Some older Singaporeans may even have to sell their homes, in order to be able to continue to live independently till their twilight years end; while younger Singaporeans will be enslaved to the banking system the moment they graduate until they are into their late fifties.<br><br>7. <strong>Star #4 - Justice</strong><br>Can there be Justice when you are considered guilty until you can prove yourself to be innocent ?<br><br>Is there Justice, when there is one set of Justice for Political Trials and another<br>set for Commercial Transactions not affecting the State ?<br><br>Can there be Justice, when the court dispenses justice by keeping a close tab on the cost of time, material and labor expended ?<br><br>8. <strong>Star #5 - Equality</strong><br>Can Singapore Society achieve 'Equality' when even the most basic National Service to the Nation will see special groups of 'White Horses' taking a different path from those less fortunate ?</span><br><br><blockquote><a href="http://home.pacific.net.sg/~linachoo/singapore3.htm" rel="nofollow"><strong>The Pledge</strong></a><br><br><span class="large"><strong>THE PLEDGE</strong></span><br><strong>The Origin</strong><br>Initially penned by <strong>Mr S Rajaratnam</strong> in 1966, the Pledge was written against the backdrop of racial riots in the 1950s and 1960s. Mr Rajaratnam revealed that the dream was about building "a Singapore we are proud of". He believed that language, race and religion were divisive factors, but the Pledge emphasizes that these differences can be overcome if Singaporeans cared enough about their country. The draft text was handed to the then Prime Minister Mr Lee Kuan Yew, who polished the text before submitting it to the Cabinet.<br><br><strong>OUR PLEDGE</strong><br><br>We, the citizens of Singapore,<br>pledge ourselves as one united people,<br>regardless of race, language or religion,<br>to build a democratic society<br>based on justice and equality<br>so as to achieve happiness, prosperity and<br>progress for our nation.<br><br></blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">Has the POWER OF ONE come close to the words that is mechanically recited daily in schools, and recited proudly once a year as a Nation - when the heart will swell, but as the days fade that it will show that cynical actions are clearer than the words spoken and forgotten ?<br><br><strong>AFTER FORTY SEVEN YEARS</strong>, how close are we to building a Democratic Society based on Justice and Equality for ALL SINGAPOREANS ?<br><br>Is it any wonder that the other thread speaks about - "people worldwide is laughing at sg" ?<br></span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In all fairness, Singapore has achieved much over the last 47 years, unless we use The Perfect yardstick to measure, but that would be pure academic to say the least.<br><br>Relative to most, by and large, we have that sense of brotherhood and equality among the different races.  Certain degree of caution is sometimes necessary in dealing certain groups of people, either by ethnic group, religion or others. This was first seen in the way the Chinese chauvinists were handled in the 70s. Such caution does not constitute inequality, the lack of it is likely to destroy whatever equality we have.<br><br>47 years old is still very young as a country, whether it is run by PAP or not. But I donÂ’t see us changing the crescent into a full moon when we celebrate 100 years national day. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>We have had peace so far even when wars were fought nearby in Asia. A few boiling issues are bound to be present here and there with regional neighbors, but did we create the problem? Would we be able to handle should the temperature rises? I think we do. I donÂ’t think any Singaporean feel that war is imminent, even for the near future. Anybody feel any tension among any particular communities within Singapore? I donÂ’t.<br><br>On all other issues, we have achieved some, we have failed badly in others, there are still a lot more to do. We are angered by the political character assassination, but we also see now such an attempt backfire as we see more and more young and credible opposition coming forward. To me this is progress already. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>But whatever it is, progress or not, democratic or not, are we proud to be a Singaporean?? I met many Burmese, one of them are fighting against their government in BKK, you can criticize their government but they are proud to be Burmese, not Thai, though we canÂ’t tell the diff. I know many Philippino, they are not proud of their government, nor democracy, but you will not have them as friends if you donÂ’t respect The Philippines.<br><br>So what if somebody from down under write something to laugh at Singapore, do we agree and laugh at ourself?<br><br>The greatest challenge to the Singapore government, remains building a Singapore identity. The greatest failure of some Singaporean, is the lack of self identity, lack of self confidence, not proud to be Singaporean, donÂ’t see future in Singapore, but cannot migrate Â…Â….

The Swiss took over 100 yrs to achieve what they are today. GCT also set the target for Singapore soccer team to go into World Cup but I donÂ’t believe we will ever be there.<br><br>But we are better today than we were even 20 yrs ago. In some areas we have done well, in other areas we are worse, it is a moving targets as the needs of the people are diff at diff time.

Has the real issue been addressed or the situation allowed to simmer ? </span><br><br>In the kampong era, the sense of brotherhood were much stronger but were within the same ethnic group. Poverty did not prevent the clashes in 1967 and the problem in Malaysia was allowed to spill over and affected us. Today, the identity of Singaporean and the sense of brotherhood are demonstrated outside of Singapore, when we face people of all races in the region. In regional meetings we donÂ’t see Singaporean Malays grouping with the Malaysian Malays, nor the Singaporean Chinese with the Hong Kong Chinese.<br><br>Preserving oneÂ’s own ethnic identity and culture is not chauvinism.<br><br>The only false sense of calm and acceptance that exist now is that for the new immigrants.<br><br>To me ethnic and religious sensitivities are still very important considerations for every aspect of our life here. I can agree that ethnic and religious relationship here continue to require tender care, all Â“obvious reasonsÂ” you mentioned are just some of these tender care. After all, we are still young, arenÂ’t we? but I do not agree that there is any false sense of calm or tension. </strong></blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">The clashes of 1967 ? - or should it be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1969_Kuala_Lumpur,_Malaysia_Race_Riots" rel="nofollow"><strong>1964 riots or the May 13, 1969</strong></a> ?<br><br>The clash was not caused by poverty in Singapore (it was a Malaysian Issue ) , nor can poverty prevent the 1969 clashes; and who would have <strong>"allowed"</strong> the clashes to spill into Singapore (shown in your statement ) ?<br><br>The problem in Malaysia spilled over due to common historical base which the two countries share, and which was a carry over from the very venomous political rivalry for the hearts and minds of the people despite separation of Singapore from Malaysia.<br><br>Surely it is politically incorrect for any one in an official delegation to a International Forum, for the different ethnic groups from Singapore to group with there kinfolks from other countries<br><br>Why look at the International Stage, have you not read of the concern of the POWER OF ONE that at the Primary, Secondary and Tertiary levels of Singapore Education Centres, the different ethnic groups have no deep understanding nor intermingling with each other.<br><br>They tend to group according to their ethnic identity, <a href="http://sam11.moe.gov.sg/racialharmony/JC/stories_multiracialism.html" rel="nofollow"><strong>social integration</strong></a> is merely skin deep.<br><br>"Preserving oneÂ’s own ethnic identity and culture is not chauvinism" - unfortunately it becomes <strong>OBVIOUS CHAUVINISM</strong> when performed <strong>aggressively with a consumating push</strong> made at the expense of other MINORITY ethnic identities and cultures.<br><br><a href="http://www.ihrc.org.uk/show.php?id=776" rel="nofollow"><strong>Chauvinism exist</strong></a> when one Singaporean ethnic group is suspectfully disadvantaged, and alternative Singaporean ethnic groups are found to be more assuring, and are preferred to fill the sensitive positions of administration.<br><br>The superficial expressions at public gatherings hide the fact of deep seated "UNSPOKEN" unease towards the unfathomable minds of our own minority ethnic group - whose faith require them to place their God, their faith and their Religious Ties before all else.<br><br>The present calm and tolerance of the status quo is artificially imposed by the draconian law in place, and does not reflect the disquiet behind close doors.<br><br>There is no display of any natural integration of different ethnic groups at the neighborhood level without official sponsorship of organised community events.</span><br></div>
