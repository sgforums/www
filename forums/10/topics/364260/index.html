              <p><strong>Asia Sentinel, 15 Jun 2009, Siddharth Srivastava </strong><br> <br> <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Another scandal mars Indian defense </strong></span><br> <br> India's corruption-ridden military procurement system has again been
              hit by a major scandal that has resulted in the arrest of the chairman
              of the state-controlled Ordinance Factory Board and the banning of
              seven major domestic and international companies including ones from
              Singapore, Poland and Israel.<br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>The current scandal is reminiscent of one – also
              involving Singapore – that brought down the government of the late
              Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi</strong></span>, who, along with several others,
              was accused of receiving kickbacks from the Swedish arms maker Bofors
              AB and led to the defeat of the ruling Indian National Congress in
              November 1989 general elections.<br> <br> Similarly, Defense Minister George Fernandes was forced to step down in
              2001 after an Indian website released a secretly filmed video
              implicating senior officials in corrupt arms deals, energizing
              opposition parties to call for the entire government to quit.<br> <br> The latest controversy doesn't appear to be likely to bring down the
              government. In a strongly worded statement, Defense Minister A K Antony
              declared: "I will take strong action if any wrongdoing is detected. No
              one found guilty will be spared.<br> <br> The first victim is Gen. Sudipto Ghosh, the Ordinance Factory Board
              chairman, who has been arrested along with several others for taking
              bribes in exchange for defense contracts.<span style="color: red;"><strong> Although seven companies have been named by the Central Bureau of
              Investigation, India's version of the FBI, Israeli Military Industries
              (IMI) and Singapore Technologies are among the biggest, currently
              estimated to be negotiating contracts over Rs 60 billion (US$1.27
              billion).</strong></span><br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>Despite their size, Israel and Singapore rank among the world's biggest arms dealers. </strong></span>The
              Associated Press reported in 2007 that Israel ranked as the world's
              fourth-biggest arms dealer after the United States, Russia and France,
              selling US$4.3 billion in arms exports, primarily to the United States
              and India. .<br> <br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Singapore has been repeatedly identified as a channel for illicit arms sales.</strong></span></span> <span style="color: red;"><strong>In
              1995, Michael Heseltine, the former British Deputy Prime Minister,
              asked for an investigation into Royal Ordnance, formerly a state-owned
              arms maker, which allegedly was channeling arms <span style="text-decoration: underline;">through Singapore</span> to both Iran and Iraq.</strong></span><br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>In the 1980s, the Swedish government announced that all arms exports to Singapore had been frozen in an effort to<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> stop the island nation from being used as a possible channel for the unauthorized export of Swedish weapons.</span> Between 1980 and 1984, according to the Swedes, Unicorn International, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">an
              associate company of Chartered Industries of Singapore, which in turn
              was a subsidiary of an arm of Singapore's ministry of defense, bought
              304 missiles and 27 field sighting units from Bofors that were traced
              to the Middle East.</span></strong></span><br> <br> According to Mark Pythian in his book "Arming Iraq: How the US and Britain Secretly Built Saddam's War Machine," <span style="color: red;"><strong>"Nobel Kemi and Bofors, subsidiaries of Nobel Industries Sweden and member companies of EASSP,<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> arranged for arms shipments for Iran to be transferred through conduit countries, most notably Singapore.</span></strong></span> <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Singapore was the second-largest largest importer of Swedish arms and accounted for 14.4 percent of all Swedish arms exports.</span></span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Bofors
              sold Singapore artillery shells, 155mm guns, 40mm naval guns, and 70
              laser-guided anti-aircraft missiles that were later shipped to Iran."<br> </span></span></strong> <br> IMI, the manufacturer of the Uzi, arguably the world's most popular
              submachine gun, supplies most of the Indian military's small arms.
              Singapore Technologies manufactures the towed 155-milimeter howitzer
              among a variety of other weapons.<br> <br> "Ending (ST's) contract means that a major upgrade to the artillery
              equipment will have to end," said the website Bnet. "A whole new
              contract proposal and award process would have to be completed,
              seriously delaying the reequipping of the military with more modern and
              advanced artillery. This means that India may have to reconsider ending
              the contracts as they require the capability being provided."<br> <br> Two other Israeli companies possibly related to the inquiry, Israel
              Aerospace Industries and Rafael, were not blacklisted, the website
              said, as their contracts are considered so important to the
              modernization of India's military.<br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>The other offending companies named are Media Architects of Singapore </strong></span>and BVT Poland. The Indian companies are HYT Engineering, R K Machine Tools and T S Kishan Ltd.<br> <br> The CBI in its first information report stated that Ghosh vigorously
              pushed Israeli firms for defense-related purchases and entered into
              "criminal conspiracy" with a "private person and other accused" to
              demand and obtain "huge illegal gratification" for supply orders. New
              Delhi has thus put on hold all procurements and projects underway with
              the seven firms till CBI completes its probe into the alleged huge
              commissions.<br> <br> Sources say that the armed forces will now have to look for new
              suppliers of the defense equipment, critical to keep their arms
              updated. The contracts affected were between IMI and the Ordinance
              Board in March, worth around Rs 12 billion (US$252 million), to set up
              an ordnance complex at Nalanda in Bihar to manufacture propellant
              charges for artillery ammunition meant for Bofors howitzers.<br> <br> Blacklisted firms have not been allowed back into Indian defense
              contracts due to the political repercussions of such moves. The Nalanda
              complex has been a particular victim. In 2004 a South African firm,
              Denel, was blacklisted which then went into oblivion from the Indian
              scene. Denel had been originally sought for the construction of the
              Nalanda Ordinance factory, which also went into limbo.<br> <br> Similar has been the fate of the then-Swedish Bofors (now owned by BAE
              Systems), which was caught in the controversy involving commissions to
              middlemen that cost Gandhi his job. Despite India's desperate need for
              howitzers, Bofors has been unable to break back into the Indian
              scenario; the guns that were delivered have proved their mettle during
              the Kargil war between India and Pakistan in 1999.<br> <br> Officials say that given the latest moves to blacklist companies, IMI
              will be particularly impacted. It will certainly affect future
              Indo-Israeli defense ties, which now run into billions of dollars. In
              addition to the Uzi and Tavor 21 submachine gun, variants of which
              cater to the needs of the Indian forces, IMI supplies 125mm tank shells
              and manufactures Zitara carbines and cargo ammunition (a variant of
              cluster bombs).<br> <br> The Indian Defense Research and Development Organization (DRDO) was
              also to be assisted by IMI in the development of the long delayed
              indigenous Arjun tank for the Army. The OFB and IMI were also looking
              collaborate on the development of PB500 bombs capable of penetrating
              two-meter-thick concrete.<br> <br> Meanwhile, <span style="color: red;"><strong>ST was to supply Pegasus
              howitzers (140 air-mobile ultra-light ones) valued at nearly Rs30
              billion. The firm was also contending to win the Rs80 billion deal to
              sell 400 155mm/52-calibre towed artillery guns, along with transfer of
              technology for indigenous manufacture of 1,100 howitzers. </strong></span>The
              Pegasus howitzer was due for field testing in the western state of
              Rajasthan this summer. The guns are needed to be deployed in rural
              areas as well as along the India-Pakistan and India-China borders.<br> <br> Among the Indian firms blacklisted, T S Kishan Co was to supply spares
              and accessories for T-72 and T-90S main-battle tanks of the Indian
              Army; Pune-based HYT Engineering components of missiles produced within
              India and the Ludhiana-based R. K. Machine Tools spares for vehicles
              and machinery produced by state unit Bharat Earth Movers.<br> <br> Observers say that the latest scandal and blacklistings will certainly
              impact India's defense modernization efforts, one of the largest
              globally, pegged at over US$50 billion between 2007 and 2012 aimed at
              building an immediate strike force against Pakistan and longer term
              deterrence against China.<br> <br> In a report last year, the Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry
              of India said the country over three years (2004-7), spent US$10.5
              billion on military imports, making it amongst the largest arms
              importers in the developing world.<br> <br> Last month the IAF inducted the first of the three Israeli Phalcon
              AWACS, India's most potent force multiplier, capable of tracking down
              incoming missiles and can keep an ``eye'' on neighboring nations
              without infringing airspace. India is paying US$1.1 billion for the
              three AWACS.<br> <br> Another system India recently purchased from Israel for US$600 million
              are aerostat radars to also spot surreptitious guerilla attacks such as
              the one in Mumbai wherein the attackers used dingy boats to infiltrate
              the city. New Delhi has also signed a US$1.4 billion deal with Israel
              to purchase a 70 km shore-based and sea borne anti-missile air defense
              system. <br> <br> -------------------------<br> <span style="color: navy;"><strong>Latest at <a href="http://singaporenewsalternative.blogspot.com/">Singapore News Alternative</a>:</strong><br> <br> 1.
