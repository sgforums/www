            <div class='col-md body'>yeah but what he said about chinese service providers is true too, malays do a better job, and they do with a smile, chinese always laugh and say malays can't work, but actually its the chinese who mostly don't put in effort when they think the job in beneath them<br>if its so bad why they want the job in the first place <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br>btw i'm chinese but i have a better opinion of malays where service sector is concern<br>i going to buy those "sotong balls" tml night but from the malay stall cos better service, the chinese auntie's attitude suck! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"> dun buy from her at the jurong point pasar malam![/b][/quote]<br><br>actually i agree that malays are more friendly, infact when i go jalan kayu for prata, the ah neh there also very friendly. But there are also nice chinese waiter/ waitress around. Places like Coffee Club, some of the cafe cartels have quite nice service too.<br><br>I feel that it's TRUE that Singapore don't have a high service standard and most of the time, we feel so not worth paying for service charge. But the bottom line is, we keep an open mind about it. Maybe next time when we dine out, make a point to TEKAN the bad apples, and COMPLIMENT those good ones. But please don't discrimanate the entire service industry because of some bad bad ppl.<br><br>Enjoy your sotong balls</div>

Auntie screamed at my mom for not ordering properly. WTF, you can always serve the order to the next customer. So she unwillingly say that the chicken will cost $6, take it or leave it...<br><br>I was quite upset by the fact she yelled at my mom infront of all the customers... but how much can we ask for?</div>

Nasty, Ugly Singaporeans ain't as much as most of us think. There is still a certain group but considered much better compared to the past. The thing about employing Malaysians to work in F&amp;B is also quite a headache. As understood, they learn Malay as mother tounge, so their english command is quite low. but most malaysians are willing to work the hours and do all the hardwork. their stamina can be really amazing compared to locals. I have to admit that most locals can't take hardship especially the younger generations. Mostly they feel that they deserve better rather to work the long hours and have to humble themselves to serve others.<br><br>There are still ppl who take pride in their job but it's getting lesser. Honestly, i felt very insulted and dishearten when "Typhoon" posted the thread about his/ her views. Most of my co- workers felt angry too. But it takes everyone to understand that in every industry, no sector is perfect. Just that F&amp;B, compared to other trades is underpaid, over worked. Even when goverment tries to encourage ppl to try F&amp;B when retrenchment, ppl are really reluctant. Those who did try, couldn't adapt well from a 9-5 switch to long hours, weekend burn. Can't blame them. Those who are in the industry, struggling to do their job, ain't appreciated that much. Good one didn't get compliment, Bad ones hit the news.... OUCH!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>honestly, this topic about service standard in S'pore can be never ending. I just want to empahsis that SERVICE is not about nationality, race or religion. It's just a different sector/ industry that we have to interact with daily.<br><br>Like i'd posted on the previous page. Someone can start a thread about service and we can post our good/ bad comments/ experience, so companies/ ppl concerned can read and do something. this is the least we can do. Don't discriminate... Encourage the positive.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Being a tourist attraction, Sentosa should have maintained at least a clean physical outlook. If it was true that eating utensils were left cluttering the eating areas long after the users have left, there must be something wrong with the quality of service there. How can it maintain a positive reputation if it cannot even provide clean serviceable areas for the tourist?<br><br>Regarding the quality of service by retailers and other establishments, the onus is upon the service providers to produce the best performance for their customers. And that means turning around a dissatisfied or even an angry customer into a loyal one who would keep turning back to them for repeat businesses. That should be the desired attitude. If a customer is rude to the front-liners, they should keep their calm, and deal with them politely. It is an inevitability that these people bear the brunt for any mistakes made by the corporation, since they are the only contact point the customers have to address their grievences. Remember, errors will be made, and people do get angry. It is how one handles the problem that makes him a good or bad front-liner.<br><br>I prefer to be polite to any customer service officers that I talk to. Not only is it a break from the drudery of angry complaints, it also makes them more willing to aid me with my problem. So far, I've nothing that I can't resolve by being polite.</div>
