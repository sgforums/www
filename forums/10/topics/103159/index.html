They used to look down on the mainland Chinese but now they change their attitude because their business depends on these Chinese, not the japs or the guai-lou.<br>Comparatively standard of service in Singapore is really appalling, sad to say. Apparently singaporean have attitude problem to serve and be served.</div>

MAYBE u haven't been to other countries yet? I've been in France, UK, US, and their service in these places are mostly exceptional. I certainly haven't had ppl screaming "go home u bloody chink" to me either. Ppl I've met in the service sector, be it large franchise restaurants, small alehouses, pubs, family diners, cafes or supermarkets, all go out of their way to be polite, friendly, helpful and accomodating. Perhaps sinagoreans should really learn to examine why other ppl say what they say about us, instead of getting defensive everytime n start yelling "why don't they look at themselves 1st", because, the truth is, IF they HAD looked at themselves 1st and then talk about us, we're gonna fall MUCH FURTHER down the scale. Be thankful that they r as lenient as they r now. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

One of them is maximise the return to the share holders only (overlooking the bigger picture to Singapore).<br><br>That sound the end of the Haw Par Villa - first, very popular with free entry, then start to sky high tickets (reason with addition of high tech attractions), reduction of tickets price, then today, it is a no visitor land although the entry fee is free now.<br><br>In the beginning many visitors to Singapore were attracted by Haw Par Villa, now no visitor to Singaqore can say they come because of Haw Par Villa.<br><br>How to prevent Sentosa falling into the same state as Haw Par Villa.  Sentosa had already gone through the same stages - in the biginning very popular, sky high tickets, reduction in tickets price.........<br><br>Sentosa should not be disigned for rich man and tourist only with high ticket price and the only consideration is maximise the return to the share holder (Government).  I think the up market Sentosa Cove Residential Development, Casino etc are not in the right direction (which are out of bound for the general Singaporean).</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think that the government is just the landlord.whatever the casino does over there is the casino's problem. The building of the Casino is completely undertaken by the casino company itself. Even if the casino loses money i think it is also not the government's fault. They will still demand rent. So...We're just concerned if the government is going to relax its rules when there isnt enough millionaires to patronise the casino, as well as if the social problems will be much more than the economic benefits itself.</div>

I once ordered a whole chicken with 5 packets of rice but at last minute I said too expensive and walked away. I could hear him kao peh kao bu at the back. The other times, I brought a friend there and then pretended we wanted to order and at last min I said too expensive and walked away. I think now he recognises me. I am on the look out for cockcroaches in those stalls that jack up prices. sure report to MOE if i see any.<br><br>There must be thousands of chicken rice stalls in singapore. In serangoon garden there are at least 6 stalls and restaurants. I can still get chicken rice at 2.50. KFC is really very expensive leh.</div>
