Handling unreasonable customers are part of our daily lives and so wat?</blockquote>this observation was not made by me, but by several people I've talked to as well. The difference in general between service given by Chinese and Malays is that Chinese are more cold towards you. Its because they're hao lian, which proves my point that service in Singapore is lousy because you lot are arrogant bastards.<br><br><blockquote>then again, it's a mutual thing. if the service industry in sinapore is incapable of handling unreasonable ppl, then in the first place, why are these group of unreasonable ppl making life miserable for ppl?</blockquote>Service people have every right to be indignant when abused by a customer... but the problem in Singapore is that the service industry people are so arrogant, they let this affect their work, giving sloppy service to others. This shows poor discipline, lack of commiment to the job, a couldn't be bothered attitude, and disgraces their establishment and country. In other countries, they get abused by customers, but they put personal feelings aside. Not like Com'on lar, don't be childish to agrue this kind of thing. We all have bad experience at certain restaurant, BUT we MUST have also met nice servers.Singaporeans, who wear their emotions on their sleeve. If they don't like you they will show it on their face.<br><br>Singapore customers treat you lot like that because you deserve it. If service was better, there would be less need to be abusive and the incidence of abusive customers will drop through good handling by the staff. As it is, bad service staff still outnumber bad customers, explain that one.<br><br>Singapore also lacks staff who are willing to go the extra mile. I accept the fact that disgruntled service people give bad service. But even when they are not having PMS, they won't even lift a farking finger to help you. In Hong Kong (!) of all places, if you walk into a shop which has sold out of the things you want, the counter clerk will run to another shop in Kowloon to get you your goods. You think this will happen in Singapore? It shows how far we have slided.<br><br><blockquote>Did it ever occur to you MOST SINGAPOREANS CANNOT TAKE HARDSHIP???? </blockquote>Yes... thus the service in Singapore is crap.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br><blockquote><br>in this industry for 7 yrs.... not once being yelled by customer, plenty of compliments, lots of regular customers.

I don't come from kampong, and I keep a open mind about very thing in this world. Only mountain turtles and foul mouth cancerous infected pigs speak like you. Gosh, so worried my kid will be sitting next to you in class, wonder what kind of language you use...<br><br>Who is speaking sense, it's not for you or me to judge. It's for ppl who read the thread and they decide themselves.<br><br>As for the walk away without paying.... i really love to see you try at my restaurant.<br><br>This topic was started to discuss about service standards in Singapore, not for you to start cursing around with your very rude and foul mouth.<br><br>I am so glad that in my life of working in F&amp;B, i have yet to come across such person like you. Even my folks with high respect from the society, does not look down on ppl from F&amp;B, you this KID who haven't even seen the world, probably still taking money from MAMA, dare to look down on ppl.<br><br>GOSH, what's the world becoming?</div>
