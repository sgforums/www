Am I rite?</blockquote>No I said it depends on their roles, and right now, it doesn't seem like they are merely advisers. As you would say, they are like the PM's 'representatives', out to handle the dirty work for the PM (like resolving the Alpa-S dispute).<br><br>If MM was really acting as an advisor, he would've sat in on the negotiations and let the Minister for Manpower handle the talking, only interrupting to ensure there is a smooth flow and that discussions stay on topic.<br><br>So I think it is only right that SM and MM be elected posts, not nominated ones. At least that way, they are still accountable to the people.</div>

Your view.</div></blockquote>For a parliamentary system, or democracy to work efficiently and effectively, there has to be safeguard against tyranny by those in power through legalistic controls and gerrymandering. Of the three realms of government, now only the executive has power with judiciary and legislative playing second fiddles.<br><br>This aspect of our governing system is an undesirable part of our system. This part has to evolve to a more satisfactory balance and check system.<br><br>In our case, the basic laws relating to the proper coordination and smooth functioning of our democracy or parliamentary democracy has been overriden by a strong executive through all kind of legalistic gerrrymandering of existing laws which effectively render the constitution a dead document.<br><br>Now the executive is the over-domineering branch of government which runs all areas of the government to its wishes and desires to serve the narrower agenda of the party in power. The system is losing its objectivity, accountability and transparency. People are losing their rights to offer views and opinions resulting in many problems.<br><br>In our system, the various parties are not working together but are contending with laws passed by the more powerful executives. We have no way to check on gerrymandering of laws from GRC to Sedition Act and self-approval of ministers' inflated salaries and retirement gratuities. More are coming like upgrading of HDB estates priority to citizens who are loyal to the government.<br><br>Under this sort of circumstance, it is not quite a good idea to give the leaders additional powers to appoint outside parties to hold executive powers like the MMs or SMs. There will be more gerrymandering with more powers to the few in power leading to corruptions and nepotism which is the greatest danger of all.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I really do respect some of the older guards of the PAP. People like George Yeo, Teo Chee Hian.. But what I don't understand is why the they were overlooked for Prime Minister duty. Singaporeans should be allowed to vote for Prime Minister approval, even though he is the only candidate.</div>

Hence their pay must be high so that it justified their post..if they are able to earn more for singaporean..Why stop or prevent. However, I am asking for SM to be appointed instead of elected MPs. As we know Fulltime MP are more concerned with our daily surrounding..Unlike Ministers where they are doing things much more demanding. Hence we shall tried all means to retain those that retired to be SM and even considered some of the existing one to be SM so that they can continue to serve singapore regardless they are elected MP or no. Why take the chances on talents...it's a loss to us if they cannot serve..<br><br>Hence, appointing SM is good for everyone.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br></div></blockquote>Well, if u really want them, then at least they should be made fully non-partisan i.e. drop out of PAP when they become SMs, or selse the political field will be skewed even further towards them. And btw, why not include CST as an SM too? hmm... he is nearly as old as MM.<br><br>But seriously, I think a first-world country does not need SMs and MMs, because first-world MPs should be able to manage on their own without any help whatsoever. And besides, like I said earlier, times change and we ahve to change along with them. older SMs and MMs will be resistant to change, and this will be detrimental to the nation's future growth.<br><br>cheers,<br>the pikamaster (who salutes GMS and frowns at Gomez)</div>
