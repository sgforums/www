Right here, we do things our way and if you don't like it, then too bad. As i said again, we are just normal forumites trying to post our own views, and our own styles.

My friend greengoblin told me that he once totally uppercut someone just because he advertised Shit on his forum.<br><br>Thats what I call REAL ULTIMATE POWER!!!!!!<br><br>If you dont believe that mods have REAL ULTIMATE POWER, you'd better get a life right now, or else greengoblin will go to your house when he is drunk. and I dunno what he will do when he is drunk. btw mods are always drunk, dont Fuck with them, they have guns and Shit. it's an easy choice, if you ask me.<br><br>Questions and ANswers:<br>Q: why is everyone so obssessed with mods?<br>A: mods are the ultimate paradox, on one hand they take care of forums, on the other hand, they spam and shout vulgarities.<br><br>Q: why dont mods uphold any moral standards and scold vulgar words all the time? whats their problem?<br>A: who ever told you that is a total jackass, mods uphold their moral standards all the time, though the standard might be very low.<br><br>Q: what do mods do besides scolding vulgarities?<br>A: most of their time is spent spamming Shit, but sometimes they ban people. (ask FireIce if you dont believe me)<br></div></blockquote>wah spot on!!! bulls eye!!! Except i haven't tasted alcohol all my life. But other then that, yup thats the life of a mod.</div>
