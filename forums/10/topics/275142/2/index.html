You can withdraw your CPF savings when you are 55 years old, provided you leave behind what is known as the minimum sum. From 55 years to 62 (going to be raised to 67) you will not get anything from CPF. when you hit 62, the CPF board will start repaying whatever (the min sum + interest earned from 55 to 62years) remaining sum you have, in monthly installments over the next 20 years(untill 82 years).<br><br>For eg at 55 you have 200k in your CPF, and say the minimum sum is 90k. Which means you can withdraw 110k and leave the min sum 90k behind. when you are 62 years this 90K+ interest will be payed over 20 years (375/m).<br><br>The amounts that i have used might not be accurate but i hope you get the picture.<br><br></div>
