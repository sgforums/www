            <div class='col-md body'>Many say PM Lee addressed difficult issues confronting Singaporeans<br>Channel NewsAsia - Monday, August 20SINGAPORE: Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's speech at the National Day Rally on Sunday has been described as substantive.<br><br>Mr Lee brought up various issues in his most important address of the year � from new measures to narrow the widening income gap to specific initiatives to help the ageing population, to new initiatives in education.<br><br>Many in the audience said the Prime Minister took the bull by the horns and addressed some of the most difficult issues confronting ordinary Singaporeans.<br><br>"I think every citizen is involved in today's speech. He's really touched everyone - young, elderly, middle-aged, whoever,� commented community leader Sarjit Singh.<br><br>A junior college student, Goh Li Jie, said, "Now with three universities, (we have) tight schedule with limited scope. But with a fourth university� chances of us getting in (are) quite high."<br><br>To NTUC assistant secretary-general Halimah Yaacob, "I think the most important message he has put across is that Singaporeans need to work longer and that the government will do its best to support Singaporeans in their effort by making sure there are jobs available."<br><br>Gerard Ee, chairman of the Council for the Third Age, agreed. "If your lifespan is expected to go to 80 and beyond, that is 20 to 25 years to the traditional retirement and that is a very long time to live doing nothing. So those with opportunities to do so should be meaningfully engaged."<br><br>Among the audience, for the first time, were opposition MPs.<br><br>Chiam See Tong, MP for Potong Pasir said, "The CPF one per cent increase in interest rate will be welcomed by people. But (for the) delay in drawing down the CPF money from 62 to 65, I think the government will have to do a lot convincing the people."<br><br>Most MPs believed the speech has put all the signs in place, so it is now their turn to explain the details to their constituents.<br><br>"These things are not easy to digest and I think Singaporeans will need time to digest. There are positive steps but (they) will need a lot of explanation," said South West Community Development Council Mayor Amy Khor. - CNA/ac<br><br><span style="color: darkblue;">The above is from govt controlled TV station.</span><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>how come he don't answer the most difficult question:<br><br>"Why do we still have to work till 65 when we taxpayers have the highest paid ministers in this galaxy to run our economy?"<br><br>He said we have to work longer because we are going to live longer and we will not have enough to spend for old age ...so, when is he going to raise the CPF contribution rate back to 20%?  Rather than raising interest rate by 1%, why don't he push up the contribution rate back to 20%?<br><br>He said we have to buy annuities in order to have sufficient to grow old - yeah we know, but please ask why don't we have enough in the first place, we are not supposed to withdraw until 55 / 65 so what is the issue?  The issue is, our pay are too low thats why we don't have enough for retirement.  Why is the government making it mandatory for us to buy annuities - they worried that we cannot manage our own money??  I am sure NTUC will have their hands and feet deeply involved in selling annuities.  The catch with annuities is, although you are promised a monthly payment as long as you live, but if you die soon, the rest goes, your son cannot inherit...so who benefit?  Government??<br><br>And the best irony is, by making annuities compulsary, is the gahmen saying we Singaporeans are clueless in managing our money and that the gahmen has to do it for us?  Then why is he suggesting to build a 4th uni to cater for more graduates?  Contradicting leh, one hand say we are immature on the other hand say we should have more graduates.<br><br></div>
