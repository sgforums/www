              <p class="times">LHASA, China -- Tibet has long gripped the Western imagination as an exotic Shangri-La isolated by soaring mountains, brutal winters and gasp-inducing thin air. Recently, it has also captured the Chinese, who come to glimpse Buddhist pilgrims prostrating themselves on their way to holy sites.</p>
              <p class="times">Encouraged by their government, some Chinese have come to the highlands in recent years seeking something else: a better life as pioneers in China's West. Recent turmoil serves as a reminder that their presence isn't welcome by many Tibetans.</p>
              <p class="times">Wang Ruilin came to Lhasa from his hometown in coastal Shandong nine months ago. He borrowed 60,000 yuan, about $8,500, from friends and family and opened a small restaurant selling noodles and dumplings.</p>
              <p class="times">Now, his business is little more than a pile of shattered memories covered in broken glass, tinged with the smell of burnt wood and plastic that hangs over parts of the city. "I lost it all," he says, picking through the rubble.</p>
              <p class="times">Many Tibetans have long resented the wave of migrants changing their culture and competing for jobs. On March 14, their anger erupted into two days of violent protests that have unhinged the uneasy calm between China and Tibet.</p>
              <p class="times">Protests started around the Ramoche Temple in Lhasa's old Tibetan quarter about noon, when monks, sealed in by police after earlier demonstrations, mounted rooftops and started pelting nearby buildings. A middle school, attended mostly by Tibetan children who are also taught Chinese, caught fire. Soon, crowds started smashing shops, including many run by Han Chinese and a Muslim minority, known as Hui. Banks, department stores and government offices were burned down in an area several blocks wide.</p>
              <p class="times">China's government says 22 people were killed, most of them civilians; Tibetan exiles put the number at 140. Hundreds have been arrested. Monks remain essentially under house arrest.</p>
              <p class="times">"They ruined people's livelihoods, they burned a school, they destroyed stores," says Xie Dayou, a police officer who came from Sichuan province 20 years ago.</p>
              <p class="times">Waving a trembling, bandaged hand, he describes how he and other police were surrounded by Tibetans, pelted with stones and attacked with broken bottles. He says the violence was far worse than anything he had seen, including protests by monks in 1989, the last major anti-China unrest here. Still, he says, he won't leave; "This is my hometown."</p>
              <p class="times">Wu Qiangyou says he came from Henan province, in central China. His taxi's windows were smashed. "I can't sell my car; no one would buy it," he says. "And if I don't drive, I lose 100 yuan a day. I used to have Tibetan friends and felt pretty good about them. Not anymore."</p>
              <p class="times">He says many of his Chinese friends are leaving, but he will stay. "I can't believe something like this happened," he says.</p>
              <p class="times">Late last week, tensions remained high. The police presence in the Tibetan quarter was heavy. Most shops in the narrow, winding stone alleyways were shut.</p>
              <p class="times">In a rare open restaurant, a sign in English promised food for lacto-ovo vegetarians, a sign of the eco-leaning tourists who often visit. There were no customers. Outdoor-goods stores were shut, too, as were most hotels, despite government assurances that Tibet is open to tourists.</p>
              <p class="times">People seemed uneasy. One foreigner declined to talk long to a reporter. "Don't believe what they tell you," she said before rushing off. "What my Tibetan friends have told me would make you sick to your stomach."</p>
              <p class="times">About four million travelers, mostly domestic tourists, visited Tibet in 2007, up from fewer than a million in 2003, the trip made easier by the building of the world's highest train line two years ago.</p>
              <p class="times">For many Han Chinese, Tibet appeals as an exotic yet accessible destination. With its cultural and spiritual traditions, it has become a haven for Han Chinese artists, writers and intellectuals looking for an alternative to materialistic modern China.</p>
              <p class="times">For those willing to move, China promises subsidies, tax exemptions, education credits and preferential consideration for government jobs. In 2005, the Tibet government offered a 2,000-yuan bonus to students from big-name universities. Soldiers stationed here get 2.5 times the normal pay, for what is considered a hardship post.</p>
              <p class="times">There is debate about how many Han Chinese have taken up the offers. Official figures show that at least 94% of the province's 2.81 million people are indigenous rather than ethnic Han, who dominate China's population. On the ground in Lhasa, though, the population of ethnic Han appears to be growing quickly, topping indigenous Tibetans, by some estimates.</p>
              <p class="times">Outside experts have no doubt that China has made huge strides to address Tibet's poverty, from funding schools and paying for medics to visit remote villages to electrifying areas. Signs of growth are everywhere, although Lhasa's mix of stores and concrete housing blocks looks drearily similar to other fast-growing Chinese cities.</p>
              <p class="times">For Ma Chuanming, a Muslim Hui who left a life as a poor farmer in Gansu province, Tibet promised a better life. After looters struck his store on the first day of riots, he and his family moved to a government building. They watched as smoke rose from the direction of their shop, which burned down.</p>
              <p class="times">He says he will rebuild. "I'm not afraid, it doesn't matter where you go, something bad could happen," Mr. Ma says."</p>

              <p>LHASA, China -- Tibet has long gripped the Western
              imagination as an exotic Shangri-La isolated by soaring mountains,
              brutal winters and gasp-inducing thin air. Recently, it has also
              captured the Chinese, who come to glimpse Buddhist pilgrims
              prostrating themselves on their way to holy sites.</p>
              <p>Encouraged by their government, some Chinese have come
              to the highlands in recent years seeking something else: a better
              life as pioneers in China's West. Recent turmoil serves as a
              reminder that their presence isn't welcome by many Tibetans.</p>
              <p>Wang Ruilin came to Lhasa from his hometown in coastal
              Shandong nine months ago. He borrowed 60,000 yuan, about $8,500,
              from friends and family and opened a small restaurant selling
              noodles and dumplings.</p>
              <p>Now, his business is little more than a pile of
              shattered memories covered in broken glass, tinged with the smell
              of burnt wood and plastic that hangs over parts of the city. "I
              lost it all," he says, picking through the rubble.</p>
              <p>Many Tibetans have long resented the wave of migrants
              changing their culture and competing for jobs. On March 14, their
              anger erupted into two days of violent protests that have unhinged
              the uneasy calm between China and Tibet.</p>
              <p>Protests started around the Ramoche Temple in Lhasa's
              old Tibetan quarter about noon, when monks, sealed in by police
              after earlier demonstrations, mounted rooftops and started pelting
              nearby buildings. A middle school, attended mostly by Tibetan
              children who are also taught Chinese, caught fire. Soon, crowds
              started smashing shops, including many run by Han Chinese and a
              Muslim minority, known as Hui. Banks, department stores and
              government offices were burned down in an area several blocks
              wide.</p>
              <p>China's government says 22 people were killed, most of
              them civilians; Tibetan exiles put the number at 140. Hundreds have
              been arrested. Monks remain essentially under house arrest.</p>
              <p>"They ruined people's livelihoods, they burned a
              school, they destroyed stores," says Xie Dayou, a police officer
              who came from Sichuan province 20 years ago.</p>
              <p>Waving a trembling, bandaged hand, he describes how he
              and other police were surrounded by Tibetans, pelted with stones
              and attacked with broken bottles. He says the violence was far
              worse than anything he had seen, including protests by monks in
              1989, the last major anti-China unrest here. Still, he says, he
              won't leave; "This is my hometown."</p>
              <p>Wu Qiangyou says he came from Henan province, in
              central China. His taxi's windows were smashed. "I can't sell my
              car; no one would buy it," he says. "And if I don't drive, I lose
              100 yuan a day. I used to have Tibetan friends and felt pretty good
              about them. Not anymore."</p>
              <p>He says many of his Chinese friends are leaving, but he
              will stay. "I can't believe something like this happened," he
              says.</p>
              <p>Late last week, tensions remained high. The police
              presence in the Tibetan quarter was heavy. Most shops in the
              narrow, winding stone alleyways were shut.</p>
              <p>In a rare open restaurant, a sign in English promised
              food for lacto-ovo vegetarians, a sign of the eco-leaning tourists
              who often visit. There were no customers. Outdoor-goods stores were
              shut, too, as were most hotels, despite government assurances that
              Tibet is open to tourists.</p>
              <p>People seemed uneasy. One foreigner declined to talk
              long to a reporter. "Don't believe what they tell you," she said
              before rushing off. "What my Tibetan friends have told me would
              make you sick to your stomach."</p>
              <p>About four million travelers, mostly domestic tourists,
              visited Tibet in 2007, up from fewer than a million in 2003, the
              trip made easier by the building of the world's highest train line
              two years ago.</p>
              <p>For many Han Chinese, Tibet appeals as an exotic yet
              accessible destination. With its cultural and spiritual traditions,
              it has become a haven for Han Chinese artists, writers and
              intellectuals looking for an alternative to materialistic modern
              China.</p>
              <p>For those willing to move, China promises subsidies,
              tax exemptions, education credits and preferential consideration
              for government jobs. In 2005, the Tibet government offered a
              2,000-yuan bonus to students from big-name universities. Soldiers
              stationed here get 2.5 times the normal pay, for what is considered
              a hardship post.</p>
              <p>There is debate about how many Han Chinese have taken
              up the offers. Official figures show that at least 94% of the
              province's 2.81 million people are indigenous rather than ethnic
              Han, who dominate China's population. On the ground in Lhasa,
              though, the population of ethnic Han appears to be growing quickly,
              topping indigenous Tibetans, by some estimates.</p>
              <p>Outside experts have no doubt that China has made huge
              strides to address Tibet's poverty, from funding schools and paying
              for medics to visit remote villages to electrifying areas. Signs of
              growth are everywhere, although Lhasa's mix of stores and concrete
              housing blocks looks drearily similar to other fast-growing Chinese
              cities.</p>
              <p>For Ma Chuanming, a Muslim Hui who left a life as a
              poor farmer in Gansu province, Tibet promised a better life. After
              looters struck his store on the first day of riots, he and his
              family moved to a government building. They watched as smoke rose
              from the direction of their shop, which burned down.</p>
              <p>He says he will rebuild. "I'm not afraid, it doesn't
              matter where you go, something bad could happen," Mr. Ma says."</p>
