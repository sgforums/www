            <div class='col-md body'><p>I second that Fatum. While several territories of western nations today were extensions of their imperialistic past, utilizing this past and equating these seperatist movements with the same seperatist movements in Tibet  is making a comparison between two very different situations. If one is to forward such a train of thought, one can even go to the extent of accusing the United States, Canada, Australia and all the nations in South America for marginalizing their original natives and taking their land. Similar, the same can be said for Asian countries like China, how can China justify the Han dominance over Hui, Manchu, Miao and Tibetian land? My point is taking a point in history where the context was very different from today's events and utilizing it to point to the injustices to the native people through time is just absurd. Rather, we have to take things in today's context. In western countries today, the issue is the marginalization of native people. In Canada, questions have been raised as to why the internment rate for the native people is so much higher than other sectional groups in society. Has enough been put into social programs for native people?  Of course, the past do remind us as to why we have an obligation to society to rewrite the wrongs that have been done.This is not to say seperatist movements are not justifiable. Anyone, with enough support and justification, has the right to organize a seperatist movement. Even within America, there are militia groups which are organized calling for the seperatie on of certain states from the Union. If their intentions are peaceful and democratic, their actions are largely tolerated. As Fatum has pointed out, they have been referendums to decide on the status of terrirtories calling for seperatism. In Quebec, they No side only won by less than 1 per cent of the vote and if the Yes side had won, Quebec would have been a seperate nation from Canada. Can the same by said for China? Who has over the past fifty years been forcibly inplanting Han people into Tibet to alter the demographics and when the going gets tough forcibly clamp down with the use of arms on their own people? There are seperatist movements in both the west and China, but the dichotemy each sets of movements face are very telling. It is not hypocritical for western nations who possess imperialistic pasts from pressuring the Chinese to stop the atrocities that are ongoing in Tibet, for it is the right thing to do for the sake of Tibetians who are being persecuted by the unethical Chinese juggernaut, who is failing to recognize it's imperialistic past and do the right thing.</p></div>

              <p>China is no longer in the stage whereby the government can force the people to stay according to their ethnic. The British colonist has used this method before, to group malay at certain kampungs, chinese at certain towns and Indians somewhere. This is proved to damage the unity of the people and definitely does no good to the country as a whole.<br>Not only China didn't do what the british colonist has done, I think the whole world is not using this method.<br>The only exception is Israel that forcibly chase away the palestinian from their house and let the israelis occupy them.</p>

              <p>The fact that such websites are hosted in the US and that no Free Tibetan websites are hosted in China does not in any way detract from the legitimacy of the claim I made, which merely is that such movements exist.

              <p>if the US is perfect, then the chaps here wouldn't have had the chance to use Iraq as an excuse for what china is doing now, right ?, lol ...... no one has yet answered me directly to the question, can a bully point fingers at another even bigger bully, in defense of what the first bully is doing to other people ? ... do you think screaming "not fair"at other people absolve the first bully of anything the first bully has done ? ...16th time now ....</p>
              <p>pointing fingers at other country's history doesn't absolve one of any wrong doing, but, is that an implicit acknowledgement of guilt ? ... to compare oneself to another bully ? ...</p>
              <p>"Oh, look at other countries persecuting their own people, ... so why are you screaming at me for doing what other people had all done before ? ... "..... </p>
              <p>the above sounds rather wrong, put this way, right ? ....  I dunno how "asian" culture has been corrupted in other countries, but I was taught never to learn from the bad behaviour of others .... a lesson that seems to be absent in some over here ....</p>
              <p>and to those people who likes to scream about media bias .... remember again ... many of those examples you've pointed out, free quebec, free puerto rico .. were not banned outright in their countries of origin .. but are allowed to contest freely in elections in their respective countries ... their leaders are not forced into exile, their websites are not blocked in their respective countries, they hold conventions and rallies and canvass for political support right there in their "home countries", and their supporters are not met with bullets .... look at some of the links the fellows have given. ... the mainstream western media themselves, which some of the fellows here have so openly derided, have covered their side of the stories ... I wonder if this irony was noted by these chaps .... to talk about western media bias on one hand, and to quote them on the next ? ... perhaps there's yet again, more confusion on their parts ? ....</p>
              <p>again I ask ... nevermind the guns and bullets now ...  do you see similar privileges being accorded to the tibetans ? ... but of course, again  .. when even citizens of China itself doesn't really get to enjoy that privilege, it is, perhaps, too much to ask for the natives of an occupied land huh ....</p>
