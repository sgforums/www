              <p>There are still some people who say 'Chinese Opression' or 'Sending/ flooding Han Chinese into Tibet'.</p>
              <p>I ask something....</p>
              <p>What is this so-called Chinese opression...?</p>
              <p>Do u know in China, ethnic minorities actually enjoy some positive priviledges compared to majority Han Chinese..?</p>
              <p>For instance 1 child policy is not applied to them.</p>
              <p>Welfare payment, and assistance is easier for them.</p>
              <p>I wonder what is this so-called 'Chinese opression' kept being said by some people. What is this Chinese Opression..? Have u been to Tibet?</p>
              <p>My sister just 1 year ago or so, visited Tibet together with her husband, my brother in law.</p>
              <p>Tibet is a normal place, a tourist place. Local Tibetans are living there as usual, working, going to school, and interacting with tourists. Everything is normal. Just very common.</p>
              <p>'Chinese Opression' ?</p>
              <p>Dont make a joke please.</p>
              <p>Not only are they treated with special priviledge, Chinese government has poured alot of money to build Tibet and improve its economy and well-being of the people.</p>
              <p>One particular special example is the train, the highest train that cost alot of money to build, to improve the infrastucture because Tibet is an isolated interior, a  poor place. Hopefully it can bring positive impact for Tibet.</p>
              <p>If you look at this....how can you say....this is called 'Chinese Opression' ?</p>
              <p>I wonder why some people are so Anti-China. Please before you say 'Free Tibet', first and foremost free your own mind first from prejudice and negativity.</p>
              <p>And another thing...I cant believe some people actually say 'China send Han Chinese to swamp Tibet' etc.</p>
              <p>Why cant people from Shanghai go to Tibet to open a restaurant..? China is one country, everyone can go to everywhere.</p>
              <p>Those are common people, people who try to make a living, opening up restaurants, shops, hotels, and so on. After all, Tibet is a tourist place.</p>
              <p>What is so unnatural about this..?</p>
              <p>Do you think they are told by the government to open up businesses and move there..?</p>
              <p>In Hawaii, white people go to there to settle and to open hotels and other businesses. In Bali, non-Balinese go there in large numbers to do business there too.</p>
              <p>What is the problem with people moving from one province to another province..?</p>
              <p>I cant believe the extreme prejudice against China. Before u indulge in such thoughts, at least stop urself and ask urself, why are you so anti-China. What is there in your mind..? It cant be right. China is just a country, a society, a people. It is not any worse or any more evil than the other nations in the world. Everyone is the same. I hope u can understand this. Do not indulge in stereotyping and narrow-minded prejudice.</p>

              <p>The majority of the natives are quite happy with the current state they are in. So, there are also opponents against the sovereignty movement.</p>

              <p>There are still some people who say 'Chinese Opression' or
              'Sending/ flooding Han Chinese into Tibet'.</p>
              <p>I ask something....</p>
              <p>What is this so-called Chinese opression...?</p>
              <p>Do u know in China, ethnic minorities actually enjoy some
              positive priviledges compared to majority Han Chinese..?</p>
              <p>For instance 1 child policy is not applied to them.</p>
              <p>Welfare payment, and assistance is easier for them.</p>
              <p>I wonder what is this so-called 'Chinese opression' kept being
              said by some people. What is this Chinese Opression..? Have u been
              to Tibet?</p>
              <p>My sister just 1 year ago or so, visited Tibet together with her
              husband, my brother in law.</p>
              <p>Tibet is a normal place, a tourist place. Local Tibetans are
              living there as usual, working, going to school, and interacting
              with tourists. Everything is normal. Just very common.</p>
              <p>'Chinese Opression' ?</p>
              <p>Dont make a joke please.</p>
              <p>Not only are they treated with special priviledge, Chinese
              government has poured alot of money to build Tibet and improve its
              economy and well-being of the people.</p>
              <p>One particular special example is the train, the highest train
              that cost alot of money to build, to improve the infrastucture
              because Tibet is an isolated interior, a  poor place.
              Hopefully it can bring positive impact for Tibet.</p>
              <p>If you look at this....how can you say....this is called
              'Chinese Opression' ?</p>
              <p>I wonder why some people are so Anti-China. Please before you
              say 'Free Tibet', first and foremost free your own mind first from
              prejudice and negativity.</p>
              <p>And another thing...I cant believe some people actually say
              'China send Han Chinese to swamp Tibet' etc.</p>
              <p>Why cant people from Shanghai go to Tibet to open a
              restaurant..? China is one country, everyone can go to
              everywhere.</p>
              <p>Those are common people, people who try to make a living,
              opening up restaurants, shops, hotels, and so on. After all, Tibet
              is a tourist place.</p>
              <p>What is so unnatural about this..?</p>
              <p>Do you think they are told by the government to open up
              businesses and move there..?</p>
              <p>In Hawaii, white people go to there to settle and to open hotels
              and other businesses. In Bali, non-Balinese go there in large
              numbers to do business there too.</p>
              <p>What is the problem with people moving from one province to
              another province..?</p>
              <p>I cant believe the extreme prejudice against China. Before u
              indulge in such thoughts, at least stop urself and ask urself, why
              are you so anti-China. What is there in your mind..? It cant be
              right. China is just a country, a society, a people. It is not any
              worse or any more evil than the other nations in the world.
              Everyone is the same. I hope u can understand this. Do not indulge
              in stereotyping and narrow-minded prejudice.</p>

              <p>a nicely worded piece meat pao .... and i hear your points, but let's put things into another perspective now shall we ....</p>
              <p>yes, minorities do enjoy things like the two child policies ... unfortunately, tibetans in no way enjoy equal rights as other citizens of china ... this is from a tibetan in lhasa mind you, not from me ... for example ... they are not allowed to travel freely to other places, unlike the han chinese. You see large numbers of chinese in singapore, they are able to come here for work and play freely, but the movement of tibetans outside of the country is strictly controlled, and subjected to goverment approval ... and they are banned from going to india, presumably because their spritual leader, the dalai lama is there, overseas travel is strictly restricted as well,  ... their temples of worship that exist in tibet today are also controlled, vetted, and approved by the chinese authorities, those that do not conform (I suppose, because of their links to the "dalai lama clique"?) are already closed down. What you see, even as a tourist, is very different from that the native tibetans feel about it ...</p>
              <p>oh, I don't image that ALL tibetans would be unhappy about chinese rule ... after all, materialism is a very powerful lure ... but why are so many tibetans willing to put their lives on the line, to face PLA bullets, if they were so happy and satisfied under chinese rule ? ... maybe because we're too caught up with the material side of things, and find it hard to comprehend why anyone would want to agitate for freedom and independence if they had it so good right ? ...  perhaps it'd be like the PAP asking, "I give you prosperity, I give you development, what more to you want" to our friend Poh Ah Pak here, right ? perhaps he'd like to answer that question. after all, outside tourists do like to think we have it pretty good too
              ..... so don't you suppose there are undercurrents that we do not
              easily see as outsiders, that drive the tibetans thus, just like in
              Singapore ? ... or do you really believe in the story that a few ang
              mohs are behind all this ? ... the dalai lama ? .......... isn't it like justdoit77 stating that the african countries are better off being colonies of the UK today, because they are such basket cases as independant countries today ?.. can you see the sanctimonity of such line of thought ? ... but maybe it's because we are all Chinese, and even here in Singapore, we are not a minority, and that makes it difficult for us to see things from another perspective ..... </p>
              <p>in any case, my friend's tibetan friend has dropped out of sight for a whole week now ... nothing's been heard from him since last week ... hopefully, it's nothing more serious but the current ban on internet access there after the riots .... but I'm keeping my fingers crossed for the chap ... after all, if there's nothing to hide, if there are no crackdowns on the streets, if there's no skeletons in the closets,  if people are happy there, if there are no tibetans killed, there really isn't any reason to ban internet access to the outside world right ? ... or he cannot be allowed to tell his story, to voice his discontent ? ...</p>
              <p>remember that in Singapore, we can have threads right here in speaker's corner with titles like "when is lee Kuan Yew going to die"... and here we are calmly voicing greviences against our goverment .... people over there, do not have such a privilege ....</p>
