              <p>is the violence perpetuated solely by the tibetans against the han chinese alone ? ....inspite of the pictures that I have posted ? ... or was the actions against the tibetans solely a reaction ? ...</p>
              <p>do you truly reckon that a diversity of views is being alllowed out by the chinese authorities ? ... do you believe that the official chinese media's version of the story is the only version ? .... that it's the complete truth ? ...</p>
              <p>I did point out my reasons for doubts to our friend idiotbutcherer here before .... looking at past experience, is there much grounds for me to completely taking in that version of the story ? ... I don't like to drag out the examples of official cover-ups and deceit from SARS to the food scares again ..... remember again, I pointed out that youtube is currently being banned in China ... together with BBC english service, and a filtered google search engine ... beijing friends and shanghai relatives confirmed the unavailability of the above ... and that journalists are currently being banned from tibet, save for a select group husbanded by the authorities that'll be allowed to interview "victims of tibetan rioters" to quote the chinese official ... that is the crux of the problem here ... what i find frightening, is that an entire people is being stoked up to a rabid nationalistic fervor while being systematically denied counter-view points .... it smells of the way the japanese society succumbed to fascism prior to WWII ..... </p>

              <p>I'll show you an example from the website of a group closer to your heart .. the Singapore democrats ... a group whom you have quoted from, time and time again, for the threads you posted up on this forum ...</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">widespread abuse of religious freedom in China</span></p>

              				countries like China, for instance, where to this day there are
              				still concentration camps for alleged enemies of the regime or
              				simply for people who think differently. It makes me very uneasy
              				that democratic countries—without having any real evidence
              				of a change in China’s governing policies—are even
              				thinking about lifting the embargo on weapons to that country
              				that was imposed after the massacre of free-thinking young people
              				in Tianamen Square in Beijing and the lifting of which would mean
              				new dangers for the democratic government in Taiwan.</span></p>

              <p>Curious ... you seems to pay lip service to democratic ideals .. judging from the threads you started in this forum .... but hey ! .. just not for Tibet eh, don't you agree with the stance of the people you idolize ? .... free hawaii, free puerto rico, ... whose people are actually free to voice their dissatisfaction with their current statuses ... even free Singapore ! ....  but just not free tibet eh ? ...</p>
              <p>this is called selective interpretation .... I used to think it's due to racial chauvinism ... but I guess it's really due to confusion ....</p>
              <p>well ... I must say ... that the supporters of China's actions in tibet here ... are keeping a strange bedfellow ....</p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"> About 30 monks shouted pro-Tibetan slogans and defended the Dalai Lama
              as journalists toured the Jokhang Temple, the visiting reporters said. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"> China has accused the Dalai Lama of masterminding the protests. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"> But US President George W Bush has urged Beijing to begin dialogue with Tibet's exiled spiritual leader. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Foreign journalists were expelled from Tibet at the height of
              the unrest, but on Wednesday China allowed a group of about two dozen
              reporters into Lhasa for a three-day escorted visit. The BBC's request
              to be included in the group was turned down. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"> The monks' protest came as they toured the Jokhang Temple - one of Tibet's holiest shrines. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">One monk shouted "Tibet is not free, Tibet is not free" before
              he started to cry, an AP journalist at the scene, Charles Hutzler,
              reported.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"> Another monk said the rioting on 14 March "had nothing to do with the Dalai Lama".</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"> The monks said they had not been allowed to leave the temple since the rioting. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"> Government handlers told the journalists to leave and tried to pull them away, the reporter said. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"> Later, the area around the Jokhang Temple was sealed off by riot police.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">A reporter for the London-based Financial Times, meanwhile, said that
              the Tibetan quarter of the city resembled a war zone, with burnt-out
              buildings, shuttered businesses and groups of soldiers on every corner.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong> "The smell of burning buildings still hangs in the air nearly two weeks
              after violent rioting swept through the old Tibetan quarter of Lhasa,"
              the Financial Times's Geoff Dyer reported.</strong> </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"> The rioting appeared to have been more prolonged and destructive than previously thought, he wrote. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"> Charles Hutzler described to the BBC a city divided. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"> "I<strong>n sort of the more recently built up, very Chinese part of Lhasa,
              life seems to be going on fairly normally... But in the older, Tibetan
              section of the town and the blocks leading to it we could see the
              remains of burnt-out buildings.</strong> </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"> "It certainly seems like a damaged city, and I mean not just physically but psychically as well," he added. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The reporters said there was a heavy security presence in the
              Tibetan quarter with squads of police and soldiers on every corner. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">But in the new town, they described life as returning to a
              semblance of normality with shops and restaurants busy with customers.</span></p>
              <p>Curiously, I never knew there's a Tibetan quarter and a Chinese quarter in the city .... I wonder if the average tourist would be able to make such a distinction too eh ...</p>

              <p>Then again tourists and all the Western media says that Singapore is a clean (as if one can eat off the floor) and efficient place, without commenting on the dirty areas of Singapore and the one party state rule. Funny how all the focus is on Chinese chauvinism is on China and not Singapore.</p>
              <p>Both the Western media and the Communist Party of China have their agendas to sell. There is a big difference being anti CCP.</p>
              <p>"Freeing Tibet" would entail an independent Tibet with a head of state not elected by the people and NO seperation between church and state. IS THAT DEMOCRACY TOO?</p>

              <p>The recent troubles in Tibet are a replay of events that happened two decades ago. On Oct. 1, 1987, Buddhist monks were demonstrating peacefully at the Barkor -- the famous market street around the central cathedral in Lhasa -- when police began beating and arresting them. To ordinary Tibetans, who view monks as "treasures," the sight was intolerable -- not only in itself, but because it stimulated unpleasant memories that Tibetan Buddhists had been harboring for years.</p>
              <p>A few angry young men then began throwing stones at the Barkor police station. More and more joined, and then they set fires, overturned cars and began shouting "Independence for Tibet!" This is almost exactly what we saw in Lhasa two weeks ago.</p>
              <p>The fundamental cause of these recurrent events is a painful dilemma that lives inside the minds of Tibetan monks. When the Chinese government demands that they denounce their spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, monks are forced to choose between obeying, which violates their deepest spiritual convictions, and resisting, which can lead to loss of government registry and physical expulsion from monasteries.</p>
              <p>From time to time monks have used peaceful demonstrations to express their anguish. When they have done this, an insecure Chinese government, bent on "annihilating unstable elements" in the "emergent stage," has reacted with violent repression. This, in turn, triggers violence from Tibetans.</p>
              <p>In recent decades, the Chinese government's policy for pacifying Tibet has been to combine the allure of economic development on the one hand with the threat of force on the other. Experience has shown that this approach does not work.</p>
              <p>The most efficient route to peace in Tibet is through the Dalai Lama, whose return to Tibet would immediately alleviate a number of problems. Much of the current ill will, after all, is a direct result of the Chinese government's verbal attacks on the Dalai Lama, who, for Tibetan monks, has an incomparably lofty status. To demand that monks denounce him is about as practical as asking that they vilify their own parents.</p>
              <p>It should be no surprise that beatings of monks and closings of monasteries naturally stimulate civil unrest, or that civil unrest, spawned in this way, can turn violent.</p>
              <p>Why aren't these simple truths more obvious? Phuntsog Wanggyal, a Tibetan now retired in Beijing who for years was a leading Communist official in Tibet, has observed that a doctrine of "anti-splittism" has taken root among Chinese government officials who deal with religion and minority affairs, both in central offices in Beijing and in Tibet. Having invested their careers in anti-splittism, these people cannot admit that the idea is mistaken without losing face and, they fear, losing their own power and position as well.</p>
              <p>Their ready-made tag for everything that goes wrong is "hostile foreign forces" -- an enemy that justifies any kind of harsh or unreasoning repression. When repeated endlessly, anti-splittism, although originally vacuous, does take on a kind of solidity. Careers are made in it, and challenging it becomes impossible.</p>
              <p><strong>I am a supporter of the Dalai Lama's "middle way," meaning autonomy for Tibet in all matters except foreign affairs and national defense.</strong> This arrangement eventually would have to mean that Tibetan people select their own leaders -- and that would be a major change from the way things are now. Tibet is called an "autonomous region," but in fact its officials are all named by Beijing, and are all tightly focused on their own personal interests and the interests of the Communist Party. Tibetans can clearly see the difference between this kind of government and self-rule, and there is no way that they will support bogus autonomy.</p>
              <p>It follows -- even if this is a tall order -- that the ultimate solution to the Tibet problem must be democratization of the Chinese political system itself. True autonomy cannot come any other way.</p>
              <p>It is time for the Chinese government to take stock of why its long-term strategy in Tibet has not worked, and to try something else. The old problems remain, and they are sure to continue, perhaps in places like the "Uighur Autonomous Region" of Xinjiang, if a more sensible approach is not attempted.</p>
              <p><strong><strong>Mr. Wang, a Beijing-based writer, was the organizer of the recent 12-point statement on Tibet by 30 Chinese intellectuals. This article was translated from the Chinese by Princeton University Prof. Perry Link."</strong></strong></p>

              <p>There is indeed anti-japanese demonstration in China. Though mainland china has the highest number of casuaties and sex slaves victims, but the demonstration are mostly done in Korea and HK, I should be surprised that why those in China are so quiet. And now you are saying that they are nationalist?<br><br>For the diao yu island, yes, the japanese navy ship sink their boat first, causing one of them to drown. Can you remember that? If this happen to country like Korea, Malaysia, Russia, do you think their government and the people will be as controlled as China. Go and check more on internet pls.</p>
              <p>You are now using the SARS as your basis to justify the anti-china media. Despite Poh Ah Pak, idiotbutcherer efforts to point out the western media intention to blackwash China thru video editing and making fake news.<br>Put yourself in their shoes, if someone paste your face in a sex video and distribute in your company, how will you feel?</p>
              <p>So after seeing so many vehicles, ambulance, shops, schools, buildings being set fire
                                      and destroyed, people being attacked, your conclusion is this is done by police to smear
                                      the "peaceful" demonstration?<br>It is confirmed that the riot, the destruction is done by the separatists, not the police. No need to argue on this. Even our pro-US singapore government has also mentioned that they support China's action on the tibet riot. Likewise when the singapore government want to capture those who attempt to bombblast Yishun MRT, no country object this decision.</p>

              <p>To be frankly speaking,i also dont like Westerners n Americans racist attitude.Somehow,they always look down on us Asians(perhaps they know we are a threat to them),and apply double standards on us.</p>
              <p>BUT,that doesnt mean they dont have any good points for us to learn.Their political systems prove to be very useful to us and prevent autocracy politics from arising.That is something we have to learn from them.</p>
