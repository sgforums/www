They cannot differentiate the difference between nationality and ethnicity.

The IC never put us as mainland chinese, but correctly put us as chinese. Obviously in your pink IC, they should have known u r a singaporean.

The point was not religious and not meant to disgrace the late leader.

            <div class='col-md body'>This "removal of race from the IC" idea reminds me of Texan traffic laws about 10 years ago.  A law was passed for all new vehicles to have a speedometer to go up to 65 MPH only, regardless of the actual top speed of the car.  The rationale of the law was that if drivers didn't know how fast their cars could go, they wouldn't push it to the limit.<br><br>In response to the new speedometers, Texan drivers developed a new game.  They pushed their cars as hard as they could to see how many times they could make the needle go around the dial.<br><br>The intent of the idea is admirable; the stupidity of the idea, however, is incredible.</div>
