            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Fellow Singaporeans,<br><br>This is your future Prime Minister addressing you. Singapore is a highly stratified society. We have been divided by race, language, religion, wealth, health, educational levels and Income. We are lucky that we are safe so far due to the tight balancing act we have in our society. However, being always in a tight rope put us constantly in a risky business.<br><br>I noticed a few posting with regards to racial divide in Schools as well as the lessening of racial interaction among our breed. Furthermore with more influx of Non-original Singaporean Chinese and Indians, we have further polarised our society. Not to mention that our current crazy PAP government is increasing our population via emigration policies - targetiong at 8 million people in Singapore by 2008.<br><br>Therefore it is with urgency that we cannot continue to see ourselves as Chinese, Indian or Malay. It is impossible. We are no longer the same as them. We are now Singaporeans.<br><br>The recent government action to reduce the intensity to learn Mandarin and Chinese seems to be in the right direction.<br><br>In order to ensure that our society could see our fellow citizens not in skin colur, race, religion or language, we have to remove the consciousness of our racial divide and identity.<br><br>I urged the authorities to remove race as a necessity in any official forms or identification. There will be no description of race in our IC or birth certificates.<br><br>When I become your PM, I will make it illegal to even mention race as a description. There will be no other race than being Singaporean. By then we will have a substantial biological Singaporean with genes from the Far East, the Atlantic and Southeast Asian, hopefully with some European blood.<br><br>The removal of our racial consciousness is the only way we become fully Singaporean. We have to do so now. The only people who can continue to identify themselves in their racial terms are non-citizens ie foreigners or new citizens. We can then teach them to how to remove that description about themselves when they want to become a Singaporean.<br><br>So from today- please support this petition to get our government to remove race from our IC, birth certificate, any records and any forms.<br><br>Support the new breed: "Singaporean"<br><br>Cheers!<br><br>Have a good weekend<br><br>Your Future Prime Minister<br><br>Relevation,<br>Currently unhappily being identified as Chinese<br>with no relationship with China other than through my grand parents.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Chinese come from China<br><br>The Indians come from India<br><br>The Malays were originally here.  When I use the term Malay, I mean the Malay Archipelago.

The government knows that most people are not happy with Singapore.  For other people to recognise us as "Singaporeans" would be a disgrace to them.  I'm proud of  my race and culture and I don't want to lose it.  I'm don't have the same culture as everyone else.<br><br>C'mon people we all have long histories right?  The Chinese, the Indians, the ma...wait...fine...not all of us.  Learning our differences is fun, isn't it?<br><br>Furthermore, I bet there are many different dialects.  Not all Indians are Tamils.  There are Hindis, Telugus, etc etc.<br><br>We can always be one even with our racial differences!  That's even one of the features of Singapore that they'd like to keep.  To show off that we can live harmoniously even amongst ourselves.<br><br>But I think that's a lie.  You can see that people here are blaming religions for what  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> one person did.  So does this mean that everyone believing in it should be exterminated?  Is it right for the teacher to punish the whole class when only one person committed a crime?<br><br></div>
