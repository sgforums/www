            <div class='col-md body'><br>Seriously, I wonder what the fark took them so long, to realize these things???<br><br>All these while, decades passed, wht the fark have they been doing or thinking???<br><br>======================================<br><strong>When providing a better chair is all it takes<br>NMP on how employers can help create friendlier environment for older workers </strong><br><br>EMPLOYERS may now be more willing to hire older workers, but much more needs to be done to retain them Â— such as providing better lighting and more ergonomic chairs.<br>.<br>Nominated Member of Parliament Kalyani Mehta said: "I have known of cases of older workers going into a job, but after a few months, they leave because they find the environment is not age-friendly."<br>.<br>Making the point at a recent seminar on Financing Ageing Population in the Asean Community, the National University of Singapore associate professor said that ageist attitudes, inter-generational gaps and even physical surroundings might contribute to less-than-conducive work environments.<br>.<br>For example, younger people may be impatient while older people may need more time to finish their tasks. Or, they may have a supervisor who does not understand the needs of such workers.<br>.<br>Some may have dependants at home and are thus unable to stay late at the office. Others, who may have existing medical conditions and need regular medication, may need to arrange their schedules around this.<br>.<br>"Company policies and physical environment adjustment are very important," she said. "They should encourage social activities to help workers of all ages get together and chit-chat."<br>.<br>Informal bonding sessions will translate into better teamwork, she added. But physical factors are also important.<br>.<br>"If a four-storey building has no lifts, it may be difficult for workers to walk up and down," Assoc Prof Mehta told Today. "But companies can tap on Government funds like the Advantage Scheme to make modifications such as better lighting and more ergonomic chairs."<br>.<br>The Advantage Scheme was introduced in late 2005 by the Singapore Workforce Development Agency in partnership with the National Trades Union Congress and the Singapore National Employers Federation to facilitate the hiring of older workers.<br>.<br>Each company can secure grants of up to $400,000 to implement systems and processes to recruit, retain or rehire them.<br>.<br>She also urged more employers to adopt flexible work arrangements. Working from home is a common option in many countries and these arrangements can translate into better productivity and efficiency.<br>.<br>Job sharing is another option worth considering. Jobs in which computers are used for a large part of the work lend themselves well to this kind of work, she said.<br>.<br>To retain older workers, Assoc Prof Mehta added: "We need some flexibility and creativity. At the end of the day, what you are aiming for is for jobs to give people financial security and independence."<br>.<br>Dr Rajagopal Dhar Chakraboti, a University of Calcutta expert on ageing, suggested during the recent Asean Gerontology Course that more ingenuity was needed to improve efforts to finance old age. While lauding Singapore's efforts in instituting a "savings culture" with the CPF scheme, he noted that withdrawals for housing and other payments have meant that some people do not have sufficient balances for retirement.<br>.<br>"As life expectancy is rising rapidly, Singaporeans are seeing it as a problem in their old age," he said.<br>.<br>An area he thinks should be looked into is the redistribution of resources from the richer sections of society to the economically weaker sections. "One way could be to pay a lower rate of interest for those with higher CPF balances and more interest for the lower income groups," he said.
