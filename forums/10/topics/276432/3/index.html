Investors will also pay to insure the credit facility against default.<br><br>People involved said the restructuring could act as a template for other such moves. But it was unclear whether other SIV-lites created by Barclays could be rescued in the same way.<br><br>Two of the other SIV-lites arranged by Barclays Capital - Mainsail II and Golden Key - have already been forced to sell assets.<br><br>Barclays also created an SIV-lite for Sachsen LB, the failed German bank, whose woes led to the resignation on Friday of Horst Metz, finance minister of the German state of Saxony.<br><br>The move represents the most dramatic political fallout to date in Germany from the turmoil.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br></div>

European stocks declined for the first time in a week after a rise in the London interbank offered rate prompted central bankers to increase scrutiny of money markets. Asian shares also retreated.<br><br>The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Index lost 16.92, or 1.1 percent, to 1,472.5 as of 1:48 p.m. in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 151.11, or 1.1 percent, to 13,297.75. The Nasdaq Composite Index decreased 19.73, or 0.8 percent, to 2,610.51.<br><br>``The probability of a recession has been increasing,'' said Vadim Zlotnikov, chief equity strategist at Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co. in New York. ``As companies start to miss earnings forecasts and you get profit margin contraction, I think that could create enough fear for another sell-off.''<br><br>A private report said the number of Americans signing contracts to buy previously owned homes in July dropped by the most since records began in 2001. A separate report showed declining sales of commercial properties.<br><br>Homebuilders in S&amp;P indexes fell 3.9 percent as a group and a gauge of real-estate companies slipped 2.6 percent.<br><br>Lehman, Morgan Stanley<br><br>Lehman Brothers lost $1.64 to $54.82.

For Morgan Stanley, Citi cut its estimate by 8.6 percent to $1.60, lower than the $1.69 average in Bloomberg's survey.<br><br>The S&amp;P 500 has risen 3.8 percent this year. It gained 2.2 percent in the previous two days after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S.

            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.businesstimes.com.sg/mnt/media/image/launched/2007-09-07/BT_IMAGES_TEMASEK7.jpg"><br><br>Temasek's Asia buys worth billions more<br>Renewed focus in region proved timely, notwithstanding Shin blip<br><br>By LYNETTE KHOO<br><br>(SINGAPORE) For more than a year now, Temasek's apparently ill-placed investment in the beleaguered Shin Corp has hogged the headlines. But calculations made by BT on the Singapore investment company's other major ventures since 2002 - when it started focusing on direct investment opportunities in Asia's fastest-growing economies - tell a different story.<br><br>Away from the hype generated by its Thai foray, Temasek's other overseas investments in listed entities have largely paid off. Of course, the timing that Temasek picked to reshape its portfolio has helped as Asian markets have been on a bull run since 2003. In most cases, the company is sitting on hefty, unrealised gains.<br><br>Temasek, for example, paid US$2 billion for a 4.8 per cent stake in Bank of China (BOC) in 2005, which has since been diluted to 4.6 per cent. Even so, it is now worth some US$8.69 billion based on yesterday's market capitalisation.<br><br>Temasek's 5.9 per cent stake in China Construction Bank (CCB), for which it paid some US$2.47 billion, has ballooned in value to about US$11.64 billion as CCB shares hit an all-time high of HK$6.84 yesterday. Temasek started buying stakes in both entities even before their initial public offerings (IPOs). After the IPO, the share prices of BOC and CCB have jumped 33 per cent and 191 per cent respectively.<br><br>Temasek's bet on ICICI Bank, India's largest financial institution by market capitalisation, has also paid off. The share has surged more than 220 per cent since Temasek bought into the company in December 2003. Meanwhile, the value of Temasek's 6.5 per cent stake has risen from US$275-US$300 million to US$1.58 billion currently.<br><br>'The banks they have invested in have done very well because the financial sector has done well, so it shows up more (in their portfolio),' said Fundsupermart general manager Wong Sui Jau.<br><br>Temasek bought into Standard Chartered last year and although the results have not been as spectacular as elsewhere, it is still sitting on paper gains of well over US$400 million. Its stake in the UK-based bank stands at US$6.93 billion, higher than some US$6.5 billion that is invested so far.<br><br>Market watchers noted that investments in listed banks - which are proxy to the growth of these economies - reflect that Temasek is fairly bullish on the prospects of the countries it is investing in. Meanwhile, its move to raise its stake in Stanchart from 15 per cent to 16.3 per cent last month suggests that it sees value in the bank following the recent market correction.<br><br>'To get an exposure to an economy, the best investment is in banks because they typically grow as a multiple of the underlying economic growth and are basically leveraged institutions,' said a local fund manager who manages some US$50 million worth of assets.<br><br>Temasek's more recent investment in Barclays, however, has seen initial jitters as Barclays' shares have fallen by some 15 per cent from the price that Temasek agreed to pay in July. The value of its 2.1 per cent stakeholding has fallen from US$1.97 billion to US$1.76 billion, though observers stress that Temasek is in it for the long haul and gains might flow in once the US sub-prime tremors subside and Barclays' takeover bid for ABN Amro is resolved.<br><br>According to its latest annual report, Temasek manages a portfolio of more than US$100 billion, focusing primarily in Asia. For the year ended March 2007, its net portfolio value crossed the US$100 billion mark for the first time at S$164 billion (US$108 billion), up from S$129 billion a year earlier, with a healthy total shareholder return of more than 27 per cent by market value including dividends.<br><br>Temasek's investments post-2002 are now valued at $58 billion and delivered a five-year compounded return of 38 per cent per year compared with a five-year compounded return of 17 per cent for the rest of the portfolio.<br><br>But as with any form of investments, Temasek did not get it right all the time. The investment house is estimated to be nursing paper losses of US$1.1 billion in Shin Corp, after it ploughed US$2.3 billion (73.3 billion baht) through its subsidiaries for a 49 per cent interest in the telco. The capital value of its current 42 per cent stake held through unit Aspen Holdings is now worth US$1.23 billion based on its latest market cap.<br><br>Shin Corp remains under the scrutiny of the Thai government on alleged breach of foreign ownership rules. An impairment charge on the investment affected Temasek's bottom line, dragging down net profit 29 per cent from a year ago to S$9.11 billion.<br><br>The focus has now shifted to its latest venture - an 8.3 per cent stake in loss-making China Eastern Airlines for US$315 million. It did this in tandem with Singapore Airlines, which snapped up a 15.7 per cent stake.<br><br>'Whether this deal makes sense or not depends on the price. Buying into companies that are losing money may be good investment because it's cheap and there is the assumption that at some point, it will make money,' the local fund manager said.<br><br>The move has so far, proved to be a good bet. Over the past four days, it has already rewarded Temasek with paper gains of US$303 million - almost doubling the amount it invested.<br><br></div>
