The news prompted them to slash their recommendations on the stock on concerns over a profit squeeze for the full financial year.<br><br>It also sent BOC shares down more than five percent last Friday although they have rebounded 3.36 percent to 4.0 dollars in mid-morning trade on Monday.<br><br>Meanwhile, China Construction Bank reported a 47 percent increase in net profit to 34.22 billion yuan in the six months to June on the back of a 37 percent increase in net interest income and a 102 percent surge in net fee and commission income.<br><br>The profit was in line with analysts estimate for a net profit of 32.31 to 35.65 billion yuan.<br><br>It said its net interest income rose to 89.21 billion yuan from 65.29 billion yuan a year earlier, while net fee and commission income more than doubled to 12.66 billion yuan from 6.27 billion a year earlier.<br><br>Interest income grew to 130.9 billion yuan from 100.48 billion yuan.</blockquote>yea....more fark up to come<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br></div>
