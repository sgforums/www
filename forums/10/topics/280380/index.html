            <div class='col-md body'>If you have lawyers representing you, maybe you should ask them about "Piercing / Lifting the Corporate Veil", it means going after the ultimate person behind this sham, he is hiding behind incorporation to commit his frauds.<br><br><a href="http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa4023/is_200601/ai_n17180868" rel="nofollow"><br>C. Fraud or Sham<br><br>The corporate veil may be lifted where there has been a fraud or other breach of the law.15 The fraud and sham argument refers to the use of a corporation by the controller to evade a legal or fiduciary obligation, where the corporation is used as a front to mask real obligations.<br><br>As the full Federal Court noted in Donnelly v. Edelsten16 "[t]he argument [of fraud] is, of course circular. It can only succeed if the argument of sham succeeds . . . ."17 If a company is a "sham" or "faÃ§ade" then it has incorporated merely to disguise the reality of its operations18 or evade obligations.19<br><br>In order to pierce the corporate veil for fraud, the company "must have the intention to use the corporate structure in such a way as to deny the plaintiff some pre-existing legal right."20 More specifically, the corporation is used in a manner to avoid a legal obligation.21 It is generally permissible to form companies to avoid a future liability, for example in a risky business venture that may fail; however, courts may not allow a company to be formed to avoid performing an existing legal duty.<br><br>Nevertheless, such arguments can be criticised for disregarding the separate entity principle.22 In regards to a "sham" corporation, Windeyer J. has held "[i]f a company is duly incorporated and registered under the [Corporations] Act and the proper records are kept in due form and the prescribed returns are made, it continues to exist as a legal entity. In that sense it is a reality not a sham."23<br><br></a></div>
