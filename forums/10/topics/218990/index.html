            <div class='col-md body'>Today, I take my A level Chinese B paper as a private candidate, there is a passage that goes something like this:<br><br>Our life was hard after my father's business busted. My mother had to make ends meet by making clothes for others. When she fell ill for a few months, we don't have enough money to pay for the eletric bills, our water supply was almost cut off.<br><br>One day, my younger sister came home, calling out loudly, "I'm donating something for the poorer family."<br><br>My mother was enraged, she said, "I don't know there are families poorer than us."<br><br>But my grandma frown, stopped her and said, "If we let her hear that, she will growing thinking she is those 'poorer people'. If she thinks she is 'poorer', she will always be begging for help in the future. Only those 'better-off people' donate things to other, don't we have one can of jam left? Let's give this to her to donate it to the poor."<br><br>The next day, grandma carefully packed our last can of jam for sister to do her charity.<br><br>Till this day, despite having three hotels in her possession, my younger sister still remembers that can of jam. No matter in workplace or everyday life, my younger sister still thinks that she is the person giving away the jam.<br><br>Ok, this is the rough translation of the passage. The idea of the passage seems this way, always help those who are needy.<br><br><strong>BUT!!</strong> Look at it again, doesn't it tells you that no matter how hard your life is, <strong>DON'T</strong> ask for help. When you don't ask for help, it is then you will achieve success.</div>
