Its definitely one sided at the discretion of media whatever the reasons.   Its like, afraid that the population might know too much and starts to wonder why, so policies that are not really working on ground level is being interpreted as successful to the mass.<br>One thing i noticed is whenever a mistake is made, its quickly doused off and move on very quickly hoping that it will be forgotten.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Truth is very much relative. It can be said that what we are getting from our local papers, are in sync with what the government. It can be said that having our press stifled as it is, has help singapore to develop as fast and smoothly as it is. But well, the younger generation having been nurtured with the american ideals prevalent in our lives, have grown attached to the idea of freedom of speech and stuff and are finding our own voices and want to resist this control by the government. I believe that us Singaporeans are maturing and its about time that freedom of press is given at the minimum.<br><br>However, just as PAP being the dominant force in the political front, the question does come up?Why get alternatives to a well oiled machine? I see the answer merely as our desire to have control over ourselves, and not have a bunch of guys elected into the parlimeant denying us this right of choice. We are humans , and do not want to live our lives under stifling control, no matter how great it is. The Changi prison is very symbolic of singapore to me, free all basic neccessities are met, but why aren't the prisoners all to glad?Freedom, that is what we want..and its about time, we get what we rightly want.</div>
