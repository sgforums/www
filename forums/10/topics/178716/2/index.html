Further discussions about additional liberalisation measures will be held when there is greater stability in the global aviation environment.</strong><br><br>4 Minister Yeo Cheow Tong said this Memorandum of Understanding marks a historic milestone in our aviation relationship.<br><br>5 "The significant liberalisation is a testament to our strong bilateral ties, and an expressed commitment of both sides to work towards a full open-skies agreement. I am greatly heartened by the progress that has been made, and I look forward to taking the next step to conclude a full open-skies agreement with Australia in the very near future," Mr Yeo Cheow Tong said.<br><br>6 Mr Anderson said that today was only the second occasion that Australia has entered into air service arrangements with another country that provide for open capacity between the bilateral partners.<br><br>7 "The first occasion was with our close neighbour, New Zealand, almost three years ago. The fact that the second country is Singapore reflects the importance which Australia assigns to its relationship with Singapore and the strength of that relationship on many levels," Mr Anderson said.<br><br>8 "I am particularly pleased that all gateways in Australia, including regional international gateways, will have greater opportunities to market their destinations, and attract new or additional services by Australian and Singapore carriers, with the removal of capacity restrictions."<br><br>9 Currently, Singapore Airlines and Singapore Airlines Cargo operate 70 weekly services to five Australian cities namely Sydney, Adelaide, Brisbane, Melbourne and Perth. Qantas and Australian Airlines operate a total of 51 weekly passenger services to Singapore. Qantas also code shares on 14 British Airways weekly services over Singapore.<br><br>10 Over the past 5 years, passenger and airfreight movements between Singapore and Australia have grown at a compound rate of 9.6% and 7.0% respectively.<br><br>Issued by:<br>Ministry of Transport, Singapore<br>Australian High Commission<br>Office of Minister Anderson<br><br>Date: 23 Sept 2003</blockquote>Just reading fr this release,we can hit back by cutting Qantas routes<br>to Europe as shown in my previouse posting.</div>
