I think at some stage they will fly on that route. But we are asking really to say to make sure that we have similar advantages as Singapore Airlines. We are restricted. No matter what Singapore Airlines says, but I think the Australian Government realises<strong> we have real restrictions on our ability to fly into certain markets out of Singapore. They are very important markets for us. It is not Singapore's fault</strong> but is an issue that must be addressed. I mean this is about, you are talking about an industry that is totally regulated in those places where governments have a major interest no matter what.<br><br>ALI MOORE: But at the same time the more people Singapore Airlines brings into Australia, the more for to you fly around the country?<br><br>GEOFF DIXON: That's one way of putting it, but you have got to remember also that Singapore Airlines have open capacity between Singapore and Australia, which effectively means they have open capacity between Europe, the Middle East and Australia and they're doing that right now.
