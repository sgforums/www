            <div class='col-md body'>Have to be cynical, how much change can there be in 5 years time with the current stranglehold on political control?<br><br>With the changing global economic environment, it is a 50/50 outlook with regards to the development and conitnued sustanance of the national economy.  The transition into the next stage of global economic and societal depends on how much liberialization takes place within the country.  However, not only does this manifest itself in the degree of political liberty, it also if somewhat influenced by the maturity of the society in general.  Will the populace develop itself in a corresponding way?<br><br>If there is a GE, what will the results be?  Will it still be the same?<br><br>There more questions than answers but the root is that it will swing the way of a negative or at best balanced position.  Thats my opinion on it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Like I said, it may or may not happen.<br><br>But it could happen because of my belief that PAP's strength is also their actual achilles heel. PAP exists because LKY exists. The system PAP has created is for the benefit of LKY and his family, relatives and friends- and almost and only them. Take away the head that is LKY and the rest of the body won't function.<br><br>And even under all the unity aura the PAP have shown so far, surely there will be some ambitious MPs who would like to try for the PM post once LKY dies? The PAP isn't invincible, my friend. Party infighting happens to all political parties around the world and PAP is still very much a political party. It may not be prominent now for obvious reasons but can you rule that out once LKY goes?<br><br>Look, it's all human nature. Even the best system created by the smartest people in the world are bound to have errors, no matter how small. LKY may believe that he has created a foolproof system for the benefit of his family and his party but even he knows that isn't foolproof. You think he hasn't thought about the same scenario once he goes? He's already 83 or 84, for God's sake. He may make proclaimations about "rising from the grave if anything goes wrong with Singapore" but even he knows deep down that he's nothing but a mere mortal.<br><br>Once you go, you go. And you won't come back. Nor will you rise from the grave.<br><br>PAP's first real test is when LKY dies and the aftermath of it. If the infighting starts publicly once LKY's funeral is done, then it's the sign of the beginning of the end.<br><br>You just cannot rule it out- even if PAP still looks invincible currently. Remember this, in an era like now, everything is in a fluid state of motion. Nothing is in concrete now. What happens in the future may not be what you believe it to be.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Harry will die(finally!), and the party will be split. A new breakaway party will be formed, made up of those who feel that Lee Jr only became minister and later prime minister because he was riding on daddy's coat tails. Others may include those unhappy with the casino decision, or the constant use of the party whip. Basically whatever dissention that has been brewing within the party will emerge after the old man is gone.

As far as I can see, he's been a poor imitation of his father.<br><br>Actually most sons of dictators or autocratic leaders have been poor imitations of their dominating fathers for some reason. Look at Syria for example. Look at the various monarchies in history. Look at the 1st Emperor of China, Qin ShiHuang.<br><br>He too, appointed his son as the 2nd Qin Emperor before he died and his son barely last three years- not just because the chinese people were furious with his father's autocratic and brutal rule but also because Qin Shihuang's eldest son wouldn't dominate like his father did when his dad was alive.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by timothytsgsg:</div><div class="quote_body">The obvious has been said. By then Lau Lee will be dead, and PAP may be splitted into two camps- one pro-Lee family and the others who remain ambitious in getting the PM post.<br><br>Honestly, my thought is that while there's a chance that PAP will be split right down to the middle after LKY dies, there's another chance PAP might still remain united.<br><br>In any case, the Lee family hold on S'pore itself will weaken as the eldest son, Lee Hsien Loong isn't as strong as a personality as his father. LKY is everything that LHL isn't.<br><br>LKY is dominating, chrismatic and has the ability to hold everyone's attention in the room when he speaks. He also has leadership qualities- although more in the vein of an autocratic dictator than a democratic leader. LHL isn't anything of that. LHL has zero-chrisma. He cannot dominate. His speeches are more likely to induce people to sleep than stir up people into action. He's also boring and- he can't make people laugh btw- and has a boring personality. And add to the fact that he has zlich leadership qualities and his fakeness of being a leader and you will see that once LKY dies, LHL's real leadership skills(or lack of) will be shown to all S'poreans.<br><br>His position now is due to his father- we all know that. And when his father, the main backer- goes, so will some of LHL's powers as PM as well. If that is the case, democratic supporters will have a good chance in finding loopholes that may not be around when LKY is alive.<br><br>My bet is that while PAP will continue to rule in the next 5-10 years, the future of their party will be unknown in the next 12-15 years or even 20 years. Eventually autocratic regimes will crumble with time- PAP will also go through that. It's only human nature. What may seem invincible now may be deemed jelly the next day.<br><br>PAP will not enjoy another 50 years of constant rule- I'm quite sure of it as I know that PAP is not the only party around in Singapore who can rule Singapore. In the next 20 years, we may see something different. A real option and a real chance to start a new chapter in Singapore's history and a new era..<br><br></div></blockquote>That's when Singapore will be the real dynamic society that we can shape it to be.</div>
