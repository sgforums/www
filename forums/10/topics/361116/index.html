              <p><strong>ZDNet Asia, 22 May 2009, Eileen Yu<br> </strong> <br> <span style="font-size: large;"><strong>S'pore govt needs holistic Web approach</strong></span><br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>The Singapore government will need to adopt a
              whole new mindset and holistic strategy, in its efforts to engage its
              citizens via the Internet and other new media platforms, say industry
              watchers.</strong></span><br> <br> The local government has in recent months indicated a desire to engage
              Singaporeans on a new level, in cyber space, to be in sync with an
              increasingly tech-savvy population.<br> <br> Raphael Phang, vice president of IDC's Government Insights
              Asia-Pacific, said Web 2.0 and other new media tools are at the
              forefront of the transformation of how governments interact with their
              people. <br> <br> Citing U.S. President Barack Obama's use of new media during last
              year's U.S. presidential elections and YouTube videos showing G20
              meetings in the United Kingdom, Phang said such forms of engagement are
              already evident across the globe. The IDC analyst added that
              politicians in the region, including Malaysia, Singapore and Australia,
              have also started blogs.<br> <br> More recently, the U.S. White House held an online town hall meeting
              and accepted questions submitted via the Web. The Obama administration
              received over 104,000 questions sent by 90,000 people.<br> <br> Phang said in an e-mail interview: <span style="color: red;"><strong>"One key
              lesson that can be learnt from these examples is that the Internet and
              new media can, and is having, a significant impact on the way citizens
              view their government--whether the government participates, or does not
              participate in its usage."</strong></span><br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>The general population is already embracing new media, regardless of whether governments do likewise,</strong></span> he said. Given the adoption and impact of such platforms, he noted that <span style="color: red;"><strong>it is important that governments become proactive users as well.<br> </strong></span> <br> During his National Day address in August 2008, Singapore Prime
              Minister Lee Hsien Loong, spoke at length about new media and its
              impact on the island-state. Over 80 percent of households in the
              country have broadband, and there are some 6 million mobile phones in a
              population of 4.5 million.<br> <br> "The young people are totally immersed in this [new] medium," Lee said
              in his speech. "People are writing their own content, sharing it with
              others, organizing interest groups... All this has changed the way the
              government works." He added that his administration is communicating
              and engaging with Singaporeans online.<br> <br> And at the forefront of such efforts is Reach, he said, referring to
              the government portal set up in October 2006, as a platform for
              citizens to submit feedback and discuss government policies online.<br> <br> <strong>Holistic approach, new skills needed</strong><br> <br> Steve Hodgkinson, research director for public sector at Ovum, said in an e-mail: <span style="color: red;"><strong>"Use
              of the Internet as a one- and two-way communications channel is now
              pretty much expected of democratic governments, so Singapore is playing
              catch-up on this one. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The
              government will need to be mindful of the fact that new media is more
              about participation than it is about managing or controlling."</span></strong></span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><br> </span></span> <br> As such, ministers and senior government officials will need to acquire
              new skills, as well as adopt a new culture and mindset, Hodgkinson
              said. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Participating in new media using "old media skills" will not produce the results the Singapore government seeks.</strong></span></span> For instance, putting a ban on online content will only serve to attract attention to it, he said.<br> <br> The challenge is that it takes time and experience to learn these new
              skills, and participate effectively in the new media environment, he
              noted. On top of that, mistakes are very public, he added.<br> <br> "The government will need to work out ways to proceed in a measured
              manner while it gains these skills to avoid embarrassing mistakes that
              could lead to a reversal of enthusiasms for more open communication,"
              Hodgkinson said. "It would be wise to engage some advisors who are very
              experienced in the use of social media in the public sector context."<br> <br> The Singapore government needs to recognize that the younger generation
              is very different from previous generations, said Ang Peng Hwa, a
              professor at Wee Kim Wee School of Communication and Information,
              Nanyang Technological University.<br> <br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>The tone and method of
              communication that worked during the era of the country's former prime
              minister and founding father, Lee Kuan Yew, is unlikely to work today</strong></span></span>,
              Ang told ZDNet Asia in an e-mail. "This generation wants to engage with
              government and politics on their own terms--on issues they care about,"
              he said. And in terms of the quality of inputs and diversity of views,
              he noted that the results of this engagement may also not be what
              government officials want.<br> <br> There are also costs involved in managing Web 2.0 communications if the
              government intends to be responsive, he added. Users expect a 24-hour
              turnaround and these new communication platforms need to be attended by
              two people, on a work shift, even during holidays, he said.<br> <br> Regardless, Ang said these forms of engagement are necessary and
              governments will need to deploy whichever new channels of communication
              the populace is moving toward. These include SMS, Twitter and instant
              messaging, he said.<br> <br> Phang explained: "Unlike traditional media, blogs and other Web 2.0
              technologies represent a more accessible medium that citizens can use
              to interact with the government, and with other citizens.<br> <br> "It is also important to remember that because new generations of
              citizens are educated in the Internet-enabled age, they will expect to
              operate in a similar environment that they have been used to when they
              enter the workforce. The same can be said for those joining the civil
              service as government officials," he noted.<br> <br> Governments then need to understand each media platform and the
              objectives of using that channel of communication, he said. They should
              approach this in the same way they do with traditional media such as
              newspapers, television and radio.<br> <br> Online media, Hodgkinson said, are typically more relaxed and
              "uncontrolled" with regard to the types of topics discussed and views
              expressed. He added that it is up to any democratically-elected
              government to decide what it deems appropriate, and not appropriate,
              especially in dealing with sensitive issues such as religion and race,
              which can be socially divisive.<br> <br> While the Internet is intrinsically more open and participative,
              enabling greater freedom of expression and transparency, governments
              can still decide how much freedom and transparency they to allow, he
              said.<br> <br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>"The hope is, over time, the
              transparency of the Internet will become a force for more open and
              transparent government generally.</strong></span></span> But, of course, this is a pretty simple and naïve view given the complexities of politics."</p>
              <p><strong>High-level official blogging</strong><br> <br> Singapore's Minister for Foreign Affairs George Yeo was the first, and
              one of the few, ministers in the country to blog. The Cabinet minister
              began blogging in 2006 and co-hosts two blogs, covering a wide range of
              issues including his memories of Star Trek, Singapore President S. R.
              Nathan's recent visit to Japan's Hiroshima Peace Memorial, and last
              month's ministerial evacuation at the Asean Summit in Pattaya,
              Thailand. His blog also features photos of the minister making official
              visits to Washington D.C., for example, where he met U.S. Secretary of
              State Hillary Clinton.<br> <br> When contacted, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs declined to respond to
              questions on whether Yeo is provided a set of guidelines on issues he
              blogs about, as well as how he manages his online profile.<br> <br> According to Siew Kum Hong, currently employed as a legal counsel at a
              tech company, most--if not all--major companies today have codes of
              conduct for employees who blog or have online profiles. However, the
              Singapore-based lawyer is not aware of similar codes established
              specifically for government officials in the island-state.<br> <br> Siew is also one of the country's Nominated Members of Parliament
              (NMPs), who are unelected MPs first introduced in 1990 as an avenue to
              allow citizens with no political party affiliation to participate in
              Singapore's parliamentary debates.<br> <br> "I doubt if the Instruction Manual covers blogging," he said in an
              e-mail interview, referring to the administrative handbook all local
              government officers refer to as a guideline for their daily operations
              and duties. "In terms of legal boundaries, the only significant
              difference between government and companies would be that the former is
              covered by the Official Secrets Act. Otherwise, the usual laws will
              apply to both equally."<br> <br> According to Ang, Yeo strikes an appropriate balance between his role
              as a Cabinet minister and online personality. Government officials
              including ministers, have to "toe the official line" even if they
              personally disagree with it, he noted.<br> <br> As a minister, Yeo does this well in his blog, while at the same time reflecting views and insights that are personal, Ang said.<br> <br> He added that new, Web-based form of engagement with the public should
              be embraced by government officials, though there are some caveats and
              cautions. "But, such engagement is necessary. Singapore is now among
              the leading pack in its use of IT, and we should aim to continue to be
              among the leaders," he said. "Such forms of engagement will teach us to
              be more inclusive of groups and views."<br> <br> Yeo had been quoted in local news reports to say that his participation
              in new media platforms, which also includes a Facebook account, keeps
              him in touch with the younger generation.<br> <br> He had referred to Obama's use of new media as an important vehicle
              behind his victory in last year's presidential elections, reaching
              pockets of Americans who might otherwise have stayed away from the
              mainstream process.<br> <br> Ultimately, Siew said, the Internet is just another platform and avenue
              for the Singapore government to reach out and engage citizens.
              Improving its interaction with the population will require a
              fundamental review of "its philosophical approach to engagement", he
              said. For example, the proposal by the AIMS to allow civil servants to
              comment on government policies was rejected, in line with an
              overarching government policy that applies both online and offline.<br> <br> The AIMS was an advisory council, established in April 2007, to assess
              how new media is impacting the local society and recommend ways the
              government can address such impact.<br> <br> The government accepted, and rejected, some of the council's
              recommendations. For instance, it now allows individuals to participate
              in online advertising for elections by blogging or posting election
              materials, though some safeguards will be implemented to ensure
              accountability. However, it dismissed the AIMS' recommendation to allow
              civil servants to voice personal opinions on government policies,
              noting that this would "compromise the performance of their duty".<br> <br> Siew said: "Once the government develops a philosophy and strategy,
              then Internet-specific measures can be implemented to execute that
              strategy."<br> <br> <strong>Engagement requires some guidelines</strong><br> <br> Phang cautioned that blogs, unlike official press statements that are
              vetted, are typically more informal. However, citizens will not view
              such information any differently, he said, adding that blogs written by
              government officials should be managed sensibly.<br> <br> "The content will be no different from what is put out in other media,
              and the guidelines governing this information is the same as any made
              public, where there is the element of taking responsibility for what
              you say," he noted. "The Internet can be viewed as a vast open network
              in which information can quickly be turned into dis-information."<br> <br> Hodgkinson said: "Government officials and ministers should definitely
              not be encouraged to blog or set up an online profile without knowing
              what they are getting themselves into, or without being trained in how
              to blog, being supported by appropriate guidelines and support teams,
              and having 'disaster' plans in place to deal with undesirable
              events--without just resorting to turning a blog off in a panic."<br> <br> The Ovum analyst suggested that a clear distinction must be made
              between political blogs that reflect a minister's personal views on
              policy issues, and blogs used by the government to communicate policies
              and related issues. The latter should avoid any political discussions,
              he said.<br> <br> Politicians and government officials who do blog should do so on a
              government-hosted, rather than public, platform to ensure posts are
              authentic, Hodgkinson said. Content should not be overly sanitized or
              politically correct or the blogger will lose credibility, he added.<br> <br> "Be open to debate and criticism, and deal with it transparently with facts and logic, rather than rhetoric," he said.<br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>Some Singapore government officials, however, seem unprepared for negative comments that may emerge from the blogosphere.</strong></span><br> <br> <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Earlier this year, now-Acting
              Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts, Lui Tuck Yew,
              described the Internet as an ineffective self-regulated environment</span></span></strong>.
              He noted that the online community did not do enough to quell "unkind"
              remarks made by local bloggers, that were targeted at a local
              politician. Lui, as quoted in local news reports, said: "Many of those
              responses were not rebutted nor answered, And, I think it is not
              healthy for some of those to remain on the Net unchallenged,
              unquestioned, and unanswered."<br> <br> -------------------<br> <span style="color: navy;"><strong>Latest updates on <a href="http://singaporenewsalternative.blogspot.com/">Singapore News Alternative</a>:</strong><br> <br> 1.
