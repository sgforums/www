              <p><strong>Man dies after collapsing in bathroom</strong>  <br> <br>IT WAS their usual routine. He would take a shower before getting ready for work, while his wife prepared dinner.</p>
              <p>But on Wednesday evening, tragedy struck.</p>
              <p>Mr Zainudin Said was found unconscious on the bathroom floor.<br> <br>The 49-year-old security guard went into a coma and died in hospital the next day.</p>
              <p>Mr Said's older brother, who declined to be named, said: 'He never got to enjoy the dinner his wife prepared for him.'</p>
              <p>Speaking to The New Paper at the void deck of his brother's Bedok Reservoir Road flat on Thursday evening, he described what had happened.</p>
              <p>Mr Zainudin's wife had got worried when he took much longer than usual in the bathroom.</p>
              <p>'His wife knocked on the door, but there was no answer. That was when she realised something was wrong.'</p>
              <p>The bathroom door was made</p>
              <p>of polyvinyl chloride, commonly known as PVC, a light material, so</p>
              <p>Mr Zainudin's wife was able to force it open with the help of two of her children.</p>
              <p>When she saw what had happened to her husband, she ran to seek help from her next-door neighbour.</p>
              <p>CRYING</p>
              <p>The neighbour, who also declined to be named, said: 'She was crying as she asked me to help her carry her husband out from the toilet.'</p>
              <p>The neighbour and her 14-year-old son rushed to Mr Zainudin's flat.</p>
              <p>They saw Mr Zainudin sprawled on the bathroom floor.</p>
              <p>She added: 'His wife was panic-stricken. She was crying and kept calling out to him. But he didn't answer her.'</p>
              <p>She said Mr Zainudin, whom she described as tall and thin, was 'breathing quite fast, his body felt hot, as though he had a fever'.</p>
              <p>They did not see any wounds on his body.</p>
              <p>The neighbour and her son then helped Mr Zainudin's wife and son to carry him out of the bathroom.</p>
              <p>'I was really scared while we were carrying him out. I was very worried for him,' said the woman, who had been Mr Zainudin's neighbour for more than seven years.</p>
              <p>The Singapore Civil Defence Force was alerted at 7.40pm. A spokesman said Mr Zainudin was unconscious when he was taken to Changi General Hospital.</p>
              <p>The neighbour said she had planned to visit Mr Zainudin in hospital on Thursday, but it was too late by then.</p>
              <p>That afternoon, his wife called her to tell her that he had died.</p>
              <p>Said the neighbour: 'It is such a pity. He was a good, hard-working man, and was the sole breadwinner of the family.'</p>
              <p>Mr Zainudin would take on additional part-time work to earn more money for his wife and three children, a daughter aged 22, and two sons, 19, and 12.</p>
              <p>His elder son, a student at ITE Tampines who declined to be named, was not at home when the incident happened.</p>
              <p>He said: 'I was shocked when I heard the news. I cried.'</p>
              <p>Mr Zainudin's brother, who also did not want to be named, said: 'I just went to the hospital to see him. But then, suddenly, he's not there any more.</p>
              <p>'His wife is so sad, she doesn't leave the room, and keeps crying.'.<br> </p>
