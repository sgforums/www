              <h1>A rebuttal to Shanmugam’s statement that it is wrong to blame foreigners for driving up costs</h1>
              <div class="date">
              <div class="dateleft">
              <p><span class="time">January 19, 2010</span></p>
              <p>Dear Mr Shanmugam,<br> <br>I refer to your comments as reported by Straits Times on 18 Jan 2010.<br> <br>You said that it is a misconception that there are five million people putting pressure on all of us because the 1.3 million here on temporary work permits impose no burden on the public housing system.  That unfortunately, is the real misconception.<br> <br>Even as workers on temporary permits aren’t allowed to buy flats, they are allowed to rent flats or rooms.  The flats that they rent becomes unavailable for sale to the people and thus puts presure on the availability of units.  Also, land that could otherwise have housed Singaporeans are being used to house workers like those in Serangoon Gardens.<br> <br>On what basis do you brush aside the 500,000 PRs as being too small a number to impact prices?  You said the number of BTO flats to be launched this year is 12,000.  If every one of these 500,000 PRs were to buy a flat each, it would take 40 years to build all the flats to accomodate these PRs.<br> <br>While Singaporeans may be the ones who are forking out top dollar for certain flats, are there cheaper alternatives for the same locations?  And for flats that are much more far flung, are they really that much cheaper?<br> <br>Instead of imposing limits on resale flat prices, the Government can impose limits on the price of new flats sold by the HDB.  In a climate of spiralling prices, the Government should not join in the fray but should hold flat prices steady instead.  That way, the government does not end up making one person happy at the expense of another.  It only makes itself less happy.  Is the government willing to do that?<br> <br>The concessionary loans and grants of $40,000 pale in comparison to the $100,000 to $200,000 increase in flat prices over the last three years.<br> <br>While 8 in 10 Singaporeans pay for their flats entirely through their CPFs, they will have to keep paying for the next 30 years and would have nothing left in their CPF for retirement.  You call that affordable?<br> <br>Politics is, first and foremost, about satisfying the needs of the people.  All popular revolutions and uprisings stem from inadequate provisions from the government.  The art of communication cannot change the feelings of hardship that the people has to endure.<br> <br> <br>Thank you<br> <br> <br><strong>Ng Kok Lim</strong></p>

              <p>Army is also a problem.</p>
              <p>Foreigners or PRs buying the HDB flats have the advantage to work early and younger than most singaporean male. Hence, they will tend to be more rich and accumulate more wealth. This gave them the power to buy more expensive HDB flats.</p>
              <p>1)PRs and Foreigner are not only stealing our flats</p>
              <p>2)They are stealing local girls who want rich guys.</p>
              <p>3)They had already stolen our jobs since 80% of the working population is PRs or foreigners</p>
              <p>Government side with foreigners because foreigners give singapore economy more money and government can get themselves higher pay to tax.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Possible Solutions</strong></p>
              <p>1)First SG people had to do is to strike on compulsory Army.</p>
              <p>Forcing poor sg people to work poor for $500 per month is not acceptable.A government without majority of its sg people forming an army is pretty useless. Or Sg can follow Thailand and revolve for military government.</p>
              <p>Jobs are for foreigners and army is for Sgers coffee pundits?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2)People need to rise up and select a new leader and donate to a new politic organisation to remove PAP's dictatorship once and for all...</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">That revolution is very unlikely to happen as singaporean are coffee pundit and very un-united.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Now almost all the minister are very united because as a member of PAP, you cannot disagree or you will be booted. </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">And most singaporeans are dumb coffee pundits who can't do anything or be united to stand against the government for an idea.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">I am also a dumb coffee pundits... Maybe we wait until this country no longer belongs to singaporeans anymore and ruled by a foreigner president... Then maybe we will think back on history and ponder what we could have change to make it better.....</p>

              <p>Looking back to a report dated 30 April 2009 - the following unemployment situation can be reviewed:-</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; font-size: 9pt;     ">Thursday, April 30, 2009</span></p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.pressrun.net/weblog/2009/04/singapore-job-losses-highest-in-more-than-a-decade.html"><strong>‘Singapore job losses highest in more than a decade’</strong> </a></p>
              <p>More Singaporeans are unemployed now than at any time before in the last five years. The jobless rate for Singaporeans and permanent residents hit a five-year high of 4.8 percent in March up from 3.6 percent in December, according to the <a href="http://www.mom.gov.sg/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #336600;">Ministry of Manpower</span></span></a>.</p>
              <p>The overall unemployment rate, which includes foreign workers in Singapore, rose from 2.5 percent in December to 3.2 percent in March.</p>
              <p><img src="http://i209.photobucket.com/albums/bb111/atobe-album/100221-0245UnemploymentNos2009.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p>More than 12,000 jobs were lost in the first quarter which ended in March – the highest in more than a decade, according to <a href="http://www.mom.gov.sg/publish/momportal/en/communities/others/mrsd/statistics/Retrenchment_and_Redundancy.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #336600;">Ministry of Manpower figures going back to the Asian financial crisis in 1998.</span></span></a></p>
              <p>But that's not the biggest news at the moment as far as one local radio station is concerned, which is giving more coverage to the swine flu which has not yet broken out in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Singapore's Channel NewsAsia website goes one better.  It doesn't even have any reports on uenemployment or joblessness in Singapore at 1.30 pm today! A site search only turned up what labour chief Lim Swee Say had to say two days ago! And nothing about the Manpower Ministry report today!</p>
              <p>But here's the hard news.</p>
              <p>Employers retrenched 10,800 workers, and another 1,800 were released from their contracts early, bringing total job cuts to 12,600 in the first quarter ended in March – up from 9,410 in the last quarter which ended in December.</p>
              <p>That's 3,000 more than the <a href="http://www.mom.gov.sg/publish/momportal/en/communities/others/mrsd/statistics/Retrenchment_and_Redundancy.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #336600;">8,890 jobs lost in the fourth quarter of 2001</span></span></a>, the year of 9/11 and the dot-com bust, the previous worst quarterly figure for job losses.</p>
              <p>The economy shrank a record <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7997581.stm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #336600;">19.7 percent</span></span></a> between January and March.</p>
              <p>Some 9,000 electronics workers lost their jobs, another 2,900 workers were laid off from services and 700 from construction.</p>
              <p>The ministry says these are only preliminary estimates.</p>
              <p>Worryingly, it says not enough new jobs are being created to make up for the job losses.</p>
              <p>The ministry says:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Falling external demand has severely affected the manufacturing sector where employment declined by 19,900, deeper than the 7,000 loss in the earlier quarter. Supported by a strong pipeline of building projects, construction employment grew by 8,500 in the first quarter of 2009, but lower than the gains in the earlier quarters. Services added 10,300 workers, substantially lower than before.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>But it's hardly headline news as far as the Singapore radio station 93.8 is concerned. Top of the news this morning was what Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Wong Kan Seng had to say about what businesses should do if the swine flu breaks out in Singapore and, no, the government is not planning to close the borders as yet. The job losses were reported only at the end of the news bulletin.</p>

              <p>Angel, it cant be 2% unemployment in Sg as the figures dont add up.</p>
              <p>New PR+citizen</p>
              <p>2007 = 90,000</p>
              <p>2008 =100,000</p>
              <p>2009 =140,000 (estimated based on govern objective to add 40K more each yr)</p>
              <p>Total =330,000</p>
              <p>Unemployment @ 2%?? now? which means that Singapore has created 330K jobs over past 3 yrs! (exclude new FT who are not PR or new citizen).. I dont believe that sg has an unemployment rate of 2% which means sg has a full employment!!!</p>
              <p>If this is true than why are so many Singaporean not employ or ppl like us who have to work oversea? To be honest, we are a lucky lot of Singaporean who are highly skill and could find job in PRC. If you think we command a high salary comparing that at home, you are absolutely wrong. Many of us probably are taking equal or lower pay than what we draw in the past.  </p>
              <p>just to be clear, no one, not me, would like to work away from home if there is a job in sg!!</p>
