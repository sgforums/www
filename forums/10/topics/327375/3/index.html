              <p>That said. I've always stood against GST increase but rather an increase in income tax. With income tax, you can target your collection at specific groups who are well within their capability to contribute to society but with GST, everyone is impacted.</p>
              <p>Our government only knows how to reduce tax for the wealthy.. forgot about all the old people when they needed the government the most. And to this that these are the people who helped them stay in power and make Singapore a success..</p>
              <p><br>I see the same fate with us - born and breed Singaporean. We've voted for PAP in the past but they have now found a new source that can carry them through another century.. new PRC citizens. Very soon, we'll all be collecting cans.</p>

              <p><br>Those folks collecting cans did not have to pay income tax in the past, now they have to pay GST 7%. That's like an income tax of 7%.</p>

              <p><br>so you will let ur wife and children suffer? dun forget, you also need to eat. some families i know are only earning like $500-700 per month, not even enough to feed themselves, have to borrow frequently from others to get by.</p>
              <p>IMO, between parents and children, though you need to exercise filial piety, but still, children are ur main priority. you would want to give ur child the best you can offer, help them get out of the poverty trap. ur parents at most live a few more yrs in poverty and hardship. if u neglect ur child, ur child will be trapped in the poverty cycle for the rest of his or her lifetime. and if that happens, the same thing is going to happen to you in the future.</p>
              <p>and about insurance schemes. yeah. i also agree that singapore policies are over rated. it is extremely hard to claim insurance unlike the ease in which u hand money over to these companies.</p>
              <p>in fact, i think you will save more if u do long term deposits with ur money, and somemore it is more flexible then insurance too.</p>

              <p>what a waste of food when people are starving, earning only $10/ week.</p>
              <p>i think the mediacorp artistes also abit out of touch with reality. you don't see them often in the public, and so i guess they probably don't know the extent of the social issues plaguing the society.</p>

              <p>The issue is whether the teacher in charge of the project knows that they were ppls depended on the cans to meet their ends meet?</p>
              <p>If yes, did the teachers want the kids to know the reality?</p>
              <p>If no, I think the teachers must send to the ground to learn how some of our poors live in Sinkapore?</p>
              <p>Is breaking the record is so important?if yes,how to achieve it?</p>
              <p>Can it be done by other alternative methods?</p>
              <p>I think our teachers are living in ivory tower and out of touch of the ground in Sinkapore!!!Teachers are playing politic in school to get promotion by carrying balls instead of our children's interests at heart just like the dogs here who r civil servants!!!</p>

              <p>And yet there are people whom are 30+ that can survive without

                  incase (touch wood) something happens to me... and yet, there are
