              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Don't you people know that making old people suffer is FAP policy???!!! They look at silliporeans as their workers to help them and their cronies make more and more money. What better way to ensure that silliporeans work as hard as possible than to make sure that those that cannot make it suffer in their old age?They will also make many policies that ensure many will not make it and will suffer.<br></span></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Work harder silliporeans, for the FAP will ensure that when you are old; they would ensure that prices will be so high you will suffer if you do not work at least 15 hours a day and stress yourself so much that you get cancer, NOW.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><br></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">In the meantime, they will flood the country with cheap foreigners to ensure that wages do not go up with the rising cost of housing and medical services. As you can see, Australian salaries are three time higher and the prices for houses and cars a pittance compared to sillipore.</span></strong></p>

              <p>That said. I've always stood against GST increase but rather an increase in income tax. With income tax, you can target your collection at specific groups who are well within their capability to contribute to society but with GST, everyone is impacted.</p>
              <p>Our government only knows how to reduce tax for the wealthy.. forgot about all the old people when they needed the government the most. And to this that these are the people who helped them stay in power and make Singapore a success..</p>
              <p><br>I see the same fate with us - born and breed Singaporean. We've voted for PAP in the past but they have now found a new source that can carry them through another century.. new PRC citizens. Very soon, we'll all be collecting cans.</p>
