              <p>cleaners' job are basically taken up by foreign workers already,
              imo. they are deemed cheaper and `quicker'.</p>
              <p>for the fastfood industry, i suspect there is a ratio or quota
              they enforce when hiring seniors. after all, all the macs and
              kfcs need to project a youthful, vibrant image. there is so
              many seniors they can hire without jeopardising their image.</p>
              <p>lastly, i think many of the seniors we see collecting cans are
              also illiterate. it makes them barely employable in today's
              context.</p>

              <p>The way I see it. It is not purely FT fault. It should be combination of factors at play. The global world, the policies of the govt, the blatant, exploitive employers, the MOM, the ambivalent attitude of the ppl etc ....</p>

              <p>but why need to go around collect cans? i bet they themselves buy can drinks too. so many schools involved, just get the students in the participating schools to help la. like set up bins for cans in school compounds which will be used for this project la. like that also cannot figure out meh. with mediacock invovled, they also can get at their canteen mah.</p>

              <p>Hold on, don't be so emotional.</p>
              <p>Yes i agree, there are plenty to be done for our seniors who may
              not fully benefit from the CPF system due to late introduction.</p>
              <p>But i also think that they themselves, being strong-willed and
              determined as they used to be, should seek our better alternatives
              rather than the gathering cans. For example maybe working at a

              sitting in the comfort of my home behind my com, but i do think

              <p>With our help and their never-say-die attitude, they will surely

              <p>Yes, it is stupid. Like the Chinese saying "who want to be bald if have hair"? You think the old folk would prefer to go collect trash can if they can have a proper job as a stall helper (which probably pay at least 10 times more than what they are earning!!!).</p>
              <p>If you are a store owner, would you hire an elderly who is slow and take like 5 min to clear 1 table and have problem remembering order?</p>
              <p>Oh yes, I remember there's still a job around for them. Nowadays, everywhere I go, I see old people starting to sell tissue papers too. But seriously, people who buy from them is usually due to compassion more than the need (it's cheaper and quite convenient to go and buy tissue paper from any convenient store instead when needed anyway).</p>
