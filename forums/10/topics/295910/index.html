            <div class='col-md body'>we don't have a minimum wage because it would drive up production/ops cost. And we certainly can't have a min wage for singaporeans because companies have lots of 'foreign talents' to turn to for much lower wages.<br><br>The argument the government would necessarily give is that the Min wage would hurt those that the plan would orginally aid.<br><br>However, i think there is much literature on how singapore can have a minimum wage etc.... but my personal view is to remain competitive, this seemingly lack of welfare is a short term pain for long term competitive advantage.</div>

An when theres a  huge exogenous supply of labour, definitely wages will drop as the firms employ labour at low wage rates. That definitely does not help push up domestic wage rates at all.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by walesa:</div><div class="quote_body">Try naming one country with a higher GDP per capita than this regime that actually has policies permitting the wanton hiring of foreigners on a scale that matches this fascist regime....</div></blockquote>Im afraid I can't as I don't have the exact statistic of any other country that has  a higher GDP per capita than Singapore and has the equivalent or even higher rate of allowing foreign workers to enter the labour market. But I daresay that Singapore could be easily in the top 10.</div>

Minimum wage may also compel business to improve productivity.</div></blockquote>Im sure it does. However the initial corporate tax rate was implemented to match the competitive corporate tax rates in Hong Kong. In that sense, its to bring Singapore's competitiveness level on par with its nearest and strongest competitor.<br><br>An implementation of a minimum wage rate would effectively net off the existing corporate tax rate (as highlighted by yourself) and would also net off any grounds made to improve the competitiveness level arising from the initial corporate tax cut.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by kilua:</div><div class="quote_body">Minimum wage may also compel business to improve productivity.</div></blockquote>I agree. That is one of the Pros of having a Minimum wage rate policy.<br></div>

Maybe a monthly rate for full time, an hourly rate for Part-timers. Need not be very high, like in Aussie for example, where its 500 plus a week. A calculated amount so that whoever works a secured a lively-hood.<br><br>Enough to pay for roof (rental or otherwise) and enuff to settle 3 meals a day, basic clothing, bus fare, clean water and other basic amenities. Maybe around 1.2k? just a very rough estimate. I don't see it raising business cost very much.<br><br>Employers and business owners that are not even paying their employees enough to afford the above amenities will feel the most impact, and employers in this category deserve that impact.<br><br>Maybe a heavier levy can be induced for hiring of low skilled foreign workers. Maybe concessions for Construction sector, depending on the sector performance at the time.<br><br>2) Welfare only for those who cannot work, unfit for work (medicaly etc..)<br><br></div>
