They account for about 1.5 per cent of the population, which means three out of every 200 people here are millionaires. </span><br><br><span class="small"><span style="color: #444444;">June 29, 2007<br>AsiaOne </span></span><br><br><span style="color: indigo;">Tiny Singapore saw the fastest increase globally in the number of high-net-worth individuals. The number of people with more than US$1 million in financial assets excluding their home rose 21.2 per cent to 66,660.<br><br>Singapore's pace was closely followed by India, where the number of millionaires rose 20.5 percent to 100,015, and Indonesia where growth was 16 percent to 20,000, according to the latest Merrill Lynch and Capgemini world wealth annual report.<br><br>"Singapore is a little boat of 4.5 million people that floats very nicely when the global economy is doing well," Mark Matthews, Merrill Lynch's chief Asia strategist told a news conference in Singapore yesterday.<br><br>"As you can see from these numbers, Singapore's growth has accelerated -- not only economic growth, but also savings."<br><br>About 11,660 newly minted millionaires, defined as those with financial asswets of over US$1 million (S$1.54 million), joined the ranks here last year, the survey of the well-to-do- in 71 countries found.<br><br>This is the second time in three years that Singapore has posted the highest growth globally, which comes amid a booming stock market, strong economy and a property boom.<br><br>Noted Mr Matthews: "We think Singapore is in the midst of an impressive transition. It is to South-east Asia what Miami was to Latin America, a place where the wealthy come to bank their money, educate their children and get culture.<br><br>"Now we think Singapore is metamorphosing into a Zurich and Monaco not just for South-east Asia but for all of Asia.<br><br>"It is become a very important financial hub and it will become a leisure hub as well. for that reason, we're very bullish on Singapore."<br><br>The 66,660 millionaires account for about 1.5 per cent of the population, which means three out of every 200 people here are millionaires.<br><br>To qualify, these well-heeled types must have a million bucks in assets not counting that widely used barometer of wealth - the home. Other investments in real estates are included.<br><br>The survey shows that the number of millionaires in Asia jumped last year, pushing their combined wealth up 10.5 per cent to $8.4 trillion, but growth is expected to slow in line with a cooling global economy.<br><br>Strong economic expansion, led by China and India -- the world's two fastest growing major economies -- robust foreign direct investments and growing confidence in the region have swelled the ranks of Asia's rich, the annual survey shows.<br><br>"In the Asia Pacific, the high net-worth population accelerated from 7.3 percent in 2005 to 8.6 percent in 2006 (to 2.6 million)," Victor Tan, Merrill's Asia Pacific chief equity strategist, told a media briefing in Hong Kong.<br><br>Soaring wealth, high savings and ample potential have made Asia the world's hottest market for international and private banks seeking to cater to the rich.<br><br>Standard Chartered Plc. , for example, launched its private banking business in India this month, looking for a slice of the action in Asia's second-fastest growing economy that is dominated by Merrill Lynch and Citigroup .<br><br>Hong Kong's wealthy grew 12.2 percent to 86,618, ranking the city as the 10th fastest in the world.<br><br>Willie Chan, another Merrill equity strategist, said the city's relatively slower growth rate was due to a high-base effect as the number of wealthy people had risen sharply in 2005.<br><br>China, with an economy growing at 10.5 percent in 2006, saw a 7.8 percent increase in wealthy individuals to 345,000.<br><br>By comparison, disposable per capita income of urban Chinese was 11,759 yuan in 2006 or about $1,545, according to official data from state news agency Xinhua.<br><br>Further details of how Asian countries ranked by wealth will be revealed in an Asia Pacific survey due in October.<br><br>The report also showed that wealthy investors had shifted more money into property at the expense of other investments, lured by high returns from commercial real estate investments and real estate investment trusts.<br><br>The trend was most dramatic in the Asia Pacific, where 29 percent of assets from wealthy individuals was held in real estate, up from 16 percent a year ago, the report showed.<br><br>"Looking forward to year-end 2008, high-net-worth individuals are likely to shift their allocation back towards alternative investments after realising profits in their real estate investments," Tan said.<br><br>But rising interest rates globally may sap the strong cash flows that have helped to drive recent growth, and economic growth in Asia and Latin America was expected to ease as global demand slowed, the report said.<br><br>The biggest risk that could hurt global economic expansion, and in turn wealth expansion, would be if the Chinese economy unexpectedly slowed down, Matthews said.<br><br>But so far there was little likelihood of such a slowdown happening in the near future, he added.<br><br>Global assets held by wealthy investors rose 11.4 percent to $37.2 trillion in 2006, but that is set to slow to a 6.8 percent annual rate between 2006 and 2011 to US$51.6 trillion.<br><br>In Asia Pacific, the growth rate is seen slowing to 8.5 percent per annum. </span><br><br>Reference:<br><br><a href="http://news.asiaone.com.sg/a1news/20070629_story7_1.html" rel="nofollow">Asia1.com</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Not bad...with the recent civil servant and ministerial salary hike, how many have joined the infamous ranks of millionaires off taxpayer's monies by writing their own blank cheques?<br><br>We must be the only country in the world where we 'pay' our ministers ridiculous millions to manage a country of just over 4 million ppl.<br><br>Along with the next article, i was thinking along the lines of...Does many of our govt agencies need downsizing, given their obvious lack of efficiency and need for multiple redundancy?<br><br><strong><span style="color: red;"><span class="large">Why are the public, bus drivers treated differently? </span></span></strong><br><strong><span class="small"><span style="color: blue;">Jun 29, 2007<br>The Straits Times </span></span></strong><br><br>IN THE face of increasing assaults on bus drivers, police have said that such attacks will not be tolerated.<br>Those who assault bus drivers will be prosecuted under Section 323 of the Penal Code and police investigations were initiated in all cases, except when the drivers themselves did not want to pursue the matter.<br><br>I read a few letters in the Forum in April, also referring to the above legislation. The letters are 'Punched and hit but police won't be taking action' (ST, April 4), 'When is an offence seizable?' (ST, April 6) and 'Why that advice to lodge magistrate's complaint' (ST, April 14).<br><br>The letters started with a Ms Kong Lai Meng who had been assaulted asking why the police did not go on to detain the suspect, and ended with a reply from the police force.<br><br>From the letters, it seems that a complaint has to be lodged with a magistrate before police can initiate action. In cases where grievous hurt was caused or weapons were used, offenders would be charged under Section 325 or 324 instead.<br><br>This being the case, how could the police say beforehand that they will initiate investigations and charge offenders under Section 323? Surely, more information is required before the police can take action.<br><br>Unless there is a fundamental difference between a bus driver and a regular guy on the street, police should take the same stand. It seems that bus drivers can opt out of police investigations whereas common citizens have to opt in by filing a report with a magistrate.<br><br>Chew Mun Kit<br><br><a href="http://news.asiaone.com.sg/st/st_20070629_133899.html" rel="nofollow">Asia1.com</a><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>With outsourcing becoming the latest in-thing for govt agencies, a downsizing of workscope (think police's inability to make any arrest for public assault except on civil servants), upping of civil service pay (for doing less)...maybe our govt should downsize and re-structure all Govt agencies across the board.<br><br>This will definitely reduce our tax expenditure on unnecessary spending.
