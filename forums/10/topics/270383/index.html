            <div class='col-md body'><strong>It was an eye-popping figure, even in the midst of a property market boom Â— and it turned out to be too good to be true.<br><br>On Saturday, The Straits Times ran an article on HDB rents hitting a 10-year high.<br><br>Citing rental figures from property agencies, ST reported Â— also listing other transactions in various locations Â— that a 3-room unit in Block 253 in Jurong East St 24 fetched a monthly rental of $2,500.<br><br>But the figure turned out to be inaccurate, after an alert blogger did his own investigations and published the findings on his blog.<br><br>Mr Alex Au, who runs the yawningbread.org website, told TODAY that the unrealistic figure raised his eyebrows, especially since he lived just a few blocks away from Block 253.<br><br>With a digital camera in hand, Mr Au visited the block and found that it was half-empty.<br><br>He asked: "Why would a new tenant pay premium rates when there are so many unoccupied flats on offer?"<br><br>When contacted by TODAY, ERA Singapore, which provided the data on the Jurong East transaction, acknowledged its mistake.<br><br>Its vice-president Eugene Lim said: "It was a transaction in 2005, but it was actually for two units of 3-room flats that were combined. Under the data churned out by our computer, it was classified as a 3-room flat transaction Â… You can call it human error or computer error."<br><br>Mr Lim added that the "jumbo" flat was rented to a company to house its foreign workers.<br><br>TODAY verified the claim when it visited Block 253.<br><br>ST said in a statement that the newspaper had "verified the accuracy of the information with ERA before going to print".<br><br>But after questions were raised over the flat, the paper investigated further.<br><br>"We found that the $2,500 monthly rental was being paid for a 'jumbo' flat in Block 253 which comprised two adjoining 3-room flats," it said.<br><br>Over at Block 510 Woodlands Drive 14 Â— also cited in the ST report Â— residents said they were "surprised" at the $2,200 monthly rent that an executive unit at their block fetched.<br><br>But Mr P Wang, who bought his four-room unit for $260,000 in February, felt the high rent was "possible".<br><br>The 32-year-old technician said: "It could be a one-off, given the booming property market."<br><br>Earlier, Minister for National Development Mah Bow Tan had expressed his concern over reports of record property prices.<br><br>Mr Au agreed that the media had to be "very careful" with information supplied by third parties, "especially when there might be a vested interest".<br><br>The latest episode goes to show how the mainstream media and the blogosphere could complement each other in revealing "the truth", he added. "Working together in a more active media scene benefits everybody." - TODAY/ra  </strong><br><br>Shows even more that the newspapers can't be trusted lately. Especially with the property prices boom, and they publish an article like that...<br><br>Sheesh.<br><br></div>
