              <p>I can understand where you are comming from. Being a woman, and having no first hand experience on military service, espacially on the battlefronts, it is common for you to think our military is inferior.</p>
              <p>More so if you hear coffee shop talk. Most guys will gripe and whine out of uniform, but when you start telling them NS is useless, or demean our military in anyway, they will defend it heartily.</p>
              <p>While Spore has not face battles, thankfully, there is no reason to believe they are incapable, or just to pass time. It is a sad notion to adopt on our men who accepted military rule instead of civilian rule freedom type of employment. Be glad we still have these regulars to train the next generations and be the backbone of our army.</p>
              <p>But if it is battles that you seek, then look no further back than the rescue of hostages in Changi Airport 1991, flight SQ119.</p>
              <p>'Get down, we're Singaporeans! We're here to rescue you!' the lead commando shouted. Hundred over citizens and foriegners were rescued, the terrorists, all of them shot dead, within 30seconds on storming the aircraft.</p>

              <p>Also, ego-boosting much? Writing such insipid rhetoric as <em>Try our
              men in a war, and be prepared to pay the River Styx's ferrymen
              price.  </em>really does wonders in making you feel good about your pitiful existence, does it?</p>
