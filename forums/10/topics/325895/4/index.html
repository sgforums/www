              <p><br>That would obviously be impratical, because it would require a massive renegotiation of the current agreement between UK and SG. Understand that the Gurkhas are there for a "worst case" scenario, and if they have to be deployed in that capacity, SG is probably in some serious deep sh1t.</p>
              <p>And like I said, that is the actual reason for our use of Gurkhas, whether you like it or not, and regardless of how much or how strongly u debate against it.

              <p>So is the Gurkha army in UK the private army of PM Gordon Brown?</p>
              <p>You seemed to have skimped the question raised by me. What makes a rule by P4P different from ALL the other countries in the world? You mooted the point to which you have privy, that it's the philosophical and governance doctrine that makes us different to others in the whole wide world. But when I asked that you give credence to your points raised, you shy away. If you raised a point, surely you must have evidence to support your point, or was it all conjectures a wisp of smoke (hopefully not the smoke someone is smoking).</p>

              <p>Like I said, im not about to do YOUR homework for you. Within most of the UK there isn't any need for Gurkhas actually.

              <p><span style="color: #008080;">Gurkhas are here because:</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #008080;">1) Chinese police/soldiers fire on Malay/Indian rioters. What do you think the consequences would be?</span></strong></p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #008080;">3) Indian police/soldiers fire on Chinese/Malay rioters. What do you think the consequences would be?</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #008080;">Regardless of whether it was just a coincidence that someone doing their job had to fire on someone else coincidentially from another race, you can be sure that the bad press would be put to good use, hence the reason Gurkhas are in SINGAPORE. At no time did I ever mention that what I say applies to any other country besides SINGAPORE.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #008080;">Appreciate the trouble you went to to dig all that up, but the explanation is much simpler.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It would give you much credibility in your arguments instead of the usual responses of, "is such an over simplification of things that you're either grasping at straws to win a loosing verbal fight or it really betrays a very simple, naive thinking process. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">".</p>
              <p>I suppose such statements will make your points look strong? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>For the most part of the points I raised, you have neither refute it or raised any other points to counter it. You just make snide remarks, kind of juvenile don't you think, or maybe you are juvenile.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So what you are saying is that, during a racially charged episode, our own SPF would not be professional enough to handle it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>On the other hand, has the presence of Gurkhas prevented riots racial or otherwise?</p>

              <p>Like I said, for the 3rd time, ask someone in the know, and you see if its your ignorance that you cannot face up to, or if it's me smoking something.</p>
              <p>You can doubt till the cows come home, but the facts stay as they are regardless. Facts don't change themselves just because someone is ignorant and disbelieving about them.</p>

              <p><br>Singapore is small and easy to manage, that I agree. But that doesn't have anything to do with the use of Gurkhas to reduce the likelihood of racial tension.</p>
              <p>So are you talking about the use of foreign military for the suppression of racial tensions or the used of Gurkhas to massacre ALL Singaporeans? There is a difference between the two, Malays, Chinese and Indians are of different race. Ireland and UK are the same race just different country, moreover what you quoted was a dispute between the unification of Ireland and UK, much like the Civil War of USA. What form of racial riot is this? Or is it a racial issue at all?</p>
              <p>I am asking you to rebutt my points, but seems like all you and Fatum can do is cast insults. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"></p>

              <p><br> I am very sure racial divide exist, as per my earlier post. But my
              point of contention is, how does Gurkhas mitigate the racial

              race factor and its history in singapore.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #008080;">Gurkhas are here
              because:</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #008080;">1) Chinese police/soldiers

              <p><strong><span style="color: #008080;">2) Malay police/soldiers

              police/soldiers fire on Chinese/Malay rioters. What do you think
              the consequences would be?</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #008080;">Regardless of whether it was just
              a coincidence that someone doing their job had to fire on someone
              else coincidentially from another race, you can be sure that the
              bad press would be put to good use, hence the reason Gurkhas are in
              SINGAPORE. At no time did I ever mention that what I say applies to
              any other country besides SINGAPORE.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #008080;">Appreciate the trouble you went to
              to dig all that up, but the explanation is much simpler.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It would give you much credibility in your arguments instead of
              the usual responses of, "is such an over simplification of things
              that you're either grasping at straws to win a loosing verbal fight
              or it really betrays a very simple, naive thinking process.
              <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">".</p>
              <p>I suppose such statements will make your points look strong?
              <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>For the most part of the points I raised, you have neither
              refute it or raised any other points to counter it. You just make
              snide remarks, kind of juvenile don't you think, or maybe you are
              juvenile.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So what you are saying is that, during a racially charged
              episode, our own SPF would not be professional enough to handle
              it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>On the other hand, has the presence of Gurkhas prevented riots
              racial or otherwise?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I do not support the opposition, I only support what is good and

              <p>The struggle in NI was a religious and political(national) one. Most everyday citizens couldn't be bothered either way, although during the independence process of Ireland, NI voted to remain part of GB. You also need to understand that while NI, Scotland, Wales and England are all part of GB, they see themselves as distinct nationalities. Hence I mentioned it was very much a nationalistic struggle, and when things are nationalistic it means politics.</p>
              <p>NONE of it was about the Unification of Ireland and GB, since Ireland sought and received independence from GB, while NI was always part of GB. There is no unification movement or anti-unification movement for the simple fact that there was NO unification.</p>

              <p>Good that you quoted the Malaysian article.</p>
              <p>Are you suggesting that the SAF be replaced by the Gurkhas? Of course with the benefit of hindsight, one can say the use of Gurkha would be suitable in such situation. But say there is a national emergency and the SAF was deployed country wide to suppress the riotings. Does this mean that the whole of the SAF would have to be replaced by the Gurkhas, since without this benefit of hindsight. How would you know where would possible racial tensions occur.</p>
              <p>During all these riots, the Gurkhas was in Singapore, did it stopped or mitigated the riots?</p>
              <p>If you look at my previous post, I have made little support for specific opposition political party, to one particular opposition candidate, I just asked that people remain objective and not be swayed by propaganda from the media. I don't deny that the opposition is weak, nobody fits the bill ascribed by me. The reason for a weak opposition is the machinations of an old man. But that doesn't cow me into voting for them. I believe that for a stronger opposition to happen, it must be led by the overthrow of this current dominant force, despite voting in a weaker opposition force for the first term. Else, there will never ever be a stronger opposition force.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Let's face it, racial tensions do occur, for the government to placate the dissenting rioters, a proper judicial inquiry has to be conducted. Not the use of violence to quell another violence. Haven't we not heard the all too familiar "violence begets violence", the Israel and the Palestinians are good examples.</p>

              <p>1) They send in the Gurkhas and proceed to bludgeon everybody up to a pulp, impose curfew, beat up violators again.</p>
