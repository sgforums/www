              <p>The SAF personnel came to my school to give talk to the Pre-university boys which are gonna enlist into NS soon.The talk is about how BMT training is like.. march 32km.. "Dig your own grave",Night time pasar malam etc etc...while during the talk,the PRC students fell asleep...........</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Just feeling dam sad lah...Just got some questions...</p>
              <p>1.) We Singapore boys gotta go through that list to items in NS training to while the PRC students come here and get subsidized education via OUR OWN SINGAPOREAN S TAXPAYER money,snatching our universities places while we go for NS.</p>
              <p>2.After graduate,they go into job market again snatching our rice bowl....</p>
              <p>3.) although 20% of university places are reserved for foreigners.. that means that the 80% will be left to Singaporeans??  i got a PRC classmate came here as a foreigner and keep on renewing her permit until now she is a citizen... She can apply for university as a SINGAPORE CITIZEN.. then with a population of 500,000 PRCs in Singapore, how many of the 80% university seats are actually meant for the locals....</p>
              <p>4.) SAF ppl mentioned about manpower shortage and mention about possibility of enlisting female into NS... how can we bear to let our dear ones enlist into NS..</p>
              <p>While we singaporeans are enlisting to NS to defend the island of singapore so the PRCs can continue reaping off our hardwork for the nation,and in time of crisis they can just packed their bags leave for better developed countries with their degrees earned via our taxpayers money?</p>
              <p>i really respect those very few true talents like some asean scholarship holder ive seen. But  too many of the PRCs migrated into singapore are just ....</p>
              <p>HuH!?</p>

              <p>i can tell u one thing, The PRC will better apprciate their China government after they have spent some tine here. A PRC told me, that. after she came to singapore, PRC gorverment seems so much better to her.</p>
              <p>and seriously foreigners will cry if they go to NS. We singaporeans are defintely more stronger minded than them.</p>

              <p>this is psychology, when some foreigner comes to singapore, he or she finds that its not rosy as they first thought it was. So psychology will tell u is just go back to their own country after earning some money and be with their loved ones. 2 things advantages they are getting = money + reunite with family after their brief stint in singapore. So in this situation, they are mch better off than they have never left their country.</p>
              <p>I am really sorry that our govt has been taken in for a ride.</p>

              <p>its not easy to make it with polytechnic results. Because only 20 % places for all 5 plotechnics and yr chances are good to zero. Unless u are a brilliant student in polytechnic. If thats the case u wouldnt have gone polytechnic anyway.</p>

              <p><br>its an <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">open</span></strong> secret that tim huxley wrote in the book 'defending the lion city' somewhere in year 2000 that we use the forward defence strategy... our borders r still defenced by he believed is 2PDF. then the 21RDF [21 rapid deployment force] like guards units will cheong behind the enemy line and set up a line of barrier defence, then cheong down geographically towards singapore, somewhat creating a circle where the enemy force cut off of their supplies.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>air force defence with its multi-umbrella throng strategy as seen in its defence watch video years back. .e.g surface to air missiles...<br><br>navy protects the sea lines of communications.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>?SIR protects key installations like jurong island, airports...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>with direct foreign investment $$, properties and everything, how u want to fight here? rebuilding the island and the economy will be a repeat of what ur parents, grandparents do again since WW2.</p>

              <p>The SAF personnel came to my school to give talk to the Pre-university boys which are gonna enlist into NS soon.The talk is about how BMT training is like.. march 32km.. "Dig your own grave",Night time pasar malam etc etc...while during the talk,the PRC students fell asleep...........</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Just feeling dam sad lah...Just got some questions...</p>
              <p>1.) We Singapore boys gotta go through that list to items in NS training to while the PRC students come here and get subsidized education via OUR OWN SINGAPOREAN S TAXPAYER money,snatching our universities places while we go for NS.</p>
              <p>2.After graduate,they go into job market again snatching our rice bowl....</p>
              <p>3.) although 20% of university places are reserved for foreigners.. that means that the 80% will be left to Singaporeans??  i got a PRC classmate came here as a foreigner and keep on renewing her permit until now she is a citizen... She can apply for university as a SINGAPORE CITIZEN.. then with a population of 500,000 PRCs in Singapore, how many of the 80% university seats are actually meant for the locals....</p>
              <p>4.) SAF ppl mentioned about manpower shortage and mention about possibility of enlisting female into NS... how can we bear to let our dear ones enlist into NS..</p>
              <p>While we singaporeans are enlisting to NS to defend the island of singapore so the PRCs can continue reaping off our hardwork for the nation,and in time of crisis they can just packed their bags leave for better developed countries with their degrees earned via our taxpayers money?</p>
              <p>i really respect those very few true talents like some asean scholarship holder ive seen. But  too many of the PRCs migrated into singapore are just ....</p>
              <p>HuH!?</p>
