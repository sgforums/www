              <p>What makes you think they <em>can</em> kill in the face of enemy
              fire?</p>
              <p>Look at how spoilt Singaporean guys are. The most they've seen
              of blood or gore is perhaps in CS or some other FPS games. Do they
              even have any idea how putrid corpses smell? Do they know how
              crippling pain from bullet wounds can be? Can they overcome years
              of conditioning that killing is bad?</p>
              <p>Huh. it's not as if those signallers never brought their own
              equipment along. If they'd tried to salvage and restore the
              communications grid using nothing but destroyed and damaged local
              equipment, then perhaps they'd deserve more respect.</p>
              <p>How much more macsuline are Singapore's neighbours compared to
              Singapore's guys? Oh i don't know, garang enough to rob and steal?
              Garang enough to fight NSmen and win? Garang enough to defy
              authority?</p>

              <p>In reply to your first sentence...you raise a valid point...but it all depends on the training. As they say, whenever a person appears in a crosshair, he ceases to exist. No qualms about morals, especially when he's trying to kill you.</p>
              <p>Your second paragraph. I'm sure our boys who went to aceh for Operation Flying Eagle can tell you in detail how a dead body smells like, or how does it feel to pluck a dead baby boy's arm out of the rubble.</p>

              <p><br>That's easy to say, in practice, it's another story. Our military is largely a conscript military. The problem with conscripts is that you KNOW they're not all hardcore nutjobs, so you simply have no way of knowing which way they're going to react till sh1t hits the fan. How many of our boys have actually fired a rifle in anger? Too small to be indicative, to be honest.</p>

Professional pride for many captains I know means even IF someone has responsibility of the ship, the buck stops with them, and they often would rather take the blame. Of course I know how it works. No need to be patronising just because u mistakenly think I do not know anything of such SOPs. But of course Courageous' captain doesnt want to ruin his nice army pension does he? How else is he going to keep up with mortgage payments for his nice home lol</p>

              <p>Hmm....on the other hand, if you're blissfully ignorant then SAF must be doing a good job allowing you not to know ANYTHING.</p>

              have no way of knowing which way they're going to react till sh1t

Almost all Singaporeans, on the other hand, resemble the cosseted pansies in NYC when it comes to physical toughness.
