              <p>If you'd bother to research, most US troops are hicks that come from poorer, rural areas where hunting is a pastime and gunfights are common. Almost all Singaporeans, on the other hand, resemble the cosseted pansies in NYC when it comes to physical toughness. But of course those NYC pansies have not undergone the mindwashing effect of NS, so in the end they're still tougher than SG NS guys.</p>

              <p><br>"I've already conceded that there's no point explaining to CIVILIANS about the intricacies about the armed forces. Like that tagline for the ladie's credit card....THEY JUST DONT GET IT"</p>
              <p>The insinuation is there.</p>
              <p>And no, you still don't get it. "Firing your weapon in anger" in common military usage does not refer to firing it in a fit of anger. In a military context, 'to <strong><em>fire in anger</em></strong>' means to shoot for a purpose in war. I wonder who the civilian here really is.</p>
              <p>Finally, I don't mean either. I mean the British Cadets. Trust me, My CQB training involves them, as well as ex and current serving British military personnel(including SAS, Royal Marines etc), ex and current serving Territorial Army personal.</p>

Doesnt mean i have to get personal about it. Since you're here bragging about your credentials, i believe you've read about the Marines retaliation strike on Fallujah after 4 blackwater guys were murdered during a convoy operation. THAT is what happens when you get angry. You make emotion-based decisions. And all of us in the military know what a fat lot of good that does.</p>
