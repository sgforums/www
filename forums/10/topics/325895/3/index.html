              <p>You people realise thats what the Gurkhas are there for? To do a job because they have no vested interests in this country?</p>
              <p>Also If ClaT is talking about hiring an army, you realise nobody is going to let u hire their national army right? Closest we've come are the Gurkhas. If you're hiring anyone it'd be PMCs and that'd probably mean people like Blackwater.</p>
              <p>Then again xtreyier I think u're a bit naive when you say our local police personnel act with compassion towards their own citizen. Just because they aren't going to murder you in cold blood for greenbucks doesn't mean they're compassionate. It just means they haven't got what it takes, hardly makes them Mother Theresa.</p>

              <p><br>heard of the French foreign legions? they hire foreigners to fight for them, in exchange for citizenship. the USA also do it too, as i recall from a Times article. the male immigrants sign up with the US army to fight in Iraq, allowing his family to gain a US citizenship.</p>
              <p>and regarding the creation of jobs and boosting of our economy with foreigners. well, IMO, we need definitely need foreigners, but certainly not an influx of them. of singapore's population of 4.5 million, there are 1million foreigners currently in singapore. 1 million ppl is alot, seriously, when you consider that all of these 1m people are here to work and study. whereas, we have elderly and the young in the remaining 3.5m local population.</p>
              <p>so, it can be said that foreigners took up a significant number of places in school and at the workplace.</p>
              <p>and do we need so many foreigners? sure, they do work in factories, etc. but what is the point of having a foreign owned factory staffed with foreign workers? You may as well build the factory in China, Malaysia etc. no need to import both the factory and its workers to singapore.</p>
              <p>our service industry, originally intended for locals, when we begin the transition from a manufacturing economy to a service industry, is also fast saturated with foreigners. just go to any food court, and you will see that it is almost 70% staffed with foreigners. i see foreigners selling everything from western food, indian food to laksa. i even saw PRC selling roti pratas. that's like so wth....</p>
              <p>and are their presence really helping singaporeans to boost our standard of living? we don't have many local firms around to hire our specialist university graduates .e.g. engineers, researchers. most of the job offers in these sectors come from MNCs, who chose singapore because of our strategic location and highly educated english speaking workforce. low wage is secondary. if they are really looking out for low wage worker, they probably won't even consider singapore in the first place.</p>
              <p>but now, the situation is that these MNCs realise that cheap foreign workers are abundant in singapore, and work permits are very easy to obtain for foreign workers. so we are seeing MNCs bringing in their own foreign workers to singapore to work, bypassing locals.</p>
              <p>a significant example is engineering. the supply of cheap indian and chinese engineers have depreciate the pay of engineers to peanuts, less than 1/3 the pay of what engineers can get in Australia. is it healthy competition we are talking about?</p>
              <p>IMO, what singapore needs is citizens, not PRs. we should not even subsidise PRs and foreigners in our university at all. $6000 a yr is dirt cheap, for any overseas education. unless these people take up citizenship, we should allow them to leech off us, jumping ship after they extract all they could from our economy. How many of these PR actually stay on in Singapore as citizens? few. too few, in fact.</p>
              <p> what we want is a citizenship of diverse backgrounds. we don't need that many not-so-permanent Permanent Residents around.</p>

              <p><br>Have you met the regulars within the SAF?  Half of them are so inept and bloated within their own egos. Life for them is an endless series of exploiting conscripts in doing work which the regulars are supposed to be doing in exchange for accepting the proverbial "King's shilling", having some meeting or another at the officer's mess, generally putting on a big show. No doubt the other half are good, hardworking people, but when half your force is full of people who only signed up because even the factories do not want them on their packing lines, and who do not even want to do the bare minimum for an honest pay, how well do you think they'll perform in times of an actual war?</p>

              <p><strong>Martial law</strong> is the system of rules that takes effect when the military takes control of the normal administration of justice.</p>
              <p>Martial law is sometimes imposed during <a title="War" href="/wiki/War"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">wars</span></span></a> or <a class="mw-redirect" title="Occupied territory" href="/wiki/Occupied_territory"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">occupations</span></span></a> in the absence of any other civil government. Examples of this form of military rule include Germany and Japan after World War II or the American South during the early stages of <a title="Reconstruction era of the United States" href="/wiki/Reconstruction_era_of_the_United_States"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Reconstruction</span></span></a>. In addition it is used by governments to enforce their rule, for example after a <a title="Coup d'état" href="/wiki/Coup_d%27%C3%A9tat"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">coup d'état</span></span></a> (<a title="2006 Thai coup d'état" href="/wiki/2006_Thai_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Thailand 2006</span></span></a>), when threatened by popular protests (<a title="Tiananmen Square protests of 1989" href="/wiki/Tiananmen_Square_protests_of_1989"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Tiananmen Square protests of 1989</span></span></a>), or to crack down on the opposition (<a title="Martial law in Poland" href="/wiki/Martial_law_in_Poland"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Poland 1981</span></span></a>). Martial law can also be declared in cases of major <a title="Natural disaster" href="/wiki/Natural_disaster"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">natural disasters</span></span></a>; however most countries use a different legal construct, such as a "<a title="State of emergency" href="/wiki/State_of_emergency"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">state of emergency</span></span></a>".</p>
              <p>In many countries, martial law imposes particular rules, one of which is <a title="Curfew" href="/wiki/Curfew"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">curfew</span></span></a>. Often, under this system, the administration of <a title="Justice" href="/wiki/Justice"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">justice</span></span></a> is left to a military <a title="Tribunal" href="/wiki/Tribunal"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">tribunal</span></span></a>, called a <a title="Court-martial" href="/wiki/Court-martial"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">court-martial</span></span></a>. The suspension of the writ of <a title="Habeas corpus" href="/wiki/Habeas_corpus"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">habeas corpus</span></span></a> is likely to occur.</p>

              <p><br>I'm sorry. but yes, you are naive. The purpose of having Gurkhas is to prevent any opportunistic persons or organisations from being able to use the incident to fan the flames further. Our government is well known for being kiasu aka overkill(witness the 40 riot police to deal with 4 peaceful protesters incident awhile back) so has it occured to your mind that the way they think is different to yours? Employing Gurkhas for the "in case" scenarios is exactly what our govt would do.</p>
              <p>And honestly, in an environment that is emotionally charged, do you think people would be as logical, given our history with racial issues? Do you not think someone would try to take advantage of any small incident to fan the flames of chaos? Larger incidents have arose from smaller incidents. The police force may have no racial branding, but do you think everyone remembers that and do you think agents of chaos would pass up an opportunity to show otherwise?</p>
              <p>Lets keep the discussion to Singapore. I already said everything I talk about, pertains to ONLY Singapore. Stop going off topic.</p>
              <p>You overestimate the effectiveness of national education and the govt's efforts. Everything in Singapore, in case you haven't noticed, is about the wayang, not what goes on underneath. If you don't believe that what I've said is the real reason the Gurkhas are here, find someone <strong>in the know</strong> and ask.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If what you say is indeed true, then we should be using our police force or military for operational duties, it will incur racial riots. Like what 4Justice pointed out earlier, what if a Chinese police officer shoots a Malay civilian. Maybe we should just scrap the national police force and military in favour of a Gurkha police and army? FYI, the Rodney King riot was committed by operational police force like our current police force.</span></p>

              <p>UK is probably the only other country that maintains Gurkhas, but not for the same reasons as Sg. Every year 2000 potential recruits are picked and trained in the UK, after which 140 of them are sent to Sg as part of an agreement Sg has with UK.</p>
              <p>Other countries western or non-western may have its racial divides, but they do not have the PAP running them. Not everybody thinks or acts in the same way, so theres no point in trying to nullify a FACTUAL reason by raising examples without any control variables.

              <p>I do not care to elaborate because most of the facts can be found in history books. I see no need to spoon feed you just because you haven't actually tried to go and do a discerning study of the differences yourself and am just waiting to be spoonfed. If you want I can point u in the right direction with one of the most important facts of all: Sg is run by a certain Mr Lee.</p>

              <p><br>That would obviously be impratical, because it would require a massive renegotiation of the current agreement between UK and SG. Understand that the Gurkhas are there for a "worst case" scenario, and if they have to be deployed in that capacity, SG is probably in some serious deep sh1t.</p>
              <p>And like I said, that is the actual reason for our use of Gurkhas, whether you like it or not, and regardless of how much or how strongly u debate against it. Facts are facts, check with someone in the know like I said, instead of coming up with all these various hypothesis that have no bearing on FACTS.</p>

              <p>White policeman beats Rodney King, racial riots happen, US pres sends in Gurkhas, then perhaps the severity of the racial riots might have been much less, even if it might not be prevented.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, the US can't send in Gurkhas because they have NO agreement with UK over the allotment of Gurkhas, and the Gurkhas are fanatically loyal to the Brits so would probably not agree to a similiar arrangement with the USA or indeed ANY other country.</p>
              <p>Also, the USA doesn't like outside help, even if it means worsening the situation. Example? Iraq, Round II. "wot? wait for UN? nah..."</p>
              <p>Understand that, Sg govt having a kiasu mindset, prefers to go "overkill" on it's precautionary measures. US govt is not Sg govt, however they do have overinflated egos and hence would reject help. You have to grasp how different people in different countries think.</p>

              <p>You seemed to have skimped the question raised by me. What makes a rule by P4P different from ALL the other countries in the world? You mooted the point to which you have privy, that it's the philosophical and governance doctrine that makes us different to others in the whole wide world. But when I asked that you give credence to your points raised, you shy away. If you raised a point, surely you must have evidence to support your point, or was it all conjectures a wisp of smoke (hopefully not the smoke someone is smoking).</p>
