              <p>Darling, my training has taught me to NEVER do anything in a fit of anger. "to shoot for a purpose in war"? Yeah of course i have a purpose, ITS WAR! Doesnt mean i have to get personal about it. Since you're here bragging about your credentials, i believe you've read about the Marines retaliation strike on Fallujah after 4 blackwater guys were murdered during a convoy operation. THAT is what happens when you get angry. You make emotion-based decisions. And all of us in the military know what a fat lot of good that does.</p>

              <p>To rooki and 4Justice.</p>
              <p>I understand your concerns. Each nation's military trainning and experiences are different. And if you don't have an indepth understanding of our military organisation or had been part of it, you cannot just simply brush off the efforts and sacrifice of our men. It's not just nationalism or proffessionalism. 'Women just don't get it!'</p>
              <p>It can be said that putting a gun in one's hand does not mean he would have the guts to fire. Nor does it also mean he WONT fire, if there is a need.</p>
              <p>Within our army, our boys had always been trained to be a team player. If someone within the team flinches or hesitate, another will come to harm or die.</p>
              <p>Some boys may not fire, but that guilt will live with him forever, watching his team-mates killed. Will our soldiers fire, when the time comes for it, rich or poor, stupid or intelligent?</p>
              <p>I believe and have the fullest confidence in them that they will fire. Self preservation dictates they will, or they will die or their teammates die.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, your claim that half of our army is lazy and the other half is hardworking? Do you have empirical figures to show such a conclusion? YOU DO NOT!</p>
              <p>Are you even aware of the numerous trials and performance tests our army conducts every year, local and overseas? Officers and non-comms get sacked if they fail to measure up, from the cook to our generals  in the general staff.</p>
              <p>So, if you wish to cast aspersions on OUR men, please support your figures with data and relevant facts, otherwise, you only impunge the honour and sacrifice of our men in uniform.</p>

              <p>However, the ordinary SG guy is definitely going to be the frontline grunt in times of war. The aggresiveness you speak of is that of the government trying desperately to punch above its weight and pissing off neighbours in the process.</p>

              <p>Wrong. When something like that happens many people whose efforts are vital towards the subsequent SAR operations don't necessarily get to see the ship or the scene. Please don't sully the efforts of the SAR teams as well as the many personnel behind the scenes who put in a massive effort to ensure that the SAR operation was able to continue in a bid to recover the bodies of those poor girls. your shallowness is unbecoming for someone who talks about honoring the dedicated.</p>

              <p>I'm sorry, i thought i was speaking English here. You take things in your own context, i take things in mine. Why don't you tell everyone what unit you are, or WERE, from, so we can all volunteer for it to have the same mindset that you have. And stop all the farking quotes. you trying to tell me you take everything you read as gospel?</p>

              <p>To rooki and 4Justice.</p>
              <p>I understand your concerns. Each nation's military trainning and experiences are different. And if you don't have an indepth understanding of our military organisation or had been part of it, you cannot just simply brush off the efforts and sacrifice of our men. It's not just nationalism or proffessionalism. 'Women just don't get it!'</p>
              <p>It can be said that putting a gun in one's hand does not mean he would have the guts to fire. Nor does it also mean he WONT fire, if there is a need.</p>
              <p>Within our army, our boys had always been trained to be a team player. If someone within the team flinches or hesitate, another will come to harm or die.</p>
              <p>Some boys may not fire, but that guilt will live with him forever, watching his team-mates killed. Will our soldiers fire, when the time comes for it, rich or poor, stupid or intelligent?</p>
              <p>I believe and have the fullest confidence in them that they will fire. Self preservation dictates they will, or they will die or their teammates die.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, your claim that half of our army is lazy and the other half is hardworking? Do you have empirical figures to show such a conclusion? YOU DO NOT!</p>
              <p>Are you even aware of the numerous trials and performance tests our army conducts every year, local and overseas? Officers and non-comms get sacked if they fail to measure up, from the cook to our generals  in the general staff.</p>
              <p>So, if you wish to cast aspersions on OUR men, please support your figures with data and relevant facts, otherwise, you only impunge the honour and sacrifice of our men in uniform.</p>

              <p>Now, I shall go and prepare for CQB training. With any luck I'll be able to get a few more knife kills today. I narrow missed getting one with a thrown knife this wednesday.</p>
