              <p><br>The USA were an ex-British colony and they don't see a problem with adopting the simple military term "to fire in anger" despite being the more powerful country now. I guess your ego's even bigger than the USA huh? ^^ All your posturing and blustering doesn't detract from the fact that you are ignorant of a term even raw green military recruits in most english speaking countries would know.</p>

              <p>Here's an example:</p>
              <p>- S'pore loses PB.</p>
              <p>- Malaysia gets bold and tries to conquer Pulaus Tekong, Ubin, Semakau, Jurong, and what-have-you.</p>
              <p>- Finally only Singapore island itself is left. Malaysia, with its superior resources, curbstomps Singapore easily.</p>
              <p>- All Singaporean women become Malaysian maids.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>i am rather concerned regarding how much money the government is spending on foreign talents here, esp the prc students.</p>
              <p>i personally feel that with that the money should be given to our own local students. I've seen many local students who struggle with payment for university, and have to work part time while studying. why is the money given to these people who use singapore as a spring board for other countries? why are we giving them free money when many of our local students struggle to pay off their education loans for local university education?</p>

              <p>Because Singaporeans are there to be taken advantage of? While foreigners have to be enticed to come, Singaporeans are basically stuck here due to inertia and anti-migration propaganda.</p>
              <p>The only entity more pathetic than clueless SG men is the current despotic regime.</p>

              <p>If every country responds to any 'insult to sovereignty' with force, pretty soon there'll be no humans left. Hey, even American pleas to release Michael Fay are 'insults to sovereignty'!</p>
              <p>You wanna make slippery-slope arguments, so can I. The importance of Pedra Branca has been overinflated by the government and the media. How can the loss or gain of such a remote lighthouse be a threat to Singapore's continued survival? Note I said 'survival', not 'dominance' or 'superiority'. The harping on the point that dominance = survival is merely rhetoric, and has caused the increase in tension among SEAsian states.</p>

              <p><br>I was talking about the demostration of force, i wasnt talking about using unnecessary force or just force(war), please get it right. If there is no need for a demostration of force to demostrate our intend on that island as a response to Malaysia's naval intrusion, then we might as well give the island to the Malaysians whom will promptly set up more patrols in the area, followed by unrestricted entry onto our island.</p>
              <p>You truely demostrate the lack of knowledge in such field by having no appreciation on the importance of Pedra Branca. Security is survival (if u cannot acknowledge this then u are in no position to make comments on such issues) and Pedra Branca is crucial to our security and therefore our survival. Further more, how can u underestimate the loss of a remote land crop? If losing that small land crop is nothing to Singapore, then losing a finger is nothing to you too.</p>
              <p>If u see that there is no point to act accordingly to Malaysia's demand of and naval intrusion around that small piece of land, can i expect no protest and defence from you when i determinely demand a pinky from u with threatening intent?</p>
              <p>Ball-less arse like u arent fit to call our soldiers wusses.</p>

              <p>No one is acting tough and mighty here u shameless loser. All we did was to prove our point with evidence of past deployments and experiences not by us but by SAF.</p>
              <p>You on the other hand had the balls to call our men wusses, spoiled and weak while at the same time questioning the need to defend our piece of land, questioning the worth of our defenders laying down their lives for that cause of defending our land and our sovereignty. Furthermore u proved yourself stupid and retarded by making comments like US soldiers aint weak just because they own guns.</p>
              <p>It is an insult for us ex servicemen and most importantly our ladies whom lost their lives at sea by underestimating the value till the extent of belittling that ultimate sacrifice.</p>
