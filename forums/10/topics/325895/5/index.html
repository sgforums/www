              <p><br>Have you met the regulars within the SAF?  Half of them are so inept and bloated within their own egos. Life for them is an endless series of exploiting conscripts in doing work which the regulars are supposed to be doing in exchange for accepting the proverbial "King's shilling", having some meeting or another at the officer's mess, generally putting on a big show. No doubt the other half are good, hardworking people, but when half your force is full of people who only signed up because even the factories do not want them on their packing lines, and who do not even want to do the bare minimum for an honest pay, how well do you think they'll perform in times of an actual war?</p>

              <p>Thx 4justice.</p>
              <p>I do meet regulars whom are like what u had described, finding no where else in the open market, they hid behind the payroll of the SAF for a living. There are many NSF whom are like that also, having no choice but to serve, they just want to pass their time. But let me also share with you what i know.</p>
              <p>The strength of a military force cannot be accurately estimate at peace time because I believe the attitude of soldiers during that time is different from that of war. In times of hostility, nationalism, anger and fear in the people will bring out a different mindset in our men.</p>
              <p>The SAF that we are all familar of, is full of lazy loafers hiding behind that large bureacratic screen of scope of responsibility, SOP and rank. Moral is seemingly low and there are little motivation to contribute or to work for more but can all these be a gauge to the true strength of our force? I dont think so.</p>
              <p>Despite all the indifferent attitudes that we have seen, the SAF is the only force in this region that can in a few days time, rally it's men, gather enough intelligence, stock enough logistics to deploy for a period of time and a distance away from home. Our deployment of 3 LSTs during the Tsunami crisis to aceh province in Sumatra is such an example. I like you to know that 3 days is all its takes to move the first LST out of Singapore. The deployment was followed by 2 more LST later.</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/cyberpioneer/images/cover_feb05_img8.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p>The whole operation was done simultaneously with the deployment of airforce helicopters and other equipments to other parts of the region as while as 1 LST in Iraq. Our Signal guys on the ground despite having men with typical serve and fuck off attitude was able to set up communication at broadband level in an area that was far from home and totally devastated. Infantry men with young boys perhaps still virgin moved without fliching into an area filled with dead bodies and still able to get their job done. These are just some of the examples of what SAF had done.</p>
              <p>The aceh deployment had shown us that sentiments on the ground during peace time is a way different from the moral and the ability of our men to move in times of need. The amazing feat in which SAF had shown to be able to handle at Aceh will be a prelude to what will happen during times of war. The performance will jump when anger, nationalism and fear become a personal issue.</p>
              <p>Another example will be this. Despite how much people in Singapore despise Sleague, our folks will still flock down to the National Stadium in order to support our team when we are against our neighbours. You must be there to feel to zeal, ardour and commitment to see our neighbours go back in shame.</p>

              <p>How small a percentage of people were actually deployed during the Aceh deployment? More importantly, how many of them were the garang ones who manouvered themselves into getting deployed? I would hardly use that as an example of our dedication. Until we face a situation like the Israelis did during the Yom Kippur we will never know how dedicated Singaporeans are. But from my personal observations, I simply have my doubts. And you realise that the rise of Imperial Japan AND Nazi Germany arose for the same reasons as those u quoted:</p>
              <p>hatred, fear, threatened, past humiliations and wrongs<br> </p>
