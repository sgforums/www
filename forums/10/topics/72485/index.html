Yahoo! already offers eight of its own localised Asian sites.<br><br><strong>SingTel said it was seeking to emerge as a dominant regional internet and e-commerce operator.</strong><br><br>This month, SingTel's subsidiary National Computer Systems announced the set up of a portal aimed at commercial users, called SEASAMi.com, as part of its efforts to develop higher-value internet services. It also owns Singapore Post, which Lycos said could complement the development of on-line commerce.<br><br>The new venture was announced a day after Singapore's Telecommunications Authority announced it was to remove restrictions on foreign ownership of both internet access providers and internet exchange providers, a move that can be expected to erode SingTel's dominance of the island's internet access market.<br><br><a href="http://www.gwu.edu/~gms/globalread/syngtelycosjv.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.gwu.edu/~gms/globalread/syngtelycosjv.htm</a><br><br><span style="color: darkred;">What happened to 'SEASAMI' ?<br><br>Did it end up in Ali Baba's Cave, which will only open with 'Open SESAMI' and not 'SEASAMI' ?</span><br><br></div>
