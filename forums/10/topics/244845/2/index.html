            <div class='col-md body'>Don't even have to say PRC. Among Singaporeans, most of us are already some sort of racist already. I still remember when i go reservist, one group of malays in my platoon called us "The Chinese guys". Isn't that some sort of racist already? Then all the standing fans in the bunk were taken by them and only blow towards them. When time to book out, they asked all to help to clean the fans and the bunk as if they are PCs or OCs. The problem is that there are too many proud Singaporean chinese esp around, go flashing their wealth, speak english but most of the times broken english (like  mine) and look down on those who are not as rich as them, regard themselves as higher class people. Must study good schools or top schools, must go U and so on. And for those less weathly group will try to move away from these people and group themselves. Thus creating a "rich VS poor". We are all Singaporeans, yes some of us are richer, some of us ok and some of us needed help. We are so small in the world, if we don't help ourselves who will. Till then we might be under other country before you know it.</div>

Our Suzhou industrial was taken over by them using trick. Our investment money from tax etc) gone.<br><br>3. Our minister took an informal visit to Taiwan, they burn our flag to protest and S'porean keep quiet<br><br>Personal Case:<br><br>1. Friend's boss and friend's friend has PRC mistress. Anyway, this is a spreading trend.<br><br>2.Friend neighbour who from PRC claim they are students  making alot of noise till 6am and slam their door very loud.<br><br>3.sister friend who are less educated work in Jurong industrial claim China supervisor bully S'porean. they treat their own PRC very nicely even when they make mistake but fine S'porean who make little mistake. They force S'porean to quit so they can recruit more PRC. So who are racists?<br><br>I not racist but if you meet one like that, it will sure twist your views. Never say never. Everyone have their own thinking, we can't force everyone to accept. It may backfired. Anyway, Foreigners may also misunderstood Sinaporeans and went back to their country and say whole Sinaporeans are like that blah blah.<br><br>It is lucky that s'porean won't resort to violence like other countries who kill and rape PR chinese who they felt a threat to their race. S'porean only talk talk and after that nothing happen, right?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think most Singaporeans are colour blind. Racism is not a problem here. Probably only a handful of Singaporeans are racists.<br>ItÂ’s more about the intolerance of  the behaviour, the culture and  the habits of the different races - or even the body odour, which has something to do with the food they eat.<br>ItÂ’s because of the govtÂ’s policy of bringing in FT that led to envy, fear, sense of insecurity and other problems between locals and foreigners.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I would see it as self-centredness and ingnorance especially when they travel overseas.  Tendency to compare the bad against the goods of their own country.  When I was studying in UK, SGreans I met, except for the older or matured students, most in their early or mid 20s are much to themselves.  Sometimes, when presented with opportunities to lend a helping hands to fellow students, be it asians or ang moh.. they simple do not really know what to do.  Much like to mingle among themselves.  But I also see ang moh not mixing much with us asian, at least in my faculty.<br><br>Stereotyping is I think most appropriate word to describe SGreans.  PRC people after also human, you think only SGrean talk bad about them? I have PRC friends who are equally doing what we SGreans do overseas.. stereotyping otheres too, and right here in SG about SGreans.  Its the same problem I heard from MYsians too about SGreans when they cross over to JB, KL, etc... tends to compare and sometimes, parents mentioned these in he presence of their children, then what do you expect their childre3n would do... same of old things about strerotyping....<br><br>I met someone from Beijing when studying in UK, he was left stranded too with no lodging and as I found out carrying few thousands pounds with him and as he told me more will be transfer once he owns a UK bank account.  You think he is rich?  Yes, he said he is so call rich in China, but once in UK, he is nothing just like us.  I allowed him to spend few weeks staying with us as there was no available hostel due to term schecule screw up.  and we often communicate trying to understand about each other's culture strange things we do in our country, eventually we jointly rented a flat with 2 French (guy and girl) and another girl from Beijing.  However, it all soon ended after the 1st term when I came back to SG.  They  can't get along with each other and the French girl is so often proud of her hertiage always seems more superior to us, while the French guy with Nigeria hearitage taught something about black people in France and prejudice they experiecnce, but he was a food stealer.. we only discovered the day after he left us.<br><br>As for the  beijing guy who studied MBA, he was cheated by the other Beijing students, majoring in Law...ha..ha..  He only found out from us when we were about to return to UK almost 2 years later in the market where I told my other SGreans friends.. lets forget and forgive make up and say farewell before leaving SG, afterall, at least we were once friends especially from SG, why make thigs difficult for all.  His simple reason for vacating the house was because he was instigated by the girl which he didn't even like simply because they were from the same hometown.  FYI too, when he 1st arrived in UK, his chinese comaride turn him away and left him sleeping on the road.  A japanese pity him, allowed him to stey with him for few days until his return to Japan.  At least, he was very grateful about us Sgreans doing him this favour as he commended and reiterating it manly times about chinese people in his own country.. He said he just don't believe they will help him if he is in his own country let alone in UK... he can certainly testify</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I have this thought of expanding this subject of racist with  --  Ethnic cleansing.<br><br>Ethnic cleansing is a litteral translation of the expression etnicko ciscenje in Serbo-Croatian/Croato-Serbian.<br><br>I think we may assume that Nazi's hate for Jews were thing of the past but in our live time we saw the ethnic cleansing policy right in our Face. And the international communities was not able to stop it.  The recent ruling doesn't really point finger to the Serb.<br><br>I think it diminish the moral authority of EU over the balkan. (but that is a different subject to be debated)<br><br>Here are My Questions:<br><br>1) Here in Singapore,  Do you think if our govenrment and the chinese majority are ethnic Bias? In contras with the region. Be neutral please.<br><br>2) If our government practics ethnic Bias do We as people of Singapore able to recognize it and Stand up and say that is Wrong!!! or do we just like people in Germany in WWII does not know killing of jews was happening outside the city? "Couldn't they smell the DEATH? or even The Serb do not think it is Morally Wrong to conduct ethnic cleansing by removing certain social group because of their reglion?<br><br>what are your thoughts?<br><br></div>
