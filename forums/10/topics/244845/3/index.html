            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by footprints:</div><div class="quote_body">Dear singaporeans,<br><br>I'm new to this forum and was reading thru some posts and realised a growing trend of racism among singaporeans. Esp the way singaporeans treat foreign nationals. I need to speak up so i've started this thread. I want to know what is the problem and why are singaporeans behaving so badly nowadays.<br><br>Questions i want to ask,<br><br>Are singaporean racists????<br>Ofcourse we would say no! But i've seen too much racial discrimination going on for a long time now.<br></div></blockquote>The correct term is probably xenophobic, considering that our government embraces foreign talent more than the locals embrace foreign neighbours.<br><br>Many Singaporeans who have limited access to international cultures will find it difficult to accept the way an 'ang moh' conducts his lifestyle, or how different nationalities think and work.<br><br>Skin colour is not a precise conclusion that leads Singaporeans into the 'racism' trap, since it is evident that eurasians and expatriates have been living in Singapore for the last 20 years, with their numbers blossoming from 1% to the current 4-5%. If Singaporeans were truly perceived to be 'racists', surely the gossip alone would have been enough to dissuade future batches of foreigners from making the arduous trip to make Singapore their 2nd home?<br><br>The 'great divide' that separates the average Singapore from his expatriate counterpart is probably the ability to manage his cost of living, given the fact that the massive wage divide openly accepted by our ministers persists in present day Singapore economics, and is deemed a 'necessary evil' to ensure our economic progress.<br><br>The government and their army of lackeys are misguided if they continue to delude themselves by concluding that envy is the source of local dissent and frustration, with numerous pot-shots taken at the recent attempt to raise ministerial salary, especially pertaining to the MR4 and SR9 benchmarks.<br><br>Why would anyone come to the misplaced notion that Singaporeans are 'racist' at all?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear friends,<br><br>Thanks for contributing into this discussion, its really good to see everyone speaking up! I've been discovering alot of interesting discussions on this forum and i'm surprised i've not found it earlier! Alas a place to discuss country matters with others who really care!<br><br>I've deliberately chosen a more provocative word 'racist' to stir up emotions of fellow singaporeans in hope of hearing your views about this matter. It turned out much better than i expected to be honest. I was prepared to get flamed big time for my remarks.<br><br>Yes i questioned, are singaporeans Racists? I asked myself this question and I can put my hand on my heart and say No we can't be classified as racists as backed by most people who have replied.<br><br>Ignorant, selfish, naive and proud, (and a whole lot more) we are all guilty of it. Lets not kid ourselves, havent we heard of ugly singaporeans misbehaving overseas? how about singaporeans littering the minute they step out of singapore into JB or china?<br><br>I am criticising singapore because singapore means alot to me. I want the best for our country and we cannot get too complacent about it. Whats the use of us cheering ourselves and ignoring the facts that really matters? I must also point out that being critical is distinctively different from cynical attitudes.<br><br>I have met tooooooooooooo many cynical singaporeans. Its such a pity...<br><br>There are so many factors involved in this discussion, i try not to deviate from the main points too much or it won't end. I shall summarise on my points.<br><br>Singapore is a multi-cultural society. We pride ourselves to live together in harmony, its something very special and we should embrace it. Dont let it go down the drain.<br><br>We should be more tolerant of others, be more open minded and accept other's cultures, its a fact we have to live with so make the best out of it. (Singapore will become more and more culturally diverse and immigration is here to stay)<br><br>Edcuation is important. Not just academic excellence, but even socially, about how we should treat our neighbours, how we treat other cultures. This kind of education starts from the homes, from a young age, not from moral education in primary school.<br><br>If we are willing to take a tiny step back, or be alittle patient, i'm sure alot of misunderstandings can be sorted out. For example, one of the earlier posts refering to the malay soldiers name calling the 'chinese people', to be honest, i dont see whats wrong with that. Perhaps they have no other way to call chinese? I dont think they mean any harm, simply because they have no idea  they were being offensive in the first place. If we didnt take those to heart but instead join in with the lads there, i have no doubts the whole platoon will glue together well.<br><br>There are always bad sheep in every society. We cannot generalise the entire race/culture/religion/country from our bad experiences with them. China has 1.2billion population. If they have just as many proportion of bad sheeps as singaporeans, their bad sheeps alone could possibly be the entire singaporean population. So lets not jump in to criticise others so easily, it does no good for ourselves, we will only look ugly doing so.<br><br>Lets get stronger and prevent ourselves from getting cheated. That should be the way forward. We are too straigth bat, if we continue to be ignorant, we will never face up to the PRC in the future. There will be more and more incidents of singaporeans getting cheated, played out, etc and its our fault for not living up to face the real world.<br><br>All these social problems cannot be rectified quickly. Its a mindset and will take generations to change. I think our political climate has attributed to much of these social dilemmas. We are obedient and yet complacent. We have the creature comforts and we get too proud. We think we are 1st world and have the skills in business but we end up picking up the wrong side of the bargain when we deal with other countries.<br><br>Am i over critical? Perhaps, but i will act and improve, not just whine away. Singapore has a fantastic future ahead, lets make it rock!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree with TS on the part where we should not generalise because all in all, there will always be exceptions... And I am definitely sure that there are Singaporeans who are racists.<br><br>The complication now is not determining whether Singaporeans are or aren't racists, but more of how to overcome this impalpable problem that always seem to co-exist in the fibre of multi-cultural society. And yes, TS has touched on this with his most recent reply.<br><br>"We are obedient and yet complacent. We have the creature comforts and we get too proud. <strong>We think we are 1st world and have the skills in business but we end up picking up the wrong side of the bargain when we deal with other countries. </strong>"<br><br>Complacency. This notion doesn't just pertain to only Singaporeans, but all around the world. It is more of a natural human behaviour - one to feel complacent with onself after attaining a <span style="font-style: italic;">certain</span> dose of achievements, agree?<br>Pride is vital for success, but over-confidence would lead to failure. How True.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  however, what made u say those words I had 'bold-ed' ?? A little harsh there.</div>

To my surprise, they said no! They replied that they can understand that the other race were only joking and in no way serious.<br><br>Sometimes, racism jokes are told just purely for the FUN of it and no direct inflicts intended.<br><br>Reminds me of a situation i encountered yesterday.<br><br>On a bus trip back home from school (with a few friends), we chatted round current affairs and landed our topic on the recent quakes in Afghanistan, Pakistan and India.<br><br>We were interrupted abruptly by an Indian man in his fourties. Apparently he thought that we were talking bout racist jokes about the indians, and brawled loudly, lecturing us in public, threatening to 'whack us up'. Obviously, our try to defend ourselves were rejected. Anyway, an old uncle came to our aid and explained on our behalf.<br><br>Nonetheless, my main point is, sometimes each race may be over-sensitive at certain times, leading to further misconception of each other. Let's say if the old man did not help to clarify, would the Indian man bring home the stories of rude Chinese teens openly talking bout racist jokes in public? Same with the rest of the public on the bus. How would they think?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by TrixCereals:</div><div class="quote_body">x2.<br><br>I often question my Malay friends that, do they mind alot when they overhear racist jokes, especially about them. To my surprise, they said no! They replied that they can understand that the other race were only joking and in no way serious.<br><br>Sometimes, racism jokes are told just purely for the FUN of it and no direct inflicts intended.<br><br>Reminds me of a situation i encountered yesterday.<br><br>On a bus trip back home from school (with a few friends), we chatted round current affairs and landed our topic on the recent quakes in Afghanistan, Pakistan and India.<br><br>We were interrupted abruptly by an Indian man in his fourties. Apparently he thought that we were talking bout racist jokes about the indians, and brawled loudly, lecturing us in public, threatening to 'whack us up'. Obviously, our try to defend ourselves were rejected. Anyway, an old uncle came to our aid and explained on our behalf.<br><br>Nonetheless, my main point is, sometimes each race may be over-sensitive at certain times, leading to further misconception of each other. Let's say if the old man did not help to clarify, would the Indian man bring home the stories of rude Chinese teens openly talking bout racist jokes in public? Same with the rest of the public on the bus. How would they think?<br></div></blockquote>You are right, we really DO NOT have a racial problem here. Our jabs and jokes towards friends, colleagues and strangers are at best friendly fun-poking. Such as to an Indian local, we say he might Chapati your face if you piss him off. ANd to a malay local friend, we say he'd Assam Pedas you, if you piss him or her off.<br><br>Sensitive people are everywhere. We should also watch our company before making any Racial-based jokes, or remarks, however innocent our intentions may be. Unlike the remarks our gov made last year, which got our neighbors all hot around their collars!<br><br>We are fine here, its just the prolifieration of loud unruly and scheming PRCs that are still flooding our country for all sorts of opportunities....<br><br>If we are racists, we won't be just talking down on PRCs... there will be Thais, Indians, Europeans, etc..<br><br>PRCs just sticks out like the sorest of all sore thumbs!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br></div>

And all these while, it is also my view, to "filter" the influx of PRCs coming into our country, and not to totally bar or ban them from entering to join and contribute to our workforce.<br><br>Saturating our market with PRCs is NOT going to help locals find employment to feed themselves, if our gov doesn't believe in Welfarism.<br><br></div>
