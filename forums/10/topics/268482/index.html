            <div class='col-md body'>Just a clarification:-<br><br>I am concerned with gradual erosions of fundamental values in society. I am not in support of suppressing the gays or other outlandish traits among people in society but it could be quite different thing altogether to go further to go on promoting and championing them as the norm. I am in support of not suppressing their right as individuals which should be respected but just enough to let them carry on this life with some dignity.</div>
