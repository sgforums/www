              <p class="standfirst"><strong style="display: block;">BESIEGED north Queensland judge Sarah Bradley has broken her silence to reveal she "feels like a scapegoat" amid calls for her to be sacked over her handling of high-profile indigenous child-sex cases.</strong></p>
              Judge Bradley– speaking exclusively to <em>The Courier-Mail</em> – revealed she felt unfairly targeted by the furore over the "secret men's business"' and Aurukun Nine cases.
              <p>She sparked<span style="color: #ff0000;"> </span><a href="http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0,23739,22902849-952,00.html"><span style="color: #ff0000;">national outrage</span></a> (lion note: read link below)when she decided not to jail nine young male rapists, saying the highly sexualised Aboriginal girl victim, who was 10, "probably agreed to sex".</p>
              <p>In an unprecedented move, Attorney-General Kerry Shine took the case to the Court of Appeal late last year to review the judgment and ordered a top-level review by Peter Davis, SC, into child-sex sentencing on Cape York. Some indigenous leaders publicly called for Judge Bradley to be stood down.</p>
              <p>"It feels like some sort of personal vendetta," Judge Bradley said.</p>
              <p>The veteran of nine years on the tough Cape York District Court circuit politely declined to elaborate on her comments pending a decision by a Court of Appeal this month.</p>
              <p>Mr Shine has vowed to release the confidential two-year review once its findings are handed down.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">In the latest uproar, Judge Bradley again faced criticism after she allowed Sydney-educated teacher James Last – who pleaded guilty to coercing a 11-year-old boy to perform oral sex on him – time to gather evidence that sex with young boys was part of "secret men's business" on Saibai Island in the Torres Strait</span>.</p>
              <p>Yesterday, in the Cairns District Court, she ordered the former teacher be sentenced after two prominent anthropologists found no evidence to support his claims.</p>
              <p>But Judge Bradley will not hand down the sentence on March 28. Fellow District Court judge Peter White will do so because Judge Bradley is due to be on leave.</p>
              <p>Defence Barrister Kevin McCreanor told the court that Dr Richard Davis, of the University of Western Australia, and Dr Jeremy Becket, formerly of Sydney University, said such initiations did occur in tribes in the southern part of PNG. But he said they had no evidence it occurred on Saibai.</p>
              <p>Outside court, Mr McCreanor endorsed Judge Bradley's decision to allow time to gather evidence. "She really had to give us that adjournment because, otherwise, it would have given us grounds for appeal," he said. "She acted properly, as any judge would."</p>
              <p>He denied his client, now aged 61 and living in Darwin, was simply employing a "delaying tactic" by claiming sex with young boys was part of a traditional male initiation rite in the Torres Straits.</p>
              <p>"Of course I can't imagine any current elders coming along saying it used to happen or still does," Mr McCreanor said.</p>
              <p>Torres Strait leaders who contacted <em>The Courier-Mail</em> following the adjournment said the only "secret men's business" – or male initiation rites – involved hunting, fishing and deep-sea diving.</p>
