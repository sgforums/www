Sentencing Indigenous offenders is never easy. There are times when the offending behaviour clearly warrants the imposition of severe and significant penalties. There are also times when a judge who has knowledge of a community, has information about the community view of the offending, the background to it and the full particulars of those involved may decide that an alternative penalty is appropriate. Determining which category of case is before you can be problematic and can often only be done with input from the Indigenous community itself.</blockquote>--USING INDIGENOUS JUSTICE INITIATIVES IN SENTENCING (PAPER GIVEN AT THE JUDGES CONFERENCE, PERTH 20-24 JANUARY 2007),Judge Sarah Bradley District Court Cairns Qld January 2007<br><img src="http://www.courts.qld.gov.au/about/photos/bradleya.jpg"><br><strong><a href="http://www.courts.qld.gov.au/about/bios/dc_bradley.htm" rel="nofollow">Her Honour Judge Sarah Bradley, District Court of Queensland<br>since 25th of March 1999, Judge of the Childrens Court of Queensland.</a></strong><br><br><strong><a href="http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,22902781-601,00.html" rel="nofollow">source of the paper</a></strong>--theaustralian.news.com.au,11.12.2007<br><br>6.<strong>am i anti--Australia by sharing the news here?</strong><br>..<blockquote> Why did QueenslandÂ’s Child Safety Depart-ment not report the sexual assault to police despite the girl contracting a sexually transmitted disease from the encounter? Why was it considered better that the girl be removed from foster care with a white family in Cairns and returned to Aurukun where she had been sexually assaulted from the age of six?<br><br>The picture emerging from the gang rape is of a bureaucratic culture that accepts a lesser standard of rights and responsibilities for indigenous people on Cape York. The Australianhas little doubt that many people who have worked at QueenslandÂ’s Attorney-General or Health Departments think it is fairly common for indigenous girls of that age on remote communities to have that sort of sexual history. But whenever the system turns a blind eye, it sends a message that this behaviour is normal and condemns future gen-erations of girls to a similar fate.</blockquote>---<strong><a href="http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,22902411-16382,00.html" rel="nofollow"><br>Standard of justice,December 11, 2007 </a></strong></div>

She attended the Aurukun Health Clinic with her mother complaining of a suspected boil on her bottom and an examination was noted and lesions were found around her private parts.<br><br>As a result of that, further inquires were made. It was - she also had a sexually transmitted infection, in common with test results which were later obtained from - in relation to *name withheld*. He admitted quite readily what had happened and stated that he and other children had engaged in this consensual sex and he was charged.<br><br>HER HONOUR: Were any of the others charged?<br><br>MR CURTIN: I'm not sure.<br><br>MR CARTER: No, I'm not either. It was something that - I'll find out for your Honour. No, they weren't. There were some cautions issued but that's all, your Honour. They were all young children.<br><br>HER HONOUR: Okay.<br><br>MR CARTER: And he was at the stage, only 13 as well. The reason a caution wasn't issued for *name withheld* is obviously because he's been - had contact with the Justice system prior to this<br><br>HER HONOUR: Yes.<br><br>MR CARTER: and it wasn't the appropriate vehicle. As I stated, she - it is possible that she contacted the sexually transmitted disease from this encounter.<strong> She(the victim) had two types of sexually transmitted disease, one of which was from similar - the same as that which was carried by *name withheld* but I wouldn't put too much weight on that, your Honour, in the circumstances, because she wasn't - he wasn't the only one she had sex with that day. It could've come from anyone that day.</strong> So, anyway, he admitted to everything that he did and an ex officio request was received in May 2006.<br><br>The reason why it wasn't dealt with earlier apart from these proceedings, the other proceedings, was because there was some difficulty - misunderstanding in relation to the certificate of readiness not being filed with the Court, and it's been rather fortuitous, in any event, because it's able to be dealt with now.<br><br>My submission in relation to this particular offence is the same that I make in relation to children of that age, of similar or the same age of that age, is to quote - <strong>well, they're very naughty for doing what they're doing but it's really - in this case, it was a form of childish experimentation</strong>, rather than one child being prevailed upon by another, although - as I said, although she was very young, she knew what was going on and she had agreed to meet the children at this particular place and it was all by arrangement, so - for that purpose.<br><br>I'd ask your Honour to take that into account and if this was standing alone, the Crown would not be asking anymore than for some form<strong> of supervisory order, form of probation, or some order of that - similar order to that, your Honour.</strong><br><br>HER HONOUR: Yes....<br><br></blockquote>2.Rape is ''naughty'' and ''childish experimentation''!!<br><br>LKY is damn right.He wants 1st class honour law  graduate in government.</div>
