They and the adults come from some of the most prominent and powerful Aboriginal families on Cape York.<br><br>Two more juveniles pleaded guilty on November 6 to raping the child, and were also given probation with no convictions recorded.<br><br>The child victim, now aged 12, does not enjoy the elevated family status of her attackers, and has had to be removed from Aurukun and put with foster parents.<br><br>News of the non-custodial sentences has added to the violent hatreds that exist in Aurukun between families and tribes and which have played a part in recent brawls involving dozens of assailants, many armed with sticks and spears.<br><br>One of the adult rapists, Raymond Frederick Woolla, 26, is on the Australian National Child Offence Register following a conviction on March 29 last year for unlawful carnal knowledge of a female child - an offence committed after he was charged with the rape of the 10-year-old girl.<br><br>Judge Bradley said Woolla was the oldest and should have known a lot better.<br><br>..<br>Woolla had been arrested on August 7 last year and the judge said the 14 days he spent in custody awaiting his sentence was to count as "imprisonment already served".<br><br>When sentencing the juveniles, Judge Bradley said: "All of you have pleaded guilty to having sex with a 10-year-old girl and (one of the juveniles) has pleaded guilty to having sex with another young girl as well.<br><br>"I accept that the girl involved, with respect to all of these matters, was not forced, and that she probably agreed to have sex with all of you....''<br><br>.</blockquote>2.<strong>"she probably agreed to have sex with all of you"</strong><br>A very interesting but sad remark from a Judge.<br><br>3.An extreme  case in the country or tip of an iceberg?<br>Probable Reason of judgement:<br><blockquote>...The four juveniles are aged 14 to 16 years.

"But two new social workers were appointed to the north and they expressed the view, which was repeated many times to the investigating committee, that putting an indigenous child with white foster parents was another stolen generation.</blockquote>Thanks to the Welfare Officers hard work.<br>She was sent back to hell and gang raped!!<br><br>3.<strong>The mind set of The judge</strong><br>She thinks there should be ''an alternative penalty is appropriate.''<br>This mean she will consider the cultures of Indigenous!!<br><br>No wonder she gave this kind of sentences.<br>Even Oz PM also jumped up....<br><br>She did not make a mistake.<br>The judge thinks she has to consider the cultures of Indigenous<br>before she gives sentences.<br><br><blockquote><br>Conclusion<br>37. Sentencing Indigenous offenders is never easy. There are times when the offending behaviour clearly warrants the imposition of severe and significant penalties. There are also times when a judge who has knowledge of a community, has information about the community view of the offending, the background to it and the full particulars of those involved may decide that an alternative penalty is appropriate. Determining which category of case is before you can be problematic and can often only be done with input from the Indigenous community itself.</blockquote>-<strong><a href="http://archive.sclqld.org.au/judgepub/2007/bradley200107.pdf" rel="nofollow">-USING INDIGENOUS JUSTICE INITIATIVES IN SENTENCING (PAPER GIVEN AT THE JUDGES CONFERENCE, PERTH 20-24 JANUARY 2007),Judge Sarah Bradley District Court Cairns Qld January 2007</a></strong><br><br>The poor girl has contracted'' a sexually transmitted disease from the encounter''<br>read 11.12.2007.<br><img src="http://hk.d.yimg.com/sp1.mm-a1.yimg.com/image/1922698673"><br><span style="color: red;">Gang raped by 5 juveniles at aged 7 and ''contracted syphilis in April 2002''.<br>Thanks to lenient judiciary of the Great Australia.<br><br>She was gang raped again by 9 men aged aged 10 and contracted ''sexually transmitted diseases.''No no need go to jail.Wat a democratic and free Australia.The worst is no one make a appeal during the one month appeal period!! </span><br><br>lenient to criminals is cruel to citizens.<br></div>
