              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>I am a diploma student doing assignment in Economics. My topic of interest is the recession in Singapore. I am trying to assess:</p>
              <p>1. Why Singapore is the first in Asia to go into recession?</p>
              <p>2. Is the fundamental economics of Singapore really sound?</p>
              <p>3. How long and deep will the recession be?</p>
              <p>4. Will the IRs have a strong impact to boost economic growth and bring us out of recession?</p>
              <p>5. How much Singapore is still relying on the US market for its growth and how much dependence from Asia itself? </p>

              <p>Why Singapore first into the recession in asia? This is absolutely very interesting question that i guess that has not gone through many people mind. Even highest paid politicians like LKY and some some ministers had miscalcalated and thought that we could continue to have their so called golden period and not be affected.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I suggest that you should post this question on ST newspaper's forum to allow million of local readers to ask, contribute and let those who are responsible to brainstorm it and enlighten Singaporeans.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I believe Singaporeans are interested to know why highest paid so called talents can make us first to go into recession in asia. Isn't it?</p>

You come to sgforums to ask, you write the truth, what if your lecturer reports you and you get kicked out of school or worse? If your lecturer does not report you, what if the school kicks him/her out or worse? hahaha... better go to some "safe" forums and ask.</span></span></p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>I am a diploma student doing assignment in Economics. My topic of interest is the recession in Singapore. I am trying to assess:</p>
              <p>1. Why Singapore is the first in Asia to go into recession?</p>
              <p>2. Is the fundamental economics of Singapore really sound?</p>
              <p>3. How long and deep will the recession be?</p>
              <p>4. Will the IRs have a strong impact to boost economic growth and bring us out of recession?</p>
              <p>5. How much Singapore is still relying on the US market for its growth and how much dependence from Asia itself? </p>

              <p>If Poh Ah Pak or AndrewPKYap were your lecturer, the anwer is very clear. Singapore is first in recession because of LKY and the PAP; the fundamentals of Singapore is not sound because there is no absolute freedom of speech; the recession will be as long as PAP is in power or as long as LKY lives; the IRs will not have any impact because this was the idea of the LHL; and Singapore will doom regardless of US or Asia, because our ministers salaries are very high.</p>
              <p>Want extra points, use red ink for answers to AndrewPKYap, add a lot of insult to the American for answers to Poh Ah Pak, sure score.  </p>

              <p>i think if it was not for pap, we would have collapsed liek long ago. look at all the economies around us. why are we more stable and safe, more first world than the rest. every country has their politics and corruption be it inside or outside. there will always be anti and pro supporters. i remain neutral till today but it clearly sees the depth in which you look at things. just maybe because your probably on the lower end, makes you feel that people on the higher end are spending what could be yours.</p>
              <p>it would be nice to see pap topple, but the effect on us would be great. i look forward to poverty. everyone is self-centered to an extent. you think you as part of the government. you dont want a high salary?</p>
