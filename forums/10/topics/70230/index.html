            <div class='col-md body'>Can you tell what is wrong, after reading the following article from New Papers?<br><br>===========================================<br>MUM AND DAUGHTER OUTRAGED:<br>Rounded up in vice raid but we're tourists<br><br>By Faith Teo<br><br>IT'S a Valentine's Day experience that won't remind Mrs Marilou C Kikuchi of love.<br><br>The 33-year-old Filipina said she and her mother, Mrs Carmelita D Vasquez, 52, were arrested while having dinner at a hawker centre near People's Park Complex.<br><br>The two, who were here on an eight-day holiday, were asked for their passports by uniformed police officers at 8.30pm on Saturday.<br><br>Acting on complaints that Filipinas were involved in vice, the police conducted a raid at the hawker centre.<br><br>Mrs Kikuchi, a Japanese permanent resident, claimed she showed the police her passport and explained that her mother's passport was at their hotel.<br><br>They were staying at the Furama hotel, a five minute walk away. This was confirmed by the hotel.<br><br>Mrs Kikuchi said the police then restrained them with plastic cuffs and took them to a police station. They were released three hours later.<br><br>Mrs Kikuchi was so angry after the incident, she made a police report at the Bukit Merah East Neighbourhood Police Centre.<br><br>Police confirmed a number of women were arrested that night but declined to say if Mrs Kikuchi was one of them.<br><br>They said it wasn't their procedure to reveal the names of those arrested.<br><br>The New Paper also asked if police were investigating Mrs Kikuchi's complaint.<br><br>They said they were looking into a complaint made by one of the arrested women.<br><br>Mrs Kikuchi said that after being restrained, they were taken to a police van. An eye-witness said she and several other women were restrained with cuffs.<br><br>Mrs Kikuchi said: "We were squashed in there, almost 20 of us.<br><br>"When we were at the police station I kept asking the officers why didn't they just check my passport and see that I am a tourist."<br><br>FIRST TIME HERE<br><br>Mrs Kikuchi said it was their first visit to Singapore. They left for the Philippines on Tuesday. Mrs Kikuchi said she is married to a Japanese who owns a software company.<br><br>She said: "We wandered into the hawker centre for some cheap local food when we first arrived, and met a Filipina who's working at a stall there.<br><br>"We became friends, and she told us which places to visit and what's good to eat.<br><br>"So we went back to that hawker centre often to chat with our friend, and that night was one of those times.<br><br>"Suddenly a woman officer came up to me and showed us a badge. She asked for our passports and I gave her mine, but she never checked it."<br><br>The women claimed they were taken to the Cantonment Complex and had their fingerprints and pictures taken. They were also interviewed by police officers.<br><br>As her photo and fingerprints were being taken, Mrs Kikuchi became concerned for her mother. But when she asked if Mrs Vasquez, a grandmother of six, was okay, she claimed she didn't get a civil reply.<br><br>Mrs Kikuchi said the police asked her about the 150,000 yen ($2,380) in her wallet.<br><br>She said: "If they checked my passport, they would have seen that I live in Japan, and have been living there for 12 years because my husband is Japanese."<br><br>She also felt insulted by the questions put to her following the vice raid.<br><br>It was only after their Filipina friend from the hawker centre, Madam Nurlina M Abdullah, retrieved Mrs Vasquez's passport from the hotel that the two women were allowed to leave.<br><br>Madam Nurlina, who runs a stall at the hawker centre, had witnessed the incident.<br><br>She said she has seen a number of police raids at the hawker centre since she started working there in 1994.<br><br>She is married to a Singaporean, and is a permanent resident here.<br><br>She said the police asked for her documents too, but left her alone after checking them.<br><br>'NO APOLOGY'<br><br>Mrs Kikuchi said: "There was no apology, no explanation. When I asked for one, the officer just said don't go to that hawker centre again."<br><br>On Sunday, Mrs Kikuchi made a police report.<br><br>Throughout the interview Mrs Vasquez uttered only a few words.<br><br>She only shook her head and said she would think twice about returning here.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>WHAT POLICE SAY<br><br>When asked if the women had indeed been arrested, police spokesman ASP Siow Cheng Cheng said it was not their procedure to reveal the names of people arrested.<br><br>She said they were investigating a complaint but declined to confirm if it was Mrs Kikuchi's police report they were looking into.<br><br>ASP Siow said: 'Acting on complaints received that some Filipino women were involved in vice activities in Singapore, the Criminal Investigation Department and Central Police Division took enforcement action on Feb 14 at about 8pm at People's Park Complex Hawker Centre.<br><br>'A total of 25 Filipino women were detained under the provisions of Women's Charter, Cap 353. Among the 25 women detained, five were released unconditionally after investigations.'<br><br>She did not say if those released included Mrs Vasquez and Mrs Kikuchi.<br><br>ASP Siow added: 'One of them lodged a report the next day of wrongful arrest and rude behaviour by police officers.<br><br>'We are looking into the complaint. We would like to assure the public that we take such complaints very seriously.'<br></div>

But actions speak louder than words, and it's the actions such as those highlighted in this case that give lie to all their scripted replies and show the real truth to how justice is in Singapore.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I know that Police public relations is bull-s-h-i-t in Singapore. I was watching a news programme about security levels in the Singapore border. Some police chief guy was saying, yes we maintain vigilance in border checks, especially along the causeway, we check every car for illegal items. THat is bull, because a day before that news programme, I had arrived from JB, and the police check the cars by random. Whatever cars they do check, they only check the boot. So whatever contraband i could have been carrying would be safe in the front seat, because they dont check the front seat.<br><br>As for this incident, I can only say this, Singapore is going to the dogs very slowly. Not only are teachers begining to be pompous, the Police have decided they must do it too! But then again, who am i to talk? Since our British metropolitan Police riot Squat are full of looneys who only join so they can hit people at football matches.<br>This is an unfair world, dominated by those with power. Get used to it, leave;</div>
