            <div class='col-md body'>The CPF cut in late 1980 seemed to work on bringing Singapore back to its economic path. Again the policy makers cut CPF rate during the Asian economic crisis around 1998, it cushioned  slightly but not really as effective as in late 1980. Now it seems that the policy makers again trying to zero into the CPF to try to revive the economy! Are they running out of idea, or are there no other way to solve the problems?<br><br>First and foremost, part of the unemployment problems lie on the hands of the unemployed themselves! As there are plenty of jobs around in Singapore, Singaporeans are basically too choosy as far as jobs are concerned. Most would expect to get the highest salary with the least effort, most would like to work in air-con environment, and last if not the least, most would like to work with only their mouths!<br><br>Just take a morning off to observe the chaotic scene on the causeway, and you will find out how much jobs are there in Singapore! If you shun away from those manual job, well, if you are not choosy and do not expect too much, there may be plenty of professional jobs around, just with lower pay!<br><br>While foreigners are talents in Singapore, most Singaporeans are not stupid, only they are too choosy!!!Find out for yourself why most local companies prefer to employ foreigners. If you are one of those big bosses around, you will prefer a foreign workers than a locals for reasons know only to yourself!<br><br>Singapore might have chosen a right path of going high-tech and gear towards knowledge based industries and now going bio-tech, it should chart the next route to carve a niche for its own survival, and Singaporeans should change their mindset in order to survive the harsh weather ahead!<br><br>Cutting of CPF was an old tricks which may not work at all time. This copy cat policy may disrupt most workers' life long planning and family cohesion, and at worst may eventually lead to some unforseen social problems! There may be better solution to fix the present meltdown, and most will understand that this is just a passing storms, and if one is prudent and pragmatic, they will weather it with no pains at all! No matter what business you are in, the ups and downs are only normal cycles in life. Those companies which still make a profit but try to exploit the present situation are the black sheeps aggravating the job displacement situation. While personal upgrading is crucial in one's survival skill, learning to adapt to change is even more critical! The choice is finally yours, ie to accept a lower salary with harsher condition or sit back and face the reality of joblessness!</div>
