For example, four-room flats in Ang Mo Kio is bigger than the newly built five room flats.<br><br>I think that is because schools are taking up more and more space. With population decreasing, I don't know why the schools are getting bigger and bigger, while properties are getting smaller. Bigger schools all right, even got new primary, secondary and junior colleges being built, and they occupy a very huge plot of land. I see that most these bigger schools are pretty empty. Nobody uses the facilities. One example is Rosyth School near my house. That field there is empty unless there are PE lessons.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thats right, we shldn't have an inclusive society. Thats why the govt allowed foreign talent so that our elites have more competition and companies here become more competitive. Thats why we have grown over 40 years.<br>Come to think of it, our ancestors were foreign talent too who built this country. To be inclusive is to reject these foreigners.<br><br>For whiners like robert teh out there, all they do is whine. They didn't do anything for the economy and they make no logicla suggestions to improve the society. All while the govt is solving problems, creating jobs and building this land.<br><br></div>
