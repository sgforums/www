            <div class='col-md body'>Terrorist in S'pore US embassy bomb plot gets life sentence<br><br>NEW YORK - A CANADIAN who admitted plotting to bomb US embassies in Singapore and the Philippines was sentenced to life in prison on Friday after telling the court he had been 'brainwashed' by al Qaeda.<br><br>Mohammed Mansour Jabarah, a Canadian citizen of Iraqi descent, was sentenced by a federal judge after pleading guilty in July 2002 for his role in the disrupted bomb plots on orders from al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.<br><br>He initially cooperated with US authorities but the relationship soured and he grew to mistrust them during four years he was held in prison.<br><br>He was sentenced without a trial, based on his initial guilty plea and court documents on the secret case were only unsealed shortly before the sentencing.<br><br>'I do not believe in terrorism, violence and killing,' Jabarah, 25, told US District Judge Barbara Jones, saying he had been a 'naive youth' who was indoctrinated by bin Laden and other al Qaeda leaders.<br><br>'I was very unfortunately brainwashed,' he said. 'I was very sadly deceived by them and they exploited and used me maliciously.'<br><br>The judge, noting that 'actions speak louder than words,' said although Jabarah had denounced al Qaeda and terrorism, he was the moving force in the embassy plots.<br><br>'That was a decision that had to be made knowingly and willfully and cannot be mitigated' by arguing 'you were duped into believing somehow killing innocent people could be right,' she said.<br><br>Jabarah admitted he swore loyalty in person to bin Laden in May 2001 and received instructions from accused Sept 11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed to attack US and Israeli embassies in the Philippines.<br><br>They later shifted the target to the US embassy in Singapore and acquired surveillance videos and explosives.<br><br>Prosecutors said Jabarah was a liaison between al Qaeda and the Jemaah Islamiah militant network in Southeast Asia, which has been blamed for attacks that have killed hundreds of civilians.<br><br>Wearing shoulder-length hair and a brown-knit skull cap, Jabarah had asked the judge to return him to his parents so he could take up studies in ophthalmology. He showed no emotion as he left the courtroom.<br><br>Plot exposed<br>After the bomb plot was exposed by Singaporean authorities, Jabarah was arrested in Oman in early 2002 and deported to Canada. He was transferred to the United States and held in safe houses and then in a jail cell.<br><br>At first Jabarah cooperated with US authorities, but prosecutors said he changed after a childhood friend was killed trying to attack American Marines in Kuwait.<br><br>They said Jabarah vowed revenge and planned to kill FBI agents and prosecutors assigned to his case, hiding steak knives and bomb making instructions. 'If they release me ... then I will kill them until I am killed,' they quoted him as writing in a diary. He was moved to jail.<br><br>Defence lawyer Kenneth Paul said there was no plan to attack agents but Jabarah felt he had been abandoned in jail.<br><br>Initially he did not have access to a lawyer, Mr Paul said.<br><br>Born in Kuwait, Jabarah moved to Canada when he was 12 and was introduced to al Qaeda while visiting Kuwait as a teenager, government records show. After high school, he travelled to Afghanistan for militant training. -- REUTERS<br><br><a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/Latest%2BNews/World/STIStory_197912.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.straitstimes.com/Latest%2BNews/World/STIStory_197912.html</a><br><br>It's about bleddy time..</div>

That poisonous ideology of crusading expansionism is the root of all the great tragedies of nations in modern history. Read history and see the world with clear eyes and see who really are the grand warmongers and blasphemers in the world today. The fact that these morons keep harping on besmirching the Islamic faith and are hell bent meeting the muslim majority in the field of mortal combat and in doing so plunging the world into apocalypse is a clear sign of how deranged these brainwashed mules are.<br><br>Â“Ye shall know them by their fruits,Â” Christ said (Matthew 7:16)<br><br>Muslims stand ready to stand by the banner of Jesus Al-Masih when he returns. Can the oil grabbing whoring warmonger crusaders of today truthfully say that they are the Defenders of the teaching of Christ?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Frak<br><br>I didn't mean to imply that religions are simplistic. I said they provide simple answers to complex questions.<br><br>Before computers were invented that could run mathematical simulations to provide empiric proof that co-operating sub-programs were more viable then selfish subprograms in the long run, Religion had already said "love thy neighbor".<br><br>Religion serves a purpose.<br><br>Contrast this to "why is the sky blue?

            <div class='col-md body'>Indeed simple answers don't always work but why blame religion when simple people resort to violence to solve their problem of cowards lobbing bombs into their villages and killing their children? Why not instead blame the simplicity of such people who cannot understand the complex geopolitical environment which calls for their deaths or maybe the complex thinking problem makers who initiated these demonic complex calculations? Religious faith is usually a fluttering ephemeral thing in the hearts and minds of people. To attribute to it the capability to generate long complex stratagems of war is quite a thing to claim. Complex thinkers should know better.<br><br>To reiterate my view (I know I cannot change yours because you are culturally indoctrinated to feel yours in superior, but try to deconstruct), religion, like any other think can be complex or simplistic, depending on the depth of understanding and scope of analysis of the human practisioner. The difference between scientific understanding and religious faith, is that the former requires as a primary criteria the capability and utilization of complex thought. However, the success of that process too is limited by available correct data. Religious faith on the other hand is for all men, great and small, a salve to the hearts of the weary and a fire in the hands of the righteous. This is no bad thing and is much better than self serving pretensions.<br><br>There is no conflict between science and enlightened religion for they both serve as civilizing forces. To have both in a man (or woman) is ideal, for one gives check on the other. To have neither is a tragedy and to have only one is to lack civilization in its truest sense.<br><br></div>
