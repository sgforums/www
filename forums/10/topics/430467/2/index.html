              Very interesting fact but the difference is that Qing with Ci Xi is declining to the root but Singapore is on the opposite end for now at least. I know the policy of both men is not perfect and is rightly so because they are just men but we can't deny that their policy and vision contribute to what is Singapore today. Remember, the subject of this post is kinder and gentle Singapore and to be kind and gentle mean Selfless as well which Ci Xi also demonstrate to be 100% opposite.

              <p>I totally agree! :D It is certainly heartwarming even though I was unaware of the political happenings when he was PM since I wasn't interested in politics back then.</p>
              <p>But now that PM Lee is in power, I think that he doesn't rule as well as the former SM Goh and MM Lee (obviously). He runs Singapore like a corporation rather than a country. Even more surprising is the no. of Singaporeans who favour growth rather than freedom (according to polls) , which justifies ( to some extent? ) his way of ruling Singapore. </p>
              <p>In any case, I think the recent GE has given the PAP a wake-up call. I believe the newly elected parliament will take Singapore to greater heights:D</p>

              <p>And I don't think that it is wrong to run Singapore like that, I do appreciate all the benefits from PM Lee's rule, however, I just hope that he would also try to focus a little bit more on "heartware", that's all=)</p>
