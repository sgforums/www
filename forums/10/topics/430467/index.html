              <p>20 plus years have passed since GCT succeeded PM n then become SM.But what is the progess of our democracy?</p>
              <p>Actually if they want to forge an election,other than Workers party 6 seat,Thiam Seah Chong should also win Potong Pasir.Coz he contribute to Singapore democracy for so many years,and even after suffering from stroke,he continue to do his best in this election.</p>
              <p>But i think he wasnt "100% obedient",cannot 50% or 80% obediant,must be 100%,thats why he get brushed out of the parliament.And they say they are more open minded compare to LKY,LOL!!!20 years have passed,from just 2 seat of opposition parties,to today 6 seats.But total seats in the parliament raise from 83 seats to 87,n opposition just get 6 seats compare to 2 last election.And the PAP take back opposition party 1 seat,very confusing isnt it lol?</p>
              <p>I dont know lol,the PAP wasnt holding any election,they not even forging an election,they were doing "Maths".Maybe 100 years later,opposition can obtain 10 seats in the parliament,but then again,the total seats in the parliament will be 100.This is the so-called "Asian Democracy".</p>

              Sorry and being a Singaporean but I am sad to say, in generally Singaporean is still rude and not service orientated. This is not Goh CT's fault and he is one of the minimal number of leaders in the world that advocate Kindness. We are at fault because only us can help realized Goh CT's vision.
                  
              Thank you and please work together and build a kind and gracious society that is world recognized.

              I hope that we can one day be proud to go outside Singapore and tell people we are from Singapore and the reply is 'Oh, Singapore is a clean and beautiful city...with full of happy, polite and kind people...'

              I do agree that Singapore is a high stress country. The problem is 'Singapore Excellency' which drive competition to the roof and the root of where our stress is. This is an example of PAP policy which I do not like. We can achieve excellency if we have a kind and cooperative environment whom we can trust. If we are a kind society and even your boss empathy with you, or if we are in MRT or on the road where everyone is kind, orderly and give way, do you think you are still stressed to the roof? I seriously don't think so. This start with us and basically when you are in this topic show you care.
              
              Also racist is in pocket of all of Australia including Singapore. I believe you know that One nation leader, Pauline Hanson, is pushed out of Queensland and last estabished herself in Regional NSW...
