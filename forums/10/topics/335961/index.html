              National University of Singapore (NUS) appeared at #18 in the 2004 Times Higher Education Supplement (THES) World University Rankings but most Singaporeans weren't aware of it. When it showed up at rank #22 in the 2005 Rankings, NUSians celebrated their success. In 2006 it was better - NUS jumped to spot #19. Everyone probably thought at the time that whatever NUS administration, faculty and students were doing, it was just right - that they were moving in the right direction. Which is why this year might come as a shock to many.<br><br>NUS is ranked #33 in the THES World University Rankings to be released this year - a rank shared with the University of British Columbia (Canada) and University of Queensland (Australia). It is now ranked lower than McGill University (Canada), which has gone up to secure rank #12.<br><br>Even Nanyang Technological University (NTU) has fallen from grace, going down from #61 in 2006 to #69, but that is not much if you look at all the others that have fallen harder.<br><br>University of California, Berkeley (US) is down to #22 from #8 (that is a big fall for that university); University of Geneva (Switzerland) is down to #105 from #39; Eindhoven University of Technology (Netherlands) is down to #130 from #67; Macquarie University (Australia) is down to 168 from #82; UNAM (Mexico) is down to #192 from #74; and Washington University in St. Louis (US) is down to #161 from #48!<br><br>But we can see big uprises as well: UniCAMP (Brazil) is up from #448 to #177 (what a leap!); University of Florida (US) is up from #226 to #135; University of Western Ontario (Canada) is up from #215 to #126; Ohio State University (US) is up from #219 to #120; and University of Waterloo (Canada) is up from #204 to #112!</div>

              <p>read what did PM say</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Mr Murdoch has made some comments today about education. Can I say
              this - that he is right. For a 21st century economy Australia needs a
              21st century education system. It means Australia must have an
              education revolution. And what we invest in our pre-schools, what we
              invest in our schools, in our high schools, in our TAFEs and in our
              universities and the quality of that investment including the quality
              of teaching - unless we get this right we will fall behind the rest of
              the world long term. So Mr Murdoch’s right. A 21st century economy
              demands a 21st century education system.</p>
              <p>An education revolution is our response, investing in the quantity
              of money that we put in to the education system, the quality of that
              investment, but also making sure that we are pulling the States and
              Territories together in such common projects as a single national
              curriculum.</p>
              <p>That’s what Australia needs for the future together with a high
              speed broadband revolution, which will turbocharge education in this
              country in the 21st century. That is core business for us as a
              Government, core business together with our responsibility for the
              general economy and supporting growth and jobs in what will be a
              difficult, tough and ugly period ahead, and also taking whatever action
              is necessary to continue to maintain the stability of the Australian
              financial system.</p>

              <p>I think that the main purpose of education is to impart knowledge and comprehension abilityÂ so that human beings will be able to understand what goes on around them and subsequently, be able to make informed decisions by themselves.</p>
              <p>Being a product of the Singapore education system, I would say that the system is truly one of the best in terms of producing people who can ace examinations. Unfortunately, the system fails spectacularly in preparing one to make informed decisions about one critical aspect of life, and that is finances.</p>
              <p>Of course, some people would point out that we are promoting entrepreneurship in schools. That teaches you, or rather encourages you to make money. However, it does not teach you how to spend money wisely. With the entrepreneurship drive, it seems to me that we are teaching that the solution to money problems is even more money.</p>
              <p>This is a huge fallacy. How many people can actually be so sucessful at entrepreneurship that money is never a problem ever again? Most people either end up being a salaried worker, or perhaps owning a small-medium enterprise. For many of us, money will always beÂ a constant headache.</p>
              <p>It need not be a headache if we had the knowledge of how to manage our money properly. We need to teach our kids that the proper way to financial freedom is control of spending. It is certainly a whole lot easier to control spending compared to controlling income. We usually can make decisions on how much to spend, but we usually have little say over how much income we get.</p>
              <p>It is not surprising that many people, especially young people are in debt. Our society has glamourised consumption. Symbols of success are often material objects, such as the size of the car, the size of the property, the size of the bank account and so forth. Credit is easily available through credit cards and easy loan schemes. It is small wonder why many young people are in debt.</p>
              <p>So, what did we do to address the problem? Financial counselling avenues are set up to help these people. While it is good to have financial counselling to help those who are already in debt, the question now is why are we not doing anything to prevent them from getting into debt in the first place?</p>
              <p>Personally, I didn’t understand anything about financial planning until I came to university and made myself take courses in accounting and finance. It wasn’t rocket science, but it opened my eyes, especially when I learnt the power of interest. I suspect that many peoeple don’t even know the exact cost of taking up a loan or racking up credit card debt because they do not understand how interest works.</p>
              <p>Take for example a car loan. If you pay cash for the mid-size car (e.g. the Nissan Sunny or Mitsubishi Lancer), it’ll probably cost you about $55,000 upfront. The person trying to sell you the loan tells you that it only works out to be a monthly sum of about $700 over ten years, with zero downpayment. For a graduate with a good degree earning $3000 a month, $700 is not that big a deal. However, if you do the math, $700 x 12 months x 10 years = $84,000. Over ten years, you paid $29,000 of interest to the institution that gave you the loan.</p>
              <p>Shocking figures? Actually, $29,000 is not your actual loss. If the money had been invested instead of being given to the bank, you would have earned interest on it. Assuming that you invest $2,900 annually over 10 yearsÂ at a return of 5%, the $29,000 would have been worth about $36,500 at the end of the ten years. With $36,500, I can probably go on annual 2 week trips to any part of the world for the next 10 years.</p>
              <p>To illustrate the concept of how interest can work in your favour, let’s take the same example again. Assuming that you invest $2,900 annually over 30 years at a return of 5%, you would have paid a total of $2,900 x 30 = $87,000 for the investment. However, your return at the end of the 30 years is about $192,000. You earned $105,000 by simply doing nothing but investing your money wisely. Of course, if you increase the amount of your investment, or if you manage to achieve more than 5% returns, you will certainly get back alot more money.</p>
              <p>Therefore, I really think that our education system should incorporate some form of financial education. The concept of interest is not not some esotoric concept. It’s something that can be easily explained to the person in the street. Armed with this knowledge, I am sure it will save many people from suffering future hardships. For those who still get into huge debt when armed withÂ sufficient financialÂ knowledge, at least they suffer not as a result of ignorance.</p>
              <p>While providing simple financial education to our young is not all that difficult, I wonder why has it not been done. The only explanation that I can come up with is that it is not in the interest of the economy to have the bulk of the population being financial savvy. Interest accounts for a huge chunk of income for many financial institutions. If people are not going to get into huge debt, how can these institutions make money?</p>
              <p>If you take an economic perspective, debt is probably a good thing for the economy because it increases the circulation of money in the economy. However, from a moral perspective, debt is not a good thing, especially when people are unable to pay their debts. Bankruptcy has a social stigma attached to it. The individual who is in debt often will have to worry about how to pay the debts, and this can strain relationships with their loved ones. It can affect their ability to work, or even their ability to function as a normal human being.</p>
              <p>It’s really about time that we consider implementing financial education. If we can have things like moral education and sex education, why not financial education? After all, an education is abut equipping a person to be able to make informed decisions, no?</p>

              <p>According to Channel NewsAsia report on Tuesday, the majority of the respondents have been bullied verbally such as being teased while more than 2,800 cases of physical bullying like being kicked, hit or pushed were reported.</p>
              <p>In primary schools, 46 percent of bullies occurred in canteens and 42 percent in the school field, while in secondary schools, 38 percent of bullying cases happened in classrooms, 35 percent in canteens and 23 percent in toilets, according to the survey.</p>
              <p>It also found that students having been bullies felt angry, sad and depressed, which experts said could lead to low self-esteem and a "tendency to enter a criminal career."</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, a majority of victims and bystanders were found too scared to speak up, which made many teachers unaware of the actual bullying situation, the report said.</p>
              <p>It quoted the Education Ministry as saying that bullying in schools is regarded as a serious matter in the city state, and the ministry has been taking appropriate disciplinary measures on bullies and carrying out counseling and other preventive actions as well.</p>

              <div>Bullying is on the rise, according to results in a survey.  But this time, it doesn't take the usual physical form that people know it to be.  Cyber bullying is the new kid on the block.  And this trend is disturbing because bullying now trespasses the safe boundaries of home while still inflicting the psychological hurt on those receiving it.  Because of the anonymous nature of cyber bullying, the insults can be more hurting than a face to face encounter.  However, most students also felt that despite this happening, they always have the option to ignore it by switching off their mobile phones or computers.    <br></div>

              <p>Singapore's education system is very bad.</p>
              <p>A good education system will have little need for tuition, yet the tuition industry is flourishing very very well here.</p>
              <p>The idea and concept of moving away from rote learning is very good, but the implementation is, in my opinion, very bad. Rote learning is still very much present in the system, albeit in a slightly different form.</p>

              <p>Most local teachers are products of the educational system and our changing society and it is appalling to read of teachers being convicted or investigated for molestation or outrage of modesty.</p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">A week ago, in the first case of its kind here in Singapore, a female teacher was charged with having sex with an underage student. And there was a recent media report about teachers moonlighting as bar top/pole dancers. </span></strong></p>

              <p>Besides paper qualifications, are teachers’ character assessed before they are hired?

              <p>What has gone wrong that teachers who spend at least six hours a day, five days a week with their students are not commanding sufficient respect? Do they themselves lack discipline in the first place? Are they worthy of respect in the first place?</p>

The case will be heard on Nov 7.<br><br>But one psychiatrist, when contacted by The Sunday Times, spoke of an almost similar tryst, except that the teenager, also a former student, was older and already doing national service at the time.<br><br>The woman, a former secondary school teacher in her 30s, had gone to see Dr Adrian Wang, a consultant psychiatrist at Gleneagles Medical Centre, seeking treatment for depression.<br><br>She told him she had felt lonely and was feeling vulnerable when she became intimate with her ex-student.<br><br>Such cases are less uncommon in the United States. Back in the 1990s, for instance, former teacher Mary Kay Letourneau was jailed for raping her former sixth-grade student. The couple had two daughters and in 2005, she married him. She was 43 and he was 22.<br><br>Psychiatrists and counsellors here said that such liaisons are rare though they do occur. Mr Sam Kuna, executive director of Teen Challenge, which addresses teen issues and family crises, said teenagers may develop an infatuation for people in authority whom they admire.<br><br>'However, this usually does not approach intimacy as the adult draws the boundaries,' he said.<br><br>The experts estimate that adult men are at least four times more likely than adult women to have sexual feelings for a minor.<br><br>Retired police officer and private investigator Lionel De Souza said he has investigated relations between male tutors and their underage female students, but the recent court case allegedly involving an older woman and an underage boy was the first he has heard of.<br><br>Some psychiatrists said they do see women patients who admit to being attracted to younger men and even minors. Often, it is a passing phase rather than a sign of a disorder like paedophilia.<br><br>Said Dr Brian Yeo, a consultant psychiatrist at Mount Elizabeth Medical Centre: 'It's now more acceptable for older women to show interest in younger men. It's an issue only if they are minors.'<br><br>Dr Simon Siew, also a consultant psychiatrist at Mount Elizabeth, said the woman's need to be with a minor can stem from an inferiority complex due to problems such as failed relationships. 'She might want to feel that she's still attractive,' he said.<br><br>Dr Wang said such women may be going through a rough patch or have a borderline personality disorder which leads to the inability to form stable relationships.<br><br>'The boy in the relationship may also be generally mature for his age,' he added.<br><br>With regard to the school environment, Mr Kuna said: 'Teachers can be very caring and the teenager may not be getting the same kind of attention from his mother.'<br><br>Such a relationship is likely to have an effect on the minor. 'He may have relationship difficulties later in life and avoid women. The boy may feel betrayed and may harbour anger,' said psychologist Daniel Koh.<br><br>Most counsellors and psychiatrists felt such cases will remain uncommon.<br><br>Still, Dr Siew said increasing awareness might lead to a rise in the number of such cases surfacing.<br><br>He added that with children gaining knowledge about sex at an earlier age, 'more such cases may occur, though they are likely to remain undiscovered'.<br></p>

              <p>Actually I only employ wall of text in lionnoisy threads... for the simple reason he creates these threads to do such a thing, no matter how ridiculus or illogical his stuff may be. Replying to him with a proper post is a waste of time.</p>
              <p>Basically he's not asking questions about Australia, he's just trying to "display" all the negative news he can find about them, he's not actually even interested in the "issues" he raises... so the most apporiate response is not to try to adress his posts, but simply post back negative news about our country.</p>
              <p>That works very well to shut him up.</p>

              <p>In other words, don't come into lionnoisy threads with the expectation of any proper discussion at all...</p>
              <p>The funny thing is, when you do the thing he has been doing in his threads to him, he starts making noise about how you are preventing him from spamming his own thread with your spam.</p>
              <p>LOL.</p>
