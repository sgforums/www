              <p><strong>The Kent Ridge Common, 26 Jul 2009, Kelvin Teo<br> <br> <span style="font-size: medium;">STOMPing the path of the old Sammyboy forums</span></strong> <br> <br> SINGAPORE – Sex sells. That is the reality. Sexual themes tend to be
              crowd pullers; a sex site or porn magazine will be able to draw in more
              audiences than a financial news daily for instance. No prizes for
              guessing which publication between Playboy magazine and Financial Times
              have a greater number of readers.<br> <br> Some of the readers may be familiar with Sammyboy forums. At least, the
              reporters or journalists from The Straits Times and The New Paper
              should be, having quoted from Sammyboy forummers on certain occasions.
              The Sammyboy forum had erotic beginnings as a sex forum initially. At a
              certain point of time, forummers began to discuss and exchange views on
              non-sexual related topics ranging from sociopolitical issues to
              hobbies. Thus, the forum host set up the Sammyboy Alfresco
              Coffeeshop/Kopitiam to meet this end.<br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>Stomp is attempting to emulate Sammyboy in this
              respect. It came up with a StarBlog section that comprises celebrities
              and mini-celebrities such as Maia Lee, Jamie Yeo and Dawn Yang</strong></span>. From the very outset, this Starblog section was meant to be a crowd puller. But there is more. <span style="color: red;"><strong>Sometime
              back, each celebrity shared their sexual experiences or opinion of sex,
              something that was a usual feature in Sammyboy sex forums (Not Sammyboy
              Alfresco Coffeeshop). One of the eye-catchers was Jamie’s account of
              her first sexual experience and her first act of masturbation at 6.</strong></span> Whether it is considered positive or negative will depend on which perspective you are coming from.<br> <br> When Stomp was first set up, there were some who initially feared that
              the former will establish a hegemony over popular sites that
              Singaporeans tend to visit. Others charged that <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Stomp
              was set up to divert traffic from popular sites with little or no
              censorship that Singaporeans tend to visit and this was the
              establishment’s way of ‘managing the Internet’</strong></span> because Stomp is after all a Straits Times venture, and the Straits
              Times is notoriously known to some as the establishment’s mouthpiece.<br> <br> Whatever the reasons behind Stomp’s establishment, the question is
              whether they will be able to emulate Sammyboy by making use of the
              proven “sex sells” mantra. It depends on the raison d’etre of Stomp and
              other extenuating circumstances. Stomp may be relatively successful in
              attracting certain sections of the crowd – those whom are into gossip
              chatter, tabloid materials, FHM or/and Maxim magazines and anything
              related to sex appeal.<span style="color: red;"><strong> An importance difference between the establishment of Sammyboy Alfresco
              Coffeeshop and Stomp is the difference in eras in which they are
              established.</strong></span><br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>Sammyboy Alfresco Coffeeshop was established in an era where blogging was considered alien to many Internet users</strong></span>.
              And the technologies involved in the establishment of a blog such as
              the ones we see at Wordpress or Blogspot were probably in their
              primitive stages then. Thus, users usually expressed their views in the
              forums. <span style="color: red;"><strong>When Stomp was established in 2006,
              blogging was already in fad, and there are a number of established
              technologies available that allows any user to seamlessly create a blog.</strong></span> Thus, if the other purpose of Stomp is to be a repository of opinions,
              it will face stiff competition from Wordpress and Blogspot. Simply put,
              if Stomp wants to play host to a myriad of views and opinions, it will
              have to do a Wordpress and Blogspot. But, Stomp from the outset was
              never in the molds of both blog publishing services.<br> <br> If Stomp intends to be magnet to attract all kinds of audiences, it may
              fail in this respect. It may not get the better of Blogspot and
              Wordpress in terms of attracting opinionated netizens although it may
              attract others. Simply put, it is never in a position to compete with
              sites that provide intellectual-based contents. For those who worry
              that Stomp will divert traffic away from the intellectual sites, they
              can sleep easy at night.<br> <br> -----------------------<br> <br> <span style="color: navy;"><strong>Latest updates @ <a href="http://singaporenewsalternative.blogspot.com/">Singapore News Alternative</a>:</strong><br> <br> 1.
