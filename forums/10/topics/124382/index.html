Many goes to the schoolmate which England, USA studies abroad, because bears huge studies abroad the expense, the psychological pressure is incomparably heavy.

Singapore's educational system and English Cambridge University's LEVEL connects rails, the degree certificate obtains the entire western society acknowledges. The education manifests the human nature, the degree of freedom is extremely high. Lets the space which student own displays be very big. The year's end academic record not only the senate Â¿Â¼Ã†Ãš end result, usually the result is more important. The ordinary each work, each small examination, the metropolis writes down the year's end the total result.<br><br>The Singapore school extracurricular activity association has extremely strictly grades the standard, and as one important inspection which will enter a higher school in the future. Each students all must at least participate one extracurricular activity association, may be the basketball, the soccer, the rugby, the tube orchestra, Ã�Ã’Ã€Ã–Â¶Ã“ and so on. Each week has the fixed training time, from extracurricular please comes the specialized training to carry on the instruction, has the nationwide competition as well as the performance and so on. The raise professional skill, sometimes studies itself is more important than.<br><br>Although study in the section the student extremely bustles about, but when two long vacations the school then the extremely few arrangement work, lets in the student true significance Ã�Ã�Ã‘Ã¸Ã‰ÃºÃ�Â¢, relaxes the brains, arranges oneself the time. Lives, because alone outside studies does not have parents' help, frequently wants own to deal with the various issue, is helpful to take care of oneself the ability to the enhancement life which the ability and treats people handles matters. Has one time, saves money when because the machine appears the breakdown has 1300 Yuan new coin is arrested, must own make the phone call carries on the negotiation to the bank.<br><br>Singapore's life fills shows loving concern. Our guardian blue south is extremely good along director as well as assistant director to us. Our several ten come from China's student, each individual birthday time metropolis receives director the cake which buys for us. At holidays time, blue south can arrange us along director to celebrate a holiday to Singapore local others in, lets us have family's feeling. But assistant director also frequently and we together play the soccer, the relations are extremely harmonious. The Singapore local schoolmate extremely is also friendly to us, frequently invites us to play to their family.<br><br>I go study the Lai Buddha gentleman academy raises the leadership artificial objective, now already trained three presidents, two premiers, also extremely had the great reputation in the middle Europe's and America's name brand university. English is the here main working language, also is the here teaching language, will study English in here moves towards the west in the future for us makes contact with one bridge. At the same time, takes one Chinese people occupies the majority the country, here manifests the thick Confucianist atmosphere as well as the Chinese culture inside story, feels extremely familiar, also lets us have more time and the space adapts the environment.<br><br>If must choose Singapore, prepare accepts the challenge. We will display in here result as well as various aspects all by the Singapore Ministry of Education record, if the result not entirely as desired speech will have the possibility can deliver China. Arrives here, periphery very comes from national the and so on China, Malaysia, Indonesia scholarship new owner, you will be able to discover oneself will be living in the middle one crowd of most outstanding crowds. Song is outstanding, 17 years old, come from the Chinese Jilin Province Jilin city, to Singapore already one year 04 months, presently goes study to the Lai Buddha gentleman academy fourth day the grade. The life always is not monotonous<br><br>I quite satisfy to Singapore's life, our guardian blue director and assistant directors all very looks after us, lets me realize the family showed loving concern with is warm.<br><br>The school in order to help us to raise the English proficiency extra enrolls in supplementary lessons the English for us, ÃŠÃ½Ã€Ã­Â»Â¯ the aspect all also is not too difficult, we basically all study in the junior middle school, but was the English teaching. The school specially opened the Chinese literature class, but also from domestic please came teacher which extremely had the great reputation.<br><br>The choice went abroad in the junior middle school graduation studies abroad still is not approved now by everybody, because this stage just was the time which the world outlook outlook on life formed, one good health social environment was very important. But Singapore social convention positive health, moreover the Chinese people is in the majority cannot have the racial discrimination, therefore the parents very feel relieved. In addition, the Singapore East culture and the western culture complements one another, is in perfect harmony, one also does not feel strange, is very quick can melt into among.<br><br>As for studies abroad the expense, all school expenses, live the lodging allowance, the board expenses all are free. Will go to the hospital sees a doctor, opens the medicine also similarly free perhaps reimburses in the future, will need to be hospitalized the speech will only need to hand over the hospitalization expenses 20%. Except these free policies, my one year also has 2200 Yuan new coin the living expenses. My some friends can very reasonable spend money, during guarantee life quality, but also has the remaining sum purchases the plane ticket which the round-trip returns to homeland. Did we learn how in here reasonably to control spend money, also understood made money is not easy, to raise our economical moral excellence.<br><br>The education quality environment may say is first-class. I have 10 hectares in the Lai Buddha gentleman academy area, the verdant full field, the deep blue swimming pool, the basketball court, the tennis court has everything expected to find. Each classroom all has the computer and the audiovisual education equipment. The crisp crisp cool breeze blows which from the air conditioning also provided the good study place to us. Under the shade bench is some students' Zhong Ai. Our school library is the Singapore most ancient library, the book collection quantity has 10000 this. The library provides the computer similarly may provide accesses the net search material convenient. Our teachers all are from the first-class university graduation.<br><br>I think any national elementary education all does not have China to be that reliable, I also am profit vulgar. But China's education too formatted, the students were all fixed inside one convention, lacks courage which the innovation thought and that kind dared to attempt. Singapore educated nimbly very are many. The Lai Buddha gentleman academy goes study which by me is the example, the school implements the person with outstanding ability educates, the stress raises student's leader makings, the school also opens the raise leadership only then can the curriculum, lets each students all have the opportunity accepts this kind of training. Moreover the stress group team spirit, the very many activities or are the topic research all are by group's form appearance, everybody mutually helps the cooperation in the research process, complements one another. Another, is Singapore very stresses student's practice ability. Teacher develops the student in the classroom diverges the thought, inspires the innovation spirit. More importantly the student after the academic society understands the knowledge, understands studies for the purpose of application.<br><br>Here Singapore the social convention positive health, is the legal system society, is very safe. In comes before Singapore, is best the vaccine which from infancy to maturity will vaccinate records, in order to avoid again will vaccinate one time. The visa and the passport Singapore side personally meets help processing, so long as preserved well may.<br><br>Singapore is one East and West culture fusion society, has the different race in this country inhabitant, everybody different skin color, different language, in together peaceful coexistence. In this races, in did the multi- cultural society, how you first learn to respect the others, how could be friendly and the others together lives, knows how respected the others, also won others' respect.<br><br>Singapore's life is is light and also fills joyfully, has the possibility in here can encounter the very many difficulties, in particular the parents in the side, all all do not want own to choose, this will be one section of indelible growth experiences, premature will leave the parents is doomed we can be maturer. Outside own one person learned to look after oneself, also the many shares longed for home plot. In order to can even better adapt the English environment, is best do not have to limit oneself in Chinese foreign student this circle, expands oneself the contact face, is helpful to enhance to the English proficiency, you also can pleasantly surprised discover the world broad, have the very many things waits for you discover. Ã�ÃµÃ“Â¢, 22 years old, come from the Chinese Chengdu. At present the Singapore management institute is reading the commercial degree three grades, in this June graduates.<br><br>Singapore extremely suits the international student studies lives<br><br>I am very satisfied to Singapore's study life, Singapore is very clean, is safe, is beautiful. Singapore's education system is very remarkable, extremely suits the international student lives the study. Singapore studies abroad the application is extremely convenient, Singapore studies abroad expense relative USA, England, Australia is all cheap.<br><br>In China, the student not too many choices, choose very much in Singapore. Singapore's student very comes from the different country, the education background to be completely different. But in China, because the population are many, the intense competition gives the student the very many invisible pressures. Singapore is good, suits the life the place, the life is extremely comfortable.<br><br>Studies abroad in Singapore, do not have to be only restricted in with Chinese foreign student exchanges, must use one kind of open point of view to know Singapore social Japanese. Dares to attempt the health the new things, do not have take oneself as center. The study is very important, but also must spend time and time studies some home study things. Cannot be lazy, positive is diligent. Must have certain self- binding force, do not have to indulge to computer games, tobacco and liquor and so on not good thing. Alone outside studies, needs the quite good life takes care of oneself the ability. (Origin: Beijing morning paper / Xu Hong)<br><br></div>
