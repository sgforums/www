            <div class='col-md body'>I thought the answer is simple .....<br><br>1) We spore have only a very small of talent.. We will foreign talent<br>We need to attract them here, make them feel comfortable so that they<br>feel a sense of belonging with a view that they wil settle down here.<br><br>2) We Singaporeans are a demanding, non appreciative lot.<br>Think these FT will appreciate wat the govt will do much much better than<br>the citizens. And they will hopefully becomes PR one day to contribute<br>and reprocial that appreciation by continue to support the sponsers !<br>ie Drink water, remember the source !!<br><br>3) Network of Singapore friendly FTs.<br>Even if these FT do finally go away or even use spore as a stepping stones;<br>they will remain to have fond memories of singapore and the people. So<br>that next when when they do do biz with singapore, they will understand<br>us better and maybe gives us more preference to do biz.<br><br>Hope these make sense to you...

            <div class='col-md body'>i think its a question of degree. most people would agree that we need some FT but the feeling i get is that there are too many FT around. i feel that the FT we should want are the FT that will work at the highest and lowest specturm of jobs. eg the professors and the construction workers, not the middle level jobs like engineers or IT or etc.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>there's this website maintained by FBI on a database of many (if not all) countries in the world. singapore has one of the largest influx (and i say "one of the largest" because I don't want to appear biased, but NONE of the western countries that is a coveted destination is even close to the rate of influx of foreigners in singapore!!!) of foreigners. i looked at the popular destinations for immigration, such as US, Canada, Australia.. none comes close to the influx of foreigners into singapore. if i remember correctly, singapore's influx of foreigners (per 100,000 of local population) is something like 5-10 times that of these countries.<br><br>and you are right. taxpayers' money is going to the foreign talents, most noticeably, india and china. asean region too, but don't underestimate the chiense force. it will consume us all one day.<br><br>doomsday.<br><br>just check with the students in nus/ntu. parts of the campus (esp engineering/science...) looks like china or india. sick of them foreigners. really sick. i don't even like them. they're piss-offing.<br><br>i once did IA with a huge MNC (one of the giant petrol companies). my manager said he couldn't understand why our local students don't want to go into engineering jobs after graduating and prefer to go into finance. i think he should open his eyes bigger (or stop lying to himself) the MNCs prefer the damn bl00dy chinese/indians cuz they're cheaper labor. they're technically equal or superior but has zero communication skills. crap.<br><br>real crap.<br><br>disillusioned? why support a government that is out to woo someone that can't even vote?<br><br>seriously, think about it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Let's face it.<br><br>As the dragon awakes, there are many among them who find poverty in China something to overcome. Many bright and hardworking individuals simply cannot get the education their intelligence deserves. Do you know how difficult it is to enter a university like Beijing?<br><br>So they come here, seeking an alternative to enlightment and an english education. Welcomed with open arms, this hungry tide is encouraged by our gahmen to develop their talent within our shores.<br><br>And who can blame them for offering such incentives to these foreign talents? Our own ppl neglect studies. Our generation has not suffered hardship like these students have. We lack the drive, desire and above all motivation to perform at the highest level.<br><br>By criticising our gahmen, we are inadvertedly blaming ourselves. Have we done anything to deserve better? The gahmen spends millions of dollars on scholarship programmes to groom capable youths, yet we end up with racists. Why not indulge these chinese? At least we can rest assured their sole interest is to excel academically and will not waste taxpayer's monies.<br><br>I have PRC workers who ask me to recommend 'S' passes so they can bring their families to stay in Sigapore while they work here. They are a simple folk, satisfied by what little money thhem.ey earn and would gladly trade all their wealth for a better education for their children. They stinge on their savings and lavish their children , hoping they grow up with better prospects than them one day.<br><br>Our parents wish the same. Yet despite all their intents, many of us take our livelihoods for granted. We treat luxury as entitlement, never once dwelling on the difficulties faced reaching our current status.<br><br>A little more caution is advised before we start complaining about this issue.<br><br></div>
