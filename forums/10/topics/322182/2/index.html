              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Singapore's quest to be less dependent on Malaysia for its water supply came about from day one when the country separated from its neighbour in 1965, Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew revealed on Wednesday.<br><br>Speaking at a dialogue session during the inaugural Lee Kuan Yew Water Prize Award Ceremony, Mr Lee recounted what happened during the early days of independence and explained why water is so crucial to the survival of Singapore.<br><br>He said even then, he believed new technology would steer Singapore towards eventual self-sufficiency.<br><br>"How do we retrieve water from unprotected catchments, so that the first flush goes off to the sea and the second one is collected and is usable?<br><br>"So, I set up a unit in my office and I had a very good engineer who was head of the department and we set out systematically from day one (in) 1965 (to) get every drop of water in Singapore potable...<br></span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Why has MM LKY not given the name of the "<em>very good engineer</em>" - whom he claimed to have recruited so early in his Govenment in 1965 - as soon as Singapore was kicked out of his own determined merger with Malaysia ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">In all the 43 years since being out of Malaysia - not a word was ever breathed of the existence of this great effort - not even in his memoirs, in which he had taken pains to mention the names of those Sewage Department engineers that tamed Rochor Canal, and was rewarded with 'Gold Bars' as he had promised.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">What would the trained mind of a lawyer know about water planning, when he has left the bulk of the strategic thinking of the economy to Dr Goh Keng Swee ?</span></p>

Hasn't somebody invented something that'll make sure that the water drips onto the grass in the evenings when it's cool and the loss of evaporation is minimal? But no, they work 9 to 5 and so they press it on in the afternoon when evaporation is highest and then they close (it) at 5."<br><br>He said countries could learn from the Israeli example of drip irrigation - a method which minimises the use of water and fertiliser by allowing water to drip slowly to the roots of plants.<br><br>Mr Lee added that he believes water reclamation and waste management will be a huge industry because every society, especially China and India, will have to cope with the problem of water shortage.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Afterall, Singoreans did agree to the dependence of the Elite on their crutch, and will accept their reason for not offering the same crutch to the very poor in the Singaporean community.</span></p>

              <p>He may be sensing his day of death is near and has to use scare tactic to make sure PAP still rules after he passes on.   Thus he stated that opposition could ruin Singapore,  and resort to giving advice to other government "<span style="color: #ff0000;">to have a government that the people support and have confidence in; to have a leadership that's above board, where decisions are made not for personal gain but because it is necessary for the country; and to have able men in charge" <span style="color: #000000;">(as if telling that PAP is the choice for Singapore).     Ironically, PAP is just the opposite of what he said (words in red).</span></span></p>
