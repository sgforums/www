But having said that, because of the steep discounting that has been going on during these four years of competition, actually the rates have gone below the pre-competition era. And so I think there is great impetus for the new companies to survive, and we have to adjust the rates to a level where the losses are gone."<br><br>On its part, MediaCorp assures advertisers that the rates won't be increased drastically. - CNA<br><br>Media release by MediaCorp .<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Based on experiences in US, one radio station served 60,000 people in the beginning but over time it served smaller and smaller grouping of 30,000 per station.<br><br>The same thing is happening to newspaper. So I don't see how Singapore's TV and newspapers are proceeding against such historic trend. Competitiveness is a different story altogether as in US, newspapers or radios have to close if they are not competitive.<br><br>Our governing authority appears to support competitivenss, but did not quite understand specifics like objective and relevance needs of people served by media.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In Ohio, Columbus, TV station generally provides many channels (as many as 30) without complaints about running up costs.<br><br>There is specialized shows and programs for everyone from pre-schoolers to doctors and lawyers.<br><br>How do these stations achieve diversities and vibrancy without making prematurely quick judgment like "Station is serving lesser people or getting smaller base  to sustain more media players"<br><br>Something is wrong somewhere? Cost problems should be tackled in multi-pronged manner instead of just blaming on size of market. May be problems with media is not understood as media tends to de-massify over time getting smaller viewers or readers while serving more and more sophisticated and educated populations.<br><br>If solutions to promote diversities, are not well planned and executed, the present merger would be a laughing stock about our ability to set policies and promote competition, diversities or getting media to serve people's needs and aspirations.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>crossed over from another forum, but i think i like to put a few words to this topic:<br><br>since the channel u and (if unscrapped, channel i) are going to be under this new umbrella of tv stations comprising of 5,8, u,why not like practice some form of tolerance between the stations?<br><br>as in, going back to the ancient eras of tv like 1996.. well back then channel 5 artistes rarely crossed over to channel 8, and vice versa. but this has not been the way it is nowadays.<br><br>given channel u (strengths in variety shows and local productions) nowadays, hopefully channel 5 and 8 artistes won't interfere with channel u stuff. if want to work in channel u, devote more time there. same for other two channels. my idea is that for game shows like for example charity russian roulette on channel 8, kym and bryan for example can participate, but they can still spend more time with channel u.<br><br>as a channel u supporter and tv viewer, i do not wish channel u to end up in the shoes of sportscity/city tv. sportscity used to be a channel PURELY devoted for sports, then mediacorp took it and changed it into city tv which is half a chinese station mixed with sports. this didn't work out, and city tv closed after a few months of their toying.<br><br>perhaps, mr man shu sum can be overall producer for channel u. best still, he goes back to his old turf and controls channel 8 and channel u. he's one of the best bosses around.<br><br>also, I wonder why media companies in singapore only bother about their artistes. I notice at taiwan, where the population is just a few ten times of us, there's a real bundle of tv stations, yet artistes from a particular tv station can participate in a gameshow/tv series/drama at another tv station. why must tv stations in singapore be so small-eyed? the media merger is no doubt a consequence of the small-eye, in my opinion..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Addition to my comments:<br><br>Even though Mediacorp holds on to 80% of the shares in the new holdings, this new company shouldn't be named as MediaCorp TV Productions Pte Ltd. It should be a name independent of MediaCorp and SPH. To have the "U~U~U" trailer followed by the "MediaCorp" black screen can be quite awkward especially when a lot of us are familiarised by the "3 drum roll+1 blue splat" MediaWorks trailer.</div>
