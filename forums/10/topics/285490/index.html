            <div class='col-md body'>Upon visiting SDP's website, the headline of an article caught my eye. It read: "Is this company linked to the Burmese  Junta?". Hmm did SDP uncover something ? Is a Singaporean company doing shady arm deals with the Junta ? Is the company in the business of smuggling drugs ? No, the company in question is listed on SGX, formed in Singapore, has origins in Myanmar and is in the business of opening avenues for  foreign investors to invest in Myanmar, according to that article anyway. Admittedly i have not done any due diligence on the company, not that it matters anyway.<br><br>In that article, SDP listed the company's name and those of the board of directors. With absolutely no evidence whatsover or even a hint, SDP has openly called the public to provide information on this company, if available. As SDP puts it: "Being listed on the SGX, it is incumbent for shareholders to satisfy for themselves that they are not dealing in blood money".<br><br>So now we publicly ask if the company is linked with the Junta, we list the company's name and those of their directors, we use terms like "blood money" and all of these are based on nothing, just that SDP would like some information to pursue their political interests.<br><br>Is this fair to the company, their shareholders and their stakeholders ?</div>

Suppose now you have that concern after reading the article. Suppose many people wouldn't have been concerned until they read the article but now are concerned. Is that fair to the company, the directors, shareholders and stakeholders ? Remember, no evidence has been produced thus far and there is not even a slight hint of any, just a sweeping question:"Is this company linked to the Burmese Junta ?</div>

Today someone rather influential to certain quarters of the community asks if your business is related to the Junta. You are facing a boycott of your goods. Upon hearing the news, your suppliers refuse to give you credit and your debtors come knocking. To makes things worse your shareholders want to sell off their shares to whoever that wants it and you run into a cashflow problem etc. Is it fair to you even though you are clean ?
