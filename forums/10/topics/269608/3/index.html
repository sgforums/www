Even those with only skills that are aplenty here can bring costs down. This will force singaporeans to be more compettive and move up the ladder.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Fingolfin_Noldor:</div><div class="quote_body">Where did I say FTs are absolutely bad for Singapore? I explained my stance in other threads a long time ago and it can be summarised as thus:<br><br>1. If they contribute to the economy and bring a skill that we don't have or not enough -&gt; OK<br><br>2. If they bring a skill we already have plenty of and there are more than people here that can do the job -&gt; NOT OK.<br><br>And you dare to use a thinly disguised ad hominen argument and use it on me. How the hell can hypocrisy be used in an argument when every damn human is a damn hypocrite one damn way or another?</div></blockquote>At least you are acknowledging that FTs are not absolutely bad for Singapore, so long "IF they contribute to the economy and bring a skill that we don't have or not enough".  A fair statement and a far cry from those who Kpkb just because it is a government policy to allow FTs here.<br><br>They forgot that countries like australia, UK and USA all gives priorities to foreigners with professions that are needed like nursing to enter their countries.<br>They forgot that usually it is the MNCs who decide if they employ foreigners or locals.<br>They forgot that the majority of the foreign workers employed by local companies are construction workers or garbage collecters whose jobs local don't need to do.<br><br>I will say hypocrite are those who complain about FTs in Singapore but go overseas and take up a job that the locals are capable of doing. This applies to everybody and everywhere.<br><br>Having said that, we can't identify the hypocrite cause we don't know enough about them, it will be up to the hypocrite to identify themselves. So all you out there, if you are working overseas, and yet complaining about FTs in Singapore, if you have actually replaced a local who is capable of doing your job, knowingly or accidentally, then you are a hypocrite, you know OK liao, we don't have to tell you. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
