He said he choked and blacked out for a few seconds.<br><br>Mr Isaiah, at the hospital for the third time after the incident, to be checked for spinal injuries. --JOEL CHAN<br>All because, he said, he honked and beamed his car lights twice at the car he thought had cut into his lane.<br><br>The driver of the other car didn't seem to have taken that gesture lightly.<br><br>The two cars then travelled for a short distance before they both pulled into a carpark.<br><br>Mr Isaiah, who didn't want his full name revealed, claimed he parked his car, stepped out and was then confronted by the other driver.<br><br>He believed there were three or four other men in the other car.<br><br>The result: The 33-year old self-employed videographer was warded at the National University Hospital (NUH) for four days.<br><br>Mr Isaiah claimed the doctors examined him for spinal injuries after he had complained of dizziness the afternoon after he left the hospital. All in all, he had to go to the hospital three times after the incident.<br><br>CAN'T WORK<br><br>Now he has to put a neck brace for the next 40 days and is unable to work.<br><br>The attack happened on the midnight of 21 Jul when he was driving home on his own after his weekly bowling session with his friends.<br><br>While travelling on Hillview Avenue, Mr Isaiah claimed a car suddenly cut into his lane from the left. He tapped the horn and beamed his lights twice.<br><br>According to Mr Isaiah, at the carpark a well-built, bald man about 1.75m tall came up to him and asked, 'why did you high beam?' in an intimidating manner.<br><br>Mr Isaiah, who is about 1.77m tall and of average build, explained, 'you cut into my lane'.<br><br>The man then said, 'I would like to settle this physically.'<br><br>Mr Isaiah said before he could react, punches rained on him and the man had a choke-hold on him.<br><br>'It was so fast, I couldn't remember how many blows. I passed out after his choke hold.<br><br>'When I came about, I realised another person was supporting me from the back.<br><br>'I felt my eyes roll from the back of my head. I felt pain on my lips, head and teeth. My head was throbbing and there was blood on my lips.<br><br>'I found out later that someone from the coffee shop nearby came to help me and stopped the assault.'<br><br>According to Mr Isaiah, the attacker was still standing over him at that time.<br><br>Mr Syed Buhari, 48, who works as an assistant at a nearby coffee shop, said he was cleaning up when he heard a commotion.<br><br>He saw a man pushing and hitting a Chinese man.<br><br>'A customer from my coffee shop then ran out to stop the fight,' said Mr Syed.<br><br>Mr Isaiah claimed his attacker continued to taunt him after he regained consciousness and said, 'Come on, come on, you already blacked out once.'<br><br>Mr Isaiah then ran into a convenience store a few metres away.<br><br>He called the police and also requested for an ambulance while in the store.<br><br>PALE &amp; BLEEDING<br><br>Mr Sufian Ismail, 21, an assistant working at the convenience store who witnessed the incident, said Mr Isaiah looked pale. His lips were bleeding and had red marks on his neck when he was making the call, Mr Sufian said.<br><br>After the police arrived, Mr Isaiah gave his statement and the ambulance took him to NUH.<br><br>He believed the police were taking statements from his attacker when he left.<br><br>Mr Isaiah's alleged attacker declined to speak to The New Paper when contacted.<br><br>Mr Isaiah was discharged after about three hours of observation at NUH's A&amp;E department and was given a day's medical leave.<br><br>He went home but woke up in the afternoon feeling dizzy and 'everything was spinning'.<br><br>He then took a taxi to a clinic and was advised to return to NUH where he had an X-ray, blood tests and and electrocardiogram.<br><br>After he was discharged that night, Mr Isaiah returned to the scene to speak to witnesses.<br><br>The next morning, he received a call from NUH saying that there could be a problem with his neck.<br><br>WARDED AGAIN<br><br>He was warded and placed under observation by a spinal specialist where he underwent three X-rays and a CT scan.<br><br>On Sunday morning, Mr Isaiah underwent 'full spinal nursing'.<br><br>For about four hours, he said, he had to lie flat on his back facing the ceiling. He was not allowed to move while a specialist examined him.<br><br>'Many thoughts crossed my mind. What would happen if I was paralysed?<br><br>'I am self-employed and I enjoy sports. There would be major changes to my lifestyle and how could I cope with a spinal operation?' said Mr Isaiah, who is single.<br><br>Fortunately, there were no injuries to his spine. He is able to walk.<br><br>Mr Isaiah said the doctor called his condition 'subluxed C5-6 vertebrae'. This means that the joints on the back of his neck are out of place.<br><br>If the injury was more severe, he could have been paralysed.<br><br>According to orthopaedic specialist Dr Jeffrey Chew of Mount Elizabeth Medical Centre, a 'subluxed C5-6 vertebrae' occurs due to severe force or trauma and can lead to paralysis.<br><br>NO FULL RECOVERY?<br><br>Victims of this injury are unlikely to recover completely because the joints are no longer in their original position, he added.<br><br>The police are currently investigating.<br><br>Road bully cases hit a high of 97 reported cases two years ago.<br><br>For the January to June period this year, the number of road bully cases remained at 37, the figure for the same period last year.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Lawyers: Victims can take civil action<br><br>LAWYERS said victims of road rage can also take civil action.<br><br>Lawyer Arul Chelvan said victims can make a magistrate's complaint or hire a lawyer to do it.<br><br>He said: 'The magistrate will decide whether an offence has been committed. If yes, the magistrate will ask the accused to appear in court to answer the charges.<br><br>'Then, the lawyer will take the role as the prosecutor and police, and conduct the case. And if the accused is convicted, he can be jailed or fined depending on the offence.'<br><br>Lawyer Gloria James said the magistrate can direct the police to investigate.<br><br>She said: 'By filing a magistrate's complaint, the judge can direct the police to look into the matter again to give him feedback. So, it's not a lost cause.'<br><br>Mr Aman Aljunied, a senior executive with the Singapore Safety Driving Centre, said that when faced with an angry driver, one should just stay calm and not respond.<br><br>The former motorcycle racer for 15 years said: 'There are angry drivers every where. If you respond, you are going down to their level. And things may get worse.<br><br>'Think of your family before you get into trouble. It's not worth it.'<br><br>The police have this advice on how to deal with road bullies.<br><br>Note down the vehicle number and file a police report.<br><br>Remain calm and do not agitate the road bully with exaggerated gestures, expressions or behaviour. Do not engage in a face-to-face confrontation with him.<br><br>Call 999, remain in the vehicle and secure the doors until the police arrive.<br>- Belle Charlene Kwan<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>===================================================<br>2)<br>Road Bullies<br>Woman driver: He spat, cursed, damaged my car<br>Man denies incident, police have closed case<br>By Belle Charlene Kwan<br><br>August 10, 2006<br><br>IT started out as a normal day in February.<br><br>Ms Monika Tirthdas, her sister, Ms Nisha, and one of their girl friends were going home after seeing off Ms Monika and Miss Nisha's mother who had taken a 5 am flight to India.<br><br>That was when they were involved in a case of road rage where they were verbally abused, spat at, and their car vandalised.<br><br>Ms Monika, who was at the wheel, on the road leading to the ECP after she had exited the carpark at Changi Airport Terminal 2.<br><br>When she turned into the road, she saw a van parked on the roadside.<br><br>Suddenly, it sped off.<br><br>Ms Monika said she immediately jam-braked her ash-coloured Subara T10, stopping just 2m away from the navy blue passenger van.<br><br>Under the dim street lights, she could see the driver, who looked to be in his 30s and had a tanned complexion, gesturing his arms angrily.<br><br>'I couldn't make out what he was saying, but he was shouting,' recalled Ms Monika, 30, a cafe owner.<br><br>After about 10m, he stopped and asked her to pull over.<br><br>Wanting to know why he wanted her to do that, she pulled up next to the van.<br><br>Her sister who was in the front passenger seat, wound down the window. The driver then hurled vulgarities in Malay, Mandarin and Hokkien. The colourful vocabulary included words such as 'stupid' and 'useless', Ms Monika claimed.<br><br>She said: 'I asked him why he was so angry, since my car was nowhere near hitting his van, but he pretended not to hear me.<br><br>'He went on and on about how people like me should not be allowed on the roads.'<br><br>She also spotted a passenger smoking at the back of the van.<br><br>Once the vulgarities stopped, the driver leaned out and spat at Ms Nisha.<br><br>The man then drove off. The three ladies thought their ordeal was finally over. But the worst was yet to come.<br><br>Ms Monika claimed that the driver, after driving ahead a few metres, then blocked her path but stopping at an angle on the narrow road so she could not drive away.<br><br>Said Ms Monika: 'He stepped out of his van and shouted at my sister and I to get out.<br><br>'I can still clearly remember what he said - 'Get out! I want to hammer the two of you'.'<br><br>He was wearing black court shoes, navy blue pants and windbreaker.<br><br>When she refused, he reached under his front passenger seat and took out a 1m-long metallic rod with a red hook at the end of it, she claimed.<br><br>Said Ms Monika: 'I was too shocked to think straight and do anything. The street lights were really dim so I could not make out what the metal rod was.<br><br>'He walked up to my car and began swinging wildly, hitting the hood several times. He also tried aiming at Nisha, who had her arm partially out of the window.'<br><br>Fortunately, Ms Nisha moved away quickly and the metal rod landed on the car door instead.<br><br>After leaving behind a deep, 30cm scratch on the car hood and several smaller ones on the front passenger door - as well as three frightened women - he jumped into his van and sped off.<br><br>'In our state of shock, the only thing in our minds was to rush to Clementi Police Station to make a report,' said Ms Monika.<br><br>They had noted the registration number of the van.<br><br>The police, however, decided not to pursue the case.<br><br>Ms Monika received a call from the police two weeks back, informing her of their decision.<br><br>She said: 'The officer in charge told me that they had closed my case due to a lack of evidence and no character witness.<br><br>'He also said that the accused has denied all charges and that I could take personal legal action if I wished.'<br></div>
