            <div class='col-md body'>Singapore<br><br>Defamation Suit Monitoring: July 31st to August 4th 2006<br><br>Richard Gibbs Q.C. went to Singapore to observe and report on defamation proceedings against Dr. Chee Soon Juan and Chee Siok Chin set for hearing on August 3rd, 2006 in the High Court of the Republic of Singapore in two actions brought by the former and present Prime Ministers:<br><br>o Lee Kuan Yew v. Singapore Democratic Party et al - case No. S262/2006Q<br>o Lee Hsein Loong v. Singapore Democratic Party et al Â– case No. S261/2006Q<br><br>Dr. Chee Soon Juan has long been the target of persecution for speaking publicly on human rights and governance issues. Dr. Chee is the Secretary-General of the Singapore Democratic Party (SDP), the small opposition to the PeopleÂ’s Action Party (PAP) that has been in power for almost five decades. Chee Siok Chin was a candidate for SDP in the last election. Earlier this year, Dr. Chee was declared a bankrupt for failure to pay S$500,000 damages awarded in a civil defamation suit brought by two PAP former Prime Ministers, Lee Kuan Yew and Goh Chok Tong.<br><br>Gibbs was denied access to the August 3rd 2006 proceedings when the proceedings were moved from the courtroom to the judgeÂ’s office and Justice Woo Bih Li refused Dr. CheeÂ’s request to have Mr. Gibbs present. Also present in the courtroom and denied access were many members of the press and a representative of Amnesty International. In September at a summary hearing, the court gave judgment for the plaintiffs (Lee and Lee) and damages have yet to be assessed.<br><br>The use of civil defamation suits in Singapore by high level PAP members against critics has proven an effective tool to prevent opposition at the parliamentary level and to punish human rights defenders. Excessive damage awards and unfair bankruptcy proceedings have severely restricted the ability of PAP critics J.B. Jeyaretnam, Dr. Chee and Ms Chee to participate in public affairs by barring them from public office. In Singapore judgment debtors, where the judgment debt exceeds S$2,000, are barred from public office for a period of 5 years from the date of judgment. Undischarged bankrupts are also barred from public office. This use of defamation and bankruptcy laws has also had a chilling effect on the willingness of lawyers in Singapore to represent defendants in politically sensitive cases brought by PAP members.<br><br>On November 23rd 2006, Dr. Chee was sentenced to five weeks imprisonment for refusing to pay a fine for speaking in public without a permit. Organizations publishing statements critical of the conviction and imprisonment included: LRWC, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch.<br><br>Source: <a href="http://www.lrwc.org/documents/LRWC.Report.2006.pdf" rel="nofollow"> Lawyers' Rights Watch Canada</a><br><br><span style="color: darkred;">Countries cited in the report includes Guatemala, Cambodia, Philippines and China.

            <div class='col-md body'>OVERVIEW<br>[1]               This is an appeal by Enernorth Industries Inc. (Enernorth) from a judgment granting an application brought by Oakwell Engineering Limited (Oakwell) for an order recognizing and enforcing in Ontario a judgment granted against Enernorth by the High Court of the Republic of Singapore on October 16, 2003 and affirmed by the Court of Appeal of the Republic of Singapore on April 27, 2004. The judgment under appeal also dismissed an application brought by Enernorth for a declaration that the Singapore judgment cannot be recognized or enforced in Ontario.<br><br>[2]               The appellantÂ’s position is that the Singapore judgment was granted by a corrupt legal system, with biased judges, in a jurisdiction that operates outside the rule of law and, as such, ought not be enforced in Ontario.<br><br>[3]               The respondentÂ’s position was accurately summarized in the application judgeÂ’s reasons as follows:<br><br>While Oakwell acknowledges that Enernorth has tendered some evidence relating to possible government interference in trials, all of that evidence applies only to political cases. The case at bar is a commercial case. <strong>There is no evidence that Singapore courts are biased when deciding a commercial case between private parties.</strong><br><br>Source: <a href="http://www.ontariocourts.on.ca/decisions/OntarioCourtsSearch_VOpenFile.cfm?serverFilePath=D%3A%5CUsers%5COntario%20Courts%5Cwww%5Cdecisions%5C2006%5Cjune%5CC43898%2Ehtm" rel="nofollow">Court of Appeal for Ontario</a><br><br><span style="color: darkred;">Does this mean that Justice Day finds that, when cases are of a political nature our courts are biased in favour of the ruling party?</span></div>
