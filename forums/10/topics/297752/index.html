I have known someone who waited 1~2 months before getting his work permit to work in Sg.<br><br>3) 4) Regarding PRs, if you really really want the info, I believe you could get it from MOM. For eg, in 1998, there were 350k work permits for foreigners (saw it in some website when I was researching for another thread).<br><br>And I thought none of the 3 economies (USA, UK, HK) that I researched on in that particular thread has anything to do with saying that employment rate is calculated by the number of citizens employed, but rather, residents or person.<br><br>Other than the above points, I agree with the fact that our current government is not very transparent with figures. One can easily point out many missing statistics. However, I believe that PAP supporters can easily counter-argue that if you want the relevant statistics, you could always go to the relevant authorities.

The main reason is as you have described your uni life, I see many people like you..., and I want to spend as little as them on most of the things. In addition, I have friends who spend very little on food too. This is stupid in my opinion, because food is what builds our body, and eating the right amount and type is sort of a long-term health insurance; you spend less money in the long run if you are healthier, hence saving more money.<br><br>I know some working friends who would tell me, money spent can be earned...
