              <p>The problem with PAP govt anti-China attitude is we begin to allow American to station their navy here. This makes China very worry. They are very uncomfortable about American cutting off their oil supply from Africa and Middle East one day.</p>
              <p>To stop worrying, they are bound to build Kra Canal thr Thailand. China PM now confirms that they are going ahead !</p>

              <h2>OVERLAND ROUTE:    Trans Peninsula Pipeline had been mooted about 10 years ago</h2>
              <p>KUALA LUMPUR: CHINA has given the thumbs-up for an oil pipeline to be 
              built across the northern region of Peninsular Malaysia, an idea that 
              has been on the drawing block since the past decade.</p>
              <p>Former prime minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad said the pipeline plan 
              was discussed during his meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping 
              yesterday and the latter had responded positively.</p>
              <p>"He thinks it is a good idea and will consider it. He will see how he 
              can support it," Dr Mahathir said after meeting Xi before the president 
              ended his three-day visit to Malaysia yesterday.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Dr Mahathir also pointed out that too many ships were using the Straits
               of Malacca and it had become congested. He said a pipeline in the north
               would bypass the straits, which is one of the world's busiest and most 
              strategic sea lanes.</span></span></p>
              <p>A pipeline has also been touted as a cheaper alternative and shorter 
              route for oil shipment. It would reduce the number of oil tankers 
              traversing the Straits of Malacca, hence lessening the potential for 
              accidents and pollution.</p>
              <p>The proposal for a Trans Peninsula Pipeline had been mooted almost 10 
              years ago to provide a shortcut for oil transportation from exporting 
              countries in the Middle East to importing East Asian nations.</p>
              <p>Earlier reports stated that the pipeline would stretch 300km from Kedah
               on the northwestern coast to Kelantan in the northeast, for export to 
              East Asia, including China.</p>
              <p>Half of the world's oil shipments now passed through the straits.</p>
              <p>On another matter, Dr Mahathir said he had also discussed the need for 
              more Chinese investments in Malaysia to balance the trade between both 
              countries.</p>
              <p>"At the moment, Malaysian investment in China is bigger than theirs 
              over here," he said, adding that both countries could build on the 
              strategic partnership like what was being done on the development of 
              industrial parks in Qinzhou, China, and Kuantan.</p>
              <p>Dr Mahathir said he had invited Chinese investment in the "Rubber City"
               and "Automative Component City" projects that were planned near the 
              Malaysian-Thai border.</p>
              <p>"We invited more Chinese investors to come here. Xi has promised to 
              encourage more business investments to Malaysia," he said, adding that 
              they were also keen on setting up an association of Chinese and 
              Malaysian businessmen.</p>
              <p>On the meeting, Dr Mahathir said Xi was "very friendly and open".</p>
              <p>"I think there are no differences in our views with regards to relations between both countries.</p>
              <p>"He used the bowl and spoon analogy to define our relations... it means
               that if there are any issues between us, we sit down and talk and not 
              break relations."</p>
              <p>In Sepang, Xi, wife Peng Liyuan and the Chinese delegation departed for
               Bali at 2pm for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation leaders summit.</p>
              <p>Present to see him off were Foreign Affairs Minister Datuk Seri Anifah Aman and Health Minister Datuk Seri Dr S. Subramaniam.</p>

              <p>Hello !</p>
              <p>Building Kra Canal won't take one hundred years as someone suggested above. It will only take 10 years.  In addition, China has the option to build a rail way to connect the two ports at both ends.</p>
              <p>I think we should think about this issue strategically. If I am in China government and my oil supply lifeline is at risk of being cut off by the American and Singapore then I will seriously consider building Kra Canal. Why ? Because I can afford it ! <span style="line-height: 1.231;">I won't be considering building Kra Canal if it is an impossible task. But if I can afford it and if building it helps my position in Asean and Asia overall then why not ?</span></p>
              <p>Between China and USA the best thing Singapore government can do is to stay neutral. Why must you guys lick USA boots ? Please have some self respect hehe. Don't get Singapore crushed when two elephents fight. <span style="line-height: 1.231;">Or when the two elephents make love. Both China and the US are moving toward the idea of 2G. Meaning both nations will decide the fate of the earth.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">In the mean time however they may have proxy wars soon. USA is likely to use Philippine, Vietnam &amp; Japan to give China problem through their conflicting territorial cliams whereas China has strenghten its relationship with Russian with their support of Russia's position in Ukraine.</span></p>
              <p>Japan is very worry about China taking the pole position in Asia. It has been the dominate power in Asia for the last one hundred years and doesn't intend to give it up without a fight. That is why you see PM Abe, with the tacit approval of Obama helping to arm Philippine, Vietnam and Indenesia etc. <span style="line-height: 1.231;">So in the near future we will see Japan exporting arms all over Asia. Singapore armament will be weaken comparatively and Asean will go into another arm race. Japan will become a major arms exporter in Asia with its focus on Arc of Freedom and Prosperity</span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">.</span></p>
              <p>The Japanese knows that their time is running out. Economically China will be 4-5 times Japan size in 10-20 years. As such they are becoming more and more right leaning. Japan will do whatever they can to get to the highest position they can achieve militarily. </p>
              <p>The US is wiser. They are falling back from the first China containment island chain and moving away to the second island chain. The Americans are trying to avoid directly conflict with China in the near future. They would rather Japan, Philippine, Vietnam or Taiwan etc playing that role. With that they position themselves as the mediators.</p>
              <p>Singapore play a vital role in the South China Sea for the Americans. The US is using Singapore to control China's oil supply. In time of conflict China oil supply will be shut off by Singapore when under pressure from the US government with the present of their navy.</p>
              <p>So you can see why China must resolve this urgent issue through the building of the Kra Canal. Xi Jing Ping is not Hu JIng Tao. I expect the new Chinese will get the canal build very soon unless Singapore back out.</p>

Xi jing ping doesn't seem to like our leaders ( remember once pm visit china and he refuse to meet him and hilary).. Singapore have thrive since 120 years ago is becos of geographical superiority in our sea port and we have many mnc regional office becos of the same reason ... This route is obviously to replace us.. If u think u are working in other industry and Losing our position  as major seaport does not affect u then u need to think again...

              <p>This has serious implication to our position as major seaport
              espexially our bunkering  industry; from my inference . Xi
              jing ping doesn't seem to like our leaders ( remember once pm visit
              china and he refuse to meet him and hilary).. Singapore have thrive
              since 120 years ago is becos of geographical superiority in our sea
              port and we have many mnc regional office becos of the same reason
              ... This route is obviously to replace us.. If u think u are
              working in other industry and Losing our position  as major
              seaport does not affect u then u need to think again... Thx for
              this article</p>

              <p>China has been tolerating our government errant behavior for the last ten over years. Hu Jing Tao was in a very weak position. He was never fully in control because of former president Jiang Zhe Ming. Jiang established a second center of command in the communist party through Zhou Yong Kang.</p>
              <p>But Xi JIng Ping is completely different. In just one year around 30-40 ministerial level officers have been brought down by him because of corruptions while he simultaneously battles with Zhou Yong Kang and Jiang Zhe Ming in the back ground.</p>

              <p>it is technologically impossible now and will take many hundred
              years.if they can build so much then it would be possible that they

              <p>Heard of the Panama Canal and Suez Canal? They were built decades ago. The technology is certainly there.</p>
              <p>The reason why they had not built it to date is because of the unrest in Thailand's Muslim south.</p>

              <p>I won't be too worried about reports about possible China intention to build the canal, if they are as smart as the world think they are.</p>
              <p>The technology is there to build a canal, but it has not been 
              economically viable for many countries, including Thailand, the host 
              country.</p>
              <p>as stated by deathmaster, with the unrest in thailand's muslim south, it would be difficult for the thailand government to control, especially if the south is fighting for a separate state and this canal would be seen to bring them income.</p>
              <p>Mahathir has always wanted singapore dead, any projects that can jeopardize singapore he would fight for it, now even to the extent of licking Xi's boots, the pipelines, the crooked bridge...fortunately even pak lah, a weak pm, could tell that these projects are not worth persuing.</p>
              <p>there is no need to please the chinese government unnecessarily. our sovereignty in the eyes of the world is more important than the relationship with china.</p>
