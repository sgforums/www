There are GPs in HDB estates that are competing fiercely for patients and there many surgeons in private practice with too much free time on their hands. In contrast, polyclinic doctors are overworked and public hospitals' surgical lists are always full. Why? Because we are not charging enough in the public sector.<br><br>$4 for the elderly and $8 consultation for the rest at polyclinics is a joke. With such low rates it is not a surprise that everyone flocks to public hospitals and polyclinics. The minister must raise public healthcare charges to re-distribute patients to the private sector.<br><br>You have two choices. if you want cheap healthcare you have to wait. If you want quick service you can go to the private sector. But no, Singaporeans behave like the mafia...they want cheap service and they want it now. The only solution in that case is to let in more doctors without the stringent qualifications we require, bring in cheap doctors from Bangladesh and China for the polyclinics and public hospitals. Let those who want cheap service and short waiting times take the risk of having doctors without equivalent local qualifications. More local doctors will move to the private sector to serve those who are willing to pay more for their service.<br><br>You cannot have your cake and eat it as well.<br></div>

It is ultimately knowledge and technology applications which will produce value-adding services to enable us to compete in the globalized world.<br><br>So do not just keep harping on how successful is our planning for doctors or lawyers but think more strategically to produce larger number of engineers in different disciplines to drive the engines of growth.<br><br>Do we have ministers who are exposed to such wider disciplines or have the sharpness or shrewdness to understand our manpower needs in such diverse fields.</div>
