Today we are experiencing a shortage of doctors and had to import them from India and Bangadesh.<br><br>How much does our ministers know about the future manpower needs? With such poor forecasts and mistakes in manpower planning are they still trying to control supply of lawyers and doctors?<br><br>Shouldn't they encourage the use of market-oriented supply and demand figures with a reference to technologies and sun-rise industries in order not to deprive our economic competitiveness.<br><br>Lawyers and doctors are not everything. We need good scientists and good engineers but lately we hear so much talk about producing more accountants. It looks like because our ministers are not entrepreneurs they always try to promote what they know like lawyers and doctors and accountants.<br><br>Do they realize that all these lawyers, doctors and accountants alone cannot bring about a more competitive economy. Just because of ignorance we will end up losing the best brains to mundane non-competitive professionals.</div>
