              <p>maurizio13,</p>
              <p>I agree with your observation that the term 'heavily subsidised' is subjective.</p>
              <p>You have compared the fees in several countries.  That is one way to look at it.</p>
              <p>But to shed more light on how 'heavy' this subsidy is, perhaps you can also find exactly how much the subsidy from Govt is with regard to University education.  A subsidy can be anything from 0.1% to 100%.</p>
              <p>Contrast with healthcare, the subsidy figures have been in the papers a lot recently.  Eg. C-class ward maximum subsidy is 80%.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p><br>Yes.</p>
              <p>The term "heavily subsidised" is a subjective word.</p>
              <p>On the first post, I posted the subsidised fees charged for NUS, SMU, HKU and ANU.</p>
              <p>The fees look comparable across the board, although some courses might cost more or less in the comparison.</p>
              <p>But the fees don't vary that much.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Fees in other countries are also heavily subsidised.</p>
              <p>So what's the logic in something is heavy when it's the same in developed countries?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If A is 1kg and B is 1kg. What's the point of emphasizing that B is heavy?</p>
              <p>Both are equally weighted.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Another issue is, how you determine the price of the University education?</p>
              <p>Is it a cost plus profit, then subsidy?</p>
              <p>e.g.</p>
              <p>Cost $100 + Profit $100 - Subsidy $50</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>or</p>
              <p>Is it cost less subsidy?</p>
              <p>Cost $100 - Subsidy $50</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If it's a cost plus profit less subsidy, the more you charge for profit less the subsidy, you still make profits.</p>
              <p>Cost $100 + Profit $200 - Subsidy $100.</p>
              <p>Though the subsidy $100 is more than $50 than in previous cases, but profits is at least $100.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>All misleading, unless places like NUS can give us a transcript of how they arrive at the cost of education.</p>

              <p>Abstract:</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">But we suspect that some Malaysian and Singaporean institutions have lost out because of our increased rigour over voting for one’s own university, and there are no Malaysian universities in this top 200. The two Singaporean universities we list, the National University of Singapore and Nanyang Technological University, have each taken a fall this year. The former is down from 19th last year to 33rd, while Nanyang has gone from 61st to 69th, but there is no doubt that they are both world-class universities in a country that is serious about becoming a world centre for science and technology. </span><span style="color: #0000ff;">(That's why I say a system based on reviews by humans is subject to bias and prejudice. Whereas the ARWU system of ranking is more factual, because it's based on Research and Nobel Prizes won.)</span></strong></p>

              <p>1) You have not a shred of idea on what is meant by fixed cost and average fixed cost.</p>
              <p>2) You should do your research with wholesalers before stating mark up for retail business. What I have stated applies to clothes, cosmetics, health supplements, stationaries, bags, you name it; whatever it is, there are certainly many retail shops around who do mark up 250% or more. Do you know that even buying clothes in Bangkok costs only 8 singapore dollars, perhaps 10 with delivery. Yet what is the price they are selling at in Singapore? In online shops, they are snapped up at $28, when retail shops are selling the same quality at $30 to $40. This is info sourced from the owner of an online shop, who is a friend of my sis.</p>
              <p>It is as you have said, retail shops need to cover rental and all other fixed costs, not to mention earn. Unless they can have a high volume of sale, which might not be so, they will make a net loss.</p>

              <p>I know for a fact that levi jeans imported in packs of 10 cost 1/3 the price of the jeans in the departmental store, and this is not from wholesaler. Not to mention that for the stores, they import in bulk from wholesalers, and probably enjoy a much lower price, so much so that it might even be a 300% to 400% increase.</p>

              <p>Yes, but before you get into the business, you will have to calculated what is the ROI in those sunked cost isnt it? And if your rental lease with your landlord is only 2 + 2 that means your business will only make business sense if you could recover your sunken cost within 2 years isnt it? That is not cost of business?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You rightly highlighted that in retail business it is not USUALLY 250%. FJ Benjamins doesnt make jeans, they sell them only.</p>
              <p>LV? I suppose their production cost will be cheap, but marketing cost will be expensive.</p>
              <p>why are we comparing the profits of manufacturers to retailers? </p>

              <p><br>My friend wanted to do some lingerie business sometime back, the cost is like SGD5 to SGD10 a piece,</p>
              <p>but these lingeries sell for like hundred Euros in the European Union.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We wanted to copy the design and sell in Singapore for like $30 to $40.</p>
              <p>But the business didn't materialised because friend didn't dare take the risk.</p>
              <p>The initial setup cost was quite hefty.</p>

              <p>You are right retail stores don't mark up afew hundred percent,</p>
              <p>retail stores mark up 50%.</p>
