                  believe in it unconditionally. If you believe that men should be free,
                  then, they should have the right of free association, of free speech,
                  of free publication. Then, no law should permit those democratic
                  processes to be set at nought, and no excuse, whether of security,
                  should allow a government to be deterred from doing what it knows to be
                  right, and what it must know to be right... " - Lee Kuan Yew,

                  not what we have always cried out against in Fascist states - then what
                  is it?… If we are to survive as a free democracy, then we must be
                  prepared, in principle, to concede to our enemies - even those who do

                  love-it is always easier the second time! The first time there may be
                  pangs of conscience, a sense of guilt. But once embarked on this course
                  with constant repetition you get more and more brazen in the attack.
                  All you have to do is to dissolve organizations and societies and
                  banish and detain the key political workers in these societies. Then
                  miraculously everything is tranquil on the surface. Then an intimidated
                  press and the government-controlled radio together can regularly sing
                  your praises, and slowly and steadily the people are made to forget the
                  evil things that have already been done, or if these things are
                  referred to again they're conveniently distorted and distorted with
                  impunity, because there will be no opposition to contradict." -Lee Kuan

                  the instruments of repression, namely the army and the police, have
                  been proved time and time again in history to have turned their guns on

                  and then to the last paragraph where in small type it added the meeting
                  would take place where we were now. I compared this with a prominent

                  national interests, or is it a closed society where the mass media -

                  sound or by sight, or both sound and sight, men's minds are fed with a

                  would have the money to hire them to clean their shoe, open their
                  motorcar doors?" — Lee Kuan Yew in the <a class="extiw" title="w:Parliament_of_Malaysia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_Malaysia">Parliament of Malaysia</a>, 1965 <a class="external autonumber" title="http://maddruid.com/?p=645" rel="nofollow" href="http://maddruid.com/?p=645">[1]</a></li>

              <li>"Of course there are Chinese millionaires in big cars and big
                  houses. Is it the answer to make a few Malay millionaires with big cars
                  and big houses? How does telling a Malay bus driver that he should
                  support the party of his Malay director (UMNO) and the Chinese bus
                  conductor to join another party of his Chinese director (MCA) - how
                  does that improve the standards of the Malay bus driver and the Chinese
                  bus conductor who are both workers in the same company? If we delude
                  people into believing that they are poor because there are no Malay
                  rights or because opposition members oppose Malay rights, where are we
                  going to end up? You let people in the kampongs believe that they are
                  poor because we don't speak Malay, because the government does not
                  write in Malay, so he expects a miracle to take place in 1967 (the year
                  Malay would become the national and sole official language in
                  Malaysia). The moment we all start speaking Malay, he is going to have
                  an uplift in the standard of living, and if doesn't happen, what
                  happens then? Meanwhile, whenever there is a failure of economic,
                  social and educational policies, you come back and say, oh, these
                  wicked Chinese, Indian and others opposing Malay rights. They don't
                  oppose Malay rights. They, the Malay, have the right as Malaysian
                  citizens to go up to the level of training and education that the more
                  competitive societies, the non-Malay society, has produced. That is
                  what must be done, isn't it? Not to feed them with this obscurantist
                  doctrine that all they have got to do is to get Malay rights for the
                  few special Malays and their problem has been resolved." — Lee Kuan Yew

                  are Malaysians? I hope I am, Mr Speaker, Sir. But sometimes, sitting in
                  this chamber, I doubt whether I am allowed to be a Malaysian. This is
                  the doubt that hangs over many minds, and the next contest, if this

                  the nation from top to bottom and undo Malaysia. Everybody knows it. I
                  don't have to say it.

                  in Malaysia today, about one-third are comparatively new immigrants

                  racial group to think that they are more justified to be called

              <p>... if you and anyone can be as filthily rich as he is, of course you can live LONGER (I don't want to specify 85)...</p>
              <p>... with unearthly axcessive wealth, one can either live longer, or die much earlier depending on how, one lives life with infinite financial clout...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>... but I would like to draw you people's attention to the saying that; Good people dies young or easily, while the bad lives longer...</p>
              <p>... but still, in the end, everyone of us HAS to die... question we all can NEVER know, is how...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>... one can do everything and anything to cling on to life even by the fingernails, just because of wealth and power, but when the time and date comes... NOTHING &amp; NO ONE can defer death...</p>
