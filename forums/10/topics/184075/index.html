LHL use it, but it work again in 2006.<br><br>to be frank, nowadays the ruling party has such great influence on every working mechanism(ministries, private sector) in singapore that even after these 40years, the fear factor still remain in every singaporean life.<br><br>who can we blame? the ruling party? it takes two to clap.<br><br></div></blockquote>It is doubtful the tactics of estates upgrading to win electrol support did work.<br><br>Using public fund selfishly &amp; unfairly, I think the ppl can sue the govt for wrong doing.<br><br></div>

So here come the progressive package, to sent a signal to lower income gp, vote for them or get nothing next time. but i still believe these 20% are mostly pro opposition.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>According to a reader of Today, GCT said Low Thia Khiang should press the govt for the fund for upgrading since it has been budgeted.  But before the GE, the PAP candidate said the minister would support the upgrading programme if Eric Low  were elected. I don't know which version is true.<br>If what GCT said after the GE is true,the govt will definitely do upgrading for Hougang if the SM tells Mah to do it.Where would be the need  for LKT to press for it?<br><br></div>
