I'm just trying to highlight that before we call foreigners in Singapore names or complain about them, we would do well to understand and be prepared for such reactions when we become foreigners ourselves. I believe Pauline Hanson's call for a white Australia was not motivated by race issues but primarily one of competition. People started to eat Asian food rather than fish and chips if you get what i mean.<br><br>As such, dreaming of moving abroad for a better life while calling foreigners in Singapore names just doesn't seem right to me.</div></blockquote>Not calling them names - they are really second class or below type of FTs. It's a fact. If they are americans , australians or english , they are truly at the bottom of their game unless they are sitting on top of the MNC branch in Singapore. Even then most have to move to Singapore because their home country has more capable fellas running the show. There is a few just wanting an experience of asia and then pack up and go home after 2 years with no problems and a job offer back in their home country.<br><br>If they are just workers with a fancy title and no power over executive decisions , they are second rate. And that is the position of most of your FTs .<br><br>If they are capable in the first place - they will be rotating between USA and Europe. USA is where the brain drain drains to. 2nd is Canada / Europe and third is Australia because it has a few core research industries .<br><br>I hear of them getting nobel prize winners or olympics medalists over but I never hear of Singapore getting anything. Look at the China born athletes imported by Singapore- NONE HAVE WON HER A MEDAL YET.</div>
