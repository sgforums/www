For instance, most citizens in Europe actually do not own their own homes unless they have inheritance from their parents or enough savings for it. What many average Europeans do is that they pay rental for their houses/apartments, and if they do not get enough inheritance or save enough to buy their own property, they actually have to pay rental all their lives.

Although medical is affordable, I still prefer a national health insurance scheme where it forces citizens to pay for their health insurance on a monthly basis. So when they meet an accident or fall seriously ill, they get the necessary medical treatment almost for free. In that way, they needn't worry about their finances when they fall ill. I mean, sickness is something everyone will choose NOT to have, regardless of the cost. So I think every sick patient's medical cost should be subsidized through a health insurance scheme. To avoid misuse of the scheme, some European countries make the citizens bear an extremely small part of the cost whenever they seek medical help.

I'm not even talking about luxuries like houses and automobiles here. The price-for-quality ridge (gradient) for many products in Singapore is extremely steep. You may find really cheap products in Singapore but to buy a product that is of a decent quality (and style), you pay a lot more in Singapore than you would have to pay in Europe or in the States. And due to our relatively lower pay and lower exchange rates, we have a very much lower purchasing power as compared to the other developed countries. Besides, International companies (I'm not even talking about designer brands) price their products pretty evenly worldwide. To put it simply, if a zara trench costs 120Euro in Europe (other than Spain heh), it'll most probably cost 240SGD in Singapore. However, while an engineer earns 4500SGD in Singapore, he'll most probably be earning 4500Euro in Europe. (The exchange rate is about 1Euro to 2.1SGD).

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Birkin,<br><br>(sorry if this is disjointed, I didn't edit it)<br><br>I thought your post was very intelligent and asked the right questions. I'd like to add my point of view to this thread.<br><br>I agree that there are many "push factors" that contribute to emigration.<br><br>Once we've listed them, the next question would be their effect. Then how much of this can be managed and in what ways. Then we ask how much of this can or should be managed by the Government.<br><br>This is where we come to the crux of the matter.<br><br>People view relationships in many ways, as form of contracts or guided by morality or mandated by human nature, mandated by God etc. These views are fundamentally different however in Singapore we find one mindset dominates.<br><br>That is a person who volunteerily gives up his rights and freedoms to another does so in exchage for certain things, be it a standard of living etc. And that imposes a responsibility on the other party to fulfil this and a right for the person to demand these.<br><br>I find a lot of debate revolves on what we can realistically expect the Government to be responsible for in exchange for those rights and freedoms we have given up and whether these responsibilities have been fulfilled and how this social contract should be managed.</div>

I'm just trying to highlight that before we call foreigners in Singapore names or complain about them, we would do well to understand and be prepared for such reactions when we become foreigners ourselves. I believe Pauline Hanson's call for a white Australia was not motivated by race issues but primarily one of competition.
