(hanyu pinyin "zheng")</div></blockquote>During the late Western Zhou Dynasty, the uncle of King You of Zhou was conferred to the State of Zheng. After a long time, the State of Zheng was destroyed by the State of Han. The decendant of the royalties use the name of the state as their surname.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Diehard_89:</div><div class="quote_body">what about Zhuo?<br><br>table without the two strokes<br><br></div></blockquote>During Spring and Autumn period, a fire broke out in the Palace of the State of Chu, the book keeper rush in to save all the records from the flame. All were saved except the records for the founder of Chu.<br><br>The King Wu of Chu was enraged and wants to kill the book keeper. Then one officer, by the name of hua2 (meaning slippery) who had a good memory, came out and po the king's lam pa first, then he said that he could remember everything on the record. The King was delighted and conferred him the land of Zhuo. His decendants use Zhuo as surname.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by spinsugar:</div><div class="quote_body"><span style="color: darkblue;">How bout.. "Yang"?

Then the state was destroyed and the lord's decendant use the name of their conferred state as their surname.<br><br>Second one. There was a virtuous man in the State of Jin, he was conferred to a castle by the name of Yang. Then one of his son killed someone and was executed because of that, his grandson escaped and used the name of the conferred castle as surname.<br><br>Lan also have two origins.<br><br>During the Spring and Autumn period, the State of Chu was conquered by the State of Wu. King Zhao of Wu escaped and when he was crossing the river, he encountered an officer riding a boat escorting his family. So he asked him for help. The officer refused and shunned him. The King was pissed off.<br><br>After he retook the State of Chu, he remembered that officer and wanted to kill him. But the officer snared (dunno the correct word or not) him being petty. Only remember these small small vengence and forgot the humilation of losing his country. King Zhao of Chu felt ashamed, pardoned him and allowed him to continue with his role in the government. Because he was conferred to the land of Lan, his decendants use the name of the land as surname.<br><br>Another origin. The crown prince of King Hui4 of Liang2 recieved the title Earl of Lan2 Tian2 and was conferred to the land called Lan Tian. Some of his decendant use the name of the conferred land as surname.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by BadzMaro:</div><div class="quote_body">Teng<br><br>- familiy of officials and generals given by the great emperor himself.

One of the origin was that, the surname was conferred by Huang Di to one of his son.<br><br>The other source cited that, one of the son of King Wen of Zhou was conferred at the State of Teng and his decendant use the name of teh conferred state as surname.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Urroh:</div><div class="quote_body">How about Wong??
