              <h1>China’s Sovereign Wealth Fund earns USD $10 billion dollars by ‘doing nothing’; complete news blackout by state media</h1>
              <p><strong>By Eugene Yeo</strong></p>
              <p>In spite of the disastrous mistake made by Temasek and GIC in its
              risky forays into the finance sector which caused us to lose billions
              of dollars, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>the PAP spin doctors and apologists continue to insist that
              they have not “done so badly” </strong></span>compared to other SWFs like Kuwait and
              Abu Dhabi and that it is “inevitable” that the funds are performing
              badly in the face of the global economic crisis.</p>
              <p>Even our highly paid Prime Minister appeared to be taken in by the
              spins of his own propaganda mouthpiece. Speaking at the Singapore
              Tripartism Forum last Sunday, he said:</p>
              <p>“Some years it will go down, some years it will go up more. But<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"> on average it’s not bad</span></strong>. And we have to take a long-term view because this is not money for now, <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">this is money for many years ahead. </span></strong>If you look at a long-term basis, on the overall <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">on the way the government has managed the money, we haven’t done badly</span></strong>“.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Only fools will be taken in by such outrageous hogwash !</strong></span> <strong>The unsavory truth is - Temasek and GIC’s performance is nothing short of catastrophe !</strong> The extent of our losses beg the question whether the government had 
              exercised due caution and diligence in the management of the funds.</p>
              <p><strong>It is a myth that it is unavoidable that our SWFs have lost
              monies. In fact, there are other SWFs which are making money in such
              troubled times !</strong></p>
              <p>Since the regime has always been quick to curry favors with China, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><strong>why did they hide the performance of China’s SWF from Singaporeans ??</strong> </strong></span>There were no reports on the performance of China’s SWF in both the
              English and Chinese dailies.  Shouldn’t we deserve to know how Temasek
              and GIC perform in comparison to the SWFs of other Asia countries ?</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>“China Investment Corp (CIC), the country’s $200 billion sovereign wealth fund, <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">made
              a profit of about $10 billion last year as it benefited from staying
              largely in cash and avoiding new investments in Western banks</span></strong>, a source close to the fund told Reuters on Tuesday.</strong></span></p>
              <p>“Combining all the investments together, <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">CIC is still enjoying a positive profit of slightly less than 5 percent, which is better than many other foreign wealth funds</span></strong>,” said the source, who declined to be identified as he was not authorised to speak to the media.</p>
              <p>CIC’s profitability stands in sharp contrast to the recent results of some other sovereign wealth funds (SWFs).</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">The assets of Singapore
              state investor Temasek Holdings [TEM.UL] shrank 31 percent to S$127
              billion ($84 billion) in the eight months to November</span></strong></strong></span>, due in part to poorly timed investments in Barclays and Merrill Lynch.” (Read full article <a href="http://singaporeenquirer.sg/?p=2251">here</a>)</p>
              <p>As the China example has shown us, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><strong>it is possible to make
              considerable profits by simply “doing nothing” with the cash instead of
              throwing them at risky investments.</strong></strong></span></p>
              <p>Furthermore, it is not true that “nobody could have foreseen the financial crisis.” <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><strong>Renowned
              investors George Soros, Warren Buffett and Jim Rogers had warned about
              the impending collapse of the United States banking sector way before
              the crisis stuck.</strong></strong></span></p>
              <p>As early as March 2008,  investment guru Jim Rogers had expressed his belief that US bank stocks could fall further and <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">predicts
              that Singapore’s state investors will lose money on their multi-billion
              dollar investments in Citigroup and Merrill Lynch</span></strong>. ‘I’m shorting investment banks on Wall Street,’ the long-time commodities bull told reporters in a media interview.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">‘It grieves me to see what Singapore is doing. They are going to lose money</span></strong>,’ </strong></span>he added, referring to investments by Government of Singapore
              Investment Corp and Temasek in Citigroup, Switzerland’s UBS and Merrill
              Lynch.</p>
              <p>Why didn’t Temasek and GIC take note of this warning then and still
              go ahead and plough in more money into Citigroup and Merrill Lynch
              subsequently ?</p>
              <p>How much money have we been paying for the “top talents” at Temasek
              and GIC to manage our funds during the “good” years ? <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Besides the
              ministerial pay he is getting, how much salary is MM Lee drawing
              annually as GIC Chairman ? Are these salaries justified ?</strong></span></p>
              <p>Since our leaders have always pride themselves as banking executives in Wall Streets who deserve to be paid at market rates, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><strong>shouldn’t they follow the practice in the private sector too and resign to take responsibility for the mistakes</strong> <strong>?</strong></strong></span></p>
              <p>When they demand us to pay them out of the world salaries, shouldn’t
              we expect them to deliver “out of the world” performance even in an
              economic downturn like China’s Sovereign Wealth Fund ? <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>There is
              absolutely no excuse for their dismal performance. Temasek and GIC are
              expected to generate returns even during troubling times instead of
              losing a bulk of our reserves !</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Singapore have imported so many China nationals to our shores over
              the years - Chinese students, workers, prostitutes and Peidu mamas.
              Maybe we should bring the CIC fund managers which probably cost less
              than our “first world talents” over to teach our SWFs how to grow their
              funds for the “long term”.</strong></span></p>
