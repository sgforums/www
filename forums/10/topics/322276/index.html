            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>Here's what I think of LKY principles and methods:</p>
              <p>1. Nothing is sacred so LYING AT ANYTHING IS ALLOWED</p>
              <p>2. When lying take some truth in it to gain some weight but bend it to your advantage.</p>
              <p>3. If intimidation fails use defamation. Mental illness has no hard evidence so I use it since it's the easiest to fake.</p>
              <p>4.
                  Spread only the negative rumors(lies) and factors(some truth) of my oponent. Neglect and hide any positive of your opponent. Make him look
                  bad both to my allies and my enemies.</p>
              <p>5. I have no respect
                  whatsoever for God since I'm in control of everything and almost anyone
                  are intimidated by me and I know even the mind of any people I want to
                  know. I use every means including paranormal to gain advantage over my
                  oponent.</p>
              <p>6. Manipulating people is what I do best. I don't run the country I manipulate people to do what I want them to do.</p>
              <p>7.
                  I like beautiful women and girls and I think any beautiful subject of
                  my own is mine by rights and I would not hesitate to harm anyone who
                  happens to like one of my liking. even when they don't know anything.</p>
              <p>8.
                  I make my enemy frustated. I sabotage(cheat) his efforts to diminish
                  his success. I intimidate and buy other people to do this.</p>
              <p>9.
                  I believe fear is my best secret weapon. I'm the sole terror of
                  Singapore. Fear gives me what I don't get from people I'm not able to
                  convince.</p>
              <p>10. I use my money(or is that my country's) to
                  get me influence over neigboring poorer countries. So I have running
                  dogs all over the region.</p>
              <p> 11. I'm above law both human and divine. So I expect people to do what I want. I have no values.</p>
              <p>So share your view. Even positive ones are okay!</p>

              <p>Hey people of Singapore and the world, you can't touch us the Lees, we will exploit the law to sue you till you are bankrupt.   So you people must always let us have our ways even it means it is to your detriment.   YOu people very ungrateful, we are here to provide you and you are so ungrateful, you all are losers.   We will continue to find ways and means to earn as much money as possible from you be it you like it or not, or be it how poor or rich you are, so what can you do to us?</p>
              <p>We don't want to spend money to take care of the old age problems so we are making it compulsory for you to buy annuity and you can draw out the money if you live long enough to reach 80 or after.    This way we can have longer time earning your money.      We have our pension paid to us but you people are not allowed to receive any pension for you are our money making machines. </p>
