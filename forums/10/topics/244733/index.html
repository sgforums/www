Evidence linking Lim Chin Siong and Barisan Sosialis to be communist seems vague at the most. In other words, there was no direct evidence linking Lim Ching Siong and Barisan Sosialis to the communist.<br><br>1966 Â– Chia Thye Poh, a member of the Barisan Sosialis, was detained without trial for 32 years under the ISA. He spent the last nine years under house arrest in the resort island of Sentosa.  In October 1966, Chia, together with eight other Members of Parliament from the Barisan Sosialis, boycotted the Parliament. This was part of the Barisan's strategy to protest "undemocratic acts" of the Government, by carrying their struggle against the ruling People's Action Party (PAP) outside of Parliament.In the same year, Chia Thye Poh led a demonstration of supporters to the Parliament House and handed a letter to the Clerk of Parliament, demanding a General Election, the release of all political detainees, and the revocation of all "undemocratic" laws.<br><br>In 1989, Chia was released from 23 years of imprisonment without trial on the mainland, and confined to a one-room guardhouse on Sentosa and made to pay the rent, on the pretext that he was now a "free" man. Chia was also made to purchase and prepare his own food.<br><br>1987 Â– In a security operation known as Operation Spectrum, 22 Roman Catholic church and social activists and professionals were detained under the ISA.

They were promptly rearrested. They were later released only on condition that they sign statutory declarations denying everything they had said in their earlier press statement. An intrepid lawyer, former attorney-general Francis Seow, stepped in to represent one of the detainees who had sought his legal assistance. When Seow arrived at the detention center, he himself was detained by the ISD and was not released for more than two months. He was later charged and convicted in absentia for tax evasion. Seow now lives in exile in the United States.<br><br>Even until recently, the case of the Marxist conspirators remains a puzzle. The detainees themselves did not fit the stereotype of the "agitators" whose activities were so troublesome to the PAP in the 1950s and 1960s. Inspired by the success of communist insurrection in China and Vietnam, the old guard leftists tended to be hot-headed, populist orators. The detainees, by contrast, consisted primarily of educated professionals. Indeed, the man accused of masterminding the plot was Vincent Cheng, a 40 year-old social worker for the Roman Catholic church, who had once studied to be a priest. Another prominent target was lawyer Teo Soh Lung, a Workers' Party supporter who had tangled with prime minister Lee during parliamentary hearings on the Law Society in 1986.

He is not a threat because they managed to discredit him alot.<br><br>He is a clown. He allows them to detain him under other legislations aka non registration of speeches etc.</div>
