              <p>Must as well turn it to monarchy.   Monarchy needs no election.</p>
              <p>Anyway, the video is a good source to educate the ignorant Singaporeans.  It is useful during election campaign.    Singaporeans are so brainwashed that protest is bad, protest is sinful.   </p>
              <p>On  the whole, it is oppression for the benefits of the leegime.</p>

              <p>I tried to be open minded and watch the video, and here's my  review.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The video is something which even a 12 year old schoolgirl can create on power-point, with a few slides and pictures. Nothing to rave about the presentation, amatuerish at best.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However, the storyline is unfortunately- hogwash and pure opposition politics unsubtantive propoganda. Here's why:-</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1. Political dissidents:-</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Out of the millions of citizens in Singapore, hundreds of other political figures, why are only 2 of them incarcerated under ISA act? There are definitive reasons for their arrests in order to protect the nation. Communism and communalism was rife during that period.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But of course, now that those dangerous years had passed and we are living in relative safety, these ex-political figures can make all sorts of allegations and claims just to cover up their raggedly communistic racist asses, to fool the new generation into thinking they are heroes.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In truth, what good had these dissidents done for Singapore? Had they been able to alleviate the sufferings of the poor, build homes, plan industrialization for jobs, etc?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So much of their talk about freedom, but centred soley on freedom of speech. What about freedom from hunger, freedom from illiteracy, freedom from poverty?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Please do not misplace your sympathys and worship the wrong god. Salute only those that had work hard to give us a chance at life amidst today's turmoil - our founding fathers as well as our forefathers who realized the opposition could not deliver and made the right vote.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>ISA:-</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Was JB Jeya ever arrested by ISA? Was Chee SJ ever arrested by ISA and detained forever? Which other current political figure was detain and had the key thrown away?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Again, opposition propaganda - ISA act use to remove opposition. An insult to thinking modern citizens again.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>ISA act is of good use to the country and its people. Our forefathers in the past suffered under power mongers, populist demagogues who use communal feelings and emotions to wreck havoc on others to gain power. Innocent civilians died for nothing.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But with ISA act, power hungry politicoes can no longer use racially charged emotions to seize power. By all means, get voted, but based on what one can perform to help the country, not by devious means to make neighbour fight against neighbour.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>No political party that intends to use communal feelings to win will be spared by ISA, including even the ruling party, should one day in future a less honourable person gets into its rank. The ISA act is protect the People.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Personally, many who get to see the video will realize that they had wasted 45 minutes of their time. There is nothing in there that can help citizens. Civil disobidence - for what? reduce cost on ERP? then allow cars to clog the streets?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The opposition or those who seek for opposition better work harder if they want power and glory. Viable Solutions are needed, not more suffering.</p>

              <p> it seems like as we are exposed to the outside world, we know what happens here isn't really correct. like the saying goes, paper can't cover fire.</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>I tried to be open minded and watch the video, and here's my  review.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The video is something which even a 12 year old schoolgirl can create on power-point, with a few slides and pictures. Nothing to rave about the presentation, amatuerish at best.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However, the storyline is unfortunately- hogwash and pure opposition politics unsubtantive propoganda. Here's why:-</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1. Political dissidents:-</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Out of the millions of citizens in Singapore, hundreds of other political figures, why are only 2 of them incarcerated under ISA act? There are definitive reasons for their arrests in order to protect the nation. Communism and communalism was rife during that period.</p>
              <p> because the rest didn't seem a threat which became true</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But of course, now that those dangerous years had passed and we are living in relative safety, these ex-political figures can make all sorts of allegations and claims just to cover up their raggedly communistic racist asses, to fool the new generation into thinking they are heroes.</p>
              <p> it seems like as we are exposed to the outside world, we know what happens here isn't really correct. like the saying goes, paper can't cover fire.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In truth, what good had these dissidents done for Singapore? Had they been able to alleviate the sufferings of the poor, build homes, plan industrialization for jobs, etc?</p>
              <p> did they even had the chance?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So much of their talk about freedom, but centred soley on freedom of speech. What about freedom from hunger, freedom from illiteracy, freedom from poverty?</p>
              <p>when you are hungry, suffering in poverty, will you think of talking or look for food and survive. will you even know whats freedom when you are illiterate?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Please do not misplace your sympathys and worship the wrong god. Salute only those that had work hard to give us a chance at life amidst today's turmoil - our founding fathers as well as our forefathers who realized the opposition could not deliver and made the right vote.</p>
              <p> i rather thank my parents.</p>
              <p>ISA:-</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Was JB Jeya ever arrested by ISA? Was Chee SJ ever arrested by ISA and detained forever? Which other current political figure was detain and had the key thrown away? </p>
              <p>Again, opposition propaganda - ISA act use to remove opposition. An insult to thinking modern citizens again.</p>
              <p> what for when you have a better way of handling and getting compensated.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>ISA act is of good use to the country and its people. Our forefathers in the past suffered under power mongers, populist demagogues who use communal feelings and emotions to wreck havoc on others to gain power. Innocent civilians died for nothing.</p>
              <p>you meant those who jumped onto mrt tracks? </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But with ISA act, power hungry politicoes can no longer use racially charged emotions to seize power. By all means, get voted, but based on what one can perform to help the country, not by devious means to make neighbour fight against neighbour.</p>
              <p> neighbour fight against neighbour? SMRT and SBS transit fighting with each other to raise fares?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>No political party that intends to use communal feelings to win will be spared by ISA, including even the ruling party, should one day in future a less honourable person gets into its rank. The ISA act is protect the People.</p>
              <p> protect the people? or did it create more sai kang for the NSFs, NSmen and regulars?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Personally, many who get to see the video will realize that they had wasted 45 minutes of their time. There is nothing in there that can help citizens. Civil disobidence - for what? reduce cost on ERP? then allow cars to clog the streets?</p>
              <p> allow cars to clog the streets? there isn't enough clogging around?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The opposition or those who seek for opposition better work harder if they want power and glory. Viable Solutions are needed, not more suffering.</p>
              </div>
              <p>yea, with all the recent policies in place, the MIW has certainly created 'viable solutions'.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>im sick of the nonsensical reasons they are giving. the oppositions have yet to prove they can do a better job, but i don't mind handing them a shot at it.</p>
