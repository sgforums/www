              <p><br>So your definition of critical analysis is name callings when you can't win arguments?</p>
              <p>Haven't seen you do much rational thought on your part, mostly name callings, which shows dire consequence due to your inability in thought processes.</p>
              <p>You are quite the hypocritical moron, much like the ruling regime. Preach one thing and practise something totally opposite.</p>

              <p> Sure, by all means, go ahead. You did admit you are sick. Your judgement would be impaired most certainly thus  logical reasons becomes nonsensical ones.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Go ahead and cast your vote as is your right. And hopefully others are not as impaired in their mind as you are.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><br>So, when there is no longer logic left in your arguments, you need to resort to name calling? If discerning people are branded as running dogs, then shall i label your kind as 'plague infested rats'?</p>

              <p>Cause he speaks as if he have nothing in between his ears, nothing can be further from the truth.</p>

              <p>Lackey, you just created this nick and account just to spam here to find fault, look at it, forumers - he just started his posting in sgforums in May 2008 just to get at us who talk negatively about PAP.</p>

              <p>Troll, Point_blank,   just read your own post to me below, you are slapping your own face, practising double standard.  Pay attention to what i have highlighted in red.  Admit it, if you are sent by PAP to interrogate or find fault here.</p>
              <p>Lackey, you are damn bloody hypocritical.   Point fingers at people and said that people do name calling, you do the same, so you are trying to tell us you are more equal than anyone of us.  </p>
              <p>Lackey troll, you keep spamming in this thread to find fault with forumers here.   Not all people here are stupid, they know your motive.   So what else is in your agenda or plan to spam here?</p>
              <p>Lackey, you just created this nick and account just to spam here to find fault, look at it, forumers - he just started his posting in sgforums in May 2008 just to get at us who talk negatively about PAP.</p>
              <p>Admit it, troll, admit you are sent by PAP.  ha ha ha.</p>

              <p>why bother posting here.. this forum is full of anti-pap ppl. i thought they would be able to properly argue  their point of view given a proper analysis of the situation, but the posts in this thread have just been  a low-class name calling of anyone who isnt't anti-pap. i really lost respect for for the anti-pap camp.. if you think otherwise, look at your posts again from a neutral point of view, who you think people will listen to?</p>

              <p>I think to find another politician like Mr Goh Keng Swee or the late Rajaratnam is difficult cause most talent will likely stay in the private sector or migrate to other</p>
              <p>countries.</p>
