              <p>Some take critical thinking as rebellion.   My cousin is against people exposing PAP though sometimes she grumble about the gahmen.   She is hypocritical.  With suppression of expression, it is only healthy that people voice out their concerns about the way the gahmen runs the country.   I think it is uncalled for for those XXX to stop people from talking about the way the gahmen runs the country.</p>

              <p>It would be fun. But the sad thing is, some would believe their views without critically rationalizing it and would follow their delusions blindly.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Generally, estimated 70% voted for the ruling party, but 30% didn't. These 30% are still our fellow Singaporeans, and it hurts to see them being manipulated by people with no substance and no credibility to lead. And these so called 'leaders' use lies, half truths and unsubtantiated allegations to twist others to their viewpoint.</p>

              <p>I am only here to do my part as a citizen, not to praise or bury, but only to ask for rationality not only for myself but for others who wandered here as well.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Who said Singaporeans are a politically apathetic lot, if not for the 'gangsterism' irrational tactics employed by persons such as qiqq9?</p>

              <p>Opposition parties in Singapore will not/cannot form government for at least for another time span(say 10-20 years maybe even longer). And the fact is that they will not seek to do that as well. All they are targeting is to get enough seats in Parliament in order to have a bigger opposition voice.To question/keep in check the ruling party if some unfair/expensive/money taxing policies are put up for implementation. This is the same case as the PKR in Malaysia and early days PAP when they seek to be a minority opposition in the SLF government. These is just some political moves, it is impossible to expect the opposition parties to form government.</p>
              <p>As for the case of SDP, lets not talk about them because they have severely tarnished the image of oppostion parties in SG with their 'silly' antics and stuffs.</p>
              <p>In response to the video, i think that it is clearly a one with a loop-sided view, as in the case of the SIngapore Story(the exact opposite). The video did bring in some of the early days incidents which I think younger generation today will never be aware of.(which tells u how much history of SIngapore has been pushed away)</p>

              <p><br>I do agree with you in response to the video. The thing with 'Pushed Away' history is, are opposition parties qualified to present such histories? Are they objective enough, and had their documents peer reviewed before allowed to be published? I hardly doubt so, thus it is important to critically think when anyone espacially opposition parties start to talk about so called 'hidden' history. It may just be a twisted version as portrayed in that video.</p>

                  22 Roman Catholic church and social activists and professionals were

              few arguments to your "review".</p>
              <p>First off, I agree with you the
              video is pretty cheapo looking, something that any teenager could
              produce with the tools available today. A "few powerpoint slides" may
              be over simplifying that a little though.</p>
              <p>Next, you claim
              that only 2 persons thus far have been incarcerated under the ISA. Care
              to name them? Next, communism was claimed as a threat and so the
              arrests carried out to protect the nation. Wait. Did the communists in
              Singapore actually did something wrong by forming a political party to
              participate fairly in elections? Is communism, although a flawed idea,
              a national security issue?</p>
              <p>Thereafter, you proceeded to say
              that the political dissidents have done nothing good for Singapore. Let
              me ask you this: did they even have the CHANCE to prove themselves? Do
              not even begin to start criticizing the opposition's lack of
              accomplishments until they actually do get a chance to get something
              moving along.</p>
              <p>Moving on, you claim the ISA prevents power-hungry
              politicians from using
              racial comments to gain power. In this respect, we have the Seditions
              Act available, so the ISA is obselete here. However, I do agree that
              the ISA is useful in that it helps officials cut red tape and arrest
              those posing a threat to national security.
              But there needs to be a limit set on this act. Indefinite detention is
              just plain nonsensical and stupid. Perhaps a maximum detention period
              of a year or two is in order.</p>
              <p>And please, cease with the overly dramatic use of language.
              "power mongers", "populist demagogues", they don't sound like words any
              objective person with an open mind would use. It makes you look
              extremely biased.</p>
              <p>If
              there is one point that I agree with you wholeheartedly on, its the
              video's take on civil disobedience. The Civil Rights movement is
              undoubtedly one big step forward in equality, but know that it is
              achieved with quite a hefty price in blood (don't think its all
              peaceful, go wiki and you'll know) Civil disobedience is plain nonsense
              in Singapore. The avenues for effecting change are available. Don't
              like PAP? Go vote for opposition then, or even better, get involved in
              the political process, no one is stopping you. Only you are stopping
              yourself.</p>
              <p>Lastly, I concur with the notion that the opposition needs some solid ideas before we give them our votes. However, don't around associating suffering with opposition parties, it makes you look like an idiot.</p>

              <p><br>Dear Enemychaser,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The first mistake in your post in reply to mine was that instead of reviewing the film, you review my post of the film! Did you even watch the film? This thread was not even started by me. But I respect your right to reply.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You should have critique the film, but you chosed to critique me. Fine. I would leave it to others to deem who's the idiot here.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Next, I am glad you saw fit to agree with several of the points i raised in my review post. As to the degree of implementation, i would rather leave it to the policy makers and MPs to decide. They were voted for a reason - to debate policy matters.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It doesnt really matter to me if you think ill of me or call me an idiot or other names, as long as you are in agreement or some of the issues i raised, because I am not important. The collective People of this country are the important ones, and need to be protected from the ilk and deprivations of the more irresponsible opposition political parties.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>( To answer to the 2 long serving detainees in your query - Chia Thye Poh and Said Zahari. As for the others detained, they are either release within a short period or not political party members but people whom are dangerous to society with the hate mongering they spew)</p>
