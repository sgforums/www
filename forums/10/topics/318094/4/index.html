              <p>eh, troll, say what you like, it is your narrow, bias, perception.   You can say what you like but it does not mean what you say are facts and reality.   I am not subject to what you think of me.    YOu fail in your b.i.t.c.h.y, nasty effort to lure me into engaging any discussion with you, so such you display such sickening, ugly character to rebuke and accuse.   Say and do what you want if it pleases you so much.     I would not entertain troll like you to satisfy you.</p>
              <p>You are so damn good to put words into my mouth and any forumers who are mature, objective, sensible will see through your motives of coming here.   You are here for destructive reasons.   PAP lackeys like you are ever so ready to find fault with people who don't agree with you and PAP.   Well, may be if you are capable, send the police to arrest those who don't agree with you and your masters, PAP.</p>

              <p>It would be fun. But the sad thing is, some would believe their views without critically rationalizing it and would follow their delusions blindly.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Generally, estimated 70% voted for the ruling party, but 30% didn't. These 30% are still our fellow Singaporeans, and it hurts to see them being manipulated by people with no substance and no credibility to lead. And these so called 'leaders' use lies, half truths and unsubtantiated allegations to twist others to their viewpoint.</p>

              <p>Who said Singaporeans are a politically apathetic lot, if not for the 'gangsterism' irrational tactics employed by persons such as qiqq9?</p>

              <p>Go surf the PAP\'s website, that will satisfy you.    You will never never ever be satisfied because there will always be people not agreeing with you and PAP.   If you are capable, go get police to arrest people who don't agree with you and PAP.   You love to indulge in being aggressive to lure people to satisfy you, so pathetic, so unproductive.</p>
