              <p>well, there is the Hock Lee Bus incident if u should remember that was incited by the 'communists' to go against the government. The fact that the so called 'communist' party wielding such great influence over the Chinese students, labour, trade union make them a immediate danger to the overall security  of SG.  Another thing to note,  the communist party have had a history of organising strikes and demonstrations  in an attempt  to challenge the then PAP govt.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>@Point_blank</p>
              <p>If u are questioning the validity of how the opposition parties preceived the different incidents/history, then why are u not questioning the so called History of SG coming from none other than the man himself. Is his view/way the only correct view/way? Sure he emerged victorious from the trying times of the 50s-70s but if u had noticed, the elitist policy of going for the best,being the best, FT rules are basically the same and in the process, common SINGAPOREAN citizens are being neglected/left behind. Is this really what its all about?</p>
              <p>and to the fact that opposition parties having a long way to govern the country is mainly due to the whole political environment in SG(which PAP has a hand in developing), it is a miracle they can survive so long.. lol.. who would join oppositon party when PAP and opposition approach u at the same time. GRC doesnt really help much because  opposition are finding it hard to field 6 people. I wouldnt even wanna go into the election tactics adopted by the ruling party, it works for them for a long time now, i wouldnt see it lasting though.</p>

              <p>Seow joined the Singapore <a title="Law" href="http://politics.sgforums.com/wiki/Law"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Legal</span></span></a> Service in 1956 and rose through the ranks to become Solicitor-General in 1969, a position he held until 1971. During his <a title="Career" href="http://politics.sgforums.com/wiki/Career"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">career</span></span></a> he served under the administration of <a title="Prime Minister of Singapore" href="http://politics.sgforums.com/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Singapore"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Prime Minister</span></span></a> <a title="Lee Kuan Yew" href="http://politics.sgforums.com/wiki/Lee_Kuan_Yew"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Lee Kuan Yew</span></span></a> and was appointed senior counsel to a <a class="mw-redirect" title="Commission of Inquiry" href="http://politics.sgforums.com/wiki/Commission_of_Inquiry"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Commission of Inquiry</span></span></a> in the Secondary IV examination <a title="Boycott" href="http://politics.sgforums.com/wiki/Boycott"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">boycott</span></span></a> by <a title="China" href="http://politics.sgforums.com/wiki/China"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Chinese</span></span></a> <a title="Student" href="http://politics.sgforums.com/wiki/Student"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">students</span></span></a> in 1963 prior to Singapore's entry into <a title="Malaysia" href="http://politics.sgforums.com/wiki/Malaysia"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Malaysia</span></span></a>. For his work, Seow was awarded the Public Administration (Gold) Medal. He eventually left public service and entered into private law practice in 1972.</p>
              <p>He was later suspended from law practice for 12 months by <a title="Chief Justice" href="http://politics.sgforums.com/wiki/Chief_Justice"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Chief Justice</span></span></a> <a title="Wee Chong Jin" href="http://politics.sgforums.com/wiki/Wee_Chong_Jin"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Wee Chong Jin</span></span></a> for breach of an undertaking made to the <a class="mw-redirect" title="Attorney-General" href="http://politics.sgforums.com/wiki/Attorney-General"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Attorney-General</span></span></a> while in private practice. Nonetheless, he was later elected a member of the Council of the Law Society in 1976 and eventually became its <a title="President" href="http://politics.sgforums.com/wiki/President"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">President</span></span></a> in 1986.</p>
              <p>His new appointment led to a falling out with Lee Kuan Yew after he became embroiled in the politics surrounding the role of the Law Society. He ran for the <a title="Parliament of Singapore" href="http://politics.sgforums.com/wiki/Parliament_of_Singapore"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Parliament of Singapore</span></span></a> as part of the <a title="Workers' Party of Singapore" href="http://politics.sgforums.com/wiki/Workers%27_Party_of_Singapore"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Workers' Party</span></span></a> team that contested the <a title="Eunos Group Representation Constituency" href="http://politics.sgforums.com/wiki/Eunos_Group_Representation_Constituency"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Eunos Group Representation Constituency</span></span></a> in the <a class="new" title="Singapore general election, 1988 (page does not exist)" href="http://politics.sgforums.com/w/index.php?title=Singapore_general_election%2C_1988&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">1988 Singapore general election</span></span></a>. His team was wildly popular in Singapore and the Eunos constituency. Seow managed to secure popular support from normally passive Singaporeans. However, in state-monitored elections, it was reported in state-controlled media that he secured 49.11% of valid votes, "losing marginally" to the PAP stronghold.</p>
              <p>Macabre political intrigues followed the post-election excitement. Just before the election, he was detained without <a class="mw-redirect" title="Trial" href="http://politics.sgforums.com/wiki/Trial"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">trial</span></span></a> under the <a title="Internal Security Act (Singapore)" href="http://politics.sgforums.com/wiki/Internal_Security_Act_%28Singapore%29"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Internal Security Act</span></span></a> for 72 days, accused of having received funds from the United States and advice for the purpose of promoting <a title="Democracy" href="http://politics.sgforums.com/wiki/Democracy"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">democracy</span></span></a> in Singapore. According to his account, he was subjected to <a title="Torture" href="http://politics.sgforums.com/wiki/Torture"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">torture</span></span></a>, including <a title="Sleep deprivation" href="http://politics.sgforums.com/wiki/Sleep_deprivation"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">sleep deprivation</span></span></a> and intense <a class="mw-redirect" title="Air-conditioning" href="http://politics.sgforums.com/wiki/Air-conditioning"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">air-conditioning</span></span></a>. During the elections, he was criticised as being an American stooge.

For his work, Seow was awarded the Public Administration (Gold) Medal. He eventually left public service and entered into private law practice in 1972.</p>
              <p>He was later suspended from law practice for 12 months by <a title="Chief Justice" rel="nofollow" href="http://politics.sgforums.com/wiki/Chief_Justice"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Chief Justice</span></span></a> <a title="Wee Chong Jin" rel="nofollow" href="http://politics.sgforums.com/wiki/Wee_Chong_Jin"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Wee Chong Jin</span></span></a> for breach of an undertaking made to the <a title="Attorney-General" rel="nofollow" href="http://politics.sgforums.com/wiki/Attorney-General"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Attorney-General</span></span></a> while in private practice. Nonetheless, he was later elected a member of the Council of the Law Society in 1976 and eventually became its <a title="President" rel="nofollow" href="http://politics.sgforums.com/wiki/President"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">President</span></span></a> in 1986.</p>
              <p>His new appointment led to a falling out with Lee Kuan Yew after he became embroiled in the politics surrounding the role of the Law Society. He ran for the <a title="Parliament of Singapore" rel="nofollow" href="http://politics.sgforums.com/wiki/Parliament_of_Singapore"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Parliament of Singapore</span></span></a> as part of the <a title="Workers' Party of Singapore" rel="nofollow" href="http://politics.sgforums.com/wiki/Workers%27_Party_of_Singapore"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Workers' Party</span></span></a> team that contested the <a title="Eunos Group Representation Constituency" rel="nofollow" href="http://politics.sgforums.com/wiki/Eunos_Group_Representation_Constituency"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Eunos Group Representation Constituency</span></span></a> in the <a title="Singapore general election, 1988 (page does not exist)" rel="nofollow" href="http://politics.sgforums.com/w/index.php?title=Singapore_general_election%2C_1988&amp;amp;action=edit&amp;amp;redlink=1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">1988 Singapore general election</span></span></a>. His team was wildly popular in Singapore and the Eunos constituency. Seow managed to secure popular support from normally passive Singaporeans. However, in state-monitored elections, it was reported in state-controlled media that he secured 49.11% of valid votes, "losing marginally" to the PAP stronghold.</p>
              <p>Macabre political intrigues followed the post-election excitement. Just before the election, he was detained without <a title="Trial" rel="nofollow" href="http://politics.sgforums.com/wiki/Trial"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">trial</span></span></a> under the <a title="Internal Security Act (Singapore)" rel="nofollow" href="http://politics.sgforums.com/wiki/Internal_Security_Act_%28Singapore%29"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Internal Security Act</span></span></a> for 72 days, accused of having received funds from the United States and advice for the purpose of promoting <a title="Democracy" rel="nofollow" href="http://politics.sgforums.com/wiki/Democracy"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">democracy</span></span></a> in Singapore. According to his account, he was subjected to <a title="Torture" rel="nofollow" href="http://politics.sgforums.com/wiki/Torture"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">torture</span></span></a>, including <a title="Sleep deprivation" rel="nofollow" href="http://politics.sgforums.com/wiki/Sleep_deprivation"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">sleep deprivation</span></span></a> and intense <a title="Air-conditioning" rel="nofollow" href="http://politics.sgforums.com/wiki/Air-conditioning"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">air-conditioning</span></span></a>. During the elections, he was criticised as being an American stooge.

              <p>This post of MM and SM is a waste of tax payer money, same also
              Minister in PM office , what they do? PM is useless if he needs
              mentor. Just a disguise to get more pay. Earn so much from 1959
