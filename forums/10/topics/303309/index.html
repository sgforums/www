People did complain, but beyond that they did nothing. But imagine his doing it now. Assuming he went around today and picked up 20 innocent people, branded them Communists in his newspaper and tortured them. Do you think Singaporeans would accept that today? I think not.

Saying stupid things like when is he going to die?<br><br>How low will you people go?<br><br>While I agree with most that MM Lee rules with an iron fist (in the past), have you ever stopped to ask - did he have other choice during the  formulative years,  Singapore's existence was at stake.  We were then poor and desperate.<br><br>I think many of us have forgotten that for a fact.<br><br>A great man is a great man, there is no one in this ungrateful world that can deny this.<br><br>The main problem with MM Lee is - he does not play to the galley or crowd.  He knows what is best for Singapore and he dived straight into tackling those basic issues he knew he had to do in order to bring Singapore forward - like providing jobs and housing, and bringing in investments.<br><br>At that time, there was nobody capable or brave enough to do it, in fact some were instead bent on seeing Singapore fail.<br><br>OK, I agree somewhere along the line MM Lee made some mistakes unpurposely but then again which policitician did not?</div>
