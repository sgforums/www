First, it doesn't have to put up with the increasing domestic hostility to its presence. Second, they need their troops elsewhere as they are already capacity constrained. Third, they will hand over the North Korean problem to the Chinese who, as befits their growing international status, will have to deal with regional pariahs, particularly when it is one of their making.<br><br>Until the Chinese displaced them this decade, South Koreans were the single largest source of Asian business immigrants to the US and Canada. So that video is total crap with respect to how the US has mistreated Koreans, or Koreans are simply hypocrits.</div></blockquote>Can anyone guess where the US is going next? Iran? Syria?</div>

It is just not the way a true socialist country should be. Dear Leader Kim Jong Il came to power 3 years after the passing of Great Leader Kim Il Sung. He only succeeded his father's place under the recommendation from the Supreme People's Assembly and the Korean People's Army.<br><br>The Juche calendar is implemented to commemorate Great Leader Kim Il Sung's Juche ideology. The governance of the DPRK has been based in the Juche Ideology. This has brought the Korean society forward as a revolutionary and socialist one.<br><br>Whether DPRK is rogue or not, depends on different perspectives. I may feel that they are being treated unfairly, but that may not what others think. No one is asking the world to accomodate the DPRK since almost all countries are under control of the usa. It is the rest of the world that has to escape from the iron grips of the usa.<br><br>I do not disagree the usa dropped the N-bomb, neither do i agree to it. Since the security of the DPRK is threatened by the a world bully with nukes, i see no reason why the DPRK shouldn't arm themselves with it to act as a deterrent. So long the usa don't antagonise the DPRK, it would not do anything to antagonise the usa. The reason why the usa kpkb DPRK is because they are anti-communist.<br><br>Lastly, i believe that the birthplace of Dear Leader Kim Jong Il is in the sacred mountain of Paektusan.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Heh. Kim Jung-Il was actually born in a military camp, which was located up in some mountain, but not as the North Koreans had described it. If you were to read the news from the Korea Central News Agency, which is the North Korean news group, you'd realise how ridiculously littered with propaganda their daily reads are. The description of Jung-Il's birth is highly dramatised, and of course, highly inaccurate as well. All these serve the sole purpose of getting the people to idol-worship their leader.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
