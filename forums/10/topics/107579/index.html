            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by the Bear:</div><div class="quote_body">North Korea?<br><br>you don't know? how many Japanese were kidnapped and raised as North Koreans so that they can be "spies for North Korea"?<br><br><span style="color: red;">Do you know how many North Koreans are kidnapped by South Korea using the term "refugees". These numbers are big when compared to the Japanese. Furthermore, Dear Leader Kim Jong Il has already admitted in the kidnaps, and has since sent Hitomi Soga and family back to Japan.</span><br><br>how many thousands die from malnutrition simply because of the hubris of their "Dear Leader"?<br><br><span style="color: red;">The crap stories of malnutritions and starvations are propaganda tools used by western medias and its puppets to discredit the DPRK. Yes, food aid is needed, but do you know more than half of North Korea's land is unsuitable for agriculture? It has also been a victim of severe flooding, especially in the arable western region. Go to the North yourself one day, you'll see Pyongyang is a great city.</span><br><br>btw, against a million-strong army with tactical nuke capabilities, you think the South Koreans can handle their own defence?  maybe.. do you wanna try? do they wanna try?<br><br><span style="color: red;">Please turn the clock back several months ago when scientists in the South admitted they had done uranium enrichment secretly. They were not condemned like the North, the IAEA promises to investigate and take actions but up till now, the US is still practising double standards. With protection by the US, the North has nochoice but to protect itself with N-weapons. Please take note: who first developed N-weapons, who threw the first N-bomb, and who during the Cold War continue to develope WMD. And now the country who started all this sh|t wants to stop another from arming itself with it, without first setting an example to disarm.</span><br><br>heck...<br><br>i think the US is the lesser of the two evils...<br><br>BUT.. when give credit and vilification where they are due... the North Koreans are currently pointing a gun to their own head while holding everyone hostage in the situation..<br><br>"i'll allow you to give aid to my starving people if you let me continue to experiment with nuclear weapons"<br><br><span style="color: red;">Like i said earlier, starving is not common is DPRK, all propaganda. The US is starting the Cold War again. Tell me, which country don't have poverty or starvation?</span><br><br>if that's not atrocity against their own people, what is?<br><br>and... for unequal reporting that skews people's opinions, just look at Israel and the Palestinians..<br><br>the Palestinians use their own people to murder Israelis with suicide bombers... innocent Israel women and children are killed indiscriminately, no one says anything about condemning Hamas and whatever who claims responsibility...<br><br><span style="color: red;">I must reiterate that i don't agree with the Palestine method. But flashback to the 50's, to whom is the land currently Israel belongs to. All Palestinians must fight for the sovereignty of the Palestine. A lot of Arabs were massacred by US and Israeli forces during the Arab-Israeli War. Now you know there is Holocaust.</span><br><br>in retaliation, the Israelis demolish the house of the suicide bomber (whose family receives cash.. ironically $25,000 in the Great Satan's currency) and the whole world cries foul...<br><br><span style="color: red;">The Palestinians are already living in poverty and they cramp many people in one house. Whereas the Israelis lived comfortably at the expense of the Palestinians on Palestinian territory.</span><br><br>these are incidents.. if you do not go further than just the surface, you'd never know, would you?<br><br>i'm not a chest-thumping warhawk.. but there is a time when facing maniacs like the North Korean "Dear Leader" who has a history of psychosis, when facing lunatic fanatics who will not hesitate to kill themselves just to blow up women and children as part of their "vendetta against the Jews", remember who started the whole thing and who has continued with the threats of violence or real violence...<br><br><span style="color: red;">Psychosis? Whoever told you Dear Leader Kim Jong Il was psychotic? Times? The Washington Post? New York Times? International Herald Tribune? The Straits Times? Our Dear Leader is in perfect health.</span><br><br>besides, it's easy for us to rant against them... we don't live there.. we don't have to face the consequences if under pressure, those who are "standing guard" quit their posts...<br><br>if you were an Israeli living in Israel, would you feel safer knowing that armed patrols are around to stop suicide bombers, or would you rather they not be there and the last things you hear on planet earth was "ALLAHU AKBAR!! KABOOOM!"?<br><br><span style="color: red;">Lastly, is Israel on it's own territory? Would you fight back if say, Malaysia occupied Singapore and subject us to terror and heavy economic restrictions?</span><br><br></div></blockquote>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The US will disengage from South Korea on its own volition within the next decade. First, it doesn't have to put up with the increasing domestic hostility to its presence. Second, they need their troops elsewhere as they are already capacity constrained. Third, they will hand over the North Korean problem to the Chinese who, as befits their growing international status, will have to deal with regional pariahs, particularly when it is one of their making.<br><br>Until the Chinese displaced them this decade, South Koreans were the single largest source of Asian business immigrants to the US and Canada. So that video is total crap with respect to how the US has mistreated Koreans, or Koreans are simply hypocrits.</div>
