            <div class='col-md body'>i have read with great interest the french bill that was passed recently. Not only did they ban muslim headscarfs, they banned the turban and any other  secular symbols in schools.<br><br>Despite heated protests from religious leaders of the muslim minority (a mere 10% minus), they were joined by their sikh brothers, it all came to nothing as the french govt has been under constant pressure to curb the rising immigrant problem and this was seen as a supplement to the issue at hand.<br><br>I couldn't help but draw comparisons to the political reasoning behind our gahmen's decision to uphold this ban. If it was righteous, then why didnt they include turbans, christian and catholic crosses (that includes any form of necklaces that bear the cross etc) and all other forms of coptic symbols?<br><br>As i recall, my secondary sch classrooms all have crosses nailed to the wall above the blackboard. To my knowledge, they are still there. Isn't that a religious symbol in a sch? Doesn't it contradict the main purpose of banning the headscarf? afterall, this ruiling was made years ago.<br><br>Is this really the policy of our gahmen? or is this simply selective governing, as long as it suits what is deemed as the norm?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If you school is not a missionary school, then that would be very strange.<br><br>Muslim girls are free to wear the tudung in their own religious schools.<br><br>In the govt. school however, it is largely FFA, and there the boundaries are more blurred. It's a complex issue.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Like you said, there's no clear distinction between missionary and govt schools. Apart from pure religious schools where wearing the headscarf is allowed, plenty of other schools have various religious symbols despite not being a missionary place of learning.<br><br>Convenient that they ban the headscarf on the "fairness" of marginalising religion in educational institutiuons.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>For the Sikhs, the French Government seems to be reviewing their policy of banning public display of religious symbols.<br><br>Incidentally, unlike the 'Turban', the Muslim headscarf for the Muslim womenfolk seems to be a 'Political Statement' to impose the Islamic presence in societies that somehow seem to have ignored their presence.<br><br>If anyone will notice - Islam has been a religion since time immemorial in Singapore; and we have seen the 'head dress' used by the women in the 1950's till the 1970's as a <strong>FASHION</strong> item, of lace material to shield the ladies' from the tropical heat. It was not worn at home, 24 hours a day, even when doing house chores, as one will see in this time.<br><br><strong>Compulsory headscarf - to cover the Women's hair - was never an issue during the 1950s through 1970s.</strong><br><br>It was only during the 1980s, that there seems to be an awakening of the Muslim World.<br><br>The awakening seems to have been linked to the new found 'Economic Power' of the Arab world, by asserting their economic strength through OPEC, in the use Oil as a weapon to combat the Economic and Political Strengths of the Western Powers of Europe, UK and USA.<br><br>This resulted in an awakening from the Malay Communities in Malaysia, Indonesia and Singapore to align themselves in an Islamic Solidarity Front with their fellow Arab-Muslim Brethens.<br><br>The Malay Communities - in South-east Asia - found common ground with the Arab Communities, with both communities generally finding themselves being the Economically Disadvantaged, and Economically Exploited.<br><br>The Islamic Revival and Awakening seems to have co-incided with the new found Economic Influence of the Arab World.<br><br>The strict observance of the Arabs, in covering the Muslim Women, is due more to their interpretation of the Islamic Tenets, peculiar to their sect; and are interpreted and put into practise quite differently by Islamic Teachers in other major Muslim Countries - such as Turkey, Egypt, Syria, and in the Mediterranean rim, all of which are more liberal in requiring the use of head cover for their Muslim Women.<br><br>The <strong>strict observance </strong>of women's dress was adopted in varying degrees by the Muslims in Europe and South-east Asia, more as a public assertion to<strong> test the limits </strong>of the liberal laws of Countries that practises Democracy, Religious Freedom, and the observance of the Individual Rights.<br><br>It is not about Religious Principles, but more a Political Statement to assert the Right to Existence - in a political and social environment that had ignored this community, which has allowed itself to be marginalised in almost every non-Muslim countries.<br><br>At least, the Singapore and French Governments displayed the guts to put a stop to this purposeful effort of a community to identify themselves separately from the rest of Society that they live in.<br><br>It is about the observance of the Outward Forms of a Religion, rather then about its TRUE Substance.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Frenchies have a history of being unfair. Why should any of you be surprised at their attitude and laws? I know it has been very well masqueraded by their marvelous open fruit flans, wines, butter pastries and quiches... until now that is <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> But none the less, I have no idea why they imposed such a law.<br><br>The French govt claims that they do this in line with their silly ideal of assimilation, that the issue goes to the heart of France's self-image as a secular state that keeps faith out of state schools and services to ensure no religion dominates or suffers discrimination.Before the vote, Education Minister Luc Ferry said France had witnessed a "spectacular rise in racism and anti-Semitism in the last three years" and the ban would help to keep classes from dividing up into "militant religious communities."<strong>The ban would also make clear pupils must follow the full official curriculum and cannot object to or skip classes for religious reasons, he said.</strong> I dont see how the banning of religious icons would enable this...<br><br>Teachers have complained in recent years of problems with Muslim pupils who interrupt history classes to deny the Nazis slaughtered Jews; boycott classes on human reproduction, saying they are immodest; or refuse to attend physical education.<br><br>They have also reported that Muslim pupils sometimes repeat anti-Semitic themes they see on Arabic satellite television. Jewish families are increasingly switching their children from state schools to private Jewish schools to avoid harassment .<br><br>Now it sounds to me like, the Frenchies are just pissed off with a few students or people.. who just happen to be Muslim. Or the French are just simply racist/prejudice, they have a history for it, especially against Islam (crusades led by France, Godfroi de Builonne). Either way, the Western world has a changed prejudice view against Muslims because of 911 and the bad publicity. What we need to stem this view, is a hollywood movie about the atrocities of the Crusades in the Middle ages, that would make Westerners think twice.<br><br></div>

Can they accept any migrant becoming a French Citizen, to impinge on the Rights of their Women, who happened to be a Muslim ?<br><br>The issue of the headscarf will rage on, whenever the Muslim Community refuse to acknowledge the advancement of Human History, and prefer to live in the narrowest interpretation of an Ancient Holy Book.<br><br>This can only bring affliction to themselves and their own Community.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Today, we are lead to believe by some Muslim extremist that the headscarf is a religious concern instead of a cultural issue. In the early days of the 50Â”s, 60Â’s and 70Â’s it was quiet common to see some Malay / Indian Muslims ladies wearing a scarf like clothe over their shoulders and we never saw them covering their heads or faces except in the movies. However, due to the export of political Islam from Saudi Arabia, Pakistan etc we have some strange behavioral patterns from some of our local chaps.<br><br>It seems obvious that the Singapore government had selectively and separately tried to handle the Muslims and must have their hands and minds boggled!  Also, the Christians, Buddhists, Sikhs, etc among us had so far not resolved and planned to kill and destroy some targets in our own country so maybe they are given some more time for Â“breathingÂ”.<br><br></div>
