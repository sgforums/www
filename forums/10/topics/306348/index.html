              <p>China storms cause $10b in damages  <br>Affected regions provide bulk of country's winter fruit <br>February 03, 2008       <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>THREE weeks of crippling snow storms across China have inflicted US$7.5 billion ($10.6b) in damages, its government said yesterday, as it also announced a $990 million relief fund for farmers.</p>
              <p>The freakish weather - the country's worst in five decades - has paralysed China's densely-populated central and eastern regions, just as millions of travellers were seeking to board trains and buses to return home for this month's Chinese New Year.</p>
              <p>The storms have killed at least 60 people, closed roads, disabled the rail system, destroyed crops and exacerbated a coal shortage, forcing power plants to shut down and factories to cut production.</p>
              <p> <br>As the toll of the damage became clear, the central bank announced that it would 'urgently create a five billion yuan farm support account, focusing on helping disaster lending by small institutions in disaster areas'.</p>
              <p>Regions hit by the storms provide the bulk of China's winter fruit and vegetables. Mr Chen Xiwen, a top agricultural official, said yesterday that the impact of the weather on produce in some places had been 'catastrophic'.</p>
              <p>Residents of hard-hit areas expressed anger.</p>
              <p>'The government should have prepared for such situations earlier,' Li Xiangxiang, 23, said as she picked over suddenly scarce vegetables at a market in Hunan's capital, Changsha. 'I think the government just wasn't ready.'</p>
              <p>The storm's effects are likely to do little long-term damage to China's overall economy. But they have cast a spotlight on the weaknesses of the country's infrastructure, which has failed to keep up with growth that has topped 10 per cent for five straight years.</p>
              <p>Mr Zhu Hongren, deputy director of the National Development and Reform Commission - the country's top economic planning body - said the disaster had taken a toll on China's economy, but that it would be only short term.</p>
              <p>Hunan, Hubei, Guizhou, Guangxi, Jiangxi and Anhui were the worst hit regions. The central government has allocated 331 million yuan to fund local disaster relief work, Mr Zhu said.</p>
              <p>Most parts of China are very short of electricity amid severe coal shipment disruptions and physical damage to the grid caused by the prolonged snow, rain and cold weather. -- Wire Services.</p>

              <p>china has never denied that they were a contributer. It's america that refuses to admit it and do something about it. Like anything on the global stage these days, the absence of america means pretty much inaction.</p>
