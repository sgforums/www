            <div class='col-md body'>CHINA STUDENT-MISTRESSES KEEP TIMETABLE OF LUST<br>Private investigators see spike in number of cases with China students as third party<br>By Caravan Miriah<br>July 31, 2006<br><br>THE school bell rings and the class<br>breaks for lunch.<br>But for some, the second shift has just begun.<br><br>These girls stand out with their heavy makeup and provocative outfits - miniskirts, low-cut tops and boots - fit for a night out at the disco.<br><br>--Mohd Ishak<br>Gazing out at the busy road, some would light up a cigarette while others whip out their handphones to send SMSes.<br><br>Within minutes, cars will whisk by to pick them up. Behind the wheels are men in their 40s or 50s. The girls hop in and they leave in a hurry.<br><br>This is what The New Paper on Sunday saw when we visited some private schools recently.<br><br>Based on anecdotal evidence from private investigators (PIs), this appears to be the secret life of China student-mistresses who have become a new breed of home-wreckers here.<br><br>The PIs themselves say they're surprised to find that almost every other adultery-related assignment they handle involves students from China.<br><br>For instance, out of 50 extramarital cases that Kokusai Security handles a month in the last two years, 20 would involve a China student as the third party.<br><br>SUGAR DADDY<br><br>Mr S M Jegan, 51, the firm's investigator with 30 years of experience, said: 'Many of these students are not well-off.<br><br>'One easy way to boost their income is to get a sugar daddy to pay their school fees and living expenses.<br><br>'This way, they don't have to eke out a living in a karaoke bar.'<br><br>According to 10 PIs who spoke to us, many of these girls think Singapore men are rich.<br><br>Their objective is to 'reel in a good catch' so they can live like a tai-tai, Mr David Ng of DP Quest Investigators noted.<br><br>In return for sex, they have to pamper the girls with at least a $1,000 monthly allowance, supplementary credit cards, jewellery and holidays.<br><br>One PI and security consultant for private schools added: 'These women are willing to trade their bodies for money and a comfortable life.<br><br>'They don't mind being with an older man, even if he's twice her age.'<br><br>Recently, he handled a case involving two married men in their 50s, who had mistresses aged 19 and 22.<br><br>The two, who are friends, paid for the women's study expenses here and rented a condo in Geylang as their love nest.<br><br>According to the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority, about 51,800 student passes have been issued in the past three years, with nationals from China, Malaysia and Indonesia making up the biggest groups.<br><br>The PIs say most of the student-mistresses stay here for between six months and two years - thanks to their student passes which allow them to stick around for the duration of their course.<br><br>If they don't have the credentials for an academic course, they can always take up English language studies in a private school.<br><br>Some even engage dubious 'education' agents to help them come here.<br><br>JUGGLE LOVERS<br><br>So anyone can sign up - as long as she can afford the agent's fees of up to a few thousand dollars.<br><br>As it stands, many of these women see the fees as an 'investment' which they can quickly recover once they find sugar daddies.<br><br>There are also advantages to being a student. For starters, they have a lot of time on their hands.<br><br>They attend classes in the morning and meet their lovers in the afternoon. At night, they head to the nightclubs to meet more men.<br><br>Said Mr Jegan: 'Some had a few sugar daddies wrapped around their fingers.<br><br>'They were juggling them at different times of the day. The men were in the dark, thinking they were in an exclusive relationship.'<br><br>Mr S Krishnamoorthy, 52, of Safeguard Security, said: 'Singapore is known as an educational hub.<br><br>'Some bad eggs will take advantage of the situation and come here with a different agenda.'<br><br>His firm has handled seven extramarital cases involving China student-mistresses in the last 18 months.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>THEY'RE LOOKING FOR CASH COWS, NOT LOVE<br><br>Other PIs are also seeing extra 'business'. SK Security &amp; Investigations Services' general manager Lawrence Koh, 38, said his firm now deals with four such cases a month compared to just two cases for the whole of last year.<br><br>'They are fast becoming a social problem,' he added.<br><br>These cases are enough to paint a picture of who they are and what they get up to.<br><br>Though most are single women in their 20s, a few are 30-something study mamas who have run into financial problems, said DP Quest's Mr Ng.<br><br>Their targets, observed PIs, are men with big disposable incomes - usually businessmen or professionals in their 40s and 50s.<br><br>'These women don't care if the men are married because they are not looking for love,' said Mr Koh matter-of-factly. 'They just want to nab a cash cow and milk him dry.'<br><br>No surprise then, that scoring As in their courses isn't top priority.<br><br>Revealed a private school consultant: 'They don't do well in tests. During lessons, they are busy SMS-ing or waiting for the bell to ring. Sometimes, they don't attend classes for days.'<br><br>'Once a student even walked in all dolled up. She later changed her address from a rented HDB flat to a private condo.'<br><br>So you don't have to look far to know who their sponsors are, said Mr Lin, 30, a course manager of a private school in the west.<br><br>He observed: 'The sugar daddies will pick them up at the campus during lunchtime. The men are old enough to be their fathers. They even behave intimately in broad daylight.'<br><br>The question then becomes: Why do men fall for these student-mistresses?<br><br>Said Mr Low Teck Keong, a counsellor from the National University of Singapore (NUS) Counselling Centre: 'Most of these women prey on older men. It's quite flattering for the men to have a sweet young thing giving them so much attention.<br><br>'They usually start off as friends and later form a relationship. The men somehow feel obligated to take care of these women, and give them financial support.'<br><br>NOBODY'S MISTRESSES<br><br>But not all China students are cheap, said Ms Bree Li, a native of Shenzi province who is here on a four-year course at the NUS.<br><br>The pretty 22-year-old explained in fluent English: 'I don't socialise with local men at all. I go home after school or meet my peers for coffee. I've never stepped into any discos here.'<br><br>When asked if she goes out on dates, she shot back: 'Go on dates? I'm here to study.'<br><br>She is now staying in a rented two-bedroom condo with a few other students from China.<br><br>'My parents pay for my expenses. Many of us can afford to live comfortably without an income, because our families support us,' she said. 'We're nobody's mistresses.'<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My take on this...<br><br>I believe that all these articles come from New Paper.  Sex do sell papers and it seems that New Paper is positioning themselves to be The Sun of Singapore,lless the centerfold gal.<br><br>This is nothing new, in the 70s there are the m'sian and the thai, philipines... now it is the chinese.  There is a change in the demographic of the source of the mistresses but the activities have been around for a while.<br><br>I believe that more cases are brought up to the surface now as compare to the olden days as the Singaporeans gals are getting more independent.  Another contributing factor is the indiscriminate ways of the chinese to land a catch, they do not mind breaking up families....<br><br></div>
