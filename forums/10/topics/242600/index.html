            <div class='col-md body'>F1 will be one of the greatest test for singapore, but i think if F1 were to really be held here, die hard F1 fans from  around the world will be disappointed, why?<br><br>reason<br>1) for years many , many people (including me) feels that singapores skyline and architects are too boring, i love my country but i am also realistic; our city view is like any other large cities, there is no prominent land mark(except for a small little merlion). the much praise durian is nothing compared to top cultural centres like sydney opera house or the spanish gugenheim museum. The durian is special in singapore but when compared to the world it is no even a worthy attempt. thus F1 city race here will not be as beautiful as Monacos. No thanks to previous URA genius.<br><br>2) lights. there is none in Singapore city night scene. Those who visited HK, Times square and Ginza will tell you Singapore is dim at night. Thus F1 night race will be a bore. Even many cities in China now adays, (who started some 20yrs later than us), b cos of the more relax advertisement rule is so much more colour ful and vibrant<br></div>
