            <div class='col-md body'>Hi hloc<br><br>actually i am not worked up at all, just speaking alot of what i think. Just realise when i type "s h i t water", it will appear as "%*%# water" on the forum, i don't use vulgarities.<br><br>I am a simple person; i just know that i am born here and i call this island my home, even though it is one of the smallest island and nation in the world, this is my home. People around us will threaten us with sand and water and who knows what else in the future, and because we are small and vulnerable, this type of bullying will never stop, if the people living on this island is so blinded with domestic squabbles and don't realise what is happening around us, then it is truely very sad.<br><br>You have to belief in something in life else life is meaningless, i believe it is quite a miracle for what this island has achieve in the past, (funny thing is many people living on the island while the whole world thinks that we are quite amazing) so if we can out do the past then it will be much better.<br><br>We need to be strong, very strong in order to live in this tiny island, else everything will be gone very fast.</div>
