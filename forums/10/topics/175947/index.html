            <div class='col-md body'>When i went Japan, I was touched by the Japan's Healthcare system. The  lower income group in Japan pays only $180 of national insurance a year and it would cover 70% of you medical bills. Despite subsidies, their standard of medical care is very high, probably higher than Singapore.<br><br>We are not discussing about those fake subsidies like HDB,NKF or transport companies buying disel at bulk discount and claiming to be giving subsidies from market rate. This topic is about real subsidies<br><br>Should subsidies be given to health care? Will giving subsidies lead to an inefficient health care system like the British? Will giving healthcare subsidies lead to citizens demanding more subsidies from the goverment? What is the point of building a huge reserves if the money cannot be used to benefit the people? Or should huge reserves be only used to benefit the civil service and civil servants with posh office, posh furniture and high salaries?<br><br>Your opinions please forumites</div>

In the end, science, supported by education, is at the core of competitiveness for a nation."<br><br><strong>Taxes still matter as a production cost</strong> and are one of the reasons why companies relocate abroad. "The real impact of taxes is, thus, on job creation or destruction," underlines the book. A higher cost of business can, however, be in part compensated by improving the "ease of doing business". The simplicity of the tax system seems thus as important as the level of taxation. "In this regard, a simpler flat tax system may be more valuable in the long run than a complex low tax regime," indicates the WCY.</span><br><br>Singapore is still very dependent on manufacturing, while countries like Australia are not. Therefore it is wrong to say that High taxes do not hinder competitiveness<br><br></div>

The simplicity of the tax system seems thus as important as the level of taxation - a simpler flat tax system may be more valuable in the long run than a complex low tax regime " .<br><br>The report also indicated that there is "no clear co-relation between a country's total tax pressure and its overall competitiveness or growth rate seems to exist. Despite the high taxation (above 40 per cent of GDP), Finland, Denmark and Luxembourg rank among the top ten in competitiveness while Estonia, Ireland, the Slovak Republic and the US had excellent growth rates with much lower taxes (25-34 per cent of GDP ) .<br><br>Singapore manufacturing sector is largely export oriented which is supported by a very liberal tax regimes towards costs and revenues earned.<br><br>The impact of high taxes - if any exist - has no direct bearing to the manufacturing sector in Singapore.<br><br></div>

It kills all form of discussion about improving Singapore. Making frequent comparisons with places like africa,indonesia vietnam, leaves no room for any debate in Singapore because we are better than them in many ways. Why not compare with Finland or Denmark since Singapore ministers are drawing world class salaries?<br><br>There are a lot of other debate-killing arguments from the goverment like - "Join politics if you want to debate" or "take action and join community work before you debate". These are senseless arguments because not everyone can be a politician or allocate time to community work because some jobs require 7 days a week commitment. But it doesnt mean they do not have a right to say how they wish their immediate enviroment to be run.<br><br></div>
