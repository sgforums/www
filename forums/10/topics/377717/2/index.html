              <p>Why I am trying to write this is because I am sick of narrow minded singaporeans complaining about their life and singapore. Living in a bubble. Please appreciate what you have and enjoy your life, because trust me you guys are living good. Thank you. I am just a singaporean trying to do a little for my fellow countryman and inform the masses so we dont look like dumb spoilt brats to foreigners.</p>
              <p>I been here for 4 years and found that singaporeans complain alot about low wages, high property prices, high taxes. But you see, most singaporeans have not lived in other countries and therefore 'Think' that they are being surpressed. I used to think that too so i cant really say much. Trust me the world out there is alot worst !</p>
              <p>You all are being protected and shelter by the goverment. Just give you a little hint, do you know that singapore is ranked 26 when it comes to quality of life In the World.</p>
              <p>Here in the USA, many people lost their homes due to the housing collaspe and now live in tents or the streets. I would say singaporeans are lucky that their properties have always risen in value. Medical insurance is way too expensive 2000/year for myself. Many people in USA rather die than see a doctor and millions are without insurance (unable to see a doctor). A classmate broke his thumb and it cost him 15000 USD to fix it. My aunt was involved in a car accident and 5 stitches and one night in the hospital totaled $60,000 !!!!! Can you believe it?<br>In singapore at least you have poly clinic. Around my university, we cant come out after 9pm because we are afraid of getting shot. Trust me its dangerous. Kids walking on the street get shot by stray bullets. The unemployement is 10% national-wide and detroit has unemployment at 30%, meaning 3 people out of 10 you see on the street dont work at all.</p>
              <p>Income taxes are 30% or more, meaning three days out of then you work for the goverment. Taxes are raising too. Property taxes are 10% on a property, eg. $20000 a year for a $200000 dollar house. University rates are 40,000 half a year, compared to a few thousand you pay in NUS.And many students have to work and study at the same time because they just cant pay it.</p>
              <p>So please. Dont complain.</p>

              <p><strong>What TS didn't tell all of you is that on the other hand...in the US..</strong></p>
              <p>1) do you know that Price of Food are still lower in the US than Singapore.</p>

              <p>A Point to Add on Property in the US.....The reason property price are still down at this moment is because there are still no CREDIT available...BUT talking to property agent they are totally BUSY people who are cash rich are snapping up houses...do you know you can still get small apartment for $60,000 where do you get that kind of place in Singapore?</p>
              <p>3) <strong> Minimum Wage. US$7.00 an hour from Fed...here in california is US$8.00/hr</strong></p>
              <p>4) <strong>Social security benefit requirement is 10 yrs of work.</strong> </p>
              <p><strong>Oh by the way....profession such as Nurse get min $22/hr. to as high as $35/hr medical assistant requirement is only high school diploma and attend 9 months of career nursing school they are pay slightly lower but entitle to overtime pay go figure. </strong></p>

              <p><strong>$8000 dollars tax credit for people who buy house now, Recently cash for clunkers up to $7500 combine rebates from manufacture &amp; government. </strong></p>

              <p>In the US if you don't commit yourself with too much expenses U are fine...</p>
              <p>So please tell me what does Singapore govt give you? and not take back?  </p>

              <p>Don't forget your all your medical expenses are tax deductible, as for Singapore medical expenses are not tax deductible (even your spectacles and contact lenses are tax deductible). <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>I think mortgage interest expense is also tax deductible in US, but Singapore is not tax deductible. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Seriously, if US is such a bad place to work, those folks I know who were working waitering jobs in the US, every time they come back to Singapore (1 to 2 years), they managed to save $30,000 to $40,000. Something must be wrong with you if you are not making enough money to make ends meet.

              <p>Higher medical cost in the US is attributable to the higher malpractice insurance that physicians have to insure themselves against.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>The rising </em><a href="http://politics.sgforums.com/2009/09/10/news/economy/healthcare_defensive_medicine/index.htm?postversion=2009093015"><span style="color: #004276;"><em>cost of malpractice insurance</em></span></a><em>, particularly for her specialty, was the straw that broke the camel's back.</em></p>
              <p><em>"<span style="text-decoration: underline;">My malpractice insurance was $125,000 a year, and going up</span>," said Wah. "The only way to get the extra money was to cut back on my salary."</em></p>
              <p><em>But it wasn't always like that. Being a doctor was once thought to be a path to a cushy lifestyle. Six years after she started practicing, Wah hit her "peak" income year in 1990. Then she took a pay cut every year from 1993 onward, to eventually take no salary for two months prior to permanently shutting her office." </em></p>
              <p><a href="http://money.cnn.com/2009/09/14/news/economy/health_care_doctors_quitting/index.htm?postversion=2009091506">Link to article</a></p>

              <p>Most patients are awarded tens (if not hundreds) of millions of dollars in damages claim against the doctor in the US. In Singapore, I don't think the courts in Singapore will award you anything above $100,000.</p>

I would say singaporeans are lucky that their properties have always risen in value. Medical insurance is way too expensive 2000/year for myself. Many people in USA rather die than see a doctor and millions are without insurance (unable to see a doctor). A classmate broke his thumb and it cost him 15000 USD to fix it. My aunt was involved in a car accident and 5 stitches and one night in the hospital totaled $60,000 !!!!! Can you believe it?<br>In singapore at least you have poly clinic. Around my university, we cant come out after 9pm because we are afraid of getting shot. Trust me its dangerous. Kids walking on the street get shot by stray bullets.

              <p><br>You have been where for 4 years??  Since you are comparing the US...</p>
              <p><strong>What TS didn't tell all of you is that on the other hand...in the US..</strong></p>
              <p>1) do you know that Price of Food are still lower in the US than Singapore.</p>
              <p>Example 4 bunch of Lecture for $0.99, Can get eggs for $0.99 a dozen. Beef is $1.97 a lbs.  5 lbs bag of potatoes is $0.99.</p>
              <p>2) Property price are down but it also has plenty of various types of apartment for Renting....</p>
              <p>A Point to Add on Property in the US.....The reason property price are still down at this moment is because there are still no CREDIT available...BUT talking to property agent they are totally BUSY people who are cash rich are snapping up houses...do you know you can still get small apartment for $60,000 where do you get that kind of place in Singapore?</p>
              <p>3)  <strong>Minimum Wage. US$7.00 an hour from Fed...here in california is US$8.00/hr</strong></p>
              <p>4) <strong>Social security benefit requirement is 10 yrs of work.</strong> </p>
              <p><strong>Oh by the way....profession such as Nurse get min $22/hr. to as high as $35/hr medical assistant requirement is only high school diploma and attend 9 months of career nursing school they are pay slightly lower but entitle to overtime pay go figure.</strong></p>
              <p>5) <strong>Temporary Unemployment Benefit for retrench citizens. (although that get payback at rehiring )</strong></p>
              <p><strong>$8000 dollars tax credit for people who buy house now, Recently cash for clunkers up to $7500 combine rebates from manufacture &amp; government.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>6) Milk powder for baby are all free if you apply for govt assistant.</strong>  </p>
              <p>In the US if you don't commit yourself with too much expenses U are fine...</p>
              <p>So please tell me what does Singapore govt give you? and not take back?  </p>
              <p>Ever wonder why Singapore population are down because they are freaking stress out....</p>
              <p>there are no relieves...</p>
