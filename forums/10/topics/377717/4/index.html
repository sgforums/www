              <p>Why I am trying to write this is because I am sick of narrow minded singaporeans complaining about their life and singapore. Living in a bubble. Please appreciate what you have and enjoy your life, because trust me you guys are living good. Thank you. I am just a singaporean trying to do a little for my fellow countryman and inform the masses so we dont look like dumb spoilt brats to foreigners.</p>
              <p>I been here for 4 years and found that singaporeans complain alot about low wages, high property prices, high taxes. But you see, most singaporeans have not lived in other countries and therefore 'Think' that they are being surpressed. I used to think that too so i cant really say much. Trust me the world out there is alot worst !</p>
              <p>You all are being protected and shelter by the goverment. Just give you a little hint, do you know that singapore is ranked 26 when it comes to quality of life In the World.</p>
              <p>Here in the USA, many people lost their homes due to the housing collaspe and now live in tents or the streets. I would say singaporeans are lucky that their properties have always risen in value. Medical insurance is way too expensive 2000/year for myself. Many people in USA rather die than see a doctor and millions are without insurance (unable to see a doctor). A classmate broke his thumb and it cost him 15000 USD to fix it. My aunt was involved in a car accident and 5 stitches and one night in the hospital totaled $60,000 !!!!! Can you believe it?<br>In singapore at least you have poly clinic. Around my university, we cant come out after 9pm because we are afraid of getting shot. Trust me its dangerous. Kids walking on the street get shot by stray bullets. The unemployement is 10% national-wide and detroit has unemployment at 30%, meaning 3 people out of 10 you see on the street dont work at all.</p>
              <p>Income taxes are 30% or more, meaning three days out of then you work for the goverment. Taxes are raising too. Property taxes are 10% on a property, eg. $20000 a year for a $200000 dollar house. University rates are 40,000 half a year, compared to a few thousand you pay in NUS.And many students have to work and study at the same time because they just cant pay it.</p>
              <p>So please. Dont complain.</p>

              <p>Oh mine, after reading  this post of yours, I think we are shortchanged.   I usually place the bottles, plastic materials in the yellow big plastic bag given by the govt for recycling.   I was glad that the govt does not charge for helping us to dispose these items.  Now that I read what you said, I think I will stop contributing my bottles, plastic materials and pass them on to the govt.      Oh I see, the govt probably want these items to make money out of them. </p>

              <p>But if she chose sg citizenship, then it's not too nice.  It cheapens the citizenship since she has switched citizenship twice - from china to singapore and then back to china again.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
