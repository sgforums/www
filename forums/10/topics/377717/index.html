              <p>Why I am trying to write this is because I am sick of narrow
              minded singaporeans complaining about their life and singapore. Living
              in a bubble. Please appreciate what you have and enjoy your life,
              because trust me you guys are living good. Thank you. I am just a
              singaporean trying to do a little for my fellow countryman and inform
              the masses so we dont look like dumb spoilt brats to foreigners.</p>
              <p>I
              been here for 4 years and found that singaporeans complain alot about
              low wages, high property prices, high taxes. But you see, most
              singaporeans have not lived in other countries and therefore 'Think'
              that they are being surpressed. I used to think that too so i cant
              really say much. Trust me the world out there is alot worst !</p>
              <p>You
              all are being protected and shelter by the goverment. Just give you a
              little hint, do you know that singapore is ranked 26 when it comes to
              quality of life In the World.</p>
              <p>Here in the USA, many people lost
              their homes due to the housing collaspe and now live in tents or the
              streets. I would say singaporeans are lucky that their properties have
              always risen in value. Medical insurance is way too expensive 2000/year
              for myself. Many people in USA rather die than see a doctor and
              millions are without insurance (unable to see a doctor). A classmate
              broke his thumb and it cost him 15000 USD to fix it. My aunt was
              involved in a car accident and 5 stitches and one night in the hospital
              totaled $60,000 !!!!! Can you believe it? <br> In singapore at least you have poly clinic. Around my university, we
              cant come out after 9pm because we are afraid of getting shot. Trust me
              its dangerous. Kids walking on the street get shot by stray bullets.
              The unemployement is 10% national-wide and detroit has unemployment at
              30%, meaning 3 people out of 10 you see on the street dont work at all.</p>
              <p>Income taxes are 30% or more, meaning three days out of then you
              work for the goverment. Taxes are raising too. Property taxes are 10%
              on a property, eg. $20000 a year for a $200000 dollar house. University
              rates are 40,000 half a year, compared to a few thousand you pay in
              NUS.And many students have to work and study at the same time because
              they just cant pay it.</p>
              <p>So please. Dont complain.</p>

              <p>so ar.. even if you type lots of it</p>
              <p>ppl will still think that the govt is at fault rather than looking at themselves.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>get sack, you ask for it. who ask you to use ur msn, your sgforums and facebook while at work?</p>
              <p>they can blame the whole world.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>for example, marriage. things don't go well. byebye...</p>
              <p>are you telling me marriage is only for the better and not for worst?</p>
              <p>To have and to hold from this day forward, <strong>for better for <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">worse</span></span></strong>, for
              richer for <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">poorer</span></span></strong>, in sickness and in health, to love and to cherish,
              <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">till death do us part.</span></span></strong>"</p>
              <p>------------</p>
              <p>well is not just singaporeans, infact the whole world is mostly unthis mind set.</p>
              <p>people who are usually sucessful is because they know the right and wrong. and willing to change the wrong part.</p>
              <p>so if you think your life is in TOTAL SHIT because of govt, well i suggest you look into your own life and sto deciving yourself</p>

              <p>If you are referring to Singapore at large. Singapore is an open society with news, information and people flowing in and out and therefore Singaporean is never living in a bubble. <br><br>It may appear to you that Singaporean is complaining because, you have not live long enough to understand the quirks and idiosyncrasies that make Singaporean tick or mad; or you are comparing the benefit/trade off of Singapore's society with your home country, the US.

              <p>I been here for 4 years and found that singaporeans complain alot about low wages, high property prices, high taxes.

              <p>You all are being protected and shelter by the goverment. Just give you a little hint, do you know that singapore is ranked 26 when it comes to quality of life In the World.</p>
              <p>Here in the USA, many people lost their homes due to the housing collaspe and now live in tents or the streets. I would say singaporeans are lucky that their properties have always risen in value. Medical insurance is way too expensive 2000/year for myself.

My aunt was involved in a car accident and 5 stitches and one night in the hospital totaled $60,000 !!!!! Can you believe it?<br>In singapore at least you have poly clinic. Around my university, we cant come out after 9pm because we are afraid of getting shot. Trust me its dangerous. Kids walking on the street get shot by stray bullets. The unemployement is 10% national-wide and detroit has unemployment at 30%, meaning 3 people out of 10 you see on the street dont work at all.</p>
              <p>Income taxes are 30% or more, meaning three days out of then you work for the goverment. Taxes are raising too. Property taxes are 10% on a property, eg. $20000 a year for a $200000 dollar house. University rates are 40,000 half a year, compared to a few thousand you pay in NUS.And many students have to work and study at the same time because they just cant pay it.</p>
