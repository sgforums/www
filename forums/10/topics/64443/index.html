            <div class='col-md body'>It might means that there is alot of unknows about him will be release after questioning eg. the weapeon US claim he have.<br>He might have looked as an person with serveral evil deeds being done in his rich and powerful life in Iraq but now, he looks like a very weak old man waiting for his death. To me he might have met his worst defeat in his life and i think he should be given a chance to start again and to repay his debt instead of just killing him off with a shot. He is just like an old man who has just lost his family and wealth, seeing him on News make me pity him. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Singaporean Soldier Found Saddam, Says Pentagon<br><br><img src="http://www.talkingcock.com/html/images/stories/nsmaniraq.gif"><br>The Pentagon confirmed today that it was Lance Corporal Hock Kian Peng, a full-time National Serviceman from Singapore, who found Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein hiding in a hole in Tikrit.<br>LCP Hock, part of a Singapore Armed Forces detachment providing support services to US troops in Iraq, had been attached to the First Brigade Team of the 4th Infantry Division as a MRE (Meals Ready to Eat) specialist.<br><br>Â“Na beh,Â” said LCP Hock lighting up a cigarette while squatting on a chair at Bagram Airbase. Â“The chao ang mor all arrow me to come because they were damn sian of their hard tack and hojjiber MRE. Then got one of their occifer saw me making Maggi mee in the barracks, and arrow me to come and make for them. Chee bye!Â”<br><br>As with most patrols in Iraq, the troops came under fire at some point. LCP Hock, at that moment about to open a packet of Chu Qian Yi Ding, immediately put his infantry training into operation.<br><br>Â“I immeelly take cover, lor,Â” he said.<br><br>LCP Hock said he scrambled for the nearest dwelling place, an adobe-type mud house. He noticed that there was a hole in the ground, barely obscured by a rug and a piece of styrofoam.<br><br>Â“I thought, ho say leow!Â” he recounted. Â“But then, when I try to go inside, nao hiah, got somebody oreddy inside.Â”<br><br>That someone was former Iraqi president Saddam Hussein.<br><br>Â“Acherly, I dinÂ’ch recognize him at first,Â” LCP Hock confessed somewhat sheepishly. Â“When I jump in, I immeelly shout at him, siam ah! Lim peh wanÂ’ to take kah-ver here! Then I look closely andÂ… eh!Â”<br><br>Â“Then he say to me, Â’Yes, I am Saddam Hussein.Â’Â” Said LCP Hock. Â“Acherly, I thought he was the mee goreng man from my house hawker centre there, and I was going to ask him what is he doing here in Iraq. But when I heard Â‘Saddam HusseinÂ’, I immeelly thought, wah lan eh, tio beh pio ah!Â”<br><br>LCP Hock will be presented with his US$25m reward by Iraqi administrator Paul Bremer later this week.<br><br>He has not decided what to do with the money. Â“Nao hiah, first must pay off the Ah Long,Â” he smiled. Â“Maybe after that set up my own KTV launge cum massage parlour in J.B.Â”<br><br>Why Johor Baru?<br><br>Â“Na beh,Â” said LCP Hock. Â“Take back to Singapore, Gahmen sure kapo, mah. Otherwise how to pay minister?Â”<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Saddam holds little of value in the way of military intelligence. His capture however, is significant in the political aspect where he ups George W. Bush's brownie points in the upcoming elections just when he seemed a no-hoper.<br><br>Tony Blair is another who can heave a huge sigh of relief.<br><br>The shadow of saddam which has stained the nation can now be lifted with the knowledge that he will stand trial for his crimes against humanity.<br><br>Apart of that, i think the bombings will continue....just like the talebans</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>No there is a victory for America. In the sense in all your wee minds deep down inside, there is a strengthening reinforcement of the idea that Western Americanness is the best... because they can invade anyone and depose anyone etc etc... America is ideally more popular/feared for deposing Saddam now. So prolly next in line would be.. Korea's Kim? Followed by... i dunno some other non-democratic person who *#*@ s up his country.<br><br>However, the above mentioned phenomenon is countered somewhat by China's space programme and the rumour/prophecy that China will be a Great economic power better than the mighty US of A.
