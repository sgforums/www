What to stop the US from placing military bases there... That whole situation was because of US meddling... the obscurity of ownership.. US arms.. and what if US insist on invoking the SFPT ? You mean China will just sit on it ? As if Japan is not enough, and now potentially having the seventh fleet and bases at it's door steps. It will never happen.<br><br>And about the village thingy, China has always claimed ownership of Taiwan, and Vice visa. Till I think in 1971. Getting Taiwan back is a China pride thing. Wouldn't you want your property back ?<br><br>I know... I know what's you point is. But it's also about national security of China too.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Taiwan, historically is part of China, that's not going to change. However, i feel that taiwan and China's way of governing is like heaven and earth, two vastly different systems. The crap about HK retaining its system and way of governing is BS, because u can see that China constantly interferes in its politcial system. And Taiwan, which is rated highly in terms of democracy, is more vocal when it comes to voicing out their displeasure, if any. How are they going to incoporate Taiwan into China?<br><br>China won't do anything before 2008, because the Olympic Games is going to keep them busy for a while, but after 2008, who knows? The US may always say that they will come to Taiwan aid, but after Iraq, Afghanistan, and the never-ending war on terror, who can really say that now? The US public will NEVER support another war if the above mentioned wars are not settled.<br><br>Chen Shui-bian is serving as an deterrant to China. If KMT comes to power, KMT will definitely seek closer ties with China, and in the process, unify with the motherland. The taiwanese may want to avoid War with china, but the sentiment there is that they never see themselves as part of China. So, they will most probably not vote for anyone who wants Taiwan to go back to China's arms.</div>

Only Japanese was taught and learning their mother tongue Chinese was prohibited. Once discovered, death.<br><br>The Japanese occupation had a great impact on Taiwan until today. The former "president" Li Deng Hui even said that he himself is a Japanese..what rubbish...<br><br>As some of you guys said that China needed to be more democratic, I have to tell you something. After the cultural revolution, China's economy is damn poor and the country has been struggling with building up its economy for years. Now even though the people of China can live carefree lives, and the economy is ok, but there are still people who wanted democracy. Which i disagree. The communist party is not the communist party we know in the past. It is different now. Maybe my post on my blog titled "Communism in China" explains some of it:<br><br><strong>Communism in China</strong><br><strong>From Huaqing's Blog (http://mahuaqing.blogspot.com)</strong><br><br><strong>As a lot of you know, China has been under communism rule since 1 October 1949. Over the years, the communists here have undergone a lot of changes. Nowadays, i don't find them like communist anymore.<br><br>Over the years, communism failed in many countries, such as Russia. However, nowadays countries like China and North Korea still claim to be under communism rule. The communists in these two countries are very different.<br><br>In North Korea, the communists there did not make North Korea a rich country. In fact, after the Korean war has ended for more than a century, North Korea's economy only grew a little. The people there has not enough food to eat. As a result, the nation has to rely on other countries to supply her with food and other resources.<br><br>In Malaya, communists created waves of unrest and disorder and people in Malaya did not like the communists. At first the Malayan Communist Party or MCP tried to overthrow the Brithish colonial rule, but to no success. Singapore eventually gained full self government with people like Lee Kuan Yew. Now MCP is very weak and is only present in Malaya. Its relations with the Chinese Communists Party is very bad also. It is very clear that the Chinese Communists Party did not agree with the Malayan Communists Party on creating social disorder in Singapore.<br><br>Since 1840, China has been under half-colonial and half-imperial rule under Qing Dynasty until 1911, when the Xin Hai Revolution occured, which overthrew the Qing Dynasty. Since 1840, Western powers defeated China and occupied many areas. The English sold opium to China, and made a lot of people addicted to it. The First Opium War opened the door of China, and after that many other western powers also came to China to occupy her land and natural resources.<br><br>The 1911 Xin Hai Revolution overthrew the corrupt Qing dynasty imperial government, and Sun Yat Sun set up The Nationalists Pary, also known as Kuomintang. He hoped to change China, but China was still in danger. In 1931, the Japanese occupied The Northeast Provinces or Manchuria of China, Heilongjiang, Jilin and Liaonin. The Japanese furthered its expansion in 1937 when it started to invade other parts of China. When the war ended in 1945, the Nationalists started a war against the communists. So the two parties fought against each other.<br><br>The communist has long wanted to overthrow the Nationalists led by Chiang Kai Shek, because it was also corrupted, which the communists succeeded. In 1949, the Nationalists were forced to leave Mainland China and fled to Taiwan. This situation caused there to be two governments in China nowadays, one in Mainland and another in Taiwan.<br><br>In 1949, there is this saying in China that "Without The Communists Pary, There is no a New China", which is quite true. If the communist did not overthrow the Nationalists, then i cannot imagine what China will be like nowadays...probably still very poor.<br><br>After the communists took over, the people of China had their lives improved. Over the years, the communists commited some mistakes to cause economy downturn in China too, eg. The Great March in the 1950s, and the Cultural Revolutions in the 1960-70s.<br><br>In 1979, ex-Chinese president Deng Xiao Ping became the president of the nation and the Cultural Revolution finally came to an end. China's economy began to revive. After 20 over years, when we take a look at the economy of China, we find it has grown a lot and China became richer. None other communists state has ever achieved this.<br><br>One difference between China and other communists nations is that, China allows captalism to be present despite communists oppose captalists. Therefore, i say that the communists nowadays are not like communist anymore.<br><br>The communists in China are more interested in economy than communism. This is really very different from North Korea. Maybe that is why North Korea remained so poor after over half a century of nation building.</strong><br><br>I wonder what will happen if the political system in China changes again. The country may be in chaos. Therefore i think the current system is good enough, as it is trying to change slowly. Instead of wanting democracy, we should accept the current political system.<br><br>By the way the current political system is democratic too. The National Congress(Members of the Parliament in Chinese Terms) is a meeting held every few years and the representatives from different parts of China were elected. Thus they represent the people. I don't see why it is not democratic. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
