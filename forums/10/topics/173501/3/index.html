            <div class='col-md body'>As a people, history has shown that China has been quite divided. Taiwan claims to be different from China even though it was historically a province of China but this divisiveness is to be expected. Singaporeans too are even more divided because the the ruling elites have over-emphasised on leades' elitism and somewhat neglected in developing social and cultural togetherness and mutual trusts, sharing of suffering and prosperity among different ability groups within the society over the years. Singapore leades have no moral authority over the people on the issue of China and Taiwan as it is basically an issue to be determined by cultural affinity, unity and sharing of common goals etc among the people.<br><br>It is only when people are united as one that there will arise greater appreciation the importance of building a country and society. But there wasn't such any attempts in building up cultural, social and national affinities among the people so it is difficult to try to survive and grow as one people.<br><br>Singapore require great leaders to build a strong bond among the different strata of the people.</div>
