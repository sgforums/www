            <div class='col-md body'>Thousands of Taiwan opposition supporters took to the streets for the second time in a week on Sunday to rail against President Chen Shui-bian and his policies, which they claim are fanning tensions with China. The protest raised many of the same issues brought up in an opposition rally last Sunday, including ChenÂ’s abolishment of the National Unification Council and its guidelines on unification with its giant neighbour, and arms purchases from the US.<br><br>Relations with China have been strained since pro-independence Chen scrapped the council in February, prompting Beijing, which considers the island part of its territory, to call the move a Â“dangerous provocationÂ”. Around 10,000 people gathered near the presidential building in the capital Taipei, holding banners reading, Â“We want peace, we oppose the scrapping of the national unification councilÂ”.<br><br>Â“This country has too many problems that require our attention, but our countryÂ’s leaders, our government donÂ’t really pay attention to the peopleÂ’s suffering, they canÂ’t pull their attention away from the issue of unification or independence,Â” Nationalist party chairman Ma Ying-jeou said. Â“What people care about is the economic problems and direct links with China,Â” Ma said.<br><br>The protest coincided with the second anniversary of the shooting of Chen and Vice President Annette Lu.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The future of Taiwan is unification with the Mainland. According to the PRC, there will be no compromise in this.<br><br>I personally feel that Taiwan is part of China and have no rights to declare independence whatsoever. Afterall, Chiang fled the China to Taiwan in 1949...<br><br>If Taiwan declares independence, I will support the PRC's decision to attack. US intervention is not much of a concern. Afterall, there is a saying " USA values Los Angeles more than Taiwan " and the US wants to have a better relationship with PRC in the 21st century.<br><br>The PRC used to supply arms such as missiles to Middle-Eastern countries such as Iran. Therefore, I do not think the USA would want to worsen the relationship and risking the PRC to support countries and organisations that are anti-USA.</div>
