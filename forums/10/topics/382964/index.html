              </div>
              <p><strong>OPINION</strong></p>
              <p>In a recent study released by the United Nations Development
              Programme (UNDP), over 90 per cent of Singaporeans expressed confidence
              in the capability and integrity of their leaders, more so than any
              other developed country in the world.</p>
              <p>Are our leaders really that great or is it merely a mirage conjured
              by years of relentless state-sponsored propaganda via the mainstream
              media such that Singaporeans can no longer distinguish the truth from
              the myths?</p>
              <p>Joseph Goebbels, the spin doctor of Nazi Germany once said:</p>
              <p><em>“If you tell a lie big enough and keep repeating it, people will
              eventually come to believe it. The lie can be maintained only for such
              time as the State can shield the people from the political, economic
              and/or military consequences of the lie. It thus becomes vitally
              important for the State to use all of its powers to repress dissent,
              for the truth is the mortal enemy of the lie, and thus by extension,
              the truth is the greatest enemy of the State.”</em></p>
              <p>The brand name of the PAP and the public image of its leaders is
              cultivated, nurtured and promoted thoughtfully and assiduously over the
              last 4 decades by the state media.</p>
              <p>The three central tenets or myths which underlie the imaginary invincibility of the PAP are:</p>
              <p>1. PAP ministers are the best talent that Singapore can find.</p>
              <p>2. As such, they deserve the highest salaries in the world since they can earn much more in the private sector.</p>
              <p>3. They are incapable of making the slightest mistake.</p>
              <p>The above three blatant lies would have been exposed and debunked a
              long time ago if not for the Singapore media which continues to pull a
              wool over the eyes of Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>During the 2006 elections, Prime Minister Lee admitted publicly that
              not all of  the PAP’s slate of fresh faces were his first choice as
              many potential candidates refused to stand for elections which implies
              that the current batch of ministers and MPs are not necessarily the
              best talents in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Singapore’s ministers are grossly overpaid to govern a tiny island state of only 700sqkm2 in size.</p>
              <p>No amount of reasoning or rationalizing can explain why the
              Singapore Prime Minister is paid more than 5 times the annual salary of
              the U.S. President.</p>
              <p>The oft-repeated argument that the ministers would have made a lot more money in the private sector does not make any sense.</p>
              <p>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong, a former minister, is earning no more than $30,000 a month as a director at Lippo group now.</p>
              <p>Dr Yaacob Ibrahim probably earned around $10,000 to $15,000 a month
              as a NUS professor before he became a minister. He now earns more than
              $150,000 a month.</p>
              <p>Despite their high pay, Singapore ministers are capable of the most
              juvenile and atrocious mistakes such as allowing a limping terrorist to
              escape from a detention center and evading captors for 4 days before
              swimming across the Straits of Johor, failing to increase the supply of
              HDB flats in the face of massive immigration leading to sky-rocketing
              prices today and causing two unnecessary deaths from food poisoning due
              to negligence.</p>
              <p>Yet no matter what mistakes they make, the mainstream media will
              always manage to spin the story in such a way to exonerate the
              ministers from blame which explains why nobody ever bother to apologize
              to the public because doing so is tantamount to admitting one’s mistake
              and being the highest paid ministers in the world, they cannot afford
              to reveal their flaws or they can’t justify their astronomical pay
              anymore.</p>
              <p>And why must the ministers be paid so highly? Because under the PAP
              system which ensures power remains in the hands of a few, it is
              difficult to attract people who are both talented and loyal at the same
              time to join politics.</p>
              <p>In a healthy, functioning and developed democracy, the media is supposed to act as a watchdog of the government.</p>
              <p>The only way for the people to assess the performance of the government objectively and accurately is through the media.</p>
              <p>There are no avenues for them to find out the mistakes made by the government if the media does not highlight them.</p>
              <p>In Singapore, the media has become the “lapdog” of the government instead of a watchdog.</p>
              <p>Its role has been subverted to ensure that one political party
              remains entrenched firmly in the system forever at the exclusion of all
              others.</p>
              <p>The state media employs three main methods to achieve these aims:</p>
              <p>1. Selective reporting.</p>
              <p>2. Spinning.</p>
              <p>3. Obfuscation.</p>
              <p>The reports carried by the Singapore media are almost always one-sided and skewed to the side of the government.</p>
              <p>More than often, the media will report only what the government
              wants the people to know and choose to omit other information which
              will make them look bad or lousy.</p>
              <p>For example, the mainstream media gave extensive publicity to
              Singapore’s third-place ranking by Transparency International, but not
              to international rankings which put Singapore in a bad light such as
              its dismal 133th ranking on the World Press Freedom Index by Reporters
              without Borders.</p>
              <p>Spins are almost always added in the articles to generate a favorable impression of the subject in the minds of the readers.</p>
              <p>MM Lee admitted recently that he made a mistake in Singapore’s
              education policy, but the news articles were deliberately spun in such
              a way to make him appeared as a magnanimous leader who have no qualms
              admitting his faults.</p>
              <p>There was no mention made of his many other mistakes made in the
              course of his political career with serious cost to both the nation and
              its citizens.</p>
              <p>When all else fails, the media will resort to throwing smoke bombs to divert public attention from the issue at stake.</p>
              <p>The KKH medication error was simply attributed to the design flaws
              of the two infusion pumps instead of inadequacies within the system
              itself.</p>
              <p>The Health Minister Khaw Boon Wan denied all responsibility by
              cleverly dwelling on the “magnanimity” of the patients to forgive the
              two pharmacists involved to obfuscate the real issue at stake which is
              the safety and reliability of SIngapore’s public healthcare system.</p>
              <p>In the second part of the article, we shall examine the 5 common
              ways in which the media helps to portray Singapore leaders as much
              better than they really are.</p>

              <p><br>We can certainly count on the opinion of a pathetic "zwei-siao-Hog" struck with the mid-term "men-o-pausal" syndrome.</p>
              <p>Sadly symptomatic memory lapses is part of the syndrome.</p>
              <p>Its memory will fail momentarily, or persist through two months and more, and will accidentally recall <strong>back issues</strong> - that it had paused to let itself crinkle for the duration - to let fly with its pent up frustrations of its aging "zwei-siao" unaccomplished Life.</p>
              <p>Part of its men-o-pause symptoms will include short temper, intolerance, impatience, foul mouth, incontinence, and impotence.</p>
              <p>Obviously, the "zwei-siao-Hog" must have been undergoing hormone replacement therapy - which explains for its squeakly temper, highly strung impatience, and "into your face" attitude as it struts around deluded as a superior "pseudo-Bavarian HOG".</p>
              <p>Is the "zwei-siao-pseudo-Bavarian-Hog" still mixed up with the Tommies and the Tommy who is dirty Old Harry's  mate ?</p>
              <p>One thing is for sure, is that the "zwei-siao-pseudo-Bavarian-Hog" will never mix up Dickie with anyone, as CSJ's dickie is always rolling in its mouth - night and day.</p>

              <p><br>We can certainly count on the opinion of a pathetic "zwei-siao-Hog" struck with the mid-term "men-o-pausal" syndrome.</p>
              <p>Sadly symptomatic memory lapses is part of the syndrome.</p>
              <p>Its memory will fail momentarily, or persist through two months and more, and will accidentally recall <strong>back issues</strong> - that it had paused to let itself crinkle for the duration - to let fly with its pent up frustrations of its aging "zwei-siao" unaccomplished Life.</p>
              <p>Part of its men-o-pause symptoms will include short temper, intolerance, impatience, foul mouth, incontinence, and impotence.</p>
              <p>Obviously, the "zwei-siao-Hog" must have been undergoing hormone replacement therapy - which explains for its squeakly temper, highly strung impatience, and "into your face" attitude as it struts around deluded as a superior "pseudo-Bavarian HOG".</p>
              <p>Is the "zwei-siao-pseudo-Bavarian-Hog" still mixed up with the Tommies and the Tommy who is dirty Old Harry's  mate ?</p>
              <p>One thing is for sure, is that the "zwei-siao-pseudo-Bavarian-Hog" will never mix up Dickie with anyone, as CSJ's dickie is always rolling in its mouth - night and day.</p>

              <p><br>The expert opinion of the resident "zwei-siao-HOG" must have been based on its own intimate experience with being mistreated from all directions.</p>
              <p>How else could it have reached its grand "zwei-siao" status as a HOG ?</p>
              <p>Did the "zwei-siao-HOG" suffered so much at the hands of dirty old Harry that it had to grit on its little finger to endure the suffering ?</p>
              <p>Perhaps the "zwei-siao" little finger was not enough and it had to delude itself that it is chewing on CSJ's tormented dickie - only to find out that it is too little to endure the sufferings for the good of the common people ?</p>
              <p>It is simply pathetic that the "zwei-siao-HOG" will spite CSJ, as much as it spite dirty old Harry, and Tommy included, and of course a whole host of participants in this Speaker's Corner that it cannot tolerate and find problems with.</p>
              <p>Now, does this not have similarities with the <a rel="nofollow" href="/forums/10/topics/384696?page=2"><strong>‘inside story’</strong>  </a>in the other thread - <a rel="nofollow" href="/forums/10/topics/384696?page=2">‘<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Govt failed to create wealth for the GEN Y</span></strong> ?’ </a></p>
              <p>Was it not the <a rel="nofollow" href="/forums/10/topics/384696?page=2"><strong>‘inside story’</strong>  </a>who found that  "<span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>SGforums</em> <span style="color: #000000;">(is)</span> <em>where the dumbest people in SG converge</em></span>" ?</p>
              <p>The <a rel="nofollow" href="/forums/10/topics/384696?page=2"><strong>‘inside story’</strong> </a>may well be part of the "zwei-siao-plot" being uncovered, which leads to a flurry of old threads being dredged up from three months past.</p>
              <p>All these vile acts were done in the typical petty acts of "<em>arrogant petulance with a 'zwei-siao' insolent attitude</em>" displayed in a kid possessing "<em>an amoebic IQ that failed to grow with the seeds left in some animal womb</em>".</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>It is not surprising.  Most mass media in the world do that for their governments.  Even in US, before the invasion of Iraq in 2003, practically all the mass media supported based on false WMD.   The only differrence, is the degree of pro-govt by the mass media in each country.</div>
