            <div class='col-md body'>CLASH BASH<br><br>Youth argues with girl. It turns into slapping match. 5 hours later, he meets with girl and her mother. Then a group of men attacks him<br>By Alvin Chiang<br><br>December 31, 2005<br><br>THEY came out of the blue and belted him.<br><br>Peter showing how he covered his face during the attack. --Pics/KELVIN CHNG<br>The gang of seven, made up of young men and teenagers, pounded and kicked him.<br><br>Their teenage target had to be taken to hospital in an ambulance. He was treated as an outpatient and discharged.<br><br>Five hours earlier at 5pm on Tuesday, Peter (not his real name), 19, had an argument with a 15-year-old girl, who he claimed is his girlfriend.<br><br>We are not naming Peter, an ITE student, as the girl is a juvenile and cannot be identified.<br><br>The argument at a bus interchange ended badly.<br><br>SLAPPED GIRL<br><br>Peter admitted that he slapped the girl.<br><br>It is not known if the later assault on him at another bus interchange was a result of the slapping incident.<br><br>Peter recalled the incident: 'I got a call from one of my friends who knows the girl.<br><br>'He said the girl wanted me to go to her house in Chai Chee immediately to talk about what happened between me and her.'<br><br>The girl said a vein in her left eye burst after the slapping incident with Peter. --KELVIN CHNG<br>He declined and told his friend he was hanging out with friends at the interchange.<br><br>About 10 minutes later, Peter claimed, the girl and her mother showed up at the interchange.<br><br>He said he saw a group of men, including some teenagers, close by.<br><br>The girl's mother claimed that she had no idea who these men were.<br><br>She said it was Peter who had told her to meet him at the interchange after she called him to ask why he had hit her daughter.<br><br>She asked Peter to apologise to her daughter. But while they were talking, the group approached him.<br><br>Peter said a man in his 20s, whom he did not know, challenged him to a fight but he refused.<br><br>The man then attacked him and the rest of the group charged in.<br><br>Peter claimed that his friends were prevented from helping him.<br><br>He said he covered his face with both arms to protect himself but it was no use.<br><br>He said: 'After I covered my face, some of them started to attack the back of my neck.<br><br>'I could feel my neck being hit by someone wearing boots. I could tell they were not shoes because they felt very hard.<br><br>'Before I knew it, I fell to the ground.'<br><br>Peter claimed his attackers continued to kick and punch him for about five minutes. They only stopped when a passer-by shouted at them.<br><br>He suffered cuts and bruises on the back of his neck, left forearm, left cheek and the left side of his ribcage.<br><br>His pair of green plastic spectacles was broken.<br><br>Police spokesman Siow Cheng Cheng confirmed that a rioting case involving seven to eight men assaulting a youth took place at the interchange on Tuesday night.<br><br>When the men attacked Peter, the girl and her mother moved away.<br><br>The mother said: 'When I saw the men going for the boy, my daughter and I quickly stepped out of the way. If not, we may have been hit too.'<br><br>She said she was afraid that the men might go after her as well.<br><br>'I was sitting next to him. Who knows, the attackers may think I am related to him and come after me.'<br><br>The girl disputed Peter's claim that she is his girlfriend.<br><br>BROKE UP<br><br>She claimed she dated Peter for about two months, but they broke up about six months ago.<br><br>She said she has another boyfriend now.<br><br>During their argument, they ended up slapping each other, she said.<br><br>She showed The New Paper her injuries last night. A red mark was still visible on her left arm.<br><br>Her mother said of Peter: 'I don't know why he thought my daughter is still his girlfriend.<br><br>'He kept sending her text messages on her handphone even after they broke up.'<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Rise in teen rioting<br><br>THERE has been an increase in teen rioting over the years, police figures show.<br><br>Rioting can be defined as fights or armed attacks involving more than five people.<br><br>The number of rioting cases involving those between 7 and 19 years old was 250 in the year 2001.<br><br>It rose to 446 in 2002 and increased again to 493 in 2003.<br><br>Last year, there were 512 such cases.<br><br>It's not known yet whether there will be another increase this year. From January to June, 245 rioting cases were recorded.<br><br>Senior youth counsellor Joyce Chan said on average, she sees between 50 to 130 teen rioters a year.<br><br>These teens were referred to the centre from the courts, schools and families of the teens.<br><br>STARING<br><br>Ms Chan, who runs the Teen Challenge Student Centre, said staring is one of the most common reasons that teens get into fights.<br><br>The counsellor with six years experience said: 'Some youths don't like people to look at them.<br><br>'Even a normal look can be seen as a stare. But sometimes, there's no reason why they mistake a look for a stare.<br><br>'They may just want to find fault or don't like someone's face.'<br><br>She said peer pressure can also be a reason that teens join gangs.<br><br>Once they are in gangs, the chances of such teens getting into fights become higher.<br><br></div>

Teachers are increasingly concerned about pay raises and promotions, and less so for teh welfare - physical and emotional - of the students they are teaching. It's no wonder soem students behave so badly. Our schools are filled with bureaucratic rules hearkening to obscure values which no student can comprehend.</div>

Some advocate the Death Penalty - a cruel and inhumane, not to mention a religiously non-adhering (Buddhist or otherwise)  punishment - for all kinds of crimes. No, caning does not solve any problem; it's not even a cure, and certainly no form of prevention. Instead, caning will stir resentment against the caner or the institution s/he represents, and the caned might find some way of vengeance. Suspension simply means the violence will be brought to the streets.<br>The real solution is to see what is CAUSING all these problems, and a cause can NEVER be a lack of punishment.</div>

Animals live in a world of "the survival of the fittest", where the strong conquer the weak. This is why strong beasts attack weaker animals &amp; run away when attacked by stronger animals. Only by behaving in this way can they continue to survive. The education system over here seriously needs an overhaul, if we do not want to produce "animals".</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Welcome to Singapore!!!<br>Well, we are living in a world of "survivor of the fittest", especially in Singapore. Study hard, get a good job, earn big money. You survive. Step on your classmates, friends, who ever. As long as you belong to the top, it's ok.<br>I honestly pity the society now.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by dragg:</div><div class="quote_body">we have secret society in the past.<br><br>this is just an improved structure.<br><br></div></blockquote>Hi, why is rioting an improved structure as compared to secret societies?<br><br>Secret societies, although a threat to public peace and non SS connected ppl, usually tend to fight amongst themselves. In a warped sense, sg's low level organised SS are easier to infiltrate, monitor and suppress.<br><br>The ad hoc rioters as described in the this threat are harder to monitor and suppress as they are not from organised societies. Their "one off" activites are as destructive as ss. Being less organised and of lower gangster capability, they tend not to focus their attacks on each other but rather at non ss members.</div>
