            <div class='col-md body'>oldbreadstinks &gt;&gt; Physically weaker? Some women are stronger than most of the guys here, its just that most women dont train physically (not that they should). Combat wise, modern day war is not really fought using bare hands or muscles, ie we use guns.<br><br>Fair enough, I understand there must be people guiding the elderly and kids to shelters, but do you need 1 for 1 guiding? Do you need a person to 'distribute' food/water/necessities to every ONE other, 1 to 1? Big waste of resources here.<br><br>I am not saying that girls should be added to any specific vocation, i.e. combat. There are many other such as medic and logistics (incl controller, communications, store, arms store, cook, drivers, technicians etc) which they will prove to be of great help. Even when guys enrol in NS, not all are combat vocations! Preferably, assigning them to their relevant skills (aka related to their jobs/edu backgrd) will be ideal. Remember that we already have a shortage of nurses even during peace times, what will happen during war?! Also, training medics can prove to be very useful during times of crisis, not only during wartime, an example is natural disaster, terrorists attacks, etc.<br><br>No matter what role we play during wartime, I repeat: WHERES THE TRAINING? Getting prepared is very important! Who knows what to do or where to go during wartime? Dont think that we can still switch on the TV or listen to radio for guides, coz one of the first few priority targets during war is to shut down communications. No more TV or radio for you.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
