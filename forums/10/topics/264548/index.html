Rather, this problem is a plague that's endemic of all rogue regimes run by despots and tyrants.<br><br>Think about it : how many dictatorships have actually afforded its masses the fundamental rights to the freedom of thought, freedom of expression, freedom from want? Essentially, such values form the cornerstones upon which any democracy (regardless of how their Constitutions and governments are structured) flourish. It's hardly rocket science to work out if such values were preached in dictatorships and other oppressed regimes, the very act of exercising such rights are effectively a direct threat to the interests and existence of those perpetuating such rogue regimes. The "symptoms" you describe that are endemic of life in such oppressed regimes are merely the tools and stigma which the despots would so dearly love to inculcate in its citizenry so as to ensure social cohesion and harmony could be effortlessly maintained. After all, in sociological terms, how else could such tyrants possibly castigate deviants who are out to reveal the truth?<br><br>Ultimately, it's not hard to see the repercussions of such policies in these rogue regimes have a detrimental impact on its citizenry far beyond political ramifications - is it then any wonder why citizens schooled in a liberal democracy where rights and freedoms are no less cherished than "law and order" or "bread and butter" actually develop a better acumen towards managing their finances, possessing a certain depth in thought quintessential to success in life (among a host of other qualities)?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
