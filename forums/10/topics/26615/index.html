            <div class='col-md body'>you would be assuming of course, that the TNI is working outside the jurisdiction of the indo gov't... wouldn't surprise me if they were cos their vast commercial interests would enable them to pretty much fund themselves outside of the defence budget.<br><br>but even if your suspicion id accurate, it would seem unlikely that the entire TNI was working hand-in-glove to pull this off... from the way it seems, its likely that a faction was interested in pulling something like this off and was working towards it without the knowledge of the rest of the TNI or the gov't. why? because the TNI is hardly a homogeneous institution many perceive them to be... many different power bases and nobody really knows how deeply involved they are in the economy. a lot of it may be black money and that further complicates things.<br><br>some groups would be more interested in maintaining the status quo and some would prefer to change it to further their interests.<br><br>they would present the crisis as an opportunity when the time was ripe or take the relevant actions and present the results as a fait accompli...<br><br>pretty much like the manchurian crisis, only javanese in conception instead of japanese...<br><br>hence, i don't think there is a centralised indo. conspiracy against the region... only one spearheaded by a certain group/faction if there ever was one.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>CX<br><br>TNI probably not as homogeneous as people think. I agree with you that some rogue or maybe blacker than black outfit has a line to these Islamic terrorists like the JI or KMM.  After all, the Ruskies supported the commie/leftie terrorists in the West during the Cold War. Maybe it is the same outfit that armed the E Timor irregulars when UN was taking over the place?<br><br>On hanging the JI terrorists, but their JI PR branch will make them martyrs? Best we lock them up low key trial and make them unseen unheard and forgotten.</div>
