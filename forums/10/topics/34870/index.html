            <div class='col-md body'>It is too simplistic counter propaganda to say that the USA is attacking Iraq so as to take possession of Iraqi OIL.<br><br>The USA still has a large reserve of oil in their own country, and with their financial power, has been purchasing oil from around the Middle-east instead of using up their own natural reserves.<br><br>Both Sadam of Iraq and Kim of North Korea are unstable characters with money, power, and WMD in their possession.<br><br>The history of Sadam has shown himself to be ruthless and war mongering. He initiated a ten-year war against neighboring Iran that killed and maimed almost a million men. He used the internationally banned mustard gas against troops and indiscriminately fired long range missiles into Iranian cities. He even killed his own citizens of Kurdish ethnicity, by using gas that wiped out whole townships and villages that killed men, women and children of all ages. He invaded and plundered Kuwait. He is ruthless to the extent of allowing poorly equipped iraqi soldiers to face an international coalition of forces to liberate Kuwait, only to have a large number of the Iraqi foot soldiers killed.<br><br>The history of Kim is little different. He was the head of the Korean Spy Agency during his fatherÂ’s presidency, and was known to have kidnapped Korean actresses whom he admire, as well as kidnapping Japanese tourists traveling overseas Â– so as to bring them back to North Korea to teach the Â‘Japanese WaysÂ’ to North Korean recruits of the North Korean Spy Agency. During his tenure as the Head of the North Korean Spy Agency, he authorized a mission into Myanmar that killed at least six South Korean Ministers and injuring more then a dozen Korean and Myanmar officials.<br><br>Both Sadam and Kim have provided financial, material and moral support to terrorists with dubious titles of being Â“Freedom FightersÂ”.<br><br>This is the kind of lunatics that are developing and controlling Weapons of Mass Destruction.<br><br>After the 9-11 incident in New York, and the Bali bombing incident, most Governments are worried that similar fanatics will now gain access to WMD, which can be smuggled into a country in an innocent form acceptable in the daily lives of human activities.<br><br>A Twenty-Foot Container can easily slip into busy Singapore Port (or even Hong Kong, Yokohama, San Francisco, or London), and while waiting for clearance, a nuclear device inside this Twenty Foot Container can be set off with a telephone call from abroad.<br><br>A holocaust of unimaginable magnitude will be the final consequence of our own lack of understanding to the terrorist threat that we are exposed to.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I do not agree that Saddam should be taken out of power from Iraq.  He seems to be have the support of the majority of Iraqis, either that or at least, the control of many Iraqis.  If he were to be taken out of power, it would cause severe fighting inside Iraq for the political leadership of Iraq.<br><br>However, I agree that Iraqs nuclear, biological and chemical warfare capabilities should be neutralised.  The difference between Iraq and other countries with nuclear weapons (except North Korea) is in the making of the decision as to whether or not to launch nukes.  While in Iraq, this decision lies in the hands of only Saddam, which makes it very dangerous as the critical decision lies to the whims and fancies of Saddam while in other countries, such as the US, there are checks and counter-checks before a nuke can be launched.<br><br>my two cents</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by laser51088:</div><div class="quote_body">I do not agree that Saddam should be taken out of power from Iraq.  He seems to be have the support of the majority of Iraqis, either that or at least, the control of many Iraqis.  If he were to be taken out of power, it would cause severe fighting inside Iraq for the political leadership of Iraq.<br><br>However, I agree that Iraqs nuclear, biological and chemical warfare capabilities should be neutralised.  The difference between Iraq and other countries with nuclear weapons (except North Korea) is in the making of the decision as to whether or not to launch nukes.  While in Iraq, this decision lies in the hands of only Saddam, which makes it very dangerous as the critical decision lies to the whims and fancies of Saddam while in other countries, such as the US, there are checks and counter-checks before a nuke can be launched.<br><br>my two cents</div></blockquote>Did you see the "mass support" for the Talebans, when USA was preparing for war to hunt Osama in Afghanistan?<br><br>There was daily organised "mass demonstration" in Kabul and other Afghan cities villifyin USA for preparing to invade Afghanistan.<br><br>Yet, when the Talebans were chased out of Afghanistan, all the common Afghani folks filled the streets, dancing and singing, and welcoming the US Armed Forces as they entered each city.<br><br>All the forbiden activities were purposely done in the open - children were doing the forbidden activity of flying kites, playing football, the men were playing music on record and CD players, the women came out to operate the bakeries, attending to the wounded in hospitals filled by both men and women.<br><br>Do you seriously believe what you see on TV, all those camera shots on one or two individual screaming support for Saddam, while others in the background grimly hold placards shouting slogans against USA ?<br><br>The Iraqi Baath Party is a Political Party from the ethnic Community from which Sadam comes from, and this ethnic group dominate the political scene in Iraq over all the other ethnic groups.<br><br>This kind of politics spells trouble for any country.<br><br>Sadam's hold on power is dependent on his Security Service, Hardline Supporters that think and behave like him, and a Special Military Group that protects him and the Baath Party.<br><br></div>
