            <div class='col-md body'>I did not see any write up on the visit by washington post only one article appear in the web site.  So LHL is the make over consultant for George.<br><br>Singapore Pushes U.S. on Mideast Peace<br>By JENNIFER LOVEN<br>The Associated Press<br>Friday, May 4, 2007; 4:50 PM<br>WASHINGTON -- Singapore's prime minister told President Bush Friday that "it's critical" to both America's global image and the anti-terror fight in Asia that Washington push hard to bring about peace between Israelis and Palestinians.<br>"It affects America's standing in Asia and the world, and also the security environment in Asia," said Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, "because extremists, the jihadists, watch carefully what's happening in the Middle East and take heart, or lose heart, depending on what's happening." Bush and Lee spoke to reporters at the conclusion of their meeting in the Oval Office.<br>Wealthy, tightly controlled Singapore is one of Washington's closest friends in Southeast Asia. It has a significant, moderate Muslim minority and is a stalwart supporter of U.S. anti-terrorism efforts. Lee often has advised Bush on how to improve America's image in the Muslim world.<br>In November, Bush spent a day in Singapore on his way to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Vietnam. The president he will do so again this year, stopping in Singapore on the way to the APEC meetings being held in Australia in September. This time, the purpose of Bush's visit will be to take part in meetings of the 10-nation Association of Southeast Asian Nations.<br>"I talked to Prime Minister Lee about America's desire to stay in close contact with not only Singapore, but our partners" in the region, Bush said. "He's got a very clear vision about the issues, the complications, and the opportunities."<br>Lee praised "the steadfastness and resolve" with which Bush is tackling the situation in Iraq and the Mideast. But the compliment did not mask the gentle message that he believes more should be done.<br>"It's critical for us in Southeast Asia that America does that," Lee said.<br>The economic relationship between the United States and Singapore has seen a jump to $42.5 billion in total two-way trade since a 2004 free trade agreement _ a 34 percent increase. Despite Singapore being a small city-state, it was America's ninth largest export market last year.<br>Lee has called for the United States to also forge stronger economic ties with other Southeast Asian nations.<br><br></div>

Unfortunately, either Daddy is underestimating the Yanks, or he's a poor imitator of Daddy or both. Quite frankly, making such political statements in the current climate in Washington is political suicide. Fortunately, the US press doesn't pay much attention to Singapore so we won't have demonstrators in front of our embassy.</div>

This regime comprises largely of idiots who do not fully understand the political dynamics of the US.<br><br>Their track record speaks volumes - just about everything adopted here would be a reflection of what a Republican administration entails (the pro-business culture, among others) in a democratic system. The thought of Congress signing some nonsense like a FTA between the US and this regime in a Democrat-controlled Legislature is simply beyond imagination.<br><br>It's no coincidence the Carter and Clinton administrations hardly cared a hoot about what this regime gets up to - it just simply isn't worth their time. Should a Democrat take the White House in 2009, just see how history repeats itself...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>reported in  Arab Times - Kuwait<br><br>----------------------------<br><br>Singapore backs Bush on Iraq: PM Lee<br>SINGAPORE, May 6, 2007 (AFP) - US President George W. Bush is right to stay the course in Iraq, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong of <strong>staunch ally</strong> Singapore said in remarks published Sunday. Lee, who met Bush Friday during a trip to Washington, also voiced support for the US leader's veto of a bill by the Democrat-controlled House laying out a timeline for withdrawing US troops from Iraq.<br><br>The bill linked the allocation of emergency funding for US troops in Iraq to a plan for US combat troops to start coming home by October 1, and for most of them to be withdrawn by March 2008.<br><br>Lee was quoted as saying in the Sunday Times that he had told Bush "what he's doing is right."<br><br>"That in Iraq, America has to take a firm position and if it leaves with its tail between its legs, it is going to be very damaging for America, very damaging for all of its friends... particularly in Southeast Asia, that we will all be greatly alarmed because our security will be greatly affected."<br><br><strong>Singapore has sent military deployments to help US troops in Iraq, and Lee said strong US leadership was critical for Southeast Asia.</strong><br>"It's critical for us in Southeast Asia that America does that," Lee said.<br><br>"I thanked the president for the steadfastness and resolve with which he's tackling the very complicated problems in the Middle East and Iraq, as well as the Israel-Palestinian issue.<br><br>"And the president continues to give strong leadership on that because it affects America's standing in Asia and the world, and also the security environment in Asia because extremists, the jihadists, watch carefully what's happening in the Middle East and take heart, or lose heart, depending on what's happening."<br></div>
