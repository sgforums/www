            <div class='col-md body'>In a matter of life and death yes they might save lives first . But in non-emergency cases I believe money plays the main role. Moreover, if some hopitals charge cheaper than others for the same operation that means the more expensive hopitals are over charging and thereby making healthcare expensive in Singapore.</div>

Which was the original question for this topic.<br><br>Finally, zenden is right. Whenever the issue of costs in Singapore comes up, the government and it's supporters always come up with the same arguments and sidetracking from the issue of cost, by trying to paint the issue as one of Singaporeans asking for freebies. We're not asking for freebies, we're just asking for prices to be reduced because it doesn't take a fool to figure out that if private hospitals charge more or less the same as government hospitals, and if private hospital charges = profits, then government hospital charges + subsidies = obscene profits.<br><br>At Singaporeans' expense.

But the fact is that, I was not making assumptions. Fact was, when the MOH first published its price guide last year, it was revealed not only was there a wide gulf in the prices different restructured hospitals charged for similar procedures, some procedures are private hospital charges actually cost less. I cannot argue about the stats you put up, since they relate to ward charges, but the point I was making was for medical procedures.<br><br>The news made the headlines for a while, then disappeared off the altogether.<br><br>I saw my info from the MoH website then. <a href="http://www.moh.gov.sg/sta/sta02050101.htm" rel="nofollow">Price comparison by procedure/operation.</a> I don't know why the comparison for a lot of procedures have since been removed, as well as the comparison with private hospitals.</div>

I mean the statistic seems to be the total bil for the stay in the hospital.

            <div class='col-md body'>Ahhh... that had to depend on how you interprete it... My understanding is this is the average bill for people that visit any specialists. The only problem with this data is it has not been classified according to different specialist cost. For example people going to hospital for heart operations is going to pay more than people going for minor surgeries. They didn't seperate the data into these different areas but jumbled up together as one.</div>

Which was the original question for this topic.<br><br>Finally, zenden is right. Whenever the issue of costs in Singapore comes up, the government and it's supporters always come up with the same arguments and sidetracking from the issue of cost, by trying to paint the issue as one of Singaporeans asking for freebies. We're not asking for freebies, we're just asking for prices to be reduced because it doesn't take a fool to figure out that if private hospitals charge more or less the same as government hospitals, and if private hospital charges = profits, then government hospital charges + subsidies = obscene profits.<br><br>At Singaporeans' expense. Medisave or not</div></blockquote>Let's keep things in perspective here.<br><br>My medisave portion was in response to a post by 'reyes'.<br><br>As for the question of hospital charges, yes i'd say they are relatively expensive. But remember they have not increased, simply become relatively less affordable because of bad times and ppl have to dig deep to pay their expenses.<br><br>Which is precisely why most govt hospitals have agreed to lower their fees. However i disagree with your statement 'public hospitals take government subsidies yet have the cheek to charge Singaporeans more or less the same prices as UNSUBSIDIZED private hospitals'. That to me is unsubstantiated. I hope you're not comparing professional fees of specialists to those of mere doctors. because that is really taking taking a 'watermelon' and comparing it to a 'lemon'.<br><br>How on earth can places like SGH and Tan Tock Seng charge similar fees to private hospitals like Mt E and Mt A? No offense but have you even been for treatment to any of these places?<br><br>I have. And i'm fully aware that the cost diference between these two types of hospitals are vastly significant, not in the hundreds, but enough for them to distinguish the apparent gap in class .<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Guys before you flame Singapore's healthcare, think about worse systems throughout the world that are even more expensive, yes even in places like USA or UK.<br><br>UK's national health scandal sucks, government hospital waiting lists are MONTHS and MONTHS long, with people with serious diseases waiting longer than those with minor ailments. THat sucks, even though healthcare is cheap. BEfore you complain SG's healthcare is too expensive, think about the good service it offers.<br><br>Singapore's healthcare docs are definitely more qualified and certified than SEA's region. Why else then do we have more foreign patients in SG than any other SEAN country? I have seen healthcare in Indonesia and India, and i can tell you its expensive and lousy, with long waiting lists and doctors that contradict each other.<br><br>Be happy for Singapore's healthcare/</div>
