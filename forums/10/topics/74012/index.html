            <div class='col-md body'>i think its damn expensive and govt is out to cheat our $$$. my friend's uncle when to general hospital, stay for 1 week, bill is $6000. not because of any big operation or treatment, but because got some so called specialist one day come and see him many times, each time ask some stupid questions then charge $100. the specialist are NUS doc trainees lah, even their skills are doubtful. then the uncle wanna transfer to other therapy centre, the hospital say they will settle, then let the uncle stay for a more days, then realise the hospital did not do anything at all. so the bills are piling and my friend wanna bring her uncle out the doc even scold my friend saying my friend did not give her uncle a chance to recover. but keeping the unlce in hospital forever, with the hospital doing nothing and the bills kept piling, its obviously cheating our $$$$ !!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ShutterBug, i do not know for certain if you are right when you mentioned that "---recent sad case of one mother who jumped with her two young children.---" is solely due to the high cost of medical expenses  in Singapore? But, what I do know is that the medical expenses are extremely high due when compared with countries like Thailand and Malaysia and the reason why many Singaporeans are heading to those countries for treatment.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Before we rubbish our medical expenses as exhorbitant, let us take a a peek at how other nations administer their medical practices.<br><br>For example, in France, the taxes are extremely high at ard 45% in terms of overall income compared to ours. However for the french, that takes care of most education bills and all medical check-ups, including specialists treatment (yes they dun pay a cent). This practice is such that some among the french abuse it to an extent that has caused growing concern within the french parliment, with calls from the leftist conservatives to review the current situation with a suggestion to increase taxes to cover the added burden brought on by these irresponsible 'malingerers'.<br><br>Over here, our gahmen introduced medisave to help our pre-dominantly aging population cope with future medical expenses. By creating a special account under the CPF scheme, they hoped that a portion of our monthly CPF would be sufficient to allow partial or full payment of any hospital treatments incurred. Obviously, this cannot cover the full cost of major operations such as chemotherapy or magnetic resonance scans needed for cancer treatment, if partially at all.<br><br>The consideration here might be to moderately increase the percentage contribution in our CPF special accounts, with an view at increasing the distribution in our medisave. The bad news is, only those who work and earn a monthly income are entitled to this benefit and that cuts off the jobless community completely.<br><br>Our medical bills here, while comparatively expensive in our eyes, are relatively cheaper compared to other established countries like germany and US. This coupled with our graft-free reputation and our competent hospital practices makes Singapore a medical destination for many ppl in the region seeking professional advice and treatment. One major reason why the iranian conjoined twins came here for their op was due to the relatively low cost of the operation. Since then, many others have visited our shores for medical assistance.<br><br>If that is not enough, then we should also consider the fact that hospitals have reduced the prices of various outpatient treatments and consultations last year to aid Singaporeans with the rising cost of living standards.<br><br>If we were to adopt a method similar to the french, will our ppl agree to the huge increase in income taxes that will curtail it? Will our ppl use the previlage that comes with this practice honestly and not try to abuse it as some within the french population have?<br><br>Let's face it, no system is full-proof. No method can cater to all the needs of a nation. Some will undoubtedly be left in the cold. At the moment, medisave is as good as it gets.</div>

At the same time, elsewhere in the world, products of the same or even better quality are being offered at far lower prices than in Singapore.<br><br>Yet, many here still cling on to the "we are better" stance, implying that others can't match our overall package because they fall short in quality or flexibility, and hence we can maintain our higher costs.<br><br>That surely is a wrong attitude to take.<br><br>PSA Corporation (formerly the Port of Singapore Authority) learnt at great cost and some embarrassment the fallacy behind that approach.<br><br>Its inability or failure to agree to the demands of the AP Moller Group, parent of Maersk Sealand and the world's largest operator of container ships, resulted in the Copenhagen-headquartered company not only moving most of its operations to the Port of Tanjung Pelepas in Johor but also taking a stake in the port.<br><br>With the help of Maersk's expertise, Pelepas is now aggressively competing with Singapore and was also able to lure Evergreen, then the second biggest user of PSA's facilities, to follow it to Johor.<br><br>The port stake offered by Pelepas may have weighed heavily in the Maersk decision but observers say that Pelepas, also held out the promise of lower fees.<br><br>Talk is that Maersk is still doing a lot of business at PSA wharves, but the initial shift to Pelepas should have been a signal to other Singaporean companies and industries.<br><br>Alas, anecdotal evidence indicates that the PSA lesson seems to have been lost on our medical and health-care sector, once the region's undisputed leader.<br><br>For example, when a reporter from this paper recently talked to our eye specialists about the disturbing trend of Singaporeans going abroad to seek cheaper cosmetic surgery in places like Bangkok and Kuala Lumpur, the replies emphasised the quality here rather than price.<br><br>The Singapore National Eye Centre told Streats: "The centre/surgeon'strack record, experience, quality control and accreditation need to be considered."<br><br>AsiaMedic chairman and ophthalmologist Low Cze Hong said: "Be aware of risks in places where hygiene and sanitary standards are not what we expect in Singapore.

For open heart surgery, it costs 64% more in Singapore than in Thailand and 82% more than Malaysia. The figures for cataracts are even more shocking. Use the figures in the article, take a calculator and do the math. Pay premium prices for quality? Sure! The problem is, the premium is TOO HIGH! Is the standard here 64% better than Thailand and 82% better than Malaysia? I don't think so.<br><br>We have to realise, the days of customers having the pay a premium for Singapore are over. That premium has gotten too high, and standards have climbed sufficiently in our rivals, to make it more worthwhile for the customers to go to our rivals.<br><br>And anyway, lets not compare Singapore with the region. What about the anomalies in prices between private and government hospitals here then? Isn't it ridiculous that prices for medical procedures are more expensive in the supposedly "subsidized" government hospitals than private ones? By right, government health care costs should not even match private health care costs, never mind exceeding it like the situation here.<br><br>Those who think health care here is affordable for all seriously need to wake up and smell the roses. And cut back on reading propaganda drivel.</div>
