            <div class='col-md body'>Except for those who are in this forum, it seems like most Singaporeans are just very satisfied with status quo.  It appears to be easy for us to be blinded by the following things;<br><br>1) The rulling party is good and gives us refund, monetary rewards, upgrades comes around election time.<br><br>2) Singapore is safe, I have a job, my kids are doing find in school, therefore the people in charge must be very honest and doing things in our interest.<br><br>3) Compared to most countries in S.E.A, we are the best and the cleanest!<br><br>4) The tight censorship is good for controling the media and preventing unrest.<br><br>5) I don't need to really care which party is ruling, as long as I have a decent living, money to live by, and good food to eat.<br><br>6) The education here is solid; everything is well-planned.  If I get a certain grade, then I can advance to my choice of streams, if not I will be filtered to less desirable streams.  This is very fair.<br><br>7) Foreign talent is good for the country's growth.  Let them keep coming!<br><br>From what I listed above, don't you think it is easy for most people to be indifferent with politics?  Isn't it easy for people to be complacent?  How can we effect positiove change in a society?  With the current status no wonder it is hard for Singaporean to stimulate creativity and entrepreneurship!<br><br>Here's my impression of Singaporeans' mental roadmap;<br><br>Singaporeans born in the 60's are fearful of government persecution if they voice a different opinion.<br><br>Singaporeans born in the 70's just do what the system is setup for them to do, follow the crowd.<br><br>Singaporeans born in the 80's try their best to fit into the system but seems to have a feeling something should change.  But cannot put a finger to what it is.<br><br>Singaporeans born in the 90's feel the pressure of the system and expectations from previous generations.  They keep thinking is there more to the life I am living now?<br><br>Singaporeans born in the 21st century will exhibit the ill-effects of the old system, then maybe real change will occur.<br><br></div>
