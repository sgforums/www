              <p>I had a meet-the-mp session with MP Seng Han Thong. That was in 2005. During the meeting, I conveyed my displeasure of the constant estate upgrading program in Singapore (and of course in my neighborhood). Cement was dug up and replaced for no apparent reason. He was not empathetic. I was the minority whose voice was drowned by the majority who voted 'yes' to the upgrading. He advised me to move out of my HDB apartment if I was not happy with the upgrading. If not, I'll definitely love the place after the upgrading. He said he was sure I'd love the upgraded estate.</p>
              <p> I was absolutely pissed. And so I was not at all surprised when he was slapped by the cabby in 2006. This incident (with the kerosene) was committed by a so-called mentally unstable person. However, I do understand how that might have happened given the way the MP 'talks down' to his people with this 'I know what's best for you' attitude.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Granted, he's a very hard-working MP. I do think he embraces and personifies  how this government works, which is often ' do as you're told, we know what's best for you' .</p>

              <p>Perhaps PAP needs to rethink it's strategy in a changing environment, maybe provide lessons in "soft skills" for it's so called leaders and supporters. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>I think he needs to learn about good customer's services first. He must know who he serves, who support him and who voted him. He maybe a hardworking MP, but not smart enough and also no good in replying others, just telling people off in a dialogue session is better than no dialogue, be sincere and take in everything as feedback, consider and slowly reply back later, he should ensure that every feedback is important, but not to tell people off. Otherwise people can get burnt in stockmarket or investment, he get burnt in politics.</p>
