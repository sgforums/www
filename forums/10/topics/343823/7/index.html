              <p>I think judging by the sentiments here, we can find a handful of potential MP Flame throwers here. But I guess what is preventing all of you from committing the same act that the man has apparently committed is that we know fear, fear and reverence to the rule of law. Furthermore, we have the ability decipher between right and wrong. That although many of you have an axe to grind with the ruling elite, you have the mental capacity to know that your displeasure doesn't give you the right to set a man of fire to assuage your disdain.  </p>
              <p>However, the said man, whom we see bound in cuffs do not possess those abilities that all of you share. He prob has little control of his temperament, which has resulted in him committing the very act, motivated by grieveances he holds. As such, I find the whole narrative of justifying his actions because he possesses a certain grieviance as a poor argument.</p>
              <p>However, I also take issue with how the man is being handled. It is like the chinese saying 'To kill the chicken for the monkeys to watch'. Yes, we governed ourselves by the rule of law, but the rule of law although unyielding and all encompassing does not prevent the exercise of compassion. Given his mental state, he should be treated with dignity and compassion, and not dragged around like some first rate criminal which he isn't! </p>

              <p><br>Your words in red :  ruling party exercises that selectively.   Especially in the case of any hurt, harm to the PAP members, court cum ruling party will not give any chance to exercise their right to the maximum.    If you ever hear how the evil old cunning fox lky spoke about demanding the public to respect his PAP members you will know that lky allows no nonsense from public to harm his pap members.   Good eg is the Durai's case.   Despite the fact that he committed such grave crime, he was allowed to travel overseas.  This is nothing but purely double standard and unfairness practise by the ruling party.</p>

              <p>I think judging by the sentiments here, we can find a handful of potential MP Flame throwers here. But I guess what is preventing all of you from committing the same act that the man has apparently committed is that we know fear, fear and reverence to the rule of law. Furthermore, we have the ability decipher between right and wrong. That although many of you have an axe to grind with the ruling elite, you have the mental capacity to know that your displeasure doesn't give you the right to set a man of fire to assuage your disdain.  </p>
              <p>However, the said man, whom we see bound in cuffs do not possess those abilities that all of you share. He prob has little control of his temperament, which has resulted in him committing the very act, motivated by grieveances he holds. As such, I find the whole narrative of justifying his actions because he possesses a certain grieviance as a poor argument.</p>
              <p>However, I also take issue with how the man is being handled. It is like the chinese saying 'To kill the chicken for the monkeys to watch'. Yes, we governed ourselves by the rule of law, but the rule of law although unyielding and all encompassing does not prevent the exercise of compassion. Given his mental state, he should be treated with dignity and compassion, and not dragged around like some first rate criminal which he isn't! </p>

              <p>The fact of the matter is that he has greviously attacked someone.</p>
              <p>Whether he should be treated with dignity and compassion is up for the judge to decide. For the police that is escorting him, it was a reasonable precaution to make sure he could not hurt another person. If his condition relapsed and attacked a police officer or worse, hurt himself who would bear the responsibility?</p>
              <p>Any police officer in any country would do the same thing, stop dragging politics into the issue.</p>
