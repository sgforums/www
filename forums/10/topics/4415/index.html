            <div class='col-md body'>I thought the deep Asian currency crisis in 1998 has taught the HOW LIAN Singaporeans a pretty good lesson, but now a new breed of HOW LIANs have emerged. Down to earth Singaporeans, young or old, may not be able to survive without 3 meals. But those HOW LIANs may not be able to survive without showing off a chain of credit cards and new generation of handphones.<br><br>Those hardcores or diehards might have found life too boring in Singapore. They found it exciting to accumulating a chain of first-2-year free credit cards, and flashing it in front those long queue of NTUC customers, while paying even $5 of grocery! This trend has diminished over the past years.<br><br>Now it seems a new trend has appeared, comparing new generation of handphones in the office, SMS their way into the drain, must show that they have handphones when they are on the road, or in the train or bus,eventhough they could not afford or are trying to delay paying their monthly subscription, or are they hoping for a free service?<br><br>It was a worrying trend when young graduates aiming for all the Cs when they just graduated. Comparing their addresses when they are in the office, comparing the car when driving on the road and now some have to surrender some if not all of their dreams when they are out of job!<br><br>Are the schools doing enough to rig them of these materialism when they are young? Why they want to get themselves bog down to such burden even they hardly can afford them?<br><br>The entrepreuner skills of most Singaporeans have suffered tremendously partly due to their  distorted<br>life style. Most trying hard to cosmetically touch up their living standard and lifestyle and enjoy life first before they put their entrepreneurial skill into work.<br><br>Are we going to be dominated by the so call down to earth foreign talents?Are Singaporeans going to drown themselves in buiding those castle in the air, dreaming of those 5Cs and just be happy with it? Or just showing off their only earthly belonging-a  new generation of handphone, even at this precarious economic situation?</div>
