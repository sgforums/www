            <div class='col-md body'>I believe it is not just DBS card, cause I would think that all other credit card offered by local banks is the same. If you want to have a reliable card, I would suggest that you try citibank. IMHO I think they are the best in Singapore.<br><br>Here are some of my experience :-<br>a) Credit limit increase<br>Citibank can arrange this within 15 min without having to give them cork and bull stories.<br><br>Local banks - Need at least 24 hours, and if you dont have a valid reason, they might not even do it for you.<br><br>b) Annual Fee<br>Citibank will waive it if you call them. Maybe they will tell you to use your card at least 3 times within the next 3 to 4 weeks.<br><br>Local banks will deduct the annual fee from your credit card $points without your permission, or they insist that you pay.<br><br>c) Call centre<br>Local banks phone banking services is slow and ineffective. Long waiting time to reach a phone operator, and personel at call centre doesnt seem to be able to make any decision.<br><br>Never have the same problem with Citibank.<br><br>d) Website<br>Citibank website is one of the best when it come to navigating and making online transaction between all your credit line, credit card and banking account.<br></div>

Citibank is at the VERY bottom of my list. I dunno why people keep saying their service is good. For me, it Sucks real bad, and I've experienced it more than once. My sister's boss got fed up of the bank too (oh yes, they managed to piss off a REAL BIG customer  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> ).<br><br>BTW, many other banks offer waiver of annual fees when i call them up to cancel. DBS, OCBC, BOC, etc etc. And I recommend BOC for its best rates for currency conversion <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> </div></blockquote>Just wan to share my experience with CitiBank visa.....<br><br>Once i lost my wallet in HongKong and after calling UOB, HKSH, OCBC &amp;  Citibank......only citibank allows me to go to the Bank and cash out money using my passport for identification.....<br><br>U shld u'stand that when u r alone in a foreign country....no money....and upset abt the loss....the one who offers to help is the greatest relief u feel indebted to....<br><br>I am only saying that in terms of overseas problem...Citibank truly can help but in Singapore...i dun think citibank offers the best value for the card holder....<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>
