              <p>Very safe is not confirmed safe. At tat time, it really is very safe.</p>
              <p>As someone mentioned before, if high yield invesment gives zero risk, then is it fair for people who invest safely ?</p>

              <p>bonds are ultimately still a type of investment, and may carry elements of speculation if u know about bond trading, though the fluctuation is not as great as stocks</p>
              <p>given the investment and speculative nature of bonds, it will hard to claim back the $$ because under the law, the person would have voluntarily consented to the risk of the investment, unless there was fraud or misrepresentation involved.</p>
              <p>as for DBS, the compensation seems to be sympathetic, but I half suspect they did it because they probably think they had misled and misrepresented their financial products, so rather compensate first to save the embarrasment and costs of potential lawsuits against them.</p>

              <p>just my 2 cts worth.</p>
              <p>Why should any financial instituition or the ghamen pay for the lost investment?  No reason to demand the ghamen pay also wat. </p>
              <p>My rationale:  When pple chose to invest/gamble, they went in with EYES WIDE open.  Why I say that?  See $$$ eyes big big. </p>
              <p>So they win $$$ they said they claim themselves GOD of Gamblers or Investors or more humble ones said: wa lau eh... me very good judgement or very HENG.  And?  Money they made they keep quiet and spend themselves.</p>
              <p>When they LOST $$$ they claim: WTF?  How come like that?  Banks cheats us with their lies and backed by ghamen somemore.  NB lost already really BUAY KUM WAN.  So they all parrot the same thing: "We duno leh... Bank said very secure and safe so we take our FD and put in PINOCHIO notes and MINIBONDS and? Bingo.. All PINOCHIO NOTES AND MINIBONDS become HELL NOTES and JAMES BOND 007 kena shoot.</p>
              <p>Not that I not sympathize with losers, which in the matter of fact I really understand.  I used to lost alot during the 97/98 crisis.  I lost aso diam diam. Cry no tears also bo pian.  I WENT IN WITH MY EYES WIDE OPEN KNOWING THAT ALL INVESTMENT CAME WITH RISK. </p>
              <p>So all my good fellow countrymen out there.  Pls understand the plights you are in now.  No use crying foul.  Dun kena lost money KPKB blame ghamen blame bank and expect to recover.</p>
              <p>If the ghamen sympathize and really pay you then this is a really screw up situation which show unfairness to fellow citizens.  Dun expect ghamen to use our fellow citizens hard earned money and compensate your lost due to your greed.  Do you in the first place share the winnings with the rest of the country anot? If not why ask fellow citizens to pay for you when you lost?  Load of Crap.</p>
              <p>Pls dun flame me.  As I say my 2 cts worth.</p>
