              <h1>Tan Kin Lian asks: Is it fair? Investors answer: NO!</h1>
              <p><strong>Written by Ng E-Jay<br> 16 November 2008</strong></p>
              <p>The fifth rally organized by Mr Tan Kin Lian for investors of
              Lehman-linked structured products and other credit linked notes that
              have fallen drastically in value drew a record crowd on Sat, 15 Nov,
              with investors vociferously expressing their anger and dissatisfaction
              at MAS and the financial institutions for pussyfooting and failing to
              provide prompt and fair redress for their heavy losses.</p>
              <p>Mr Tan Kin Lian began his speech by drawing attention to a new group
              of investors — people who have invested in the Pinnacle Notes series
              created by Morgan Stanley. Many of these credit linked notes, which
              typically run for a term of around 5 years, have had their value nearly
              obliterated even though they are not linked to the failed US bank
              Lehman Brothers.</p>
              <p>For example, Pinnacle Notes 1 has only 1.8% of its original value
              left; Pinnacle Notes 2 has only 3.8%; Pinnacle Notes 8 has around 69%,
              and Pinnacle Notes 12 has around 80% of its value remaining as of last
              week.</p>
              <p>More seriously, Pinnacle Notes 9 and 10 have had their value
              completely wiped out because at least 5 of the underlying 100 financial
              assets have gone into default.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Why are the Pinnacle Notes affected even though they are not linked to Lehman Brothers?</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.sgpolitics.net/picsarchive05/tkl02.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p>The answer is that the Pinnacle Notes are very similar in structure
              to the other structured products like the Lehman Minibonds and the DBS
              High Notes. Each of the Pinnacle Notes have several reference entities.
              If one of the reference entities goes bankrupt, the entire Note will go
              into default. In addition, each Pinnacle Note also invests in the
              credit instruments of around 100 underlying financial entities. If a
              certain number, say 5 to 10, of these underlying financial assets goes
              bust, the entire Note will also be obliterated. The latter event is
              precisely what happened to Pinnacle Notes 9 and 10.</p>
              <p>Another question arises: What if there is a new swap counterparty
              for Lehman Brothers? Will investors be able to recoup their full
              principal sum at the maturity of the Lehman Minibonds?</p>
              <p>Mr Tan Kin Lian’s reply was that he was not sure, as the value of
              the Minibonds will also depend on the performance of the underlying
              financial assets. If the underlying assets go into default, the
              Minibonds will be similarly affected even if all the other reference
              entities are still around.</p>
              <p>Mr Tan recapitulated that he had already sent 3 petitions to MAS.</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.sgpolitics.net/picsarchive05/tkl03.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p>The first petition, dated 9 Oct and signed by 983 people, asked MAS
              to carry out an independent investigation into whether the financial
              institutions had breached the Securities and Futures Act or the
              Financial Advisers Act. Mr Tan had also sent a personal letter urging
              the Government to take action in the form of bringing the errant
              financial institutions to Court or negotiating with them to compensate
              investors duly, if indeed the law had been broken.</p>
              <p>However after one month, there had been no concrete action from MAS,
              which had refused to meet or discuss the matter with Mr Tan. MAS had
              only announced that they could not discuss the issue with individual
              investors, but gave no indication as to whether there would be a full
              fledged independent investigation.</p>
              <p>Mr Tan asked the crowd: “Is that fair?”</p>
              <p>To which the crowd replied loudly: “NO!”</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.sgpolitics.net/picsarchive05/tkl04.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p>The second petition, dated 17 Oct and signed by 277 people, asked
              MAS to check on how the financial institutions had trained relationship
              managers and sales representatives.</p>
              <p>The third petition, dated 31 Oct and signed by 1017 people, asked
              MAS to set up an independent unit for investors to lodge complaints, so
              that investors need not approach the financial institutions directly if
              they feel uncomfortable doing so. The petition also urged MAS to push
              for a collective settlement for all affected investors, rather than
              allowing the financial institutions to go on a case-by-case basis which
              would inevitably prejudice certain investors.</p>
              <p>Next, Mr Tan Kin Lian brought to attention the recent remarks made
              by MM Lee Kuan Yew. MM Lee had said that many educated and young
              investors went into the Lehman-linked structured products with “<strong>their eyes open</strong>“.
              He also said: “Higher returns means higher risks. So when somebody
              tells you, ‘you get 1.5 per cent at the bank, I give you 5 per cent’,
              read the small print carefully.” (ST Online, “Lehman investors ‘aware
              of risks’”, 11 Nov 2008)</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.sgpolitics.net/picsarchive05/tkl05.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p>A person using the initials S.B. had written to Mr Tan expressing
              his anger at MM Lee’s comments. The writer said that an annual return
              of 5% was not commensurate with the amount of risk that the investors
              were taking, and that investors had been lulled into assuming the
              products were all right because they were approved by the authorities
              for sale. The writer admitted that he should shoulder some
              responsibility for his investment decisions, but added that MM Lee’s
              words sounded as if the authorities were taking investors to task, and
              that the case was closed as far as the Minister Mentor was concerned. <strong>The
              writer said that this gave him the impression that the Government had
              already taken the side of the financial institutions even without any
              solid evidence, and that this was unacceptable action from a popularly
              elected Government.</strong></p>
              <p>Mr Tan Kin Lian went on to mention that in his recent meeting with
              some primary school teachers, the teachers were of the opinion that the
              Government had done a good job by making sure older investors were
              compensated. Mr Tan was quick to give these teachers a reality check.
              He told them that the so-called “vulnerable investors” who were given
              prompt and full compensation only constituted less than 5% of the total
              number of affected investors. The teachers were shocked when they
              learned this. <strong>They realized that they had been mislead by the media into thinking many people had already been duly compensated.</strong></p>
              <p>Finally, Mr Tan asked why these highly defective credit linked Notes
              were only sold in Singapore, Hong Kong and Taiwan, and not in places
              like the US, Malaysia, or Australia?</p>
              <p>The answer, sadly, was that if investment banks were to sell these
              defective products in places like America, they know they would be sued
              and forced to compensate investors the full principal amount, unlike
              places like Singapore where they have a chance of fooling investors and
              getting away with it. Places like Malaysia were also unlikely to
              approve these products for sale to retail investors or unsophisticated
              investors in the first place.</p>
              <p>Mr Tan ended by saying that he hoped MAS would follow the example of
              the Hong Kong Legislative Council in carrying out a full fledged
              investigation and summoning banks to provide the necessary information
              about the sales process and the details of the transactions. Errant
              bankers should also be sent to jail if and when found guilty.</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.sgpolitics.net/picsarchive05/tkl06.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p>Mr Goh Meng Seng then gave a Chinese rendition of Mr Tan’s speech, as well as his own views on the matter.</p>
              <p>He said: “This government only cares about the big corporations, what about its citizens?”</p>
              <p>Mr Goh quoted the example of Hong Kong, where Minibond investors
              could pressure the Legislative Council (Legco) into launching a full
              probe into the banks because the Legco was not dominated by a single
              party. Here in Singapore, with only 2 opposition MPs in Parliament, the
              ruling party could do as it wished with flagrant disregard for the will
              of the people.</p>
              <p>Mr Goh ended his speech by imploring the audience to “<strong>open their eyes</strong>” and “<strong>vote for the correct party</strong>” in the next election.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>About USD1 trillion dollar has been lost in structured CDO products around the world and the losses are mounting. Considering the world GDP to be 66 trillion and Singapore's GDP of about 140 billion. Assuming the CDO losses are distributed around the world, Singapore would assume 0.2% of these losses. This is probably around 2 billion. ( I would imagine the number to be smaller due to imperfect distribution of the CDO risk). There are many more CDO related funds out there that have been sold by insurers, i.e Great Eastern etc, that have lost 70-80% in the last one year. It is not viable to set a precedent to compensate these investors. Once we do, everybody would disregard due diligence to identify possible risks in purchasing these assets and expect to be "bailed out" when shit happens. Besides this situation happens only <strong>ONCE IN A HUNDRED YEARS.</strong></p>
              <p>Problem is people think that there is no risk in investing certain products. There are always risks even if you put your money in a DBS fixed deposit account or in government bonds. You are betting that the credit rating of DBS is strong, and that it won't go bust during the duration of your investment.</p>
              <p>There is no way, the banks or any government can refund the investors all the money.If they do, it's unfair to the other 95% of the population. The DBS High Notes/Pinnacle notes is just the tip of the iceberg.</p>
              <p>This is part and parcel of capitalism, the idea of a free market to make lots of money or lose lots of money. IF one doesn't like the idea of losing money in investing then stay out of the markets or embrace communism or ultra-socialism and vote out the PAP. Just be prepared to pay 40-50% income taxes, 20% capital gain taxes etc etc..</p>
              <p>I sympathise with the people that lost money in this investment, but compensating everybody who bought CDOs is just unfeasible. I hope the people protesting at Speaker's Corners understand this and do something more constructive with their free time.</p>

              <p>Investors bought their sales talk, thats what they bought. And thats what they have to pay. They never get burned before, so they dunno what is fire. <br>Now they know, they can prevent such incidents from happening in the future, its a learning experience, although abit costly.<br>Then you keep saying not fair for investors, then the banks fair ah?<br>Because of their sales rep they take the blame? You should find the sales person who sold you the products, not the bank.<br><br>Its like another sim lim square.</p>

              dunno what is fire.<br> Now they know, they can prevent such incidents from happening in
              the future, its a learning experience, although abit costly.<br> Then you keep saying not fair for investors, then the banks fair
              ah?<br> Because of their sales rep they take the blame? You should find the
              sales person who sold you the products, not the bank.<br> <br> Its like another sim lim square.</p>

              <p><br>My good lords, Bonds not consider investment...OMG!!, Uncle, u must be a Con sultant hor..anything that can make a lost or gain is an investment, i can also invest in property, buy a property, get the certicate of deed, then when time is good, sell to earn the profit, but if time is bad, sell at a lost or nothing. Bonds is not fixed deposit, if fluatate same as stocks and commodities, just that it has less risk, but still a risk. And you get dividends. </p>

              <p>According to Wikipedia, investment is a term with several
              closely-related meanings in business management, finance and economics,
              related to saving or deferring consumption. Wiki went on to say that
              investment is the choice by the individual to risk his savings with the
              hope of gain.<br><br>According to dictionary.com, investment is<br><br>1.  the investing of money or capital in order to gain profitable returns, as interest, income, or appreciation in value.<br>2.  a particular instance or mode of investing.<br>3.  a thing invested in, as a business, a quantity of shares of stock, etc.<br>4.  something that is invested; sum invested.<br>5.  the act or fact of investing or state of being invested, as with a garment.<br>6.
              a devoting, using, or giving of time, talent, emotional energy, etc.,
              as for a purpose or to achieve something: His investment in the project
              included more time than he cared to remember.<br>7.  Biology. any covering, coating, outer layer, or integument, as of an animal or vegetable.<br>8.  the act of investing with a quality, attribute, etc.<br>9.  investiture with an office, dignity, or right.<br>10.  a siege or blockade; the surrounding of a place with military forces or works, as in besieging.<br>11.  Also called investment compound. Metallurgy. a refractory material applied in a plastic state to a pattern to make a mold.<br>12.  Archaic. a garment or vestment.<br><br><br><br><br>Clearly,
              there are many definitions of investment. So what exactly is
              investment. To some people, investments might be putting money into the
              stock market. To some others, the unit trusts, bonds, etc. To another
              person, an education is also an investment. Raising a kid might be an
              investment to some as well.<br><br>To me, investing is the act of
              sacrificing something in order to gain something else more worthwhile.
              It does not necessarily need to include money. Example: spending time
              to read self-improvement books for free from the library is a form of
              investment; I gain in getting more insights. Spending the effort to
              build such a blog/website is also investing; I gain in being able to
              gather, clarify and put together my thoughts.<br><br>Indeed, investment
              is important. To me, the bulk of investments should be on oneself; the
              returns are far greater than investing in any stocks, bonds, etc.
              Education, reading, learning on the job, etc, build upon life skills
              that may likely be used again and again in the future. This is sort of
              like a form of compounding; the database in you may grow in a constant
              rate, but if each piece of data gives you some form of returns at a
              constant rate as well, the total returns increases in an exponential
              rate. This is because the data that you possess continue to give you
              some sort of returns as you build up your personal database. Every
              piece of new data starts to give you rewards the moment you put it in,
              together with previous data that continue to provide the rewards.<br><br>Not
              sure if I explained the idea properly, but in short, invest in
              yourself, invest in building up a personal database. This will be on
              top of investing time on trading on the stock market (stock market
              plays are not called investing, but trading).</p>
