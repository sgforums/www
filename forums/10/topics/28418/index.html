            <div class='col-md body'>I think the Singaporean Government maybe consider adopting NS for women since Malaysia is starting their NS. Also I think the S'porean Government might now be thinking of upgrading or increasing the size of the SAF. But to my opinion, we should get weapons is able to handle a large number of enemies while obtaining little causalties for ourside, we should get long range missiles or at least a few nuclear submarines <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

Hahaha.<br><br>Seriously, our women have to be trained to know how to take care of themselves in case of an emergency.  They must know what to do at the right time and place.  Women cannot be an extra burden to the fighting men.  The men will fight better if they know their wives are trained to stay safe.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>women do not neccessary be the ones charging with arms in the battlefield;<br><br>PROPOSAL FOR FEMALE ENLISTMENT IN THE SAF<br>=========================================<br><br>This is a summary of the strong arguments for S'pore "girls"<br>to serve National Service in an NON-COMBAT vocation<br>in the NS call-up scheme presently implemented for S'pore Males<br>prior to being awarded full S'pore Citizenship at age 21.<br><br>* Presently, alot of administrative duties are being done by<br>NSF males in clerical &amp; non-combat vocations, like typing,<br>filing, data-entry, computer word-processing, basic clerical<br>tasks, simple administration, which can be done equally well<br>by females, if not better.<br><br>* Already, there are SAF women trainers in combat vocations,<br>who upgrade reservists' skills during in-camp training.<br><br>* They can be stationed at reservist units, brigades, battalions, etc<br>to fill up the huge vacuum in required personnel.  They won't be<br>posted to far-away camps, but to nearby camps around S'pore,<br>eg. Maju Camp, and work in a 9 am - 5 pm daily schedule,<br>with booking-out daily, and they don't have to stay overnight<br>in the camps at all.  They will have to serve a minimum of 1 year<br>to be trained well enough.<br><br>* In the passing of the addition to the SAF ACT, girls will<br>look for exemptions from service, in the form of being registered<br>for marriage or/and being married.  They can setup a fake marriage<br>to escape enlistment.  There will be a mad rush for these people<br>to get registered for marriage, with or without holding a traditional<br>wedding dinner, but on paper they are legally married.<br><br>* These people will still not be exempted from service.  Only those<br>who are pregnant or/and have children are exempted. Some will<br>deliberately get pregnant to do this.<br>Of course, the disable, mentally crazy, are exempted.<br>We will also need the suicidal, psychologically unbalanced<br>to raise the fitness of the SAF.<br>Not many S'pore girls will fit these categories, or do they ?<br><br>* This will give a "quick-fix" to the population-policy,<br>and reverse the population and birth figures to 1984 surplus,<br>as a side-effect.<br><br>* But the SAF has to be realistic.  It should target only being<br>able to get a figure of &gt; 20,000 and &lt; 50,000.  They should<br>quickly restructure the existing male personnel makeup<br>to get an enhanced Defense Force.<br><br>* In war-time, these NS trained "women" can backup crucial tasks<br>that are vital, in event that the regular men performing<br>these are killed or dead by the enemy/s.<br><br>* We don't want our offices to be empty once all our men go to<br>the forefront, no one to count numbers, no one to answer phones,<br>no one to type letters, simple tasks but which need our<br>needed soldiers to do in times of war, when casualties go high,<br>when every man is filling in the last man who dropped, to<br>man the guns, the cannons, the weapons, but not the "pen &amp; paper."<br><br>* For each soldier which is deployed in such vocations, there<br>will be one less potentially capable soldier on the battle-field.<br><br>* The increased presence of operationally-ready SAF women<br>will boost the morale of SAF men in wartimes and peacetime,<br>where they will become emgaged in more realistic wartime conditions,<br>and pay greater attention to their NSF and NSmen training.<br><br>(They do want to look like weaklings who cry for pain,<br>in the presence of female, who struggle at running 2.4 km,<br>who cannot do at least 4 chin-ups, who cannot do this &amp; that,<br>so you depend on them to kill the enemy &amp; defend you from ?<br>(that's a great plan for self-destruction !))<br><br>(also, in real times of war, men will fight harder to defend<br>the females in their territory.)<br><br>* Females are a valuable resource in the S'pore population,<br>and they cannot be ignored, or they will become a greater<br>liability than useful in times of war.  The excuse of<br>a labour shortage in the market is not a valid reason<br>for the "LOOP-HOLE" in National Defense.  Let the market<br>forces work in the free economy.<br><br>* In the present call for men to go overseas to expand<br>business links &amp; income for S'pore, they cannot be relied<br>upon immediately in the event of a sudden war, invasion.<br>they may hesitate in coming back to S'pore, and by the<br>time they book a flight home &amp; report for duty,<br>S'pore would already be lost.  If there is a air-embargo,<br>they can't even get an airline that will fly here !)<br><br>* In the event of a modern war with weapons of the 90's,<br>S'pore will not be lost in weeks, as prevoius advertisements say,<br>it will be lost in HOURS &amp; DAYS.<br><br>* In case S'pore falls and surrenders, the enemy will probably<br>not kill the women, and they can play a great role which<br>no man can, infiltrate the enemy ranks, assasinate their<br>commanders, form a resistence, gather enemy information,<br>steal documents, monitor enemy movements, etc<br>and pass information to the underground fighters.<br>These can become the ELITE of the SAF army, navy, air-force.<br>They can work among the captive population, while SAF men<br>may be singled out from common population into detention camps,<br>or systematically killed, gassed, shot, slayed, tortured;<br>separated from contact.  They can operate in an invisible<br>background of the women and operate &amp; activate mines &amp; bombs,<br>chemical weapons, laid in all parts of S'pore, so when<br>enemy forces concentrate on an area, they can blow them to pieces.<br>They can also get to secret places with hidden telecommunications<br>equipment and make contact with foreigh leaders for military aid.<br>Or rescue our captured leaders from enemy hands, etc etc<br>They can MAKE a difference in our counter-attack capability.<br><br>* It will provide them a chance to get a working picture of<br>TOTAL NATIONAL DEFENSE, how they play an important role,<br>and learn a sense of patriotism in them, which is clearly lacking.<br>This will produce great dividends for S'pore's future &amp; present.<br><br>* For S'pore's defense, parents will be supportive as they have<br>with sometimes their only sons, to give their blessings to<br>their daughters.  It will give them a good chance to become<br>a more important part of S'pore, and let them mature from<br>"girls" to "women".  They will form a base of good citizens<br>our country can count on, instead of counting corpses.<br><br>* FOR THE SAKE OF SINGAPORE'S EXISTENCE, THE OBSTACLES TO THE<br>IMPLEMENTATION OF "GIRLS NS" CAN BE OVERCOME, AND WITH<br>PATRIOTISM AND DETERMINATION, IT WILL BE A GREAT SUCCESS.<br><br>fOR tHE pEOPLE oF sINGAPORE.  24.2.1995.<br>-anonymous<br><br>didn't seem to work last time 1995... now? hmmm... dunno maybe someone will do something about this?<br><br>I attended the Temasek Seminar recently, and during the Q&amp;A session, there were several questions posed at the Minister of State for Defence(? forgot<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">) regarding girls in NS, and the reply was that they currently do not see the need for girls to be enlisted for NS. Will they change their mind so fast? That statement was made on Wednesday 30 Oct, was it before Malaysia announced mandatory NS for its people?</div>
