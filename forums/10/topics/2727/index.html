            <div class='col-md body'>hi one and all...lately as most of u know...people have been burning a lot of paper money...this is because of the hungry ghost festival...<br><br>i am a Christian...and i make no attempt to cover the fact...<br><br>however...i still feel that it's not about religion...i feel that regardless of religion...people should not be allowed to burn things just like that...y can't they go to temples and do their sacrifices there?<br><br>every time they burn these kinda things outside my home...i get headaches and feel dizzy...my contact lenses itch...<br><br>it's like the haze once again...except it's more intense...<br><br>if this burning of paper offerings is tolerable...den y do we even bother to make so much fuss over the forest fires in Indonesia? isn't it almost the same?<br><br>isn't it spoiling the environment? isn't it like smoking?

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Cadence,<br><br>have a little sharing here but hopefully it wun spark off some religion thing or whatever.<br><br>U r a christian, and why do u believe in it? Obviously there's some certain reasons, just like when pple burnt joss paper, they believe that their beloved-late relatives will receives all this things, or that they will be 'safe' during this mnth. For whatever reason, i dun really know. I mean if they felt relief and good after buring these joss paper, why not? its far much better than to keep worrying everyday.<br><br>Why not go to the temple? hmmm.....cos the number of pple burning the joss paper are far too large for the temple to handle. Imagine every1 rush to the temple, i mean, its just not possible. Of cos, its diff from the forest fire in Indonesia, and i am sure u know it, can't believe u actually comapred them, heh...  :p<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well it's true that a little bit of burning is okay...<br><br>but wat if everyone thinks the same? wouldn't that amount to a lot of burning (which i have been observing)?<br><br>just like a 5cent coin which is almost worthless now...just one coin is worthless...but wat about, say a thousand 5cent coins? that accumulated sum of 5cents now becomes $50...is $50 small?<br><br>our environment is clean...true...but the govt is doin so much and we are not doing our part...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>From what I saw from the postings.<br>People were saying that burning of joss papers and incenses pollutes the environment.<br>I think that,The point is not totally valid.<br>How can burning of joss paper on a small scale pollutes the environment that it becomes an environment issue?<br><br>Think about it, which causes more pollution.<br>The amount of exhaust that is released by all the vehicles in Singapore in a day and the amount of smoke that is produced by the burning of joss papers in a day.<br>(Remember end product of burning papers is carbon dioxide, soot, and etc, but the exhaust of the cars?)<br><br>Burning on a small scale doesn't pollutes the environment as much as our other human activites(If it does then we must be living in a highly polluted environment since the days Man discovered how to make use the fire, and have since been burning stuff then.), it does not cause depletion of the ozone layer, neither will animals die because people are burning paper on a small scale, compare to the burning of forest in Indonesia)<br><br>&lt;WE are oso doing ours by not burning these stuff. U dun expect everyone to hv the same mindset rite? Just as the govt. is promoting a crime free Singapore but why are there still creeps that lurk around in the nite to rob people?&gt; --- Baby<br><br>Um I think that your description of having same mindset isn't very apt, Burning of joss paper during the seventh month is to appease the spirits who has no kin to make offerings for them.(According to my knowledge on the hungry ghost festival) How can you compare it to thieves and acts of crime? But I do get your point just that the way you describe it is not very appropriate.<br><br>For me, I don't burn joss papers as well but not because that it will cause pollution(compare to the amount of CFC we human are generating into the atmosphere, it's nothing)<br>But because of the inconviences it causes to my fellowman and also because my religion  doesn't require me to do that, I can understand what cadense is going thr since I have a sensitive nose.<br><br>So people let's tackle this issue matter of factly, burning of joss papers in the public isn't appealing to most people(including me that's why i said that your point is not totally valid and not your point is not valid). But we must practise tolerance, and at the same time, put our ideas forward to the people who burn joss papers without any form of control and let the ashes and soot go flying around in public, because that is just plain irresponsible.<br><br>This post is not targeted at anyone, so please for those who reply, don't target the religion aspect of this issue but instead on the issue itself. Just my humble opinion, so for those who do not share my views. Please put your views across peacefully and not just flames ok? Thanks<br><br>------------------<br>To obtain peace, We have to fight for it, but then do you really call it peace if we have to fight for peace?</div>
