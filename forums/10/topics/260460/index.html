Does it mean that every time the company declares a net profit, it needs to raise prices?<br><br>Its behaviour mirrors that of public transport operators ComfortDelgro and SMRT, both of whom proceeded with fee hikes previously despite what are, in my opinion, healthy profits.<br><br>I disagree with the view by StarHub's Mr Thomas Ee that it is not a monopoly in Singapore when, in fact, there is no other competitor for cable TV content.<br><br>How can it not be a monopoly when it is the only channel that screens live English Premier League matches and Formula One races?<br><br>I also find the method of raising fees very high-handed.

Isn't it to regulate and investigate such price increases to promote fair competition? In this case, I would be surprised if it is considered fair practice.<br><br>I am upset with StarHub which, in my opinion, does not value customer loyalty.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey! Don u know, according to MICA, your views on these issues distort the truth?!  They are polemics dressed up as analysis, blaming the Government for all that you are unhappy with. You offer no alternatives or solutions. Your piece is calculated to encourage cynicism and despondency, which can only make things worse, not better, for those you profess to sympathise with.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes, we complain but offer no solution...solution to what? High-handed and deliberate price increases? What is the aim of price hikes if not to raise profits, even when annual earnings of companies have shown a healthy growth + profit margin?<br><br>With monopoly in tow, starhub convenient raises the price on subscription. If that's the case, than our closed-door TV market needs more competition than ever to compete. Clearly there is an obvious lack of competition within government regulated agencies in full control of our media options - pathetic  mediacorp or pricy starhub cable.<br><br>Maybe the public should cancel subscriptions after expiry and let starhub have a taste of consumer power.<br><br>Then again, i'm one of those 'solution-less' ranters.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>
