Bush as he works to secure another term in office.<br><br>Congress is reforming myriad federal retraining schemes as local community colleges - seen as the local workhorses in a national effort - tie up with businesses to match student skills with market needs.<br><br>The push for training is a sign of the times as companies merge and announce wholesale layoffs, the Christian Science Monitor reported.<br><br>The migration of jobs, ranging from call centre operations to computer programming, to lower-cost countries is also a growing trend.<br><br>'The US no longer has a lock on high-tech, white-collar jobs,' said Mr Craig Barrett, chief executive of Intel, the world's leading computer chip maker.<br><br><strong>Mr James Fusco should know - he worked as a programmer for AT&amp;T for 13 years before it farmed out much of its data centre operations to IBM in 1999.<br><br>But most of IBM's projects were handed to programmers in India and Canada and in May 2002, he and his colleagues were laid off, the New York Times reported.<br><br>Last November, Mr Fusco, 50, found a job as a systems administrator at a small company in New Jersey. With the federal aid and retraining he is seeking, he said he might switch to another field. </strong><br><br>'A year ago, I would have gone for newer computer skills,' he explained. 'But I'm not sure that programming is a smart thing to get back into. It can be done remotely.'<br><br>Like Mr Fusco, <strong><span style="color: red;">many Americans fear that in an information-age economy, all kinds of jobs may be at risk. About eight million Americans are unemployed, with nearly two million out of work for six months or more</span>.</strong><br><br>'Increasingly, people are not working for a single industry or in the same occupation their entire lives,' said Mr Jason Walsh of the Workforce Alliance, a coalition of groups concerned about training issues.<br><br>'There is a lot of churning, lifelong learning, people losing jobs, getting new ones, and learning new skills,' the Christian Science Monitor quoted him as saying.<br><br>Mr Bush, in a recent radio address, highlighted Owens Community College in Toledo, Ohio, which with seven other colleges, has set up programmes to train students for skilled manufacturing.<br><br>'The response has been phenomenal,' said Mr Jim Gilmore, a coordinator at Owens, of the three- to five-month programmes. He has 60 students enrolled, with many more showing interest.<br><br>The federal money that pays for tuition and books is made use of differently, depending on local conditions.<br><br>Said Mr Gilmore: 'So where manufacturing might be the big thing where I'm at, in Arizona, health care might be the up-and-coming thing.'<br><br>At the Borough of Manhattan Community College in New York, the emphasis is on training Americans to replace foreign workers on H-1B visas, which companies apply for when there are no Americans qualified for the job.<br><br>'We focus on dislocated workers - those who have lost jobs as a result of 9/11 - and minorities in general,' said Mr Rodney Alexander, a director at the school.<br><br>Straits Time 18 February 2004<br><a href="http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/topstories/story/0,4386,235753,00.html?" rel="nofollow">http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/topstories/story/0,4386,235753,00.html?</a><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Globalisation means that our jobs here in advanced economies are gonna be threatened. Look at Dell, their tech support call centre is in India.<br><br>But what about quality of the work from India?<br><br>Remember the trend of subcontracting? Now it's exporting. I think when they discover that it's hard to control the quality of work, they might move these jobs back.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, as an economist by training, what Bush's chief economic advisor is doing is actually correct.<br><br>Give you an example, let's take singapore and malaysia. Currently, Singapore imports food products(pigs etc) from malaysia, because it would be inefficient for singapore to produce farmed products due to our limited land space, thus we focus on other more high tech products. In return, we export high tech products to malaysia(Creative Tech etc).<br><br>In the current example, US shipping high tech computer jobs or mostly call centres and other jobs to India, is because its more efficient and the labor is much cheaper. This cut in operation costs and overheads benefits the US companies who in return can issue more bonus shares and dividends to predominately US shareholders. The loss jobs in US tech and call center will shift to more efficient sectors.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>Class is over!
