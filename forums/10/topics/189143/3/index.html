According to Longman dictionary, it means to arrange an election or game dishonestly etc.<br><br>Do we people elect our MPs or leaders legally or illegally or do we elect them so as to give them power to fix us the citizens or our elected MPs in illegal or dishones manner like suggested by the word "fix"?
