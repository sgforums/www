It dictates that, in order to prevent the accumulation of too much power in one person or decision-making body, there must be some separation of the three branches of the constitution: the Executive, the Legislature and the Judiciary. If this is not achieved, there is a danger that absolute power will be vested in one individual, which could lead to inefficiency and corruption.<br><br>The theory of separation of powers has been developed by writers as far back as Aristotle, who, writing in the 4th century BC, recognised that the Â“rule of a master is not a constitutional ruleÂ”(see footnote 1) and that government has three functions. He opined that government intervention is necessary because of human imperfection; however it should be limited to ensure that government vests as far as possible in the people. The classic formulation of the theory of separation comes from the writings of the 18th-century philosopher the Baron de Montesquieu. In his 1752 work LÂ’Esprit des Lois (The Spirit of the Laws), he explained that there are three functions of government and three main organs of government.<br><br>In order to protect individual liberty, the three functions of government Â– the formulation, the application and the enforcement of the law Â– should be kept separate and performed by the three organs of government Â– the Legislature, the Executive and the Judiciary. The structure should provide a system of checks and balances between the different branches to ensure that no one body can monopolise power in order to abuse it. Political theorists have long pointed out the dangers of non-observance of the separation of powers. According to Article 16 of the French Declaration of the Rights of Man of 1789, drafted after the overthrow of the despotic King Louis XVI, Â‘Any society in which the safeguarding of rights is not assured, and the separation of power is not observed, has no constitution.Â’<br><br>There is some debate as to whether a just constitution can accommodate an overlap of personnel between the different branches. To take two examples, the UK constitution displays a considerable overlap of personnel, not the least of whom is the Prime Minister. He is the head of the executive, but is also a Member of Parliament, hence drawn from the body of the legislature. He is therefore responsible for proposing legislation and can ensure its passage through Parliament by use of the party whip system and his Parliamentary majority.<br><br><strong>In contrast, the Constitution of the United States clearly stipulates that there can be no overlap of personnel.</strong> Article 1 of the US Constitution vests the Legislative power in Congress, Article 2 vests the Executive power in the President and Article 3 vests the judicial power in the Supreme Court and other inferior courts. Further, the Constitution states that there can be no overlap of personnel between the different functions. That the US Constitution adheres to MontesquieuÂ’s strict model of separation is unsurprising: it was produced in 1787, just 25 years after the Esprit des Lois was published, and the draftsmen were well-versed in MontesquieuÂ’s constitutional theories.<br><br>The judiciary<br><br>In the UK, the courts play a vital role in ensuring that the government adheres to the rule of law. This is a role that has developed throughout history. As far back as 1765, a prominent English judge, pointed out that a government may not act unless it is in accordance with the law, and it is for judges to decide whether the government possesses such a legal right:<br><br>Â“If it is law, it will be found in our books. If it is not to be found there, it is not lawÂ… By the laws of England, every invasion of private property, be it ever so minute, is a trespass. No man can set his foot upon my ground without my licenseÂ… If he admits the fact, he is bound to show by way of justification, that some positive law has empowered or excused him. The justification is submitted to the judges, who are to look into the books; and if such a justification can be maintained by the text of the statute law, or by the principles of common law. If no excuse can be found or produced, the silence of the books is an authority against the defendant, and the plaintiff must have judgment.Â”<br>Lord Chief Justice Camden in Entick v Carrington (1765)<br></span></blockquote></span><br><br></div>
