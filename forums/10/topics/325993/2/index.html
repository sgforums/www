              <p><em>...The governments paid for it in various ways: by taxation, by fiat
              money, by borrowing from banks (which created credit for the pur­pose),
              and by borrowing from the people by selling war bonds to them. Each of
              these methods of raising money had a different effect upon the two
              chief financial consequences of the war. These were inflation and
              public debt. The effects of the four ways of raising money upon these
              two can be seen from the following table: </em></p>
              <ol type="a">
              <li><em> Taxation gives no inflation and no debt. </em></li>
              <li><em> Fiat money gives inflation and no debt. </em></li>
              <li><em> Bank credit gives inflation and debt. </em></li>
              <li><em> Sales of bonds give no inflation but give debt. </em></li>
              </ol>
              <p><em>It would appear from this table that the best way to pay for
              the war would be by taxation, and the worst way would be by bank
              credit. How­ever, taxation sufficient to pay for a major war would have
              such a severe deflationary effect upon prices that economic production
              would not in­crease enough or fast enough. Any rapid increase in
              production is spurred by a small amount of inflation which provides the
              impetus of unusual profits to the economic system. Increase in public
              debt, on the other hand, contributes little of value to the effort
              toward economic mobilization. </em></p>
              <p><em>From this point of view, it is not easy to say what method of
              financing a war is best. Probably the best is a combination of the four
              methods mixed in such a way that at the end there is a minimum of debt
              and no more inflation than was necessary to obtain complete and rapid
              economic mobilization. This would probably involve a combination of
              fiat money and taxation with considerable sales of bonds to individuals, the
              com­bination varying at different stages in the mobilization effort...</em></p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The summary of your post, the crux of the matter, the point of
                          your contention is simply boiled to your personal greviance of
                          'social spending'</span></p>
              <p>Nah. My main intention i just to correct your unorthodox mindset.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">but without money, they are nothing,
                          and unable to lead. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">with the little i have and earn</span></p>
              <p>Firstly, a good govt wouldn't be in a position where it is cash-stripped. If they are in such a shit, why would the people vote for them?</p>
              <p>Secondly, look at the history of SG. Have any of our leaders been a bankrupt, or are facing financial difficulties, when they were being elected? I do agree that some of them comes from a poor background, but being able to escape the poverty cycle proofs that they are capable indeed.</p>
              <p>And also, to participate in the election, one must be able to fock out 10k, if im not wrong. I think that the financial status of those participating in the election, be it PAP or opposition, would be better compared to yours. So don't judge others until you are of equal status with them.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">In theory, much of these costs can be offset if the country has
                          natural resources, such as oil or minerals. </span></p>
              <p>Explain Nigeria to me.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">We need to
                          pay for our govt in order that it can run social spending, and save
                          enough with investments for the next generation.</span></p>
              <p>Being a citizen of any country will subject you to taxes, SG is no different, so don't complain.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Unlike Hong Kong, a province of China, where it would be stupid
                          to save for 'future generations', for each dollar saved would go to
                          the national treasury of China, for China to dole out accordingly. </span></p>
              <p>Do you know that during the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis, HK spent US$1 billion just to protect its currency. It also spend more than HK$100 billion to prevent and recover from the shock. Where do such a large money comes from? The national treasury of course. Without the complusary saving, HK would be doomed during the financial crisis.</p>
              <p>Saving had always been a virtue in many cultures and religions and history have proven that those who don't have the disclipine to do so would fail in life.</p>
              <p>Yes, HK will return to China and all the funds in the treasury would go to CN. However, you have not considered that before CN took over, HK had to faced any problems on its own. Also, the HK people aren't complete retards. They would also fight for a portion of the money to be reserved specially for their province.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">It was through our
                          previous generation's sweat and toil that made Spore great -
                          schools, buses, roads, buildings, homes, etc. We alone can never
                          hope to have such facillities. </span></p>
              <p>Yes, our forefathers had been marvellious and impressive people, deserving our total respect. But, we had achieved great things too. Look at our annual GDP. Look at the amount of donations we give to the needy each year. Look at the living condition you are experiencing and the security we have on our streets. These are the achievements made by our forefathers and US.</p>
              <p>We, the capable majority of singaporean, have proven that we can achieve great things through hard work. Only the incapable minority, would not accept challenges and complain behind the protection of their computer.</p>
              <p>I'm not saying that we are better than our forefathers, however i find that the present singaporean are comparable to them. They have their problems, we have ours. The only common factor is that all of us solve them and achieve success.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">However, the current generation may not be caring enough. We had
                          been cold and calculative, and forgotten the sacrifices of toil and
                          sweat of the previous generation. </span></p>
              <p>And who are you to judge it?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">We have a declining birth rate,
                          pampered womenfolk who make demands on taxpayers, and selfish
                          perhaps ignorant kids blustering for better transportation
                          services.</span></p>
              <p>You forgotten to add retarded babies who claims that only by increasing the nation's population, can a nation's transport system improve.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">There can be more buses at peak hours. But what happens at
                          non-peak hours? </span></p>
              <p>Less bus lor! Common sense.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">So to provide more buses or trains at peak periods,
                          there will more mouths to feed even during non-peak hours, and such
                          monies comes from us citizens. </span></p>
              <p>What are you talking about? I know you are very "proficient" in EL. But do understand that I'm not as "good".</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">but having more
                          citizens, PRs and FTs, so that we singaporeans can have a better
                          and comfortable future for ourselves and our future </span></p>
              <p>My foot! PRs and FTs will only increase the manpower availablity in SG. The sudden surge of them would result in everyone recieving a lower pay. Supply and Demand boy! I'm sure you are clever enough to know.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">I don't mind paying more, </span></p>
              <p>Your business, not mine.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">But
                          if we have more citizens, it would help defray such costs. With
                          just a few us, we will only end up having to pay more,</span></p>
              <p>More citizen would require more social spending and resources. How would that defray costs? Fewer people would require a lesser quantity of everything, this in turn would decrease the amount of money the govt spend. Having more citizen over a short period of time would only encourage inflation and wage wars.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">espacially
                          for our elderly for we cannot as a society leave them to die by the
                          roadside, as they sacrificed much for us in our past.</span></p>
              <p>Only retarded and insensitive babies do such things.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Comfort and whines/complains comes at a price. No matter which
                          political party we vote in - PAP, WP, SDA, SFP, SDP, etc. We
                          taxpayers will have to still pay.</span></p>
              <p>LoL! Don't bring SG politics in if you have nothing to add. And btw, name me 10 countries which do not require its citizen to pay tax of any form?</p>
