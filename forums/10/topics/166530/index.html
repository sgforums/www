While much effort has been put in to looking after the needs of our elderly residents and disabled in this Town Renewal Plan, we also made sure children as well as adult residents are well taken care of. We also pay attention to integrate our facilities in a way that will help enhance family and community bonding."<br>.<br>During the dinner, grassroots leaders and residents of Sembawang Town Council paid a special tribute to Dr Tony Tan, MP for Sembawang GRC and Adviser to Sembawang Town Council, by means of a slide presentation and token of appreciation for his years of contribution to the town council.<br>.<br>Formerly the Deputy Prime Minister before he retired from the Cabinet in September, Dr Tan, 65, had been an MP in Sembawang since he entered politics in 1979. Dr Tan has recently taken up positions in the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation and Singapore Press Holdings.<br>.<br>In the last five years, 21,000 households in the older estates benefited from a total of 25 Upgrading Programmes costing $340 million. In addition, 600 improvement projects were implemented throughout the area.<br>.<br>According to Mr Hawazi, Sembawang Town Council is in "very sound financial health" with a surplus of $8.6 million and $233 million in its reserves. Its decision to invest its funds has paid off.<br>.<br>"Our funds with our fund managers have given us a total return of $25 million in the last two years, or a yield of 16 per cent per annum," said Mr Hawazi</div>

But still follow some pay "scheme" which if you are so qualified you better off working outside.<br><br>But be warned, t council job everyday revolves ard attending to complaints from residents abt corridor lights spoil lah, ceiling leaking lah, tap no water ah ... neighbours dog keep barking ah, people want to rent void deck for funeral or wedding lah ... processing tenders for contractors to do repairs lah, a lot of nitty gritty siao ah pee to do.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>extracted from ST forum.<br><br>Ensure no place for 'pork-barrel' politics<br><br>HOT on the heels of the $160 million renewal plan announced recently by the Aljunied Town Council, the East Coast Town Council has been allocated $500 million for its five-year plan. The Jalan Besar Town Council is expected to announce its plan early next year.<br><br>While such programmes are welcome, especially to residents in Aljunied and East Coast who are the direct beneficiaries, many Singaporeans cannot help but view them as the Government's adoption of 'pork-barrel' politics - loosely translated to mean government spending that is intended to benefit constituents in return for their political support - coming as they do before the impending General Election.<br><br>As the Prime Minister himself deplores pork-barrel politics, as evidenced by his recent criticism of the practice in Japan when speaking at a luncheon organised by the Foreign Correspondents Association ('Singapore's PM criticises Japan's pork-barrel politics'; Japan Today, Oct 7), he should ensure that before the next election is held, budgets for such five-year renewal plans are allocated to all the remaining constituencies that have yet to announce such plans.<br><br>Better still, let the parties contesting the election come up with their plans on how to utilise these funds to benefit the residents in these wards. Residents can then decide for themselves which platforms to endorse - besides other considerations - and vote accordingly.<br><br>This way, the MPs can then be held accountable, ensuring that they fulfil their election promises before their five years are up.<br><br>Jeffrey Ho Loon Poh<br></div>
