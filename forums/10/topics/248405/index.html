The same goes for seven other members of the EU parliament who are visiting Indonesia and Singapore this week.<br>Anders Samuelsen has complained about the restriction placed on him through a press release issued in Danish in Denmark. If this will land him in trouble in Singapore remains to be seen.<br>"It is indeed proof that te fight for democracy in Singapore is still on, when you can prohibit someone to speak at a public meeting," Samuelsen is qupoted by the his party's press release.<br>Samuelsen and the seven EU parliamentarians are members of the liberal group in the EU parliament (ALDE). The meeting is with the Council of Asian Liberals and Democrats (CALD).<br>"I am shocked. This is state control of the worst kind and ought to be a black spot on the democratic conscience of the government. Jeg have along with the other participants objected to the foreign committee of the Singaporean parliament, but the decision stands. Also the EU ambassadors have had no luck in trying to influence the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Singapore," Samuelsen says.<br>Still Samuelsen and his colleagues have decided to stay in the meeting.<br>"We have decided to participate anyway, but we have been issued a clear message that we will be arrested if we say something. It is absurd but then again it comes as no surprise when you consider the government of Singapore," he adds.<br>According to the press release, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Sinagpore issue on Tuesday a statement saying that Singaporean politics were for Singaporeans only to debate and that foreigners who involve themselves in domestic Singaporean affairs are not welcome in Singapore.<br>Anders Samuelsen may while in Singapore be reached for additional comments on his mobile phone +45 5126 7616<br>--<br><a href="http://www.scandasia.com/viewNews.php?coun_code=dk&amp;news_id=3213" rel="nofollow">http://www.scandasia.com/viewNews.php?coun_code=dk&amp;news_id=3213</a></div>

In fact, many of his acts could be seen as being identical to that of Ghandhi(whose acts resulted in the mass decolonization of British colonies) or Walesa(who basically instigated the uprising which eventually, coupled with other factors, led to the dissolution of the USSR). The only problem is, unlike Walesa and Ghandhi, however, he just doesn't command the sort of moral authority or stature you need to effectively instigate changes through such means (the fact that there're people viewing him as a crazy megalomaniac just sums it up).<br><br>To be honest, I don't think it's that bad an idea for him to highlight the repressive practices of this regime to the international community...</div>
