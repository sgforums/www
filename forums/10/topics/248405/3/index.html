 much like most of his bloody career...<br></strong></blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">CSJ is probably doing us a favor to help loosen the dead bolts that have rusted into the woodwork, and is helping to loosen the tight political rules that have made politics the exclusive territory of only those annointed and accepted by the Ruling Party.<br><br>Is Singapore Politics the exclusive domain of a SINGLE Party much like that of Communist Vietnam and China, or the Military Dictatorship of Myanmar ?<br><br>Is it not a shame that with all the political instability that Indonesia is facing, these European Parliamentarians were given the opportunity to speak their two-cents worth in an Indonesian Forum, while FIRST WOLRD Singapore is afraid to allow its Citizens to hear some enlightened political views from some Members of Parliament from another FIRST WORLD ? </span><br><blockquote><strong><br>btw, i'm bitter about him causing the opposition to be set back by a few decades with <span style="color: red;">his debacle of ousting his mentor</span>...  maybe i'm biased against him, but can you actually blame anyone for hating him? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br></strong></blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">Where on earth did you get this piece of information from ?<br>Gossip or false propaganda promoted by the supporters of the Ruling Party ?<br><br>It is sad an educated person will hold personal view towards another person that is skewed from information that is erroneous and baseless gossip.<br><br>The following information is easily obtained from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore_Democratic_Party" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia</a>, and members of the SDP could have easily protested or even updated any information if it was incorrect.<br><br>Similarly, it would have been in Chiam See Tong's interest to correct the following, if any part was in serious error and that would have validated your sympathy towards Chiam for the supposed back-stabbing by Chee.</span><br><br><span style="color: green;"><blockquote><span style="font-style: italic;"><br>In 1993, three months after joining the SDP, Chee was accused of using his research funds to send his wifeÂ’s PhD dissertation to the US. Dr Chee had asserted, and still does, that this was not the case as his wife was an employee in the same department at NUS at that time and was working with him, sharing and collaborating in their research, and that the funds were legitimately used. The NUS decided to sack Chee.[3]<br><br>Chee claimed this was a political vendetta plotted by the ruling party as his supervisor Mr S.R. Vasoo was a PAP MP.[citation needed] The PAP had, however, denied the accusation and insisted that the offence was real.<br><br>Chiam wanted to censure Chee but</span> <strong><span style="color: blue;">the former was not supported by the Central Executive Committee and they voted to oust him as general secretary and to replace him with Chee</span></strong>. <span style="color: green;">Supporters of Chiam left the party and formed the Singapore People's Party in 1994, which Chiam took over from Sin Kek Tong as the secretary-general in the 1997 general election.</span><br><br><strong><span style="color: blue;">The SDP decided to strip Chiam See Tong's membership after the latter had gone to the Singapore Press Club and denounced the SDP and the Central Executive Committee</span></strong><span style="color: green;">.[4] Had he lost his membership, under the law, he would also have to lose his seat in parliament. The courts ruled that his dismissal was unfair and that he should be allowed to remain as a member of the SDP.<br></span></blockquote></span><br><span style="color: darkred;">How could his dismissal be seen to be unfair, when the general SDP membership approved the decision of the Central Executive Committee to dismiss Chiam ?<br><br>Is it any surprise that the Singapore Judiciary should make a decision in favor of Chiam, when the process of his dismissal was recorded to be correctly executed and submitted to the Registrar of Societies ?<br><br>Should we wonder who would benefit in stoking up the rumor mill to pin the blame for Chiam's removal on CSJ ?<br><br>This rumor fits CSJ personna that was already seen to be a "party spoiler", and would have served the purpose of neutralising him as a direct threat to a smooth LHL future accenscion to the throne.<br><br>Unfortunately for the Ruling Party, CSJ's mercurial arrival spoilt the meticulous plans that were already in motion to neutralise all political threats from internal dissenters(old guards), and external threats from the likes of JBJ, Tang Liang Hong, Francis Seow - all of whom would have given LHL's rule a hard time.<br><br>It is so easy to pin it on CSJ, and the State Controlled Publicity Team has been working overtime to make CSJ a real goof, which somehow is not seen by others looking at him without tinted glasses. </span><br><br></div>

As visitors to our country, foreigners should not abuse their privilege by interfering in our domestic politics," the Ministry of Home Affairs said in a statement issued on its Web site late on Thursday.<br><br>"Foreigners who abuse the privileges that Singapore accords to guests and visitors, and meddle in Singapore's domestic politics, are not welcome here," the Ministry said.<br><br>The barred speakers include European parliament members Graham Watson of the United Kingdom, Anders Samuelsen of Denmark, and Lydie Polfer of Luxembourg, a former deputy prime minister of that country.<br><br>Under Singapore's Public Entertainments and Meetings Act, public speaking is generally prohibited unless it has been licensed by the government.<br><br>Singaporeans who wish to speak indoors do not need to be licensed, but forums featuring foreign speakers require a permit, the ministry said.<br><br>Chee Siok Chin, sister of party leader Chee Soon Juan and a senior party member herself, said the SDP would go ahead with the forum with local speakers.<br><br>"You have this autocratic government coming down and showing utter disrespect for our international peers. I'm ashamed," she said on Friday.<br><br>She said the seven foreigners barred from speaking at the forum are currently in Singapore.<br><br>According to the SDP Web site, Chee Soon Juan plans to speak at the forum and rebut remarks made by Lee Kuan Yew, modern Singapore's first prime minister, about the ministers' pay hike.<br><br>Lee said earlier this week that Singapore should pay ministers competitive wages because the city-state needs an "extraordinary government with extraordinary government officers".<br><br>Copyright 2007 Reuters.

The point is that all these companies will bring us is tax revenue and some finite no. of jobs but by no means will they contribute to raising the standards of living of the people. Only a strong domestic economy will raise the standards of living as it will avail to the people a wider spectrum of jobs and allow people to progress up the economic ladder. And yes, we shouldn't expect anything from the foreign companies because of this. We should not expect them to help people develop themselves or anything.

For the record, a country's sovereignty isn't dependent on the recognition of a particular country (so I don't even see the relevance of when it was recognised by the EC and US), but that's besides the point. To suggest the EU could have been remotely blameworthy for the Balkan chaos is no more relevant than suggesting the Israeli-Palestinian conflict should be pinned on the US for its failure to reach a long-term peace agreement between the Israelis and Palestinians.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Arapahoe:</div><div class="quote_body">Not when u are in the federation.

At the end of the day, the EU is only representative of the collective interests of its 27 member states, not the rest of the world (it's not a UN, mind). Just as I'm sure Microsoft doesn't run its business worrying about whether their progress actually stifles competition and free trade from its competitors.<br><br>Speaking about China, the arms embargo was enforced in the aftermath of the Tiananmen Incident in '89. They pushed for that order to be rescinded simply because any sane government (supranational or otherwise) knows the importance of trade with China in terms of economic development - regardless of how horrendous their human rights (or any other aspect) or corruption may be. In essence, the EU is only acting in the collective interest of its member states. Like it or not, moral authority never supercedes the principles of a market economy - if moral authority were such an issue, there shouldn't be any liberal democracy wanting to trade with China, South Korea (when they were a dictatorship) or even Singapore for that matter.<br><br>[quote]Originally posted by Arapahoe:<br><strong>The alliance that you are talking about is a pretext of federation.

The "Common Market" concept first proposed by the British in 1956 has absolutely nothing along the lines of what a federation constitutes (you could use the S'pore and M'sia federation between '63 and '65 as an example of a federation) - this is further reinforced by the Treaty of Rome ('57). The EU member nations still retain their sovereign rights in many ways, although many aspects are subjected to EU regulations (like the free movement of EU citizens between member states, etc). Basically, if anything, the EU largely oversees matters which are transnational (but within countries of the EU) by nature (ie.free market policies to ensure competition in the "common market place" and the freedom of EU citizens to travel and work freely - ie.without work permits/social passes - in other EU nations).<br><br>Back to your point - I absolutely concur with you that an EU-like alliance in ASEAN is not going to occur anytime soon simply because there's hardly any common interests between member states that provide conditions for an EU-like institution to take shape. Just take a look around you - just about every nation in ASEAN is beset by either corruption and/or bankruptcy and/or despotism. Without even a common basis (be it compromising on political, economic or social matters), how do you even establish a union that could be empowered to overrule sovereign matters of its member states? Which regime in ASEAN is prepared to have a "supranational government" oversee their internal policies? That, in essence, is what I believe makes an EU-like union impossible, not so much the sense of patriotism or national identity...</strong></div>

How many R&amp;D labs have we attracted? Either a few or none? Why? Our workforce is hardly prepared to take on such tasks, not least most people aren't even interested in such things.
