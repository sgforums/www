He has no credibility with the population, and well, even if he's right, no one will listen to him.<br><br>Politics sometimes isn't just about idealism, it's about tactics and selling yourself to the people. This talking down to people serves him no purpose especially whne you are dealing with a population which is more inclined to stuff its head into the ground than anything else.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Gazelle:</div><div class="quote_body">FDI has served us well in the past and they will continue to be the key driver of growth now and future.<br><br></div></blockquote><a href="http://www.okusi.net/garydean/works/fdising.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.okusi.net/garydean/works/fdising.html</a><br><br><blockquote><br>In effect, the Singaporean government's policies hoped to attract TNCs to establish manufacturing facilities in Singapore to not only provide employment, but also with the hope that sophisticated foreign technology would 'trickle down' to local companies effecting technology transfer.  Government policy-makers tended to believe that TNCs were better vehicles for the acquisition of high technology.[6] However, to what extent this trickle-down effect actually happened is debatable.  It is suggested that TNCs are generally reluctant to use local contractors, which is where transmission of techniques and practices would be expected to take place, and that the technology actually used in locations such as Singapore is not cutting edge, but rather at the end of its product life-cycle.[7] </blockquote><blockquote><br><br>However, one important weakness in Singapore's approach is the question of technological innovation, considered the last stage of technology transfer.[10] For a variety of reasons, state-of-the-art R&amp;D by TNCs is nearly always concentrated in a few developed countries, and high technology tends not to be developed outside the TNC's home-base.  Cutting-edge R&amp;D in particular is usually undertaken close to management and decision-making centres where there exists a large local market, and a pool of advanced and specialist technical skills.[11] Another important weakness is that the very presence of strong TNCs can inhibit local companies from deepening their technological capabilities, preferring to import foreign technologies that are proven and ready-to-use, rather than invest in their own R&amp;D.[12] This is arguably what has already happened in Singapore as a consequence of their developmental path.</blockquote>and of course<br><br><blockquote><br><br>With or without FDI, Singapore would have found it difficult to languish as an economic backwater.  Accidents of location, culture and history came together in Singapore, and given a modicum of political stability, such a country could only prosper. Singapore was lucky; its apparent 'success' was certainly not only due to its FDI policies, but also due to many other factors.<br><br>What FDI has done for Singapore is to assist in the creation of a nation with one of the highest per capita incomes in the world, for what that is worth.  Singapore could be said to be wealthy in the same way that ancient Athens was said to be democratic. In both cases, a huge, anonymous underclass of cheap labour supported the superstructure; in the case of Singapore, Malaysians (of every race, not just Malays) and other Southeast Asians, who are offered only the barest of legislative protection by the government.<br><br><strong>The cost in human terms of this success has been high: Singapore today is an authoritarian corporatist state that intervenes in virtually every aspect of citizen's lives.  Singapore has become a nation of functionaries who serve the interests of the TNCs and the Singaporean state elite.  Within such an environment there exists very little true entrepreneurship.  FDI has not assisted in the development of an innovative population; rather it has assisted in the creation of a self-satisfied, arrogant society that seems content to live off its natural advantages.[23] Singapore today resembles an enormous air-conditioned shopping mall, with squeaky-clean streets and traffic so orderly as to border on the bizarre.</strong> </blockquote></div>
