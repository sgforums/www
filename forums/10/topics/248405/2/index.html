Fixing the economy? There are many things they could have done, most of which are non-economic, but will influence the economic climate and the relative attractiveness of Singapore to foreign investors and real talent.<br><br>Not a lax scheme of import substitution where there is talent duplication and a keen, overrated belief that one can fix the economy by only focusing on economic measures.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>At least, the present government is concerned about fixing the economy although they are out to benefit themselves first.</strong><br><br>Herzog, I think I have to disagree. For too long, S'pore was dwelling on low-to-mid-end 'manufacturing'. When the ASEAN/China competition speeded up, S'pore made a slow switch from 'manufacturing' to 'creative industries' and high-tech R&amp;D. But then, the govt acknowleged that our rote-learning school-system was NOT churning out enough 'creative' thinkers, thereby having to hasten 'creative' learning in our schools. But then again, 'creativity' in schools are left to teachers schooled in the old 'memorising' manner, so there's now a mismatch.<br><br>So, are we still wondering why the govt is paying so much $$$ to buy foreign talent and infrastructure to staff our many high-tech R&amp;D vnetures? And also to get the casinos in to earn more forex?</div>

The recent argument made by LKY was the siting of small GDP.  Singapore have been promoting FDI since 70's and with the increase high cost and competitive china, india needless to say the rate of FDI inflow into Singapore are diminishing. It has its peak and its positive impact.<br><br>What i saw was a lack of. A domestics economy that generate local solution for local needs.

The point is that all these companies will bring us is tax revenue and some finite no. of jobs but by no means will they contribute to raising the standards of living of the people. Only a strong domestic economy will raise the standards of living as it will avail to the people a wider spectrum of jobs and allow people to progress up the economic ladder. And yes, we shouldn't expect anything from the foreign companies because of this. We should not expect them to help people develop themselves or anything. To them, this country is a mere hotel for them to stay for the time being until the hotel fees rise to a level too expensive for them to stay.<br><br>And ultimately, if we are going play a race in FDI we will loose in the long run. This is not a long run feasible problem and as usual the Govt is probably throw money at it again when we reach some plateau and that is hardly a sound economic decision, not least it is an efficient use of resources.</div>
