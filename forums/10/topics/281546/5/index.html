Three Burmese cities, Lashio, Mandalay and Muse, have been described as "virtually Chinese cities now", and China is building a tax-free export zone for its own industries, next to the port of Rangoon.<br><br>The Chinese media are handling the Burmese protests with great caution, as they usually do when reporting movements against any governments. But the Chinese official newsagency Xinhua reported that the number of demonstrators has swollen over the past week, and that monks, "joined by larger crowds of young civilians, marched peacefully through Rangoon".<br><a href="http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,22481995-25837,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,22481995-25837,00.html</a>[/b]</blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">China has to make a positive public stand in line with the opinions of the other world communities.<br><br>Not to do so will place them too closely with the Myanmar military junta, and their ambition of hosting a successful Olympic in 2008 will be jeopardised.<br><br>Unfortunately, China will not put more weight behind the polite words, and as matters have developed up till this hour, one monk was 'accidentally' shot, and two other succumbed to the beatings.<br><br>The methods used by the Myanmar Military Junta - in the name of peace and order - is no different from our Singapore Government, with both having serious self-interest to protect from any civilian disobedience campaign.<br><br></span><br></div>
