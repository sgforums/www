            <div class='col-md body'>The junta has been more or less been ignored all this while by the world  community at large. And it has been a thorn in Asean's flesh all this while, as it has been difficult to handle Myanmar's problem. It would seem as though the rest of the Asean's members are closing an eye in not recognising the problem. But perhaps it has to do with the lead for the world's greatest democracy. America's been busy lately, and being an insignificant country in south east asia and no significant threat to america's war against terrorism, the country been left out of America's foreign policy. But Bush has taken notice of the country of late. Will we be expecting to see the high-handedness response of the US?<br><br>From what I see and drawing some similarities from its neighbour, Thailand, the protest can only come to either two conclusion.<br><br>One: the diminishing of the junta's rule in myanmar. To relief power completely to the people would be a difficult thing for the junta to do. Power is a great corruptor afterall.<br><br>Two: The military takes action, just as what happened in bangkok in 1970s, when soldiers opened fire on protesters or in tiananmen square. To have the military take action against its own population... indeed a scary thought.<br><br>Of course there is another way this thing may fold out: a stalemate.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The marching monks and now the nuns must be seen in a broad historical perspective. We are not in the best position to comment because like I said in many other threads: unless we know the history, and was there as witness, everything that we said is at best a personal and unlearned and often bias comment. You will have a better feel when you roam the vast country of Myanmar on foot with a backpack. See for yourself, talk to the ordinary folks(though they are quite guarded because they don't want to be seen talking to foreigners), walked the backlanes, ride the bullock carts - and you will know how sad that a resource-rich country has the world's highest poverty rate!<br><br>Military rule whether by force or by franchise is a thing of the past. We read in history books revolutions and uprisings against tyranny and dictatorship. By its nature, the junta must rule by force and use arms when it is cornered. So when the monks and nuns corner the junta, tanks will roll.<br><br>The dhamma is no drama for the junta and so is karma.  The monastic order is no match for military order.  Soldiers had long ago sold their souls for a buffet of good life in the barracks.  So they are not likely to go against the orders of their miltary masters.  What happened in Asia in the 20th century is what happened to Europe in the 18th, 19th century culminating in World Wars I and II.<br><br>History always repeat itself. That is called CYCLE, and REBIRTH will cause history to repeat itself again because a Hitler will be born again, a Hirohito will be born again, a Mohammed will be born again and of course Jesus is Coming again!</div>
