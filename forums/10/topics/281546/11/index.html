Or are you immuned from it?<br><br>When Christopher Hill expresses faith in the DPRK's commitment to nuclear disarmament, is that merely a front the US would like to put on to signal progress in the six-party talks or is there something tangible in his words? Perhaps, it's worth wondering why Hill is still talking about his faith in a deal instead of his achievements more than 2 years after his appointment as the US representative to the six-party talks. Apparently, you seem to live in a world fit for kids where you literally take everyone's word at face value.<br><br>Anyway, back to your points :<br>1. Sanctions and isolation may not have yielded the outcome in terms of having a complete overhaul of the regime, but evidently there is nothing to suggest it hasn't worked. <strong>On the contrary, there is nothing to suggest anything else works better, which clearly explains the international community's knack in resorting to such measures whenever the junta steps out of line</strong>. As a matter of fact, that regime has a knack of backing down when placed under pressure from the international community through sanctions and isolation. You may wish to analyse in detail the sanctions and subsequent backing down by the regime whenever Aung San Suu Kyi's house arrest is extended.<br><br>2. What the hell are you talking about? Who ever said you'd get a resolution passed easily at the Security Council? Your intellect seems no more agile than a toddler going by your senseless diatribes. Did the Security Council reach any effective consensus in the Balkan crisis in the 1990's or Iraq before Bush sent his troops in? As a matter of fact, <strong>this particular instance isn't so much an issue of a resolution not having the support of the majority as is the issue with the fact China chooses to exercise its veto as a permanent member which complicates things</strong>.<br><br>3. If the UN were prepared to sit by and let the ASEAN Human Rights charter kick in, why would they bother sending Gambari there to begin with? For a holiday or tea session with Tan Shwe? If ASEAN could be relied upon to resolve issue, would there even be a need for this matter to be referred to the Security Council to begin with? As with anything, Gambari's merely doing everything diplomatically possible by exhausting all avenues to advance his cause - and that's by no means an endorsement on his, or the UN's, part of the ability of ASEAN to resolve this issue.</div>

Political objective has not been met from sanctions because your limited intellect doesn't permit you to comprehend it to be so.

That's got nothing to do with "playing cards" as your deluded mind is led to believe. It's obviously exclusive for morons like you, through a lack of proper understanding of the functioning mechanisms that govern the UN's operations, to regard the UN's role to be nothing but a "show case" and a "dysfunctional organisation".

Really, have any asian countries proved any more successful in trying to resolve the Burmese issue?<br><br>If your diatribe were true, why would China be bothered to issue a condemndation through the UN? And clearly, you lack a dose of basic common sense - how on earth are you supposed to establish a "more legitimate government" by retaining the present one? Lest you get confused, the UN was dealing with the more pressing humanitarian issue of the regime's crackdown on protestors than the need for the regime to be toppled. So why are you comparing an apple with an orange? I suppose you must be linguistically challenged to have interpreted things that way.</div>

The state-controlled New Light of Myanmar newspaper reported the meeting only after Wang had left the country.<br><br>China, a communist country whose own record on democratic reforms and human rights has been criticized, is one of Myanmar's largest trading partners and its main political ally.<br><br>Beijing does not usually publicly criticize Myanmar's military government, a reflection of its position of strict noninterference in the internal affairs of the country.<br><br>But in recent weeks, it has been credited with working behind the scenes to pressure Myanmar to embrace democratic reforms after the crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrations.<br><br>China also provided important backing for the mission of Ibrahim Gambari, the U.N. secretary general's special envoy on Myanmar, by supporting a Security Council declaration and helping persuade Myanmar to allow him to visit twice.<br><br>As Wang's visit ended Friday, U.N. human rights investigator Paulo Sergio Pinheiro announced that at least 15 people died in Myanmar's biggest city when the military crushed the demonstrations, five more than the government had acknowledged.<br><br>"This is just in Yangon," Pinheiro said. "The government has not told me all the casualties in the country."<br><br>He said numbers were based on post-mortems and other official information, adding that he would continue seeking relevant information from other sources.<br><br>It was the first trip the junta allowed the Brazilian professor to make to the country in four years.<br><br>Pinheiro said he would give as complete an accounting as possible to the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva on Dec. 11.<br><br>Myanmar's military government has said 10 people were killed when troops opened fire on crowds of peaceful protesters in late September. Diplomats and dissidents, however, said the death toll was much higher.<br><br>Pinheiro said the authorities gave him post-mortem reports on 14 people whose bodies had been sent from Yangon General Hospital to be cremated. He said the 15th known fatality in the crackdown was Japanese journalist Kenji Nagai, who was shot dead by security forces.<br><br>Pinheiro was allowed to meet with several prominent political prisoners at Yangon's infamous Insein Prison during his trip. He described the facility, which holds about 10,000 prisoners, as being "old and overcrowded."<br><br>The government has said it detained almost 3,000 people during crackdown and that most of them have been released, but many prominent political activists remain in custody.<br><br><a href="http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/M/MYANMAR?SITE=MOSTP&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT" rel="nofollow">http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/M/MYANMAR?SITE=MOSTP&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT</a></div>
