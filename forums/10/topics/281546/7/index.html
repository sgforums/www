Suryanarayana<br><br>SINGAPORE: In a politically significant intervention, Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, who chairs the Association of South East Asian Nations that includes Myanmar, described the unfolding situation there as Â“very graveÂ” indeed. Mr. Lee began consulting other ASEAN leaders, as the forum Â“could not credibly remain silent or uninvolved in this matter.Â”<br><br>Singapore called upon the military junta to Â“grantÂ” the U.N. envoy Ibrahim Gambari Â“full access to all playersÂ” relevant to a peaceful resolution of the current Â“situation.Â”<br><br>A spokesman of Nobel Peace Laureate Aung San Suu KyiÂ’s National League for Democracy, Win Hlaing, told The Hindu over telephone from the Thailand-Myanmar border that the junta, styled the Peace and Development Council (SPDC), was believed to have moved Ms. Suu Kyi to Insein prison from her Yangon residence where she was being held in detention for years.<br><br>But there was no independent confirmation of any such development. Ms. Suu Kyi had silently greeted hundreds of marching monks as they filed past her residence last Saturday when the police, in a rare gesture, allowed them access to her doorstep.<br><br>National Council of the Union of Burma spokesman Soe Aung told The Hindu over telephone from Bangkok that the crackdown could lead to another Â“bloodbathÂ” as in 1988. He said the leaders of the latest movement were looking towards democratic powers like India to prevent any such denouement yet again.<br><br><a href="http://www.hindu.com/2007/09/28/stories/2007092863491600.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.hindu.com/2007/09/28/stories/2007092863491600.htm</a><br>----------------------<br>BBC News<br><br>China, one of Burma's main allies, has urged all parties to "maintain restraint", but has refused to condemn the junta.<br><br>The Burmese authorities have bowed to international pressure and agreed to let UN special envoy Ibrahim Gambari visit the country.<br><br>UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Louise Arbour has warned Burma's leaders they could face prosecution for the violence.<br><br>Meanwhile, Japan said it would make an official protest over the death in Rangoon of Kenji Nagai, a video journalist for Tokyo-based news agency APF News.<br><br>Meeting in New York, foreign ministers from Asean (the Association of South East Asian Nations) took the Burmese representative to task over the violence.<br><br>Singaporean Foreign Minister George Yeo said Asean politicians had met and "expressed their revulsion to (Burmese) Foreign Minister Nyan Win over reports that the demonstrations in (Burma) are being suppressed by violent force and that there's been a number of fatalities".<br><br>BBC United Nations correspondent Laura Trevelyan says Asean members do not usually interfere in each other's internal affairs but the group is too embarrassed to ignore the world focus on what is happening on its doorstep.<br><br><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7017369.stm" rel="nofollow">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7017369.stm</a></div>

Shaolin monks did rescue the Prince of Qin, Li Shimin, who was in captivity.<br><br><blockquote><a href="http://ezine.kungfumagazine.com/magazine/article.php?article=90" rel="nofollow">http://ezine.kungfumagazine.com/magazine/article.php?article=90</a><br><br>13 Monks Rescue the Tang Emperor<br><br>As Shaolin Temple became more economically independent, it was also more tied politically to the government, a situation which reached its apex in 621 of the late Sui Dynasty. The Prince of Qin, Li Shimin, was leading the Tang army in a bitter battle in the Songshan mountain region against Sui General Wang Shicong. Li Shimin was taken captive after several days of fighting, and the Tang army defeated. They sent a desperate message to Shaolin Temple asking for help. The Temple's monks, resentful of Wang Shicong for taking their land, sent 13 monks to the aid of the prince. Headed by fighting monks Tan Zong, Zhi Chao and Hui Yang, they came with their cudgels and ambushed the Sui army, defeating them, capturing Wang Shicong's nephew and freeing Li Shimin. Li went on to ascend the throne becoming the Emperor of Tang, and he rewarded the monks with 40 hectares of land and other privileges. </blockquote></div>

The government initially responded with arrests, detentions, and excessive force resulting in some deaths.<br><br>The demonstrations of 1988 culminated in a massive nation-wide show of People Power on August 8 in which hundreds of thousands of people marched to demand a change in government. These peaceful demonstrations were violently crushed by army troops who fired relentlessly on the unarmed crowds in Rangoon and other cities killing more than 10,000 student, civilian and Buddhist monk protesters throughout the country.

I would love to dwell deeper into what you are actually thinking.<br><br>Firstly, you mentioned that it is fundamental human nature to defend what is theirs, but does it make it right fundamentally itself? Do I have the right to kill another just because they encroach upon my property? What you are saying is that use of extreme violence is acceptable. So are you saying cases of domestic violence should be accepted since men are fundamentally more violent and brutal since the stoneage times? This is the primal instinct within us am I not wrong?<br><br>Is it human nature to kill without qualms? I hope thousands of years of civilisation has not taught us that human lives are to be taken lightly.<br><br>You have a warped sense of justice, seeking address for the perpetrators of injustice. Do you know about the acts of abuses against human rights within the country itself? Should you be actually residing amongst such horrors, amidst such repression, it is not right to want to right things?</div>
