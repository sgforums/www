              <p>Dear forum users,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is perhaps now common knowledge that Dr Ong Chit Chung's constitutency is now taken care of by the other MPs in Jurong GRC.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I had been appealing for a Lift Upgrading Program for my wheelchair bound mum and ailing dad for the last 3 years but to no vaild. The most irriating thing is that half the blocks surrounding my piteous block have gotten their lifts.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I'm not a very good speaker online, but 3 years of getting Jurong Town Council's attention to my parents' plight has really placed questions into my mind about governance in Singapore and whether those people in administration actually understand people really do get very upset and our lives are very badly affected when planning goes bad for us and worse, no news when appeals are made.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My mum had depression when she could not walk. My dad was okay, until he lost his ability to walk by himself and now also need people to monitor his movement, especially on steps.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have to literally carry my mum in her wheelchair with my maid when we need to move out of our flat to see doctors at the polyclinic or hospital- imagine 2 ladies hauling an old lady. I hated myself to bits when I accidentally had an accident with my mum where she injured her urinary tract. Anyone looking at the way we carry her will agree that it is a dangerous adventure whenever we have to do it ourselves.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Here's the history of my appeal.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>29-11-2006 - Email Appeal made after not getting any answer on LUP timing from the MPS in the early part of 2006. They offered help, but it is cold comfort that it is the JTC worker who is forced to attend to us on Sundays when my mum wants to go church to lift her spirits. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4-12-2006 - General Manager replied that they understand my situation and will put up my block for nomination within JTC.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>31-1-2007 - email again to ask season of nomination</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>31-1-2007 - General Manager replied to say it will only happen in the first quarter of the year. So I waited.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3rd quarter of 2007 - my father contracted bacterial infection and almost lost his life. He managed to recover but need assistance in walking.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>end of 2007 - I went to the Bukit Batok Branch Office to ask about any nomination for my block to get LUP. It is now more urgent. Both parents really need a lift. Lady at counter checked and said there was none. Appalled that appeal at MPS and emails did not seemed to work. 'Officially' put on record to Branch Office that I want to appeal for LUP</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A JTC called a week after to 'secretly' tell me that my block will get a high chance of getting LUP. I decided to wait.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Sept 2008 - Saw another block next to mine getting LUP. No notice pasted at my block. Jaded. Hurted.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Sending email now to the General Manager again and going to go to the MPS tomorrow.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I don't know why I am still doing this, my parents do not want to move out and I'm trying so hard to get something I know will help my parents alot. Dr Ong not being around anymore makes me feel even more jaded with this whole "MP will listen to you, and will send white-money when your parents pass away, but will not give you a lift even when you can pay for it."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I know perhaps I am ridiculously naive in this whole appeal process, but just to share, perhaps some of the criticisms against the current form of governance in our country holds water.</p>

              <p>If only the ministerial pay rise was never implemented, your parents, both of them, would probably be enjoying floor-to-floor lifts now.</p>
              <p>If only our MPs would look beyond their over-flowing purses.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>In any case, I hope you get your lifts soon.</p>
              <p>It's funny how the media never gets documentaries like this done. Oh, but then again, our media is state-run, isn't it?</p>
