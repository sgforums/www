              <p>I believe that when taxpayer dollars are used, they should support the things produced here at home," Democratic Sen. Byron Dorgan, author of one of the provisions, said in a statement.</p>
              <p>Many analysts say the measures reflect the interests of small sectors over the larger economy, which could suffer from reduced trade and higher steel prices.</p>
              <p>"The result, according to my calculations, is that the U.S. will lose more jobs than it will gain," said Gary Hufbauer, an economist with the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a Washington think tank. "We are going to poison the wells of world commerce if we do this."</p>

              <p>during the 1998 asian financial crisis, some people ever asked will currency attacks happen in USD?  At that time when USD as safe haven and asian currencies were dumped like shit, it was hard to believe that USD might have asia style sell-off.</p>
              <p>11 years later in 2009, with a new president who is bent on pushing up the US economy while federal debt is hitting the legal limit, a USD might just happen.</p>
              <p>The irony is S$ might have to track USD down since S$ tracks a basket of trade weighted currencies. </p>

              <p>in fact i dont think we should worried too much about nationalisation of the USA banks and financial institution. the pain will last for few years. when the economy recovers, the USA can then again start selling the banking shares to the resurgent hedge funds, SWF and potential investors.</p>

              <p><br>to get the financial insitution out of the blue, you need a total reengineering ie a total revamp, kick out all the MDs and CEOs who runs the company into a bad shape, aren't CEOs responsible for their insitution/corporation downfall?? But sad to say, US govt is not doing this, the CEOs went to congress and said that the workers are absorbing high paid and refuse to get wage cut due to strong unions, (GM per worker gross US$75 per day comparing to toyota US$43 per day). The workers' unions went to Congress and tell the govt that CEOs are getting high bonus and paid...so which is which, the ding dong story will go on and on.....unlike Japanese or Korean who emphasized on how to cut cost together and get out of this bad state fast, so i guess the Asian markets will recover faster than the US.</p>

              <p>it is stupid to ever consider striking USA.</p>
              <p>they will be the big bro of the world before and after the crisis. there is simply no alternative.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>in fact i dont think we should worried too much about nationalisation of the USA banks and financial institution. the pain will last for few years. when the economy recovers, the USA can then again start selling the banking shares to the resurgent hedge funds, SWF and potential investors.</p>

              <p>It is predicted the the economy will recover within the next 5 quarters, but it will be a different economy, and US of A will definitely lose it share of the market whereby China or perhap Arabs states and Russian or even Jpn and korea could be the next super economy powerhouse, farewell USA.</p>

              <p><br>i will rather said credit power than spending power. And because of the credit power, the financial system is in chaos once the credibility of credit lost it power, if it is to be spending power, i think USA will be begger now.</p>

              <p>on paper they are bankrupt. but in real, if they bankrupt, the world will be bankrupt. this is a can of worms no one in the world would like to see. Just like PAP.</p>

              <p>USA will remain dominate of the world market. the financial institution could be down but not for long, american still has lotsa world famous brands. like you said. they will re-invent and come out strong again.</p>
