              <p><strong>... I believe it would turned out that the <span style="color: #ff0000;">motorist, SHOULD have kept a proper look out for pedestrians</span> if it was just an ordinary public member who hit Wrixen... </strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>================================</p>
              <p><strong>Top Iras official not to blame for fatal crash  <br> Lee Seng Giap <br>Wed, Jun 04, 2008<br>The Straits Times  <br></strong><br>A TOP civil servant whose car hit a Victoria School student along Marine Parade Road in October last year was yesterday cleared of criminal negligence in the fatal accident.</p>
              <p>State Coroner Victor Yeo came round to this view following testimony by several witnesses at the inquiry into the death of Secondary 4 student Wrixon Chew Teck Cheng, 16, who died six days after the accident.</p>
              <p>The driver of the car was Ms Chin Li Fen, 48, an Assistant Commissioner of the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (Iras). Named as a potential defendant at the inquiry, she elected to remain silent.</p>
              <p>One witness, airline pilot Lars Anders Schoden, 42, said the lights for pedestrians to cross were clearly red at the time of impact.</p>
              <p>The court heard that after a graduation ceremony at school that day, Wrixon and two schoolmates headed for a tuition class. But as they were about to board a bus, he received a call to return to school to pick up a pen.</p>
              <p>His schoolmate Arthur Lim Wei Quan, 16, walked back to school with him. As they were on the pedestrian crossing, the green man signal started flashing, said Arthur, who was a little ahead of his friend.</p>
              <p>As they stood on the divider, however, Wrixon showed him a paper plate on which had been written well wishes by his schoolmates, and decided to pass it back to their friend at the bus stop.</p>
              <p>He was hit by Ms Chin's car as he ran diagonally across the road.</p>
              <p>Coroner Yeo, returning an open verdict, said evidence suggested that <span style="color: #ff0000;">Wrixon could have failed to keep a proper lookout for oncoming vehicles.</span></p>

              <p>some? i think at 95% of the pedestrians don't bother to check clear before crossing minor roads, entrance and exit of car parks. and the parents of children don't even teach them to check.</p>
              <p>i don't remember experiencing that when i was young. all my elders never failed to ask me to watch out for vehicles while crossing.</p>

              <p>and it was at a traffic light junction.. with the green light on.. im 100% sure there's something called "anticipating the traffic light".. when approaching the green light, u are supposed to reduce speed in case it turns yellow.. during TP if u fail to do this its 8pts straight..</p>
              <p>and as the article wrote, the boys were standing at the divider, not like behind some cars or vans and blocked from the driver's view and rushing out all of a sudden..  in this case the driver cannot say she failed to see them, and hence were unable to anticipate their actions..</p>

              <p>i believe that civil servant was speeding, any vehicle reaching a pedestrian crossing, especially near school, should slow down and put their foot on the brake pedal.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When you slow down, the reaction to evade and brake will be faster, even if you knock down a kid of that age, most likely he/she may get an injury, but to die mean that the impact is strong, therefore she had failed to slow down and also fail to emergency brake.</p>

              <p>What would you suggest to be a safe speed? Even car accidents (between cars) can happen at less than 40km/h, and I have pictures to show how badly damaged a car could be at that speed. Thus, what else can we expect of a car hitting a human at that speed?</p>
              <p>Anyway the article is still too vague for us to give any summary judgement. Any one of us can easily give reasons why she is in the wrong, but any one of us could also easily give reasons why it could be unavoidable. Either way, all are merely speculations.</p>
              <p>But no matter what, she will still have to bear the burden of having killed a fellow human being for the rest of her life.</p>

              <p>When his friend was crossing the road, the green man signal was flashing but the pilot said that it was clearly red at the time of impact.</p>
              <p>The traffic light would have been red and had just turned green.  Here was a car that hit the student and flung him 10 m away as reported in ST, 24 April 2008. The evidence suggested that she was anticipating that the light would have turned green by the time her car reached the traffic junction and so did not slow down. Was she not driving at unsafe speed?</p>
              <p>Anyway it's a kangaroo court. Don't expect much fairness. The headline says <strong>Top Iras official not to blame for fatal
