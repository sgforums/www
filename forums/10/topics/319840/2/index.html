              <p>An article in the new paper today (Mon 24/01/2005). Now you be the judge.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>US MILLIONAIRE IN CAR ACCIDENT AT SCOTTS ROAD<br> Driver ordered to pay $2m<br> <br> THE jogger <strong>may have run right across the yellow traffic box
                                      junction</strong> outside Goodwood Park Hotel along Scotts Road <strong>and
                                      disregarded the pedestrian crossings.</strong><br> <br> Still, the Singapore driver who hit and killed him had to bear 45
                                      per cent of the blame for the accident, the court found.<br> <br> It turned out that the jogger was Mr Henry Adolphus Lassiter, 48,
                                      an <span style="color: red;">American self-made millionaire</span> who had a thriving technology company and assets worth nearly $40
                                      million at the time of his death.<br> <br> Now the Singapore driver, Madam To Keng Lam, a housewife, has been
                                      ordered by the Singapore High Court to pay the jogger's widow, Mrs
                                      Ann Masters Lassiter, US$1.3 million ($2.1 million), for the loss
                                      of her husband's support.<br> <br> WORTH MILLIONS<br> <br> Mr Lassiter was jogging near the hotel where he was staying when
                                      the accident happened on the morning of May 9, 1994. Madam To was
                                      driving her son to school at about 6.30am. Her son was then in
                                      Secondary 2 at Monk's Hill Secondary.<br> <br> <span style="color: red;">The traffic lights were in Madam To's
                                      favour</span>. She was driving past the junction of Scotts
                                      Road/Stevens Road and Draycott Drive, when he ran across the yellow
                                      box junction in front of her car.<br> <br> In her affidavit, she said, she jammed her brakes but could not
                                      stop in time.<br> <br> He flew onto the car bonnet and hit his head on the windscreen,
                                      cracking it, before he landed on the road.<br> <br> He died from serious head injuries on the spot.<br> <br> Mr Lassiter was in Singapore on a business trip.<br> <br> He was then running a real estate company and a technology start-up
                                      which was making millions of dollars.<br> <br> His estate was valued at about US$39 million, and his annual pay in
                                      the year before he died, was said to be about US$479,000.<br> <br> Shortly after the accident, his widow, Mrs Ann Masters Lassiter,
                                      who lives in Georgia in the US, sued Madam To for negligence,
                                      claiming the loss of her husband's support and loss of inheritance
                                      for herself and four of their daughters, who were then between 17
                                      and 26 years old .<br> <br> After which began a long-drawn battle over Mr Lassiter's financial
                                      worth and assets, to determine exactly how much money Madam To has
                                      to pay Mrs Lassiter.<br> <br> On Jan 10 , Justice Woo Bih Li ruled that Madam To, alias Jeanette
                                      Toh, has to pay his widow, Mrs Ann Masters Lassiter US$130,000 a
                                      year, over 10 years, for the loss of her husband's support.<br> <br> FINANCIAL TANGLE<br> <br> He husband was an entrepreneur and while his property and
                                      technology businesses were taking off, the family 'lived in meagre
                                      circumstances as he re-invested the money in business.'<br> <br> So he paid for the family's expenses, but liquidity was a problem
                                      as his money was tied up in his company and properties.<br> <br> In her affidavit to the court, Mrs Lassiter said: 'The consequence
                                      of Henry's unanticipated death have been economically disastrous
                                      for my daughters and me in many ways.'<br> <br> Looking at her annual expenses, including her daughters' school
                                      fees, Justice Woo decided that she should be given US$130,000 a
                                      year.<br> <br> But for how many years?<br> <br> Justice Woo said: 'In view of (Mr Lassiter's) good health and
                                      working habits as well as his very ambitious character,
                                      <span style="color: red;">it was likely that he would have worked
                                      to 70 years old. He was killed when he was 48 years old...'<br> <br> As such, Justice Woo decided that it was 'fair' for the driver to
                                      provide for Mrs Lassiter for 10 years.</span><br> Mrs Lassiter, who lives in the US, could not be reached for comment
                                      while Madam To, who lives in Mount Echo Park off Tanglin Road,
                                      declined to comment through her lawyer.</p>

              <p>When his friend was crossing the road, the green man signal was
                  flashing but the pilot said that it was clearly red at the time of

              <p>The traffic light would have been red and had just turned
                  green.  Here was a car that hit the student and flung him 10 m
                  away as reported in ST, 24 April 2008. The evidence suggested that
                  she was anticipating that the light would have turned green by the
                  time her car reached the traffic junction and so did not slow down.
                  Was she not driving at unsafe speed?</p>
              <p>Anyway it's a kangaroo court. Don't expect much fairness. The

              <p>Well, the article also suggests that he ran diagonally across the road. Which pedestrian crossing around Marine Parade cuts diagonally across? The car could have been planning to slow down before the pedestrian crossing, and not expect that the student would cut <span style="text-decoration: underline;">diagonally</span>. It could be a sudden motion. Again, what would you think would be a safe speed, that if you hit a human, you will not be flung 10m? Do you really think 10m is very far? A normal adult giving you a very hard push can easily push you back by 2 metres or more. We are now talking about a car vs a human. So how? Travel at 10km/h best for you along the whole stretch of road? Or 20km/h?</p>
              <p>As I have already mentioned, any one of us can easily give reasons why she is in the
                                          wrong, but any one of us could also easily give reasons why it
                                          could be unavoidable.</p>
              <p>I'm not saying that she should or should not be guilty. What I mean is that this article doesn't offer sufficient information.</p>

              <p>No one is going to specify that x mph is safe speed. In a highway, high speed is actually the preferable safe speed because it's purpose is to ease congestion(not ERP) and to save time for road travellers.</p>
              <p>As the definition states, it's the speed that allows a  driver sufficient time to take action to avoid an accident (and at sea, to avoid a collision. In the air, it's about altitute). It also imply that the distance must be taken into consideration when assessing safe speed.</p>
              <p>As a defendant, she chose to remain silent. Was she talking over a HP or did she jammed on the brakes and left tire marks on the road? How do the readers know that the judge is unbiased when he ruled in favour of the defendant?</p>
              <p>I wish that the victim's family has the means to engage a lawyer to seek at least monetary compensation. Coming from a good school, the son could have become a doctor if he grew up and live to be 100 years old as medicine is progressing with time.</p>
              <p>Ah, but this is only a dream  if the victim did not come from a prominent family.</p>

              I don't know if this is true. A driving instructor once told me that Sg's traffic laws were not favourable to drivers esp if it involved hitting on someone. Drivers were expected to drive with caution and thus able to stop on time to avoid knocking on anyone any time and under whatever circumstances. Drivers would be culpable even in situation one least expect like a small kid dashing out from nowhere.
              
              Maybe now with the ft and elite rules have changed.

              <p>US MILLIONAIRE IN CAR ACCIDENT AT SCOTTS ROAD<br> Driver ordered to pay $2m<br> <br> THE jogger <strong>may have run right across the yellow traffic box
              junction</strong> outside Goodwood Park Hotel along Scotts Road
              <strong>and disregarded the pedestrian crossings.</strong><br> <br> Still, the Singapore driver who hit and killed him had to bear 45
              per cent of the blame for the accident, the court found.<br> <br> It turned out that the jogger was Mr Henry Adolphus Lassiter, 48,
              an <span style="color: red;">American self-made millionaire</span> who had a thriving technology company and assets worth nearly $40
              million at the time of his death.<br> <br> Now the Singapore driver, Madam To Keng Lam, a housewife, has been
              ordered by the Singapore High Court to pay the jogger's widow, Mrs
              Ann Masters Lassiter, US$1.3 million ($2.1 million), for the loss
              of her husband's support.<br> <br> WORTH MILLIONS<br> <br> Mr Lassiter was jogging near the hotel where he was staying when
              the accident happened on the morning of May 9, 1994. Madam To was
              driving her son to school at about 6.30am. Her son was then in
              Secondary 2 at Monk's Hill Secondary.<br> <br> <span style="color: red;">The traffic lights were in Madam To's
              favour</span>. She was driving past the junction of Scotts
              Road/Stevens Road and Draycott Drive, when he ran across the yellow
              box junction in front of her car.<br> <br> In her affidavit, she said, she jammed her brakes but could not
              stop in time.<br> <br> He flew onto the car bonnet and hit his head on the windscreen,
              cracking it, before he landed on the road.<br> <br> He died from serious head injuries on the spot.<br> <br> Mr Lassiter was in Singapore on a business trip.<br> <br> He was then running a real estate company and a technology start-up
              which was making millions of dollars.<br> <br> His estate was valued at about US$39 million, and his annual pay in
              the year before he died, was said to be about US$479,000.<br> <br> Shortly after the accident, his widow, Mrs Ann Masters Lassiter,
              who lives in Georgia in the US, sued Madam To for negligence,
              claiming the loss of her husband's support and loss of inheritance
              for herself and four of their daughters, who were then between 17
              and 26 years old .<br> <br> After which began a long-drawn battle over Mr Lassiter's financial
              worth and assets, to determine exactly how much money Madam To has
              to pay Mrs Lassiter.<br> <br> On Jan 10 , Justice Woo Bih Li ruled that Madam To, alias Jeanette
              Toh, has to pay his widow, Mrs Ann Masters Lassiter US$130,000 a
              year, over 10 years, for the loss of her husband's support.<br> <br> FINANCIAL TANGLE<br> <br> He husband was an entrepreneur and while his property and
              technology businesses were taking off, the family 'lived in meagre
              circumstances as he re-invested the money in business.'<br> <br> So he paid for the family's expenses, but liquidity was a problem
              as his money was tied up in his company and properties.<br> <br> In her affidavit to the court, Mrs Lassiter said: 'The consequence
              of Henry's unanticipated death have been economically disastrous
              for my daughters and me in many ways.'<br> <br> Looking at her annual expenses, including her daughters' school
              fees, Justice Woo decided that she should be given US$130,000 a
              year.<br> <br> But for how many years?<br> <br> Justice Woo said: 'In view of (Mr Lassiter's) good health and
              working habits as well as his very ambitious character,
              <span style="color: red;">it was likely that he would have worked
              to 70 years old. He was killed when he was 48 years old...'<br> <br> As such, Justice Woo decided that it was 'fair' for the driver to
              provide for Mrs Lassiter for 10 years.</span><br> Mrs Lassiter, who lives in the US, could not be reached for comment
              while Madam To, who lives in Mount Echo Park off Tanglin Road,
              declined to comment through her lawyer.</p>

              year, over 10 years, for the loss of her husband's support.<br> <br> FINANCIAL TANGLE<br> <br> He husband was an entrepreneur and while his property and
              technology businesses were taking off, the family 'lived in meagre
              circumstances as he re-invested the money in business.'<br> <br> So he paid for the family's expenses, but liquidity was a problem
              as his money was tied up in his company and properties.<br> <br> In her affidavit to the court, Mrs Lassiter said: 'The consequence
              of Henry's unanticipated death have been economically disastrous
              for my daughters and me in many ways.'<br> <br> Looking at her annual expenses, including her daughters' school
              fees, Justice Woo decided that she should be given US$130,000 a
              year.<br> <br> But for how many years?<br> <br> Justice Woo said: 'In view of (Mr Lassiter's) good health and
              working habits as well as his very ambitious character,
              <span style="color: red;">it was likely that he would have worked
              to 70 years old. He was killed when he was 48 years old...'<br> <br> As such, Justice Woo decided that it was 'fair' for the driver to
              provide for Mrs Lassiter for 10 years.</span><br> Mrs Lassiter, who lives in the US, could not be reached for comment
              while Madam To, who lives in Mount Echo Park off Tanglin Road,
              declined to comment through her lawyer.</p>
