(http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/rankorder/2127rank.html).<br>-	This means that Singaporeans are not procreating- a worrying trend because this means that either Singapore imports citizensÂ… or else the Singaporean will soon be extinct with the population reduced by half every generation!-  who then will pay taxes?<br>-	Stress, worries about hunger/ poverty plagues every parent to be&gt; who will pay if my child is abnormal/ cannot study- is abortion a solution?<br>-	A high number of abortions/ divorces only points to a society that is mentally unwell and morally decadentÂ…<br>-<br>3)	Unfair remuneration:<br>-	Singapore Prime Minister US$1,100,000 (S$1,958,000)<br>-	But SGporeans remain poor: http://www.singaporedemocrat.org/poverty.html<br>-	Households with monthly incomes of less than $3,000 was 40 percent in 1998 but increased to 42 percent in 1999.<br>-	If assumed that the median income/ person could be $3k, then SG PM earns &gt;54x what the average family might earn in 1 yr.<br>-<br>4)	Â–Property in SG is overvalued:<br>-	Because the greedy PAP govt sold property at high prices to SGporeans: Ave HDB costs $400K +- this is equivalent to 11+yearÂ’s salary of the 42th % family in SG: and what about the high costs of living? Â– no wonder SGporeans are indebted to the govt.<br>-	Note that property tax is NOT progressive in SG as well as the rampant upgrading schemes? : this is the PAPÂ’s way of covering up for overpricing of property in the 80/ 90Â’s- they donÂ’t want property prices to fall before the elections.<br>-	The fact that estate duty is tax exempt S$9M but other assets are exempt  up to $600K is indeed lop-sided- a cover up for HDBÂ’s over pricing of HDB flats to Singaporeans.<br>(http://groups.google.com.sg/group/soc.culture.singapore/msg/1a6b70584a7cd63e)<br>-	In 2004 37,823 households could not afford to buy their own flats or rent homes in the open market.<br>-<br>5)	Poverty in Singapore:<br>-	http://www.singaporedemocrat.org/poverty.html<br>-<br><br></div>

You very cute sia.<br><br>If child is abnormal, is the parents who wants it. They have kids late, and as women grows older, the chance of having abnormal kids is getting higher. Nothing to do with PAP.<br><br>Singapore, right from the start, is dominated by foreign citizens, if you study our history well. High abortion rates also nothing to do with government. We have been taught moral education since young and before abortions, you will be shown a video of the disadvantages of abortions. The choice still lies with us. You can't blame the PAP for that.<br><br>Think of better points next time.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Cmon man.. There are things that are better in Singapore also, ya know.. Our tax rate is at 5% GST. If you're going to live in Europe, taxes can even go up to 40% of your salary. The standard of living, although increasing rapidly, is still lower than some other countries too. And if Singapore's governance wasn't good, we wouldn't be where we are in a mere 35 years, from a rural port village to a cosmopolitan mega-city. That was because of good visioneries such as our Prime Ministers and so, Singapore's governance is pretty much alright.

It is not that the government needs to have more monies in increasing such fees and charges. It is running a system like the NKF only to benefit either in more extravagant spending on the 7 wonders or increasing the salaries and bonuses of government ministers and civil servants like the NKF CEO has done.<br><br>People are not happy with such high level of surpluses and reserves as expressed in NKF reactions to revelations of high reserves and extravagance.<br><br>If reserves are used to create jobs or lessen cost burden in medical or as temporary unemployments, that will be supportable. But reserves are increasingly being used to increase spending on extravagance and beneifting the ministers' salaries etc. These are all major concerns of citizens.<br><br>These are issues and problems thrown up in the NKF saga.

Many leaders have passed away who were at first invincible due to military powers like Qin Shi Huang, Hitler, Suharto, Sadam, Macos..Over time what were wrong will always be wrong. There will be truths, citizens' sense of values and social equity and call of judgment.<br><br>Right or wrong it is for people and then eventually history to judge not imposed top-down through books written by oneself or merely media hypes or self-adulation, Good-looking justifications and  presentation alone will be last. Powerful propaganda will not last. True worth last because it stays in the heart and mind of citizens much longer.<br></div>
