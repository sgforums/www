              <p>DPM Wong is the head of MOHA and his department has made a huge mistake which potentially could cause Singapore billions of dollars if Mas Selamat managed to escape and form a new terrorist group to blow up Singapore key installation or tourist attractions such as Sentosa IR or Singapore Flywheel.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As of now, his department's mistake has already caused tax payer millions of dollar in security cost, traffic jams, tourists arrival and most of all the reputation of Singapore police force.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Do you think it is only fair that DPM Wong take a pay cut or step down as DPM and Minister of MOHA.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Honestly, I think I have the right to not feel comfortable for someone like Wong to be our DPM.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>If the government is to be believed, Mas Selamat is potentially one of the most dangerous minds in Singapore and yet is held in one of the least secured detention facility. The home ministry is at fault for allowing him to escape and not having found a way to lock him away in a more secure facility. One can argue that he is not directly at fault but i think we can say that he is not good enough as he has not covered this loophole. I think he should come out and admit that and penalise himself at some point of time within this year. Relinquishing his position will be the most apt. If he does not, I'm sorry to say he has to go and people might just vote him out in favour of the opposition. We cannot be led by a man with no honour.</p></div>

              <p>If this happens to a minister in Japan or Korea, he will immediate hold a press conference and sincerely apologize to the public and announced he will step down from his post.  He will begs the public to give him a chance to redeem his mistake by bringing back the fugitive, before he resigns.  This is call MAN.</p>
              <p>Let's see what the government ministers are made up of.  And the quality of man PAP chooses.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>It has been speculated that Ho Peng Kee is the younger brother of Ho Ching.</p>
              <p>Both Ho Peng Kee and Ho Ching studied at National Junior College.</p>
              <p>Ho Ching is 1 year older than Ho Peng Kee.</p>
              <p><em>"Even her age is considered off limits. A Temasek spokesman was unwilling to reveal her age or date of birth, although a Temasek bond document in 2005 said she was 52." <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ho Peng Kee's birthdate is 09.05.1954.</span></em></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">I don't understand why all the secrecy.</span></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Ho Ching was married to LHL in 1985, subsequently Ho Peng Kee stood for elections in 1991 as MP for Sembawang.</p>
              <p>In 1993, he was appointed Parliamentary Secretary (Ministry of Law and Ministry of Home Affairs)</p>
              <p>His portfolio has never been re-shuffled, he is now the Senior Minister of State (Ministry of Law and Ministry of Home Affairs).</p>

              <p>its really quite ironic that aft the most disgraceful incident in s'pore national security in recent years, there is a army n police career fair at both suntec n marina sq. i jus wonder r those ppl proud of manning those booths.</p>
              <p>oh btw, dont expect any quitting or pay cut or watever crap, cos birds of the same feathers flock tgt, jus cover one another backside. at most those guards n their superiors on duty that day count themselves unlucky, rank remain the same till they retire. n dont even think abt bonus. they will b made the ultimate scapegoats. not the Ministers.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>It has been speculated that Ho Peng Kee is the younger brother of Ho Ching.</p>
              <p>Both Ho Peng Kee and Ho Ching studied at National Junior College.</p>
              <p>Ho Ching is 1 year older than Ho Peng Kee.</p>
              <p><em>"Even her age is considered off limits. A Temasek spokesman was unwilling to reveal her age or date of birth, although a Temasek bond document in 2005 said she was 52." <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ho Peng Kee's birthdate is 09.05.1954.</span></em></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">I don't understand why all the secrecy.</span></p>

              <p>Ho Ching was married to LHL in 1985, subsequently Ho Peng Kee stood for elections in 1991 as MP for Sembawang.</p>
              <p>In 1993, he was appointed Parliamentary Secretary (Ministry of Law and Ministry of Home Affairs)</p>
              <p>His portfolio has never been re-shuffled, he is now the Senior Minister of State (Ministry of Law and Ministry of Home Affairs).</p>

              <p>yeah man, even as students we are escorted. he being a terror king, should be watched even while shitting or masturbating. this is madness. and just like the other singaporeans, it is only fair that we know what happened. this is our country. but right now what we gotta do is find that bugger and interrogation will do it. now is not the time for the blame game. the entire country's sole goal is the nail that bugger and bring him straight to hell. and then settle the politics later.</p>
              <p>i don't believe it is WKS's fault. he is at the very top. what the hell can he do? from above, the ground is blur. if heads should roll, it will be the chief and all his men at the detention centre. what kinda SOP they have in place, the kind of security they have etc. it's not WKS's fault ultimately. it is very unfair to him if the public were to only point fingers at him. as i said, if heads should roll, it will be the officers at the detention centre.</p>

              <p><br>raising their pay on hard times may sound damn bad. but there's a reason for it. singapore is facing a serious problem of brain-drain. our top earners and whizkids are leaving us. we can't allow foreign talent in this field yes? so to attract top earners, incentives have to be in place. 1) to attract the potential ministers 2) to let the ministers focus and concentrate on their jobs without worrying about their other businesses.</p>
              <p>so i feel as a normal average singaporean, it is pretty sound and fair that their salary increases. ministerial work is tough. for us, we do work, go home and rest. they do work, go home, den do more work, sleep also must think. it is madness. maybe if you read the memoirs of lee kuan yew, you'll get a better picture of the life of politicians who have 4million over people to govern and please, and another billion of ppl worldwide to please too. they have pressure to succeed cuz their names are at stake. all eyes are on them. and they know ppl are quick to point to the leader and blame them as proven in history. and i'm juz barely touching the surface of it all. don't be quick to judge me, i'm only a student at a polytechnic and there, we dun haf national education. i'm not here to make enemies or make a statement about who is right and wrong. what i'm saying is from my own analysis and understanding. it is a personal view. i think, it is really very unfair to underestimate their job load. running a country is a hell lot harder than running a company. a CEO only gotta care for the company's business and a thousand employees. but a minister?</p>
              <p>even S.R. Nathan wants out from politics. but he can't cuz nobody adequate enough wants to replace him. talent is rare, and many are leaving for the States. we have to retain them. pay rise is only a little bit of what we can do to attract good people to govern our affairs.</p>
              <p>and if we wanna argue on this, it will never end. until we are able to see firsthand how the life of a minister in today's singapore context is like...we will always be assuming and thinking "walao, government pay rise sial, overpaid people. why nobody give me a million dollar pay rise too?"</p>
              <p>what say you people? just cut them some slack. our lives are practically in their hands. so far they are not too bad right? if you guys want a change of government, who can we turn to? oppositions? you kidding me? the last time an opposition party governed singapore, we had riots and if i'm not wrong embezzlements within the governmental body itself. NKF and shincorp is nothing compared to having your own government stealing your money. there's a price to pay, no system is entirely good. there are pros and cons, and right now...we've got the best deal as of yet.</p>
              <p>so who can we turn to if not for PAP?</p>
