              Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with its Cambodian counterpart to
              combat transnational crime.<br> <br> The MOU was signed by Deputy Prime Minister Wong Kan Seng and
              Cambodian Deputy Prime Minister and Interior Minister Sar Kheng in
              Phnom Penh on Thursday.<br> <br> The agreement provides a framework to better understand the
              challenges of combating transnational crime. It also signals closer
              bilateral cooperation in the exchange of expertise and
              information.<br> <br> Other areas covered include terrorism, cyber crime, drug
              trafficking (narcotics and psychotropic substances) and forgery of

              <p>given my confidence in the system,</p>
              <p>i optimistically think that it will take 6 months or less to capture mas.</p>
              <p>but at the same time, i urge that foreign talents good in this aspect be brought in to save the situation. get the right people to do the job. our current people doing the job are great talents although mas still not caught and over 2 weeks has passed, we should not be given the wrong impression that they are not capable. They are. Their market value proves their worth. maybe there is not enough manpower. So , I urge more foreign talents with investigative skills be invited to be citizens so that they can handle top secrets to trace Mas down.</p>
              <p>for the sake of national security, we need more Foreign talents in investigative skills with proven track records. The nation is fully at stake.</p>

              <p>given my confidence in the system,</p>
              <p>i optimistically think that it will take 6 months or less to
              capture mas.</p>
              <p>but at the same time, i urge that foreign talents good in this
              aspect be brought in to save the situation. get the right people to
              do the job. our current people doing the job are great talents
              although mas still not caught and over 2 weeks has passed, we
              should not be given the wrong impression that they are not capable.
              They are. Their market value proves their worth. maybe there is not
              enough manpower. So , I urge more foreign talents with
              investigative skills be invited to be citizens so that they can
              handle top secrets to trace Mas down.</p>
              <p>for the sake of national security, we need more Foreign talents
              in investigative skills with proven track records. The nation is
              fully at stake.</p>

              <p><br>since FT is welcomed and those who give up entirely the citizenship are called loosers, i think i must learn from this and also cannot say i do not support FTs to run the pore.</p>
              <p>we have to be non-double-standard. else people laugh at us for incompetence.</p>
              <p>a FT is just an application away from being a citizen, generally speaking.</p>
              <p>a foreigner worker with some qualification is just an application away from being a PR, generally speaking and this means very short time is needed only.</p>
              <p>a PR is just an application away from being a citizen, generally speaking.</p>
              <p>so, i do not support double-standard that all who wants to run the pore should be allowed the chance based on the idea that the pore offers equal opportunity for all.</p>
              <p>I long to see the day. we should not not support this idea.</p>
              <p>foreigner today, citizen 'tomorrow', so-to-speak.</p>
              <p>if citizen, should deserve a shot to run the pore.</p>

              <p>The ministers don't mind about FT replacing the citizens and compete for our rice bowls, we citizens also do not mind ministers to be replaced by FTs who are cheaper and better than these highest paid ministers in the world who can screw up big things and shown not that talented that they claimed to be.</p>
