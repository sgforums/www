              <p>quite remarkable, really. Few politico parties in the wer like this long win streak.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>maybe, we should understand that it is the voters who gave the mandate. Politico parties like to have their support but its the voters who selected them and gave them power.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>so far, I can only say they made the choice which is good or bad, depending on individual.</p>

              <p>dun u think part of their coffer comes from the people itself? hoarding the cpf, tax here, tax there, and everything in between, well, i am not sure leh....</p>
              <p>keeping this amount to be pass down to the next Lee generations, tt i tend to believe.</p>
              <p>if anyone pocketed some money and emigrated as you imply, your ROI is only a fraction of what you put in.</p>

              <p>Near trillions? Maybe someone should justify their source instead of using conjectures again.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>All from punitive taxes, over-priced public necessities and housing.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>They should increase more GST, price electricity higher and charge higher for public housing.</p>

              <p>gee, i didn't know u know me so well.....dun talk abt me, talk about how the gahmen accumulated the whatever trillion $ that u so proudly approved.</p>
              <p>firstly, no one knows exactly how much the Lees have `accumulated'. what is printed is not what it seems to be. i have attorney frens working inside MAS and they told me perhaps only 3-5 ppl only knows the extend of sinkapore's wealth. no prizes for guessing who these 3-5 ppl are.</p>
              <p>u seemed perfectly fine wif yr money locked in. maybe you are wealthy to not bother, but spare a thot for the majority who struggles daily.</p>
              <p>their salary to double? i won't bet against tt too!<br>by the way, i no emigrant. sorry to dissappoint u.</p>

              <p>Sooner or later, it will become a mocking feast for our dear government with their mishandling of such an important national security matter if this drags on further. I'm pretty much getting nauseous feeling at the bottom of my stomach everday, seeing Mr Mas Selmant photo everywhere i go,. Ps: he wasn't such an eyecandy to begin with, and the haunted image of him appears almost everywhere on the bus, on the train, on the wall of my HDB, on the newspaper that i was reading just now and yet nothing concrete has been happening.</p>
