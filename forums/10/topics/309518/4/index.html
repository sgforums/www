              <p>He should definitely step down. For the PAP ministers to command such obscene salaries, they must be willing to pay the price.</p>
              <p>They like comparing themselves to the CEOs in the private sector. Well, in the real world out there, if the CEOs screw up, they are EXPECTED TO RESIGN!</p>
              <p>Since when have they become so magnanimous? I don't recall the PAP saying 'Let's not dwell on mistakes made and move on' when it was Chee Soon Juan and JBJ in the limelight. No apologies were accepted then. Apparently, that was to show how 'tough', 'uncompromising' and 'judicial' they were.</p>

              <p>MM Lee has said to the international audience that Singapore has to learn from Mas Selamat prison escape which he described as a lesson in complacency.</p>
              <p>What does he mean by such remarks "Complacency", "lesson to be learned"</p>
              <p>Does he mean such complacency was inevitable or caused by some junior guard on duty which is part and parcel of life when he chose those words "lesson of complacency".</p>
              <p>In which case it only means that he intends to cover-up of NKF with excuses which reflects on his own complacency rather than some junior prison officers' incompetence or negligence.</p>

              <p>Dont mean to point finger, but it is obvious that LHK has a hand in causing so many people infected with SARS in hospital. I cant remember the details, all I can remember is he saying the SARS is being contained while it was spreading like wild fire in the hospital.</p>

              <p>MM and PM will have to be very careful on how the deal with the situation. Since MM has the balls to say that Singapore need to pay top dollars for capable people, then I think it is only fair that our ministers are made accountable for both what they do.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Singapore is at risk of being destroyed WKS complacency . Just imagine what will happen is Mas managed to hijack a plane and crash into Changi aiport when both IRs are up and running. All flights into Changi will be diverted to KLIA and this will eventually give MAS and Malaysia the chance to replace singapore as the regional air hub serving the lucrative Kangaroo route.  </p>

              <p>Mr.MM sir, you are too quick in making a statement. If you think that mas selamat would not pose any danger if he remained at large in singapore, you should re-consider that.</p>
              <p>The fact that so many days had passed with the whole country mobilized to search for him and cannot even locate his shadow, give us enough reasons to believe that he has resources at this disposal.  Nobody can remained at large in singapore for more than a few days without being harboured.</p>
              <p>If he can get someone to buy him food, drinks and clothes, he can ask someone to get him simple components to make explosive.  He can also get in touch with terrorist network overseas via encrypted communications to get him resources.</p>
              <p>The rule of the game for a fugitive onshore and a fugitive offshore may be different.  But one thing in common.  They all pose imminent danger to the public.  To prevent a thief from getting into your house is much easier compared to prevent theft from people already in your house.</p>
