            <div class='col-md body'>As we know, the Malaysia's PM, Mahathir is being so call replaced by Adbullah yesterday on 31st October. Adbullah being the successor of Mahathir inherite many of the big project from Mahathir which he has introduced during this years. This big projects is able to prose threats to our economy even the coming years such as Airasia vs SIA and the competitions of both ports which see workers being retrenched this year. We Singapore has always regarded Malaysia as our good neighbour ever since during the 1960s with the PM Lee. However, they have always trying to find faults and disagreement with Singapore even in our right of land reclaimation and on the water talks. These problems have always been in our daily talks as on whether the countries' relationship might be worsen.<br>I think I agreed of what our government has always said that Malaysia and Singapore has always been related with each other in many ways even on our geogorical( sorry i do not kow how to spell) postion, and thus we should co operate in order to get each of us into a win win solution instead of both animal being hurted badly.<br><br>Hope all of u will be able to give me some suggestion even if the might be a small contibution as everyone counts. Thanx for reading. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In my opinion , the relationship between Singapore &amp; Malaysia will start to get better. As previous PM Mahatir has tried to find faults with Singapore and strain the relationship between the two country like the land reclaimation and water problem. Sir Adbullah would be able to understand the whole situation and should try not to go the path that Mahatir took and instead try to work with Sinapore and build a better neighbouring relationship. If Sir Abdullah insist on finding faults and problems with Singapore, it would be a different story as we would have to face another Mahatir.</div>
