I don't believe performance can be measured when there is no transparency. Lets say if a minister is getting US$10 million a year, will you still feel this is to ensure a corruption-free government?</strong></blockquote>Can performance of a Government be measured ?<br><br>The Ruling Political Party aka the Government claim that the annual economic result is an indicator of the work that THEY have done with their carefully planned policies that allow the clock work to tic-toc in sync to their plans.<br><br>Yet, when things begin to unravel - as in 1987, 1997, and 2002 - they will blamed on EXTERNAL FACTORS that are BEYOND their control.<br><br>Is it surprising that they can get things to work in a POSITVE MANNER, yet have no powers to MINIMISE the NEGATIVE effects to Singapore and Singaporeans ?<br><br>If one is to recall - during the early 1980s - the many complaints of the high CPF and high Wages from the SMEs before the 1987 crash, the Ruling Political Party aka the Government arrogantly dismissive to all these suggestions even from larger corporations and industries.<br><br>Even with three crashes to our economy, and with Committees formed, and grand statements that hooted 'NO STONES WILL BE LEFT UNTURNED' and that there will be 'NO SACRED COWS' - we were later told that some stones have been lifted up but returned to their original positions, and some sacred cows are simply too conveniently sacred to be rid off.<br><br>Is the Annual Economic Indicator a good measure of the work put in by the Government aka the Ruling Political Party, or should we also include into the indicator the movement in size of the Middle Income Group, the Lower Income Group; or perhaps the growth and reduction indicators of crime and social problems - suicide levels, joblessness, homeless, murders, robberies, rapes, gang riots ?<br><br>With the Statistic Department in the control of the Ruling Political Party aka the Government, can we depend on the department for the numbers that they churned out - in view of some of the past controversies in interpretation raised by some senior university lecturers (who were 'forced' to retract and apologise for the 'unauthorised' publicity ) ?<br><br>Is there anyone that is beyond the political influence and obligation to the Ruling Political Party to be able to stand up and be a truly independent administrator or arbitrator of a committee to measure such performance ?<br><br></div>
