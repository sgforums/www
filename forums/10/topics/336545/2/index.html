              <p>don't generalize and make unsubstantiated claims...</p>
              <p>1. housing interest rates for standard variable rate today is 7.65%, down from 9%</p>
              <p>2. ave median home price for sydney is A$230k. that was july  07. with the current situation, it is not unthinkable that the same house will cost less.</p>
              <p>3. unleaded petrol prices averages under A$1.30 per litre in Australia</p>
              <p>4. 1 year old used camry can be had for about A$22k.</p>
              <p>5. public transport both sucks in singapore and australia. ok, ok, i rate singapore's public transport 2.5 vs 2.0 for a city like sydney.</p>
              <p>and maurizio13 has posted ad nauseum the comparable living standard on what the aussie $ can buy compare to the sing$. i won't go there.</p>

              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">...one time I took MRT and Bus to Tuas from Upper Serangoon, damnz it... you know how much it costs? You know how long it took? Believe me, with the amount of time you save and the amount you have to pay "going public"; driving my own car is better... (maybe if it were to town that might be different)... still, you cannot generalize and say that going public is always better.</span></span></p>

              <p>2. that's the average. in singapore, everyone lives in disti 10/11 issit? if you look around the suburbs in melbourne/sydney, it is not impossible to buy (nice) homes in the $3-400k bracket. this is way below your $5-700k bracket you claimed.</p>
              <p>3. do you even  drive? downtown melbourne's unleaded petrol is about A$1.25/litrel. Shell's unleaded price in sydney is A$1.29. you click on your own link and see for yourself.</p>
