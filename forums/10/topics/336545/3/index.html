                  amount you have to pay "going public"; driving my own car is
                  better... (maybe if it were to town that might be different)...

              <p>which means for people commuting to work from the morning and returning in the evening, it costs $6.50.</p>

No, my taxes did, thanks to Kevin Rudd. And interest rates have gone up. The fare rise is a bigger increase than S$.03 that everyone gets up in arms about. And what do we get for it? Trains still get cancelled. Trams still change their service at the last minute.</p>
              <p>and once i was stuck in a not so safe area after 10. The last tram was supposed to arrive at 10.20 according to the bloody timetable - it didnt and in oz there is this number to call on your mobile to  find out the next tram arrival, to my horror it stated the next tram is in the morning.

              <p>The amount of tax you're paying doesn't even start to giving you the amenities. <br><br>When you're old, the government doesn't give a sh!t about you (think euthanasia). You'll have to work until you're over 60 before getting what reserves you have in your CPF (which, may I remind you, is forcibly imposed). While citizens in America get to enjoy retirement at around 50 and can ask the government for money and healthcare subsidies, you'll be picking up cardboards off the streets.</p>
              <p>Talking about culture, Singapore's culture is nowhere near as diverse as some other countries. You can boast all you want, but how often do you see Singaporeans celebrate Chinese New Year like in China/Hong Kong? <br><br>Land-wise, have us a better city structure than Tokyo/Hong Kong? Do we have clean waters like those in Huntington Beach or Perth? Have we nature reserves that can rival those in China?</p>

              <p>like most countries, australia is large. in small town, the pay is lower, the cost of living is lower too. the public transport facilities are bad there.</p>
              <p>in big cities, the pay is higher, the cost of living is higher too. some people with lower wages will have trouble owning a car in the big city due to the cost of living, as a car will include parking and taxes.</p>
              <p>if you want to compare to singapore, it is prudent to compare to the big city, and only include the average salary of people in the big cities. that will be a better comparison.</p>

              <p>The amount of tax you're paying doesn't even start to giving you
                  the amenities.<br> <br> When you're old, the government doesn't give a sh!t about you
                  (think euthanasia). You'll have to work until you're over 60 before
                  getting what reserves you have in your CPF (which, may I remind
                  you, is forcibly imposed). While citizens in America get to enjoy
                  retirement at around 50 and can ask the government for money and
                  healthcare subsidies, you'll be picking up cardboards off the
                  streets.</p>
              <p>Talking about culture, Singapore's culture is nowhere near as
                  diverse as some other countries. You can boast all you want, but
                  how often do you see Singaporeans celebrate Chinese New Year like
                  in China/Hong Kong?<br> <br> Land-wise, have us a better city structure than Tokyo/Hong Kong? Do
                  we have clean waters like those in Huntington Beach or Perth? Have
                  we nature reserves that can rival those in China?</p>

              <p>Ya, more for pple who have more trips.</p>
              <p>For me, just taking a train to work, and back home immediately, cost about $3 a day. This is without changing of bus or train network. This is only for a <strong>15 mins</strong> train ride because <strong>I stay near my workplace</strong>. This is <strong>excluding</strong> going out to shop or work, or travelling elsewhere before going home.</p>
              <p>And you have to take into account <strong>price of transport vs average salary ratio</strong>. You don't compare things just like that. E.g. a $1 bread means less to someone earning $10000 a month as compared to someone earning $1000 a month.</p>
              <p>And you have to consider the <strong>distance travelled</strong>. How big is Singapore, really...</p>
