              <p>Ya, more for pple who have more trips.</p>
              <p>For me, just taking a train to work, and back home immediately,
              cost about $3 a day. This is without changing of bus or train
              network. This is only for a <strong>15 mins</strong> train ride
              because <strong>I stay near my workplace</strong>. This is
              <strong>excluding</strong> going out to shop or work, or travelling
              elsewhere before going home.</p>
              <p>And you have to take into account <strong>price of transport vs
              average salary ratio</strong>. You don't compare things just like
              that. E.g. a $1 bread means less to someone earning $10000 a month
              as compared to someone earning $1000 a month.</p>
