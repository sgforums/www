              <p>if you stayed in singapore all your life, what does that make you to be?</p>
              <p>getting connected with friends, relatives, etc. are easy enuf thru' technology. and how often you visit your relatives &amp; friends here since you live here anyway?</p>
              <p>when you have a family, sometimes how you view things with different perspective take precedence. you don't do things for yourself anymore. the same if you are single, or just have a small family, your prerogatives are diffirent. parents know that they have to let their children `go' when they reach a mature age of wanting to live their own lives. it would be selfish to hold their children back.</p>
              <p>if singapore works for you, well and good. singapore is not without its merits, but for the rest who are better off elsewhere, let them be. let them experience what is it outside and decide if it is for them or that they need to come back to singapore.</p>
              <p>and you have not offered any points on why the other side is bleaker?</p>
              <p>so, how can you draw your conclusion?</p>

              <p>those who liked overseas, majority i know moved with their families, do u know that? And they dont feel the pain.</p>
              <p>Likewise also many students who went from singapore to overseas to study have returned because of one thing - family...</p>

              <p>when u state people who liked and people who disliked, please also state the demographics rather than generalising as one single group.</p>
              <p>the single individuals who went overseas alone are  most likely to return. But again i know some families have also returned.</p>
