              <p>In fact in OZ, it is so diverse between different states that the environment varies. In capital cities like melbourne and sydney working class people, its more of a busy lifestyle and people are stressed , when they are, they tend to be rather unfriendly or keep to themselves.</p>
              <p>So what difference it makes if i come to s'pore and work? Foreigners as well, and it could be even worst as there are no workplace ethics and laws  in sg.</p>

              <p>sorry mate. but u cannot count on anyone to agree with your opinions and ideas. i have worked in the SG local IT industry for the past 10+ years and each year, i saw the number of singaporeans dwindling over the years until i was the minority.</p>
              <p>shits happen especially when some foreigners think they are far better than us in Oz, heck, some singaporeans there thought of the same too about other fellow singaporeans in Oz.</p>
              <p>really, we cannot count on others for this matter. and u already have experienced the "privilege" of a worker-rights oriented environments as in Oz, can u adapt back to the old SG worker abusive ways?</p>

                      but s'pore provides more value for the bucks than what overseas can
                      provide. Safety, lively clean surroundings, ease of life  and
                      an efficient transport system.</p>
              <p>The most important aspect is the culture and food and festivals
                      that u have grown up with.</p>
              <p>Are u willing to let all these go for some secluded lonely life
                      in a foreign destination?</p>
              <p>How many of u agree with me? </p>

              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">I do agree with you that I missed Singapore lots.  But I gradually grew out of missing Singapore a long time ago, when I first finished university overseas.  It was the encouragement of my wife to work in the UK and I have since never looked back.  I am earning alot more as an engineer in the UK than in Singapore.  Both my wife and me are working in very good positions in established MNCs in the UK.  I believe that one day I will return to Singapore but probably in a management role that must first match my salary in the UK.  In the meantime, we tend to use Skype to speak with friends and family in Singapore regularly.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">I am aiming towards getting my PR in the UK in the next 2 years.  With that it will also mean that my children will not have to pay the ridiculous school fees for foreigners to study in prestigous universities in the UK.  Also, my lifestyle in the UK is fairly simple, which has already helped me to save enough money for us to buy our 2nd home.  With the way things are going, I should be able to buy a proper 4 bedroom house in Southwest in England and then rent out the properties if I choose to leave for Singapore.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">So yes, there are plenty of sacrifices to make when you work overseas.  But if you are able to endure the returns are definitely much better than working in Singapore.  Unlike Singapore, Europe can provide excellent opportunities and remuneration packages for talented people who may find it tough in Singapore due to limited opportunities.   Opportunities are normally dictated by the Singapore goverment with the GLCs and the direction that the goverment would like to invest in.  For now, it's mainly research and finance in Singapore.   I have met Singaporeans who are artists or designers in London and they are doing very well, more so than in Singapore so that is why we choose to stay here.  We make do with the once a year visit to our family members and the time spent is always well cherished.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">I hope this gives a better idea of how some Singaporean overseas feel about this issue.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">Cheers</p>

                  dwell time [the time a train spends in each station], address

              <p>Please!
                  Somebody stop the madness! I feel like there has been a complete lack
                  of public consultation on a matter like this. Someone needs to bite the
                  bullet and invest the money to make our current systems work. While
                  services may run slightly faster, they would need to be MUCH more
                  frequent to make up for the lost capacity - which will be huge. I hope
                  common sense prevails in this case, that money should be directly
                  injected into upgrading our current systems - getting more 'working'
                  millenium trains on our tracks, and improving services.</p>

              <p>The budget papers refer to single deck trains being able to operate at a "higher frequency".</p>
              <p>Is there a genuine operational reason for this?</p>
              <p>At first glance, it looks like codswallop to me - why would a single
                  deck fleet be more efficient (apart from manufacturing costs, of
                  course) than a doubel deck fleet?</p>
