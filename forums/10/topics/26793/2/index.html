            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks  Joe Black for the pictures! The SAF Armour family will really be much more powerful after acquiring anyone of these monsters! I am a tank commander myself,this is in response to recoil. Well if you think the Bionix is cramped? Wait till you try out the SM1 !!! The BX in my opinion is huge! I think all the tankees out there can agree with me,yes? Well I think that the SM1 is unsuitable for modern warfare as it is simply too old despite the upgrade in the 80's. However, I do have great pride in being a tankee! The SM1 is not all useless though.The accuracy of the old 75mm main guns is still pretty impressive,despite the fact that alot of the firing procedure is manually done. Gentlemen we have touch mainly of the replacement for SM1 but what about the other vehicle which I have mention earlier? Please comment,Thanks <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I so far define them this way.<br><br>Tanks:  Tracked and Turreted Armored vehicles that take out vehicles and tanks w/ direct fire.<br><br>AFV:  Armored, and armed vehicles, exclusive of Tanks. Can include IFVs and APCs.<br><br>IFV:  Armored Fighting Vehicles specifically tasked to supporting infantry<br><br>APCs:  Armored vehicles capable of transporting personnel on board through a battlefield while offering armored protection.<br><br>To me, tanks are a unique class of its own.  They cannot be classified as AFVs due to their unique nature.</div>
