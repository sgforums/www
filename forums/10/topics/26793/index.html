            <div class='col-md body'>Recently I have spotted a couple of new platforms. One of them is (what I suspect) the replacement for our old workhorse of Armour--AMX13SM1.The other looks like a missile launcher on a M113. I wish to know more about these two new weapon systems. I am aware of the security implications concerning this topic so i strongly urge anyone out there who know anything about this be cautious when you post a reply.As for myself I will describe the vehicles in a vague manner to prevent breaches of security.Another question is how does these 2 weapon systems work in our current doctrine, simply said is what is the role they play in the SAF.

It is announced we are looking into replacing the SM1, it's only a matter of when.<br></div>

However, if we are talking about "a new light tank" ST Engg is developing, then perhaps it is only going to be pure speculation.  Janes has reported that ST Engg is building a new light tank most likely for SAF and probably based on a Bionix chassis. However, till now, we haven't had concrete news about the program. Like the Bionix which went through a thorough testing and initial deployment within the army before it was made public, we won't see the light tank in public places until Mindef decides that it should be announced.<br><br>As for the AMX tank some posters have seen here, they are not new and definitely not some top secret thingy.<br><br>BTW, I've got one question about the AMX-10PAC tank... why did SAF go for the 90mm gun instead of the 105mm. Does that mean that we have now 3 kinds of tank rounds to support (75mm, 90mm and 105mm)?  And how good are the AMX-10PAC sights/fire control system compared to the current SM1?</div>

Yes, its an AMX-10 (confirmed by my friend's photo, which had the designation and description plate in front of the tank.). What is its role in the SAF?

Not a secret leh.<br><br>Anyway, I am interested to know how many people reckon the CV90-120 is a suitable vehicle in SAF context. I wonder if Mindef has ever considered that - a 25 tons that shoots 120mm round - must be a real attractive option. Furthermore, the 25 tons is within the engineer support capabilities after they have received the Class 30 Leguan bridges on the Bionix.<br><br>I also think that a foreign 105mm turret marry to the Bionix chassis is SAF best light tank solution.

            <div class='col-md body'>In my opinion a 105mm gun is a suitable gun as a replacement for the 75mm. The mating of a foreign turret to BX chasis is applicable as well as practical. The BX is designed to be able to accommodate various types of turrets such as 40/50,25mm Bushmaster and other 'turrets' like bridging equipment as in the BLB. Can anyone suggest what 105mm turret is suitable for the BX? Thanks <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>1990, MINDEF awarded Giat a contract for 22 AMX-10 PAC 90 Fire Support Vehicle and 22 AMX-10P 25 ICVs with 25mm Dragar turret. All variants ordered are based on the AMX-10P Marines and are fully amphibious, being specially modified for naval operations. The vehicles are being propelled in water by water-jets that are being emitted at the rear of the hull via four bilge pumps which are switched on prior to entry into water (The 305 mm water-jets impart a maximum water speed of 10 km/h). These vehicles are given reinforced waterproofing and a special protection against salt corrosion. They could be readily identified by their strong transparent wave breaker mounted on the glacis plate. Delivery of these vehicles were completed by 1994.<br><br>AMX-10P 25 ICV (Marines)<br><br>The AMX-10P 25 ICV was originally developed by Giat Industries as a private venture and Singapore is the only country which ordered this vehicle in the special amphibious version. The prototype was shown for the first time in June 1983. It is basically a standard AMX-10P Marines with a one-man Dragar turret. The commander sits to the left of the turret with a front-opening piece hatch cover, five day periscopes and night periscope. Mounted at the centre of the hull is the Giat Industries Dragar one-man turret armed with a 25 mm Model 811 Giat Industries dual-purpose cannon which fires both HE and AP rounds. The vehicle can carry 175 rounds of HE and 45 rounds of AP ammunition for use. A 7.62 mm machine gun is mounted co-axially, to the right of the cannon and 200 rounds of ammunition is available for ready use. A bank of two electrically operated forward firing smoke dischargers is mounted on either side of the turret. The vehicle weights 14,300 kg loaded and 11,700 kg empty.

            <div class='col-md body'>AOH 2002 was not bad. got to ride in the bionix. pretty cramped tho. but i guess all tanks are like that.<br>Just a question about our Apache Longbows... in the US armed forces they're assigned to the army... but with the SAF our Apaches seem to be assigned to the RSAF. Does it make a difference? integration wise is it still the same? it seems that anything that flies belongs to the RSAF... anyway. can't wait till they finally arrive here.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
