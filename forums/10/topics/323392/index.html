              <p>In response to media queries, a police spokesman confirmed that a male
                  Indian was arrested for disorderly behaviour and using abusive words
                  towards public servants yesterday (<span style="color: #ff0000;">lion note--US Independence Day)</span>at about 10.45pm at the junction of
                  Race Course Road and Bukit Timah Road.</p>
              <p>Plainclothes
                  officers on their routine anti-crime operations in the area heard a
                  loud knock on their marked Police vehicle when it stopped at the
                  traffic light road junction of Race Course Road and Bukit Timah. They
                  saw a male Indian walking away. When the officers identified themselves
                  and interviewed the person, he became abusive and refused to furnish
                  his particulars as he claimed he was a US citizen and the Police has no
                  right to check on him. Despite repeated warnings to stop his verbal
                  abuse, including a racist slur against one of the Malay officers, he
                  continued to be uncooperative and persisted in his abuse.</p>
              <p>The
                  commotion caused by the subject attracted a crowd of over 25 onlookers,
                  which created a risk of public disorder due to the inflammatory remarks
                  used by the subject. The police officers, after giving the male subject
                  repeated warnings to calm down and not to cause a public disturbance,
                  had no choice but to arrest him for disorderly behaviour and for using
                  abusive words towards public servants.</p>
              <p>When
                  the Police placed him under arrest, he put up a fierce struggle and
                  resisted arrest. As a result, the subject’s glasses were broken and he
                  sustained slight bruises. One of the Police officer’s glasses was also
                  broken.</p>
              <p>It was only after his arrest that
                  the man subsequently disclosed his full name as Gopalan Nair at the
                  station to the officers. In accordance with police procedures, a
                  medical examination by a doctor was conducted in the police station and
                  a blood sample was taken with Gopalan Nair's consent to analyse for the
                  presence of any alcohol.</p>
              <p>Gopalan Nair has
                  since been released on police bail. Gopalan Nair is being investigated
                  for using abusive or insulting words towards a public servant and
                  disorderly behaviour under the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order
                  &amp; Nuisance) Act. A person convicted for the 1st offence using
                  abusive or insulting words on a public servant is liable to a fine not
                  exceeding $5,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year. A
                  person convicted for the 2nd offence of disorderly behaviour is liable
                  on conviction to a fine not exceeding $1,000 or imprisonment for a term
                  not exceeding one month.</p>
              <p>Police takes a
                  serious view of those who disturb the public peace and who are abusive
                  to Police officers performing their duties.</p>
              <p><strong>Released as factual information</strong></p>
              <p>Gopalan
                  Nair is currently facing two charges under the Penal Code for
                  intentional insult to a public servant sitting in a judicial proceeding
                  under Section 228 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224. These charges relate
                  to an email sent by him to Justice Lai Siu Chiu in 2006, and a posting
                  on his blog relating to Justice Belinda Ang in May 2008. Both Justice
                  Lai and Justice Ang are High Court Judges.</p>

Unless a lawyer has a totally different biological system, we should be able to sense his trauma or at least see the superficial injuries especially on his head.</p>
              <p>If the police force is as tyrannic as what he had described. Do you think they care if he is a lawyer, assuming that they really want to give him a good beating ? Go to some other country where the police force  is realli screwed up, do u think they care if u are a foreign lawyer and give u less a beating?</p>

              <p>Ladies and Gentlemen,<br><br>I continue in Court 6, Subordinate Courts, Singapore at 9.30 am on Monday July 28, 2008. The story continues from the last blog.<br><br>I
              am writing as time permits. I have been in court nearly every day with
              either this case or the Blogging case, having to work on them, leaving
              little time to report. As time permits, I write these blogs. Apologies
              to not being to be more immediate in the reporting. But rest assured,
              it will be done.<br><br>I reported in my last blog, on the previous day
              of trial that I had objected to the presence of Investigating Officer S
              Vikneshwaran sitting in Court during the proceedings because in Dr.
              Chee Soon Juan's previous cases, a valid objection was raised with the
              Investigating Officer sitting in court and then being observed to leave
              the court room and found to be coaching other police prosecution
              witnesses who were yet to testify, enabling them to tailor their
              evidence against Dr. Chee to secure convictions.<br><br>Today the
              Prosecutor, Mr. Peter Koy Su Hua, started the day by making a lengthy
              but regrettably useless and time wasting speech by explaining in detail
              that it was not proven in Dr. Chee's earlier case that the police in
              fact misbehaved in this way, but regardless, he will agree not to allow
              the Investigating Officer S. Vikneswaran not to be present in court
              while he is not testifying and to instruct the Police Officer Thien not
              to indulge in such illegal activity by listening to the evidence in
              court and then going out and telling the other police witnesses who are
              yet to testify, what was said.<br><br>Next, I objected to the
              prosecution' list of witnesses. There were supposedly several
              witnesses, all police officers, except for the doctor who already
              testified. Except for their names and they speak English, nothing was
              said in it as to what their role may be. I understood from other cases
              that the list should not only state their names and language spoken but
              also the gist of their testimony. I do not know if this was another
              dirty trick played by the Singapore Government prosecutor's office to
              obtain criminal convictions against political opponents of the
              government, but upon my raising this objection, Mr. Koy Su Hua did
              state orally what their roles will be, but I am still left without a
              written statement of their particular roles.<br><br>Next, Senior Staff
              Sergeant Kang Wei Chien takes the stand. He claims to be part of the
              policemen who arrested me on the day in question and the leader of
              them. He claims to have been in the Police Force for 15 years etc. He
              goes into a narrative. He says together with others he conducts anti
              crime patrols to collect information and basic investigation. He says
              he and his men will dress in civilian and not police uniforms, they
              will be in marked police cars and sometimes on foot, they go in a group
              of 6 policemen and such general stuff. I had asked the court to
              dispense with these background on the duties and practices of the
              Singapore Police Force, not wanting to write a theses on it, and come
              straight to point with the incident of my arrest, but the court
              permitted this totally irrelevant background information which served
              no purpose other than to waste everyone's time.<br><br>As background to
              this blog post, a leading question is one that tends to elicit a
              particular answer, such as "The defendant stole the purse, did he
              not"?, since it is almost certainly result in your witness saying "He
              did". Such questions are disallowed in cross examination. The
              prosecutor with this witness was almost repeatedly asking such leading
              questions to which I naturally objected. Mr. Koy then tried to justify
              them by saying they were "specific questions" and not "leading
              questions". To that, I pointed out that I have never heard the term
              "specific question" in the law of examination of witnesses, to which
              the court took no issue and the examination of Mr. Kang, the police
              officer went on.<br><br>Finally Mr. Koy, the prosecutor decided to come
              to the point of the actual case, namely the claim that I behaved in a
              disorderly manner and insulted police officers on July 4th, 2008, at
              about 9 pm at the junction of Race Course Road at Little India and
              Bukit Timah Road.<br><br>Kang, the police officer claims that he went
              on patrol to Race Course Road with 5 other police officers. He claims
              they were in two marked police cars, with him and another policeman
              Seargent Azar in the leading car and the others in another car some way
              behind.<br><br>Kang, the police witness says that his task was "to look
              for suspicious characters" and "also to visit such places like pubs and
              clubs to look for trouble makers as there are lots of fights at closing
              time".<br><br>He claims Seargent Azar was driving the vehicle, sitting
              on the right (Singapore has right hand drive vehicles) with him on the
              left front seat.<br><br>He claims that at about 10.30 pm, his car on
              Race Course Road drove to the traffic signal lights at the junction of
              Bukit Timah Road and stopped at the junction, being the first car at
              the junction, the other police car with the other policemen being a few
              cars away.<br><br>The prosecutor Peter Koy Su Hua then proceeds to
              refer him to some photographs which were taken at the scene. I
              naturally objected to him testifying on the photographs as the law
              requires the maker of the photographs to testify in court on their
              authenticity before anyone else can give testimony on them. Peter Koy's
              argument, ingenious but without basis nevertheless, was that he should
              be allowed to testify on them, and if subsequently it is proven that
              they are unsubstantiated, his testimony can be ignored. I objected to
              this argument. I demanded that the photographer be produced first to
              confirm their authenticity before Kang testifies anymore on these
              photographs.<br><br>Court agrees that photographers be called before any further testimony by Policeman Kang.<br><br>Mr.
              Quek Kim Nguan, police photographer takes the stand. An elderly man who
              does not know much English. To the question from Peter Koy Su Hua, he
              confirms he took the photographs.<br><br>My turn to cross examine him. He said he took the photographs of the street on July 22, 2008.<br><br>To
              the question from me "Do you know what a junction is?", his answer was
              "traffic light junction". Again to the question "do you know what a
              junction is" he says he cannot answer. He did not know the meaning of
              the word "junction". On the whole, it was clear that the poor man had
              hardly any English. Since the pictures did appear to show the scene, it
              was not necessary to make too big an issue of this man. He was released
              after testimony.<br><br>Next came another police witness Staff Seargent
              Tan Kim Kiang, a photographer, as well as a scene of crime officer,
              specializing in taking fingerprints. This time he took photos of the 2
              police vehicles in question. He said he took photographs of the 2
              police cars, a set of which I had been given. He said he took the
              photographs at the basement parking lot of the disused market at Little
              India and that he took fingerprints on the car. He then says he sent
              the fingerprints to the Criminal Investigation Department for results
              and that they "were unable to confirm that the fingerprints were mine"
              because, listen to this, "they don't have any records of the accused
              person"!<br><br>Another ingenious mind boggling statement by a
              government desperate to defend the indefensible. The long and short of
              it was that there were no fingerprints on the police car, and if there
              were, they were not mine. Someone else who hates in Little India at the
              time who hates the police like many do, may have decided to "knock" the
              police car and scoot off. Instead of that " they come out with this
              gibberish that "they were unable to compare any fingerprint with the
              accused person because they don't have any records of the accused
              person". The simple point of it all is that they cannot prove that I
              ever touched any police car, keeping in mind that their contention for
              stopping me was that I had touched their police car!<br><br>July 29, 2008/ Court 6/ Subordinate Court<br><br>Senior
              Staff Seargent is seen by Mr. Yap Keng Ho, another civil rights
              activist who happened to be in court that Mr. Kang, the police witness
              was in the court eavesdropping, while the 2 police photographers were
              testifying, from the from within the witness room, since according to
              Mr. Yap, this was possible. Mr. Yap is in court and I ask that he be
              permitted to testify as to this wrong doing.<br><br>Mr. Peter Koy Su
              Hua, the prosecutor objects on the ground that Mr. Yap was not in the
              witness room at the time, second that Mr. Kang was within the witness
              room and never came out and therefore there is no basis for him to say
              this. According to Mr. Yap however, it is possible to do this since the
              witness room is not sound proof. I inform the court that Mr. Yap has
              proof that this has happened in other occasions.<br><br>I then ask the
              court, Judge James Leong Kui Yiu sitting, that I be permitted 5 minutes
              to speak to Mr. Yap who is in court. Application to do so is denied.<br><br>Mr.
              Peter Koy Su Hua then addresses the court claiming that I have made
              unsubstantiated allegations against police officers of the Singapore
              Police Force, that this is part of my defense and that he hoped that
              the Judge would direct me not to make unsubstantiated allegations
              against policemen again. The judge then asked me not to make
              unsubstantiated allegations to which I replied that if I have personal
              knowledge of some fact, it is not unsubstantiated and I ma entitled to
              complain if that is the case. Matter was left at that.<br><br>I now
              cross examine Mr. Tan Kim Khiang, the witness who is a police
              photographer and a scene of crime expert who took the fingerprints.<br><br>There
              is some unintelligible testimony from his that my fingerprints were not
              found on the car because they did not have records of my particulars
              even though I was arrested that very night and my fingerprints were
              taken at the police station. When people who want to hide the truth
              usually end up with gibberish and that was what he was saying. The
              judge made no attempt to clarify his nonsense ordering that whatever he
              said made sense. It may have made sense to the judge, the Singapore
              prosecutor bent on prosecuting Singaporean dissidents but certainly not
              on an rational bystander. We have just to leave it that there were no
              fingerprints of mine on that police car regardless of whatever fairy
              tale reasons there may be.<br><br>Mr. Kang, the police officer then
              gives evidence from the witness box (the stand). Mr. Koy the prosecutor
              now tenders a sketch plan of the scene and asks Mr. Kang to testify as
              to the position of his car in the plan. Of course I object. Koy is
              trying the same trick he did with the photographs. Again the rule is
              when a person has made a plan of a sketch place or scene, if anyone
              else is made to give evidence on it, the maker of the plan has first to
              confirm that it was he who made the sketch plan. Mr. Kang, not having
              drawn the sketch plan has no authority to give evidence on it without
              this. Court upholds my request.<br><br>Wednesday, 3oth July 2008/ Court no. 6/ Subordinate courts/ Trial continues<br><br>Mr.
              Koy Su Hua now wastes time again. Since the last time the court sat,
              today, he produces 2 cases heard in the Singapore High Court apparently
              to prove that the sketch plan can be admitted in evidence merely to be
              identified and someone other than the maker can give evidence on it,
              and if subsequently it is proven that the sketch plan is false, we can
              then ignore the earlier evidence! All this even if it is very easy for
              him just to call Mr. S Vikneshwaran to court and confirm he drew the
              sketch plan! And he takes about half hour or so to give large
              explanations of what he thought this case from the court even though I
              have never heard of these cases before and this is then first time that
              I have been handed copies of this case! And what is more these 2 cases
              are lengthy and consist of nearly 200 pages of small print about
              matters that have nothing to do with criminal law at all! They are
              shipping cases, where contractors had negligently repaired a ship!<br><br>Naturally
              I object to this time wasting. To this totally irrelevant case to prove
              a point which is totally unnecessary when all they had to do is to just
              call Mr. S Vickneshwaran to court!<br><br>You would have thought the
              judge would have put a stop to this nonsense. Nothing of the sort. Mr.
              Koy is permitted to make his academic pedantic but totally unnecessary
              rendition of what the law was. The case he refers to is Jet Holdings vs
              Cooper, both the High Court and the Appeal case. Naturally I ask for
              sufficient time to read the lengthy case, but the judge allows mew only
              30 minutes to read nearly 200 pages in fine print about a complicated
              shipping case and not only that, understand it!<br><br>So Mr. Koy
              stands up to start his long academic speech as to what the law about
              whether the court can rely on a document even without calling the maker
              of it to prove it. And to everyone's surprise, at the end of that
              totally unnecessary speech, he says that he admits that the cases he
              has referred does not entirely prove his point and that if necessary,
              he is prepared to call the maker of the plan, Mr. S Vickneswaran to
              confirm that he did it!<br><br>After all this, I point out to the court
              that firstly, the case actually confirms the rule that in the case of
              documents, the maker of the document has in fact to be called to
              confirm its authenticity before it can be used as evidence! End of jet
              Holdings vs Cooper and any reference to it. Mr. Koy after all is
              prepared to call Mr. S Vickneshwaran to testify!<br><br>The Court now
              calls to the stand a man who wishes to be known as S Vicki. Mind you,
              this is not his name at all! He says he is S Vicki. He states that he
              wrote the sketch plan of the scene.<br><br>It is now my turn. I ask him
              what is his full name. To that he says it is Vikneshwaran son of
              Sockalingam, which in Singapore is written Vikneshwaran s/o
              Sockalingam. Viola, finally we have now found out his real name, which
              he and others like him in this case were so desperately keen to
              conceal. He is a Tamil of South Indian descent. Not very educated and
              appeared grateful that he has a job as a policeman in the Singapore
              Police Force for lack of any better.<br><br>Mr. Vickneshwaran s/o Sockalingam now leaves and back comes the prosecutor to continue his examination in chief of Mr. Kang.<br><br>Mr.
              Kang refers to the sketch plan, where he was in the sketch plan and the
              layout of the junction of Race Course Road and Bukit Timah Road.<br><br>Mr.
              Kang says that his vehicle stopped at the first line of the traffic
              line junction, as the signal was red. In other words his was the first
              car at the traffic light junction. He claims he heard a "continuous and
              loud" knocking sound on his car while he and his driver Sergeant Azar
              was in it, and saw a "male Indian walk past his side towards Bukit
              Timah Road". "Sergeant Azar and myself made a quick check on the left
              hand side of the car to see if there was any damage". "The male
              Indian's back was facing us. Sergeant Azar shouted at the male Indian
              "Hello Sir" "Hello Sir" for a few times, and at the same time we were
              walking towards him but there is no response from the male Indian".
              (The language is not grammatically correct, written verbatim. Mr. Kang
              does not know English well) he claims his intention of approaching the
              male Indian (me) was to ask him why he knocked his car and to take his
              particulars so that if the car was damaged, he "he will have someone to
              fall back on".<br><br>Mr. Koy's examination in chief of Mr. Knag
              continues. He says when he reached the male Indian (me), he touched me,
              Sergeant Azar touched me on the shoulder. Mr. Kang then claims, I
              shouted back "Who are you?", "think you are all policemen, so what?", "
              You all policemen go and do your job and go catch thieves, don't bother
              me, I have done nothing wrong".<br><br>To Mr. Koy's questions, Kang
              says he showed his police pass and that he verbally told me that he was
              a policeman. He than claims he asked for my particulars and that I said
              I had none, and that I had shouted expletives at him. Kang then says he
              asked me why I knocked his car. He then says that I shouted to the
              Malay officer that he is a "Malay bastard". He then claims that I had
              had accidentally knocked his car (although how a man can accidentally
              "continuously and loudly" knock a car is mind boggling).<br><br>To Mr.
              Koy's question, Kang then says that while shouting I was "gestilating"
              with my hands. Not knowing the English word, what he meant to say that
              I was gesticulating with both my hands!<br><br>Now he says something
              very strange indeed!. He says that 2 uniformed policemen appeared at
              the scene from Tanglin Police Station saying that they received a 999
              emergency call stating that there was a "dangerous man" in the scene
              and asked him whether I was attending to him? Not being sure, Mr. Kang
              asks the 2 men from Tanglin Police Station to check with their
              Operations Room!<br><br>It is now my turn to cross examine Mr. Kang the policemen. You will see how incredible Mr. Kang's testimony is!<br><br>Nair: Are you saying someone knocked your car many times correct?<br><br>Kang: Yes. I did not say many times. I said "continuously" and "loudly"<br><br>Nair: When you said "continuously" what did you mean by that?<br><br>Kang:
              I said someone knocked my car continuously. It means continuously. I
              cannot tell how many times. That is why I said continuously.<br><br>Nair: How many times is "continuously"<br><br>Knag: I do not know how many times and I do not wish to commit myself.<br><br>Nair: You were in your car at the time of the incident on the 4th of July 2008, is that right?<br><br>Kang: Yes sir.<br><br>Nair: You say your car was knocked "continuously". Why is it that you cannot even guess how many times?<br><br>Court: Interjects.<br><br>Nair
              to Court: I am entitled to cross examine this witness on this material
              point. This is a question that goes to the root of this case. I am
              entitled to ask this question as to why he cannot state even a guess as
              to how many times his car was knocked even though he was in the car. I
              am asking that I be entitled to put this crucial question to him.<br><br>Koy Su Hua, the Prosecutor objects to my question on the ground that the question has been asked and answered.<br><br>Nair
              to Court: Koy's objection is invalid as this is cross examination and
              the accused is entitled to full opportunity to defend himself in a
              criminal case where the burden of proof is on the prosecution on the
              basis of proof beyond reasonable doubt.<br><br>The point here is this.
              Kang says he was inside the car. He says he heard his car being knocked
              continuously and loudly. Yet he is not even prepared to say how many
              times was "continuously" even though according to him, it was not only
              "continuously" but also "loudly".<br><br>Nair: Was the continuously knocking on your car by someone; was it a very hard knocking or a very slight knocking?<br><br>Knag: I wish to state that I cannot tell whether it was hard or soft knocking because I was inside the car.<br><br>Nair: I realize that you were inside the police car. From the inside, did you hear a loud knocking, slight or what?<br><br>Knag: It was a "loud" " continuous" knock.<br><br>Nair: If it was a loud continuous knock, did you turn to see who was knocking your car?<br><br>Kang: I turned and saw the accused walk past my car on the left side.<br><br>Nair
              to Court: I am asking the court to for assistance to advice the witness
              to answer the question because witness is refusing to answer it.<br><br>Nair:
              let me ask this question to you again and please answer the question. I
              am not asking whether anyone walked past your car. I am asking whether
              when you heard continuous loud knocking on your car, did you turn to
              look at who it was?<br><br>Kang: I did turn and I saw a male Indian walk past my car.<br><br>Nair:
              This continuous knocking on your car about which you claim you are
              unable even to guess how many times it was, even though you were in the
              car, and even though it was loud as you state, for what period of time
              did the continuous knocking last? Was it 1 minute, or 2 minutes or 5
              minutes?<br><br>Knag: I do not know how long it was because I did not have a watch to time how long it lasted.<br><br>Nair:
              I am not asking for an exact period of time. For example if someone had
              asked me how long have I been in this court today, I can guess perhaps
              10 minutes? Coming back to you Mr. Kang, even without a watch, how long
              do you think the continuous knocking lasted?<br><br>Kang: I do not wish to commit myself to the timing, as I do not know.<br><br>Nair: You are a police officer.<br><br>Kang: Yes.<br><br>Nair: Do you know that it is a criminal offense under the Penal Code for someone to continuously and loudly knock a police car?<br><br>Kang did not provide a response.<br><br>Nair: Was that male Indian that you claim walked past your car running away?<br><br>Kang: No he was walking past my car<br><br>Nair: Did you see me continuously and loudly knock your car.<br><br>Kang: I did not see you continuously and loudly knock your car.<br><br>Nair:
              You say that you saw a male Indian walk past your car. Did you see that
              male Indian continuously and loudly knocking your car?<br><br>Kang: No I did not.<br><br>Nair: Why is it that if someone continuously and loudly knocked your car, while you were in the car, you do not know who it was?<br><br>Kang: Your honor, I never saw, how do I know who it is?<br><br>Nair:
              Are you trying to say that you are inside a car; someone knocks your
              car continuously and loudly. Why did you not turn to look who it was?<br><br>Knag:
              When I heard someone knock the car, I only saw the male Indian walk
              past the car, and therefore as such I cannot see who knocked the car.<br><br>Nair: I put it to you that your claim that someone knocked your car continuously and loudly is a figment of your imagination.<br><br>Kang: Your honor, what is a figment?<br><br>Nair: I rephrase. I put it to him that you are lying about someone continuously and loudly knocking your car<br><br>Kang: I disagree<br><br>Nair: Put to him that if someone continuously and loudly knocked his car, he would have known who it was.<br><br>Kang: I already said I did not see. I disagree.<br><br>Nair: if someone had continuously and loudly knocked your car, you would have immediately arrested the person<br><br>Kang: I never saw who knocked the car.

              Can you imagine why someone would want to knock a police car with

              Can you not agree that if someone were to knock your car continuously
              and loudly for no apparent reason, which is incredible by itself, would
              you not expect that person to run away, instead of leisurely walking
              past your car?<br><br>Court: Disallows question.

You are duty bound to answer questions.<br><br>Kang: I am unable to do so as I do not know how long it took.<br><br>Nair: Are you saying that while you were checking the car, this male Indian was leisurely way<br><br>Kang: yes.<br><br>Kang
              then says that he had to check on the vehicle first and later to call
              out to me to ask if I knocked the car. He says that while he was
              checking the car the male Indian continued to walk away. He said the
              male Indian was walking to Bukit Timah Road. That when Sergeant Azar
              started calling out "Hello Sir" the male Indian was a distance from us,
              that he cannot tell what the distance was. He cannot tell but it was 20
              to 30 meters away. He repeats that the male Indian walked past his car
              but did not see him knocking continuously and loudly. He repeats again
              that he did not see anyone knock his car. To the question that if
              indeed the male Indian had walked 20 to 30 mothers toward Bukit Timah
              Road while he was stationary at the traffic light junction, being the
              first car, the male Indian would have been in the middle of the Bukit
              Timah Road and would have been knocked down by a car and died, his
              answer is now that in his opinion it was 20 to 30 meters. He then says
              it could have been 10 meters.<br><br>I had put it to him that he had no
              probable cause to have stopped me on that day. I put it to him that he
              had instructions from above to look out for me and have me arrested. I
              put it to him that I have not been charged for knocking anyone’s car.
              He admits that he never saw me knock the car and that his purpose was
              to conduct a search and to question me on whether I knocked the car.<br><br>He
              says that Singapore police can stop anyone for a consensual
              conversation. That if the suspect is suspected of having committed an
              offense, they can check on him.<br><br>He admits that none of them were
              in police uniforms. He claims that he cannot say that Race Course Road
              and Bukit Timah junction is a crowded place on July 4th 2008 at night
              because he does not have any statistics. He refuses to answer the
              question. I put it to him that perhaps the male Indian did not stop
              because he thought that perhaps the calls of "Hello sir" were from
              thieves and gangsters, to which he says he cannot comment as he cannot
              speak on behalf of other people. He disagrees that the location at that
              time is a crowded place. He then admits that he never identified
              himself as police officers at all but later changes to say that he
              identified himself later.<br><br>I put it to him that I thought they
              were gangsters and thieves as they were in civilian clothes and did not
              identify themselves. I put it to him that I had no obligation to
              respond to any questions in those circumstances.<br><br>Case continues in Court 6 Subordinate Court 9.30 am on Aug 6, 2008. Future dates are August 14, 15, 18, 19, 20, 21, 2008.<br><br>See you there if you want too witness the proceedings.</p>

              I am tired of this clown.  Go home to his wonderful America.
              But serve time first.  Pity he probably won't get canned like another infamous American!
              
              September 26, 2007
              by Paul Craig Roberts
              
              Bush's "war on terror" quickly became Bush's war on Iraqi civilians. So far over one million Iraqi civilians have lost their lives because of Bush's invasion, and four million have been displaced. Iraq's infrastructure is in ruins. Disease is rampart. Normal life has disappeared. 
              
              Self-righteous Americans justify these monstrous crimes as necessary to ensure their own safety from terrorist attack. Yet, Americans are in far greater danger from their own police forces than they are from foreign terrorists. Ironically, Bush's "war on terror" has made Americans less safe at home by diminishing US civil liberty and turning an epidemic of US police brutality into a pandemic.
              
              The only terrorist most Americans will ever encounter is a policeman with a badge, nightstick, mace and Taser. A Google search for "police brutality videos" turns up 2,210,000 entries. Some entries are foreign and some are probably duplications, but the number is so large that a person could do nothing but watch police brutality videos for the rest of his life. A search on "You Tube" alone turned up 2,280 police brutality videos. PrisonPlanet has a selection of the most outrageous recent cases.
              
              Police brutality has crossed the line from using excessive force against a resisting Rodney King to unprovoked gratuitous violence against persons offering no resistance, such as the elderly, women, students, and elected officials. Americans are not safe anywhere from police. Police attack Americans in university libraries, in public meetings, and in their own homes.
              
              Last week we had the case of the University of Florida student who was repeatedly Tasered without cause for asking Senator Kerry some good questions in the question and answer period following Kerry's speech. Two days after the Florida student was gratuitously brutalized, Senate Republicans defeated Vermont Democrat Patrick Leahy's bill to restore habeas corpus protection.
              
              A UCLA student was Tasered by police without cause for studying in the university library without having his student ID on his person. Following police orders to leave, the student was walking toward the door when police grabbed him and repeatedly Tasered him. 
              
              On September 19, 2007 a young woman was repeatedly Tasered without cause by a large brutal cop in a parking lot outside a night club in Warren Ohio. 
              
              On September 14, 2007, Roseland, Indiana, city council member David Snyder was ejected from a council meeting by dictatorial council chairman Charlie Shields. Snyder had protested being limited to one minute to speak. Police goon Jack Tiller escorted Snyder out, and as Snyder exited the building, Tiller, following behind, pushed Snyder to the ground and without cause began beating Snyder in the head with a nightstick. Snyder was hospitalized.
              
              Local TV news stations throughout the US offer an endless stream of police brutality videos, which are then posted on the stations' web sites, often with an opportunity for citizens to express their opinion of the incidents. 
              
              There are many disturbing aspects to police brutality cases. 
              One disturbing aspect is that the police always arrest the people that they have gratuitously brutalized. There was no justification whatsoever to arrest councilman Snyder, or the UCLA student, or the University of Florida student. The cops committed assault against innocent citizens. The cops should have been arrested for their criminal acts. Instead, the cops cover up their own crimes by arresting their victims on false charges that are invented to justify the unprovoked police violence against citizens. 
              
              Another disturbing aspect is that no one tells the police to stop the brutality. "Free" Americans are so intimidated by police that on February 19 of this year male customers in a Chicago bar stood aside while a drunk cop weighing 251 pounds beat a 115 pound barmaid, knocking her to the floor with his fists and repeatedly kicking her, for obeying the bar rules and not serving him more drinks.
              
              Yet another disturbing aspect is that a minority of citizens will justify each act of police brutality no matter how brutal and how unprovoked. For example, WNDU.com's poll of its viewers found that 64.2% agreed that Snyder was a victim of police brutality, but 27.8% thought that Snyder got what was coming to him. "Law and order conservatives" and other authoritarian personalities invariably defend acts of police brutality. Perhaps the police brutality pandemic will bring the day when we will be able to say that a civil libertarian is a law and order conservative who has been brutalized by police.
              
              The most disturbing aspect is that the police usually get away with it.
              
              I remember decades ago when civil libertarians in New York City tried to stop police brutality by establishing civilian review boards to introduce some accountability into the police's interaction with civilians. Law and order conservatives at William F. Buckley's National Review went berserk. Accountability was "second-guessing" the police. The result would be a crime wave. And so on.
              
              Police forces have always attracted bullies with authoritative personalities who desire to beat senseless anyone who does not quake in their presence. In the past police could get away with brutalizing blacks but not whites. Today white citizens are as likely as racial minorities to be victims of police brutality. 
              
              The police are supreme. The militarization of the police, armed now with military weapons and trained to view the general public as the enemy, against whom "pain compliance" must be used, has placed every American at risk of personal injury and false arrest from our "public protectors." 
              
              In "free and democratic America," citizens are in such great danger from police that there are websites devoted to police brutality with online forms to report the brutality. 
              
              Nine years ago Human Rights Watch published a report entitled, "Shielded from Justice: Police Brutality and Accountability in the United States." The report stated:
              "Police abuse remains one of the most serious and divisive human rights violations in the United States. The excessive use of force by police officers, including unjustified shootings, severe beatings, fatal chokings, and rough treatment, persists because overwhelming barriers to accountability make it possible for officers who commit human rights violations to escape due punishment and often to repeat their offenses. Police or public officials greet each new report of brutality with denials or explain that the act was an aberration, while the administrative and criminal systems that should deter these abuses by holding officers accountable instead virtually guarantee them impunity.
              
              "This report examines common obstacles to accountability for police abuse in fourteen large cities representing most regions of the nation. The cities examined are: Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Detroit, Indianapolis, Los Angeles, Minneapolis, New Orleans, New York, Philadelphia, Portland, Providence, San Francisco, and Washington, D.C. Research for this report was conducted over two and a half years, from late 1995 through early 1998.
              
              "The brutality cases examined, which are set out in detail in chapters on each city, are similar to cases that continue to emerge in headlines and in survivors' complaints. It is important to note, however, that because it is difficult to obtain case information except where there is public scandal and/or prosecution, this report relies heavily on cases that have reached public attention; disciplinary action and criminal prosecution are even less common than the cases set out below would suggest.
              
              There is no way to hold police accountable when the president and vice president of the United States, the attorney general, and the Republican Party maintain that the civil liberties and the separation of powers mandated by the US Constitution must be abandoned in order that the executive branch can keep Americans safe from terrorists.
              
              Even before the "war on terror," federal police murdered 100 people in the Branch Davidian compound at Waco, and no one was held accountable.
              
              Who is a terrorist? If the police and the US government have the mentality of airport security, they cannot tell a terrorist from an 86-year old Marine general on his way to give a speech at West Point. Retired Marine Corps General Joseph J. Foss was delayed and nearly had his Medal of Honor confiscated. Airport security regarded the pin on the metal as a weapon that the 86-year old Marine general and former governor of South Dakota could use to hijack an airliner and commit a terrorist deed. 
              
              In America today, every citizen is a potential terrorist in the eyes of the authorities. Airport security makes this clear every minute of every day, as do the FBI and NSA with warrantless spying on our emails, postal mail, telephone calls, and every possible invasion of our privacy. We are all recipients of abuse of our constitutional rights whether or not we suffer beatings, Taserings, and false arrests.
              
              The law makes it impossible for Americans to defend themselves from police brutality. Law and order conservatives have made it a felony with a long prison sentence to "assault a police officer." Assaulting a police officer means that if a police thug intends to beat your brains out with his nightstick and you disarm your assailant, you have "assaulted a police officer." If you are not shot on the spot by his backup, you will be convicted by a "law and order" jury and sent to prison.
              
              No matter how gratuitous and violent the police brutality, a "free" American citizen can defend himself only at the expense, if not of his life, of a long stay in prison. Osama bin Laden must wish that he had such power over Americans.

              *Governor at the Pearly Gates*
              
              The governor (slang : one looked upon as governing) stood before the pearly gates of heaven. 
              
              The Angel of the gates asked him: Why did you allow police brutality, false imprisonment and excessive fines?
              
              The governor asked: â€œWhat do you meanâ€�.
              
              The Angel replied: Quality control! Was there ever any quality control? Did government EVER scientifically ask questions of the arrested? Did you ALWAYS assume the police were right? Was communication to government limited by fear of police reprisals, police lies, falsified evidence, police harassment, excessive or false imprisonment or threats of imprisonment made to the victim or the witnesses?
              
              The governor replied: â€œAmericaâ€™s courts are the best in the world. I have always refused to let the courts be criticized!â€�
              
              The Angel replied: â€œYou still donâ€™t know that the American courts committed extortion and torture?â€�
              
              The governor replied: â€œI, I donâ€™t understandâ€�
              
              The Angel replied: â€œIndeed! Did you think the police had intelligent, sane judgment?â€�
              
              The governor replied: â€œWell, not during high school â€¦â€�
              
              The Angel replied: â€œDonâ€™t you have an expression on earth - Garbage In, Garbage Out?â€�
              
              The governor replied: â€œI know, but we all liked to believe all the cop stories on TV. Did you ever seeâ€¦â€�
              
              The Angel replied: Was American Justice ever a double-edged sword? Did the police usually get prosecuted for their lies, errors, and excessive force? Was any case against the police be prosecuted simultaneously with the victimâ€™s crime? 
              
              The governor replied: â€œThe police investigate police.â€�
              
              The Angel replied: â€œDid that work?â€�
              
              The governor replied: â€œAh, well actually Uh, only when the media got involved.â€�
              
              The Angel replied: â€œDid the media get involved?â€�
              
              The governor replied: â€œA few times. I wouldnâ€™t have been elected if I criticized the police...â€�
              
              The Angel replied: â€œBut you would get into heaven.â€�
              
              The Angel continued: Did you allow the suppression of litigation against government? Did fear of reprisal and longer sentences limit justice? Were the police allowed to accuse people of false crimes that resulted in days, weeks, or months or even years in jail?
              
              The governor replied: â€œYeah, but other countries were worseâ€¦â€�
              
              The Angel replied: â€œIs that good logic?â€�
              
              The governor replied: â€œNo, but, but, everybody said it wasâ€¦â€�
              
              The Angel replied: â€œNo man is a friend of force received. You were taught that to Turn the other cheekâ€�. 
              
              The governor replied: â€œBut everybody knows that doesnâ€™t apply to governments!â€�
              
              The Angel replied: YOU WILL BE SENT BACK TO HELL FOR ANOTHER LIFETIME! You will reincarnate!
              
              The governor whined: â€œBut what about the police?â€�
              
              The Angel replied: â€œYou will be oneâ€¦â€�
