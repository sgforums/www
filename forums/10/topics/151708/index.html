            <div class='col-md body'>"A radiology group in Bangalore, India, has promised it can study X-rays and send a diagnosis within 30 minutes, Health Minister Khaw Boon Wan said yesterday. And it can do it cheaper too.<br><br>Mr Khaw said he saw no reason why Singapore should not pass on routine radiology work to cheaper places and concentrate on high-end work instead."<br><br>(Straits Times 8 Sep: http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/sub/singapore/story/0,5562,339446,00.html?)<br><br>Is this the way forward? Outsourcing diagnostics can certainly be cheaper and achieve better turnaround time. However, whilst labs in Singapore are accreditated by international bodies (Singapore was blowing its trumpet just few days ago about acquiring College of American Pathologists accreditation), the same cannot be said of low-cost diagnostic centres in India.<br><br>The Minister's idea is for the X-rays (and probably other lab tests in future) of Singaporeans who want a cheap service to be outsourced to India. Paying and foreign patients who are willing to pay for higher quality will have their tests done in Singapore at a higher price. Subsidized patients with difficult conditions will continue to be handled locally at higher cost, but with time more of these can be outsourced as the quality of Indian labs rapidly improve.<br><br>From the experience of others who have gone down this route, one implication is that hospitals will not want to train younger radiologists who do the bulk of the simpler cases. In any case, the easy cases have all gone to India anyway, so hospitals will just hire qualified radiologists to handle the complex cases. Secondly, in time, India and China will have so many cases that they will train increasingly more radiologists whilst we will lose them, as increasingly complex cases can be outsourced. Eventually, all of diagnostics will be outsouced (it has happened in the US).<br><br>The writing is on the wall: if you are a young doctor considering specialisation, there is no future in diagnostic radiology unless you are prepared to accept a lower pay or work in India, where the cost of living is lower.  This will eventually happen to other disciplines that can be easily outsourced, such as telepathology for diagnostic pathology services.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ministers and MPs can and should be outsourced as well. They can talk to constituents, debate and vote on bill and policy matters via phone or video conferencing, email etc. Singapore will be able to save HUGE amounts of money, and these outsourced ministers and MPs can come from various countries, since our current leaders are more expensive than anywhere on this planet anyway. We can have them on 2 or 4 year contracts, subject to renewal. We must remember that the biggest drain on Singapore's coffers is in fact the Singapore parliament, as well as all the non-performing GLCs kept afloat with public funds.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The problem with outsoucing anything for that matter stems from becoming beholden to these companies.<br><br>If these companies decide to one day turn around and screw you big time, you're stuck without alternatives and end up having to pay exhorbitant sums to clean up the mess.<br><br>And until India's quality improves significantly, i won't place a single dollar on putting my trust in their medical industry. The risk is just too great.<br><br>And if our ministers are serious abt making our medical sector world class, they better start finding ways to Kaizen their work procedures and processes to cope with the rising volume.<br><br>In short, become better, faster and cheaper, otherwise forget abt their pipe dream.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The NFK saga has clearely proven that despite all the assumptions about leaderships and high medical costs said to be inevitably associated with kidney treatments, at the actual work level, problems and assumptions are not always as presented.<br><br>One salient point arising out of the NKF saga is assumption about elites might look good to their leaders but to the people such perceptions are mere falsehood or fallacies.<br><br>The so-called affordability of kidney treatments was found to be totally misplaced based on one-sided assumptions and claims only. Figures and facts showed that these claims were trumped up to create good-looking score sheets to suit the high-profile personality. Even lawsuits on defamations could look good to the leaders but could be the results of cover-ups of facts about lengths of reserves due to narrow-minded attitude on the part of CEO and non-disclosing of correct facts to people in the first instance.<br><br>It is time for the leaders to stop all the fallacies about inevitably high medical costs to entitle CEOs or ministers to keep raising fees or charges.<br><br>Get the NKF fallacies out of the way and start managing Singapore based on facts and objectivity. Put in another entrepreneurial board and overhaul departments or ministries like being done for NKF, all the presumed high costs of medical services will be found to be unreal due to laziness of the mind or inadequacies of persons or chief executives in charge.<br><br>That is why all government medical computations put up by previous ministers should be reexamined and overhauled and revamped. How about removing the land cost elements and unnecessary recoveries of fixed or infrastructure costs already paid by ciitizens and not to allow ministers to double-charge them again.</div>
