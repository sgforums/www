Having children who are successful professionals but unwilling to support their children is one thing, there are plenty of examples too where the children are barely making ends meet supporting themselves AND their own children ....<br><br>I'll repay my parents for everything that they have given me of course, but I won't want to saddle my children with the expectations of supporting me and my wifey in our golden years ...<br><br></div></blockquote>You don't get it, do you? The grown-up son doing that to his bastard of a father is exactly karma. Karma is on the bastard father, not his own son of a bastard. He cheated his mum of her house, then threw her out. Didn't even bother to find her a place to stay in. She worked as a cleaner to bring him up, and <strong>he left her to die on the streets?</strong> He's a doctor. I believe uneducated labourers or even stray dogs have more conscience than to do that.<br><br>I think I can guess it. He wanted his mum to stay at home to work as a maid for free, and look after his own son of a bastard. When she refused, he threw her out, deciding his mum was of no further use to him.<br><br>Can someone find out his name, ic no., address, clinic name and other details? I'm sure many of us are eagerly waiting for a chance to pounce on that bastard.<br><br>Parents if you are reading this, do take your kids in hand. Teach them correct values and morals, and safeguard your own assets. Don't transfer your CPF funds to your children or asset ownership to your children. Leave it to buy a coffin for yourself and your spouse. Otherwise you may end up needing a casket company to sponsor a cheap coffin for you. Government will not help you.</div>

It's very convenient to blame the gov for this, but if you've seen the trend in many other countries as well, then you'd think twice about assigning blame. At the end of day, if people are willing to take responsibility for their own actions, then situations like that could have been avoided.

No matter how well parents raise their kids, there is no guarantee that the children will turn out to be model citizens, it's not all based on karma. In fact, if you place the outcome of things just based on karma, it's like pushing your responsiblity on 'karma' and expecting 'it' to make things right for you.Taking responsibility for you own actions is something which is within your control but forcing someone to take responsibility for their actions is not.<br><br>I'm sure that you are very proud that you have children who are high flyers (which is probably why you keep talking about them), but there are many parents out there who are not as lucky, so i wouldn't be so quick to place everything on karma.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If the wife cannot get along with the mother-in-law , that's between them - not for us to comment. I know how much my paternal grandmother made life very very miserable for my mom , i.e. nitpicking on her for every trivial matter, so I don't think we should interfere in that matter. And how often do we hear forumners complaining about their mother in laws- quite a few times actually.<br><br>As for someone who commented on sg women being heartless , how would you know if the daughter in law is a singaporean lady? I would refrain from making such remarks.<br><br>There are many ways to deal with such matters - but making a mother, one who had provided care and support for him all the way,  homeless is indeed heartless regardless of all the reasons. We should stop and look at it this way.<br><br>If they cannot live together, the onus falls on the son to provide his mother with alternative living arrangements and allowances necessary for her survival to accommodate both sides , NOT throw his mother out and make her homeless.<br><br>If the old woman <strong> chooses </strong> to be homeless <strong> to protest against her son not wanting to live with her ,regardless of any reasonable alternatives provided to her </strong>, then it is her choice - nobody asked her to play pity patty.<br><br>There are alot of factors not known in this case. I would not throw a judgement yet.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think some people here misunderstand the meaning of 'karma' and they use it in an oversimplified, inaccurate way in relation to what has happened to the old lady and her son.<br><br>In Buddhism, karma is not the only cause of anything that happens. The following are the five "Niyama Dharma" that cause effects.<br><br>Karma Niyama - Consequences of one's actions<br>Dhamma Niyama - Laws of nature<br>Irthu Niyama - Seasonal changes and climate<br>Biija Niyama - Genetic inheritance<br>Chitta Niyama - Will of mind<br>The last four cover 'conditions' or 'circumstances' in which karmic potential can ripen as result<br><br>quoted from: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karma<br><br>I hope people will not continue to misuse such a well-known concept of buddhism; the term 'karma' should not be misused to explain simple terms of 'reward' and 'punishment'.</div>
