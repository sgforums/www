It seems that making non-sensical statements like that to refute my points is your trademark, no proper points or reasons to counter my explanations, just accuse it of being simplistic and that's it! Now who is being simplistic?<br><br>And I said that it is quite common for parents to blame the school and gov, i did not say that they are the only ones who blame, you really jump to a lot of conclusions, don't you?<br><br>All your tedious ranting about the gov and durai, what does that have to do with the topic at hand? Can you draw a connection with gov leadership and durai with the implementation of the parent's maintenance bill? You are totally off mark, if your main objective is stir up propoganda, by all means go ahead, but don't do it in a context where your propoganda does not fit.<br><br>let me ask you, who's responsibility is it FIRST to take care of old folks in the first place? Their adult kids, right? Who has secondary responsibility? The gov and NGO institutions, right? So, what is wrong if the gov hands back some of the responsibility back to the adult kids? i'm sure the bill was set to protect the interests of old folks rather than to burden working singaporeans. Anyway, you are still myopic and seriously lack perspective. How can you be so threatened by a bill that  has yet to prove to be effective in solving the problems of old folks? Just look at the statistics for goodness sake!!!!!!!<br><br>You can even go as far back as to blame decades of gov rule as the reason for this problem today. If you believe that most singaporeans have been made paupers because of the gov, that's your opinion and it may be relevant in a totally different context. But what does that have to do with the social problems afflicting old folks today? Is it because singaporeans are so poor that they cannot afford to teach filial piety to their children? Or is it because the citizens are so poor that they can't afford to take care of their parents and the gov doesn't want to share the burden of responsiblity?<br><br>The responsibility should be shared between the people and the gov; for people who practice filial piety, the help should come from the family first rather than from outsiders. Instead you are lobbying for the gov to 'take over' this problem, what does that mean? Create more old folks homes so that adults can dump them there and expect the gov to foot the entire costs? For some people, if this were an option for them, they would still do that even though they can afford to foot the bill.<br><br>You said that:<br><br><strong>''Instead of responding to help this group - which is mostly from the lower economic strata of Singapore - the Government had responded with a sledge hammer to a small prick of a problem.'' </strong><br><br>If it really is a small group and they really need the help, even if it is from their own children by the means of the law, what is wrong with that? Are you implying that because of the blanket ruling, another group of old folks will emerge to take advantage of the system? You seem to have such a low faith in old folks.<br><br>You also said:<br><br><strong>''This Parent Maintenance Bill will widen the schism in the relationships between parents and their children - who are unable to reconcile their relationships, resulting in a situation made worse by enforcement of a Law. ''</strong><br><br>That is laughable, you can even go to the extent of blaming the bill as a 'destroyer' of parent-child relationships. My guess is that the parents see the law option as a last resort. You are talking as though  it is a general problem afflicting singaporeans as a whole, but in reality, only a small number of people are affected, just refer back to the statistics in the article.<br><br>You asked:<br><br><strong>''Have you lost perspective of the entire social problem - and the lop sided and irresponsible policies of this Government- with your petty interpretation of my post, without understanding the underlying issues ?'' </strong><br>Yes, you have completely lost perspective on this issue. This may be irrelevant, but you have a funny way of writing, you like to structure some of your statements as though you are asking a question when what you really mean to do is to make criticisms of other people's points. Why do you feel the need to take such an indirect route? Maybe because you don't have many points that are logical and that you think that it is a 'clever' way of writing.<br><br></div>

AGAIN, this is another problem, wad a parent can teach is limited, parents need the help of school. school nvr teach properly?, sch needs the help of parents to guide the child! not juz the school's responsiblity.<br><br>every party has done their part, or rather, every party just needs to do their part.<br><br></div>
