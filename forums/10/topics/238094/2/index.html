And if i am the doctor , i will chase my wife out of my house and divorce her instead of making my mum leave my house . Such ungratefull cum spineless creature , if not for his mum he think he got today meh ? If his mum know he will do such things to her when he grows up i bet she rather go shit a big pile of feaces then to give birth to such creatures . Knn the wife of the doctor ar , i assure her that she will be the next to be thrown out of the house when her son or daughter grows up . Scum of the universe .

            <div class='col-md body'>Being a doctor, he must realise that he must be humane to all his patient, no matter friends or kin or even utter strangers. What this doctor has done is definitely not worthy of be imparted medical training.<br><br>Children who have mental problems have the right to live seperately from their parents so that they can concentrate on getting better or getting on with life but this doctor is in perfect sound mind and has a new family to take care of.
