              <p>We can only hope that world leaders will do nothing more than enjoy
              a pleasant bicycle ride around the charming streets of Copenhagen come
              December. For if they actually manage to wring out an agreement based
              on the current draft text of the Copenhagen climate-change treaty, the
              world is in for some nasty surprises. Draft text, you say? If you
              haven't heard about it, that's because none of our otherwise talkative
              political leaders have bothered to tell us what the drafters have
              already cobbled together for leaders to consider. And neither have the
              media.</p>
              <p>Enter Lord Christopher Monckton. The former adviser to Margaret
              Thatcher gave an address at Bethel University in St. Paul, Minnesota,
              earlier this month that made quite a splash. For the first time, the
              public heard about the 181 pages, dated Sept. 15, that comprise the <a href="http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2009/awglca7/eng/inf02.pdf">United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change</a>—a rough draft of what could be signed come December.</p>
              <p>So far there have been more than a million hits on the YouTube post
              of his address. It deserves millions more because Lord Monckton warns
              that the aim of the Copenhagen draft treaty is to set up a
              transnational "government" on a scale the world has never before seen.</p>
              <p><a name="U10230075496RCH"></a></p>
              <p>The "scheme for the new institutional
              arrangement under the Convention" that starts on page 18 contains the
              provision for a "government." The aim is to give a new as yet unnamed
              U.N. body the power to directly intervene in the financial, economic,
              tax and environmental affairs of all the nations that sign the
              Copenhagen treaty.</p>
              <p><a name="U10230075496C3B"></a></p>
              <p>The reason for the power grab is clear
              enough: Clause after complicated clause of the draft treaty requires
              developed countries to pay an "adaptation debt" to developing countries
              to supposedly support climate change mitigation. Clause 33 on page 39
              says that "by 2020 the scale of financial flows to support adaptation
              in developing countries must be [at least $67 billion] or [in the range
              of $70 billion to $140 billion per year]."</p>
              <p>And how will developed countries be slugged to provide for this
              financial flow to the developing world? The draft text sets out various
              alternatives, including option seven on page 135, which provides for "a
              [global] levy of 2 per cent on international financial market
              [monetary] transactions to Annex I Parties." Annex 1 countries are
              industrialized countries, which include among others the U.S.,
              Australia, Britain and Canada.</p>
              <p>To be sure, countries that sign international treaties always cede
              powers to a U.N. body responsible for implementing treaty obligations.
              But the difference is that this treaty appears to have been subject to
              unusual attempts to conceal its convoluted contents. And apart from the
              difficulty of trying to decipher the U.N. verbiage, there are plenty of
              draft clauses described as "alternatives" and "options" that should
              raise the ire of free and democratic countries concerned about
              preserving their sovereignty.</p>
              <p><a name="U10230075496TSF"></a></p>
              <p>Lord Monckton himself only became
              aware of the extraordinary powers to be vested in this new world
              government when a friend found an obscure U.N. Web site and searched
              through several layers of hyperlinks before discovering a document that
              isn't even called the draft "treaty." Instead, it's labelled a "Note by
              the Secretariat."</p>
              <p>Interviewed by broadcaster Alan Jones on Sydney radio Monday, Lord
              Monckton said "this is the first time I've ever seen any transnational
              treaty referring to a new body to be set up under that treaty as a
              'government.' But it's the powers that are going to be given to this
              entirely unelected government that are so frightening." He added: "The
              sheer ambition of this new world government is enormous right from the
              start—that's even before it starts accreting powers to itself in the
              way that these entities inevitably always do."</p>
              <p>Critics have admonished Lord Monckton for his colorful language. He
              has certainly been vigorous. In his exposé of the draft Copenhagen
              treaty in St. Paul, he warned Americans that "in the next few weeks,
              unless you stop it, your president will sign your freedom, your
              democracy and your prosperity away forever." Yet his critics fail to
              deal with the substance of what he says.</p>
              <p>Ask yourself this question: Given that our political leaders spend
              hundreds of hours talking about climate change and the need for a
              global consensus in Copenhagen, why have none of them talked openly
              about the details of this draft climate-change treaty? After all, the
              final treaty will bind signatories for years to come. What exactly are
              they hiding? Thanks to Lord Monckton we now know something of their
              plans.</p>
              <p>Janos Pasztor, director of the Secretary-General's Climate Change
              Support Team, told reporters in New York Monday that with the U.S.
              Congress yet to pass a climate-change bill, a global climate-change
              treaty is now an unlikely outcome in Copenhagen. Let's hope he is
              right. And thank you, America.</p>

              <p>I don't believe that the majority of Americans are proud of or concerned about American dominance in the world. They're just like us, ordinary people who are struggling just as hard, probably harder in today's economic context, in order to feed themselves and their families.</p>
              <p>Fear of a world government is not only an American sentiment just because this article comes from an American source. Surely there're people in other countries who are alarmed by such a trend. But as you mentioned, since America has a strong Christian tradition, fear of the AntiChrist probably factors in as well.</p>
              <p>Power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely. More government is never a good thing. I believe any sufficiently informed person would also be wary of concentrating more power into a single entity.</p>

              <p>Dr. Carroll Quigley's comments have been misquoted or misrepresented for more than 3 decades by the extreme right in the United States.  </p>
              <p>One point which many people do not realize is that the Quigley book (Tragedy and Hope) most often cited by the extreme right as "proof" of whatever dire statements they wish to make has no footnotes or bibliography.  Consequently, there is no way for anyone to verify "documentation" because there is none.  But that doesn't prevent the extreme right from proposing that Quigley is entirely accurate in all of his assertions.</p>
              <p>The primary organization in the United States which cites Quigley's book is the John Birch Society (JBS).  The Federal Bureau of Investigation under J. Edgar Hoover concluded that the JBS was "extremist", "irrational", "irresponsible", "lunatic fringe" and "fanatics".</p>
              <p>For a 91-page report on the JBS which is based, primarily, upon first-time-released FBI files and documents, see:  </p>

              <p>With respect to former FBI Special Agent W. Cleon Skousen who wrote a book (<em>The Naked Capitalist</em>) which supposedly analyzed Dr. Quigley's book, <em>Tragedy and Hope, </em>it is significant that: </p>

Edgar Hoover [See, for example, </span><em><span style="font-size: small;">JBS Bulletin</span></em><span style="font-size: small;">, January 1968, page 1] OR that Skousen was an </span><em><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-size: small;">"administrative assistant"</span></span></em><span style="font-size: small;"> to Hoover. </span></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, mono; font-size: small; line-height: normal; color: #333333; white-space: pre-wrap;"><span style="font-size: 16px;"><span style="font-size: small;">Others claim that Skousen had extensive investigative experience while he served in the FBI -- particularly with respect to internal security-related matters. </span></span></span></p>

              <p>Ernie1241, I have a question, why is the radical right in the U.S likes to use the issue of world government as a bogeyman to scare people?</p>
              <p>We have people like Alex Jones keep on ranting about the hidden agenda of world government for over 10 years now and his followers have increased.</p>
              <p>There are also a few followers of him in Singapore.</p>

              <p>Well, Angel, ultimately the answer to your question is based upon the predicate that government is, by definition, always a force for evil.</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: large; line-height: normal;">
              </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="font-size: 1em; margin-top: 1em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; line-height: 1.6; text-align: justify; padding: 0px;"><span style="line-height: 23px;">Some elements within the right-wing (particularly the John Birch Society) propose that we adopt a new understanding of a political spectrum.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="font-size: 1em; margin-top: 1em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; line-height: 1.6; text-align: justify; padding: 0px;"><span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: black;">The basic premise of the new spectrum is that history proves that government is evil and dangerous and it <span style="text-decoration: underline;">always</span> diminishes freedom and facilitates tyranny.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="font-size: 1em; margin-top: 1em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; line-height: 1.6; text-align: justify; padding: 0px;"><span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: black;">Therefore, the more government activism or intervention within a society -- the less freedom exists in society. Consequently, the new proposed spectrum places anarchy [no government] on the extreme right and totalitarian dictatorships [total government] on the extreme left.  </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="font-size: 1em; margin-top: 1em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; line-height: 1.6; text-align: justify; padding: 0px;"><span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: black;">Then---groups whose ideology we currently consider “extreme right” (such as the Birch Society) place themselves in the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">CENTER</span> of the new spectrum because they claim to favor </span></span><span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: blue;">"limited government".</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="font-size: 1em; margin-top: 1em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; line-height: 1.6; text-align: justify; padding: 0px;"><span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: black;">It is a rather transparent attempt to pretend that <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">everything</span></strong> despicable, dishonorable, frightening and dangerous originates <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">exclusively</span></strong> from the LEFT side of the spectrum whereas everything decent, honorable, moral, and desirable may be found <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">exclusively</span></strong> in the center and center-right side of the spectrum.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="font-size: 1em; margin-top: 1em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; line-height: 1.6; text-align: justify; padding: 0px;"><span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: black;">Furthermore, the new "middle" or "center" (Birchers et al) propose that liberalism, socialism, communism, fascism, nazism are ALL forms of "<em>collectivism</em>" or "<em>statism</em>" (aka PRO-government activism) and, consequently, they inevitably produce tyranny – so not much point in making fastidious distinctions between or among them.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="font-size: 1em; margin-top: 1em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; line-height: 1.6; text-align: justify; padding: 0px;">Consequently, "world government" would merely amplify the inherent danger which ANY government represents.</p>
