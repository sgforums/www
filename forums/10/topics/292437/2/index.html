            <div class='col-md body'>Discord at the 'Family Dinner'<br><br>Myanmar's refusal to allow Gambari briefing dampened leaders' spirits<br>By Ravi Velloor &amp; Cheong Suk-Wai<br><br><img src="http://www.straitstimes.com/STI/STIMEDIA/image/20071120/ST_IMAGES_SUKHEATED2.jpg"><br>MOODY MONDAY: The mood was tense on Monday as regional leaders, including (facing, from left) Malaysian PM Abdullah Badawi, Philippine President Gloria Arroyo, Asean Secretary-General Ong Keng Yong and Singapore PM Lee Hsien Loong, had a dinner discussion over Myanmar's refusal to allow Prof Gambari's briefing. -- AFP<br><br>IT WAS meant to be a family gathering amid a lush setting, with consomme, seabass, roast veal, ice cream and some plain speaking on the menu.<br><br>As it turned out, Monday's informal dinner among the 10 Asean heads of government at the Shangri-La Waterfall Terrace became the most dissected event - the morning after.<br><br>What prompted the leaders to make a surprise announcement late on Monday night that they had aborted a briefing by UN Special Envoy Ibrahim Gambari on the Myanmar situation?<br><br>Ahead of the meeting, Singapore's Foreign Affairs Minister George Yeo had billed it as a 'family dinner where each member is invited to speak his mind'.<br><br>Whatever was spoken, the effect was this, said a diplomat who was present: 'Myanmar looked Asean hard in the eye and the rest of us blinked.'<br><br>Host Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong opened the discussion by telling his nine fellow leaders that it would make sense for the grouping to ride on the UN Secretary-General's effort to tell the world that there indeed had been movement inside Myanmar.<br><br>After all, no less than Myanmar's icon of democracy, Ms Aung San Suu Kyi, had endorsed the Gambari efforts for a national reconciliation. Besides, he said, it would be a message to the world that Asean was trying to be on top of the situation in its backyard.<br><br>After all, Asean had issued a strong statement on Sept 27 in New York.<br><br>'It cannot be business as usual. That was why Singapore thought it would be a good idea for Gambari to brief the East Asia Summit. That was Mr Lee's point,' said a person who listened to the speech.<br><br>Diplomats familiar with the developments said that there were some murmurs when Singapore initially mooted the proposal. But as no one objected to the idea, Singapore went ahead and invited Professor Gambari to address the summit.<br><br>However, even as the UN envoy was winging his way to Singapore from New York, the winds shifted.<br><br>Another diplomat said that as late as last Wednesday, Myanmar had said explicitly that it had no objections to the Gambari briefing.<br><br>But around the weekend, Myanmar sent word that the briefing was not a good idea, but did not reject it.<br><br>By then, said a summit participant, the Chinese had also voiced objections to the Gambari briefing for the EAS. But their concerns centred on whether the briefing would be in a formal setting, hence lending the EAS more weight over the Myanmar situation than China felt necessary.<br><br>Singapore, acting as the Asean chair, reassured China that the setting would be informal. The Chinese then relented.<br><br>Even as early as Monday morning, Myanmar Foreign Minister Nyan Win told his fellow Asean foreign ministers that it was acceptable for Prof Gambari to brief the Asean grouping, but not the EAS. The Asean leaders accepted this position, according to a source, especially after initial rumblings that some did not like the idea of the briefing going beyond the group's 10 members.<br><br>But by the time Myanmar's Prime Minister Thein Sein arrived in Singapore, there was a volte face. No Gambari briefing, he said.<br><br>'It was obvious he was here on a short leash,' said a diplomat.<br><br>'The real issue was never Gambari. The real issue is what role you want Asean to play,' he added.<br><br>At Monday's dinner discussion, which some observers described as 'heated', Mr Thein Sein simply would not budge.<br><br>There was no need for Prof Gambari to brief the East Asia Summit or the Asean leaders, he said firmly. Every Asean nation is a UN member and if they wanted Prof Gambari's report, they could ask their envoys to the United Nations in New York to get a report from him.<br><br>His message came down to this, said a person who listened to Mr Thein Sein's speech: 'I look after my own house. You cannot come in and rearrange the furniture. The furniture may not be great but I do it the way I want it. Period.'<br><br><strong>Faced with his intransigence, other senior summit members spoke up. Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines and Malaysia suggested that this no longer could be considered a domestic matter.<br><br>One diplomat reported what was said by one leader: 'The rest of the world thinks that this is a matter that concerns Asean also and have begun to hit at us.'<br><br>Mr Thein Sein remained immovable. It is a matter between Myanmar and Prof Gambari, he said, and between Prof Gambari and his UN bosses.<br><br>Asean? The grouping has no role in it.<br><br>The entreaties were in vain. Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia wilted and made the point that 'one of our members is objecting'.</strong><br><br>That was the end of the consensus.<br><br>That triggered the three-hour brainstorm among the leaders to come up with a Chairman's Statement to explain why they had to call off the Gambari briefing.<br><br>Just as family quarrels will inevitably have its eavesdroppers, the night's drama was heightened when a microphone was accidentally switched on and it fed back into the media room snippets of the leaders' angst-filled exchange on how to word the statement.<br><br>When Mr Lee finally appeared before the media, flanked by the others, the message had been crystallised to this: Myanmar was 'on its own' in its dealings with the UN and the international community.<br><br>Less than eight hours later, the man without an audience to brief landed here and immediately declared himself 'very disappointed' with Myanmar's stance.<br><br>But Asean's loss, as it turned out, proved to be individual members' gain, as several of them sought to meet Prof Gambari separately, including at cocktails just before last night's gala dinner. Some even hugged him.<br><br>He met Philippine President Gloria Arroyo briefly and is scheduled to meet other leaders today.<br><br>One delegate described Myanmar's decision as one 'they will regret'.<br><br>But on Monday night, Mr Thein Sein did not look like he had lost his appetite He ended his meal with ice cream ensemble and fruit, after he was done with his plain speaking.<br><br><a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/Free/Story/STIStory_178756.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.straitstimes.com/Free/Story/STIStory_178756.html</a><br>-----------<br><br>Disgusted.

I already see that the world is lookin for leadership and direction from Singapore hopping to take appriate action, but while western countries expectation may not be the interest of Asia. I don't think LHL is explaining or convincing the world leaders that Asean decision is justified either.<br><br>One of the key characteristics that  LKY was successful in his early statementship was because he spoke and the rest of the leaders were convince and go along. He was pursausive enough. LHL does not have the interest to explain.  His interview with CNN was crap.  We see that leadership are here to make hard choice. not sure if LHL could do it.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Indonesia should forget outdated ASEAN ideas<br><br>Endy M. Bayuni, The Jakarta Post, Jakarta<br><br>Following the signing of the ASEAN Charter, Indonesia must rethink its position vis-a-vis the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, especially with regard to the group's usefulness as Indonesia's main vehicle for pursuing its foreign policy objectives.<br><br>What was supposed to be a historic moment for ASEAN, during the summit in Singapore last month, quickly turned into something of an anticlimax, as we saw the extent to which the charter had become a watered down version of the original "bold and visionary" principles laid down by ASEAN's eminent creators.<br><br>The charter is indeed a watershed in ASEAN's 40-year history, which is putting the brakes on the region's march toward a unified community by 2020.<br><br>The charter is nothing more than a collection of old principles which the ASEAN's 10 members have agreed on. It is not exactly a document that takes us to the next level of cooperation.<br><br>Community building, in other words, has become more rhetoric than an objective ASEAN is seriously or actively pursuing.<br><br>The only thing the charter will achieve, once ratified, is to turn the group into a formal organization, from the loose network of nations it has been for the past 40 years.<br><br>The loose and informal nature of ASEAN has actually worked wonders, and won the group accolades as a model for a regional organization in the 1990s. Thanks to ASEAN, Southeast Asia was transformed, from a region of conflict in the 1960s, into a region of peace and development for the majority of member states in the area by the 1990s.<br><br>ASEAN's informality, the non-binding nature of its decisions, the consensus principle in its decision-making process and the principle of non-interference in members' affairs, have all served their purpose to make ASEAN meet most of the objectives and serve in the national interests of its members -- primarily in the security and development sectors.<br><br>There is a growing realization, however, the "ASEAN Way" no longer serves the group's interests in the 21st century, in which the geopolitical environment has drastically changed.<br><br>ASEAN needs to change its ways to meet the challenges of the times. The rise of China and India as regional economic superpowers and rapid economic globalization make it necessary for ASEAN to come up with a unified response.<br><br>Sadly, the charter does not take ASEAN any further than where it stands at present. Decisions will still be made largely on consensus, countries must refrain from commenting on the domestic affairs of other members and Indonesia's proposals for the insertion of universal democratic values and for the creation of a human rights council were largely shot down during the deliberation process.<br><br>What worked for ASEAN in the past may not necessarily work again for the present or future. The 40th anniversary was supposed to bring momentum for ASEAN leaders to make the leap, and take their people into the 21st century.<br><br>This, they failed to achieve as bureaucrats worked hard to turn what was essentially a bold visionary proposal by ASEAN's eminent creators, into an almost meaningless charter.<br><br>Indonesia, as the largest member, stands to lose most from the lost momentum. After a hiatus of almost five years, in 2002 a new and more democratic Indonesia resumed the leadership of ASEAN by coming out with a proposal to turn the region into a regional community by 2020, and once agreed on, came up with a proposal to make ASEAN a formal organization.<br><br>Is Indonesia is moving too fast for the rest of ASEAN?<br><br>No. Indonesia is simply responding to the challenges of the new Asia, given the emergence of China and India as the region's economic powers. The single community idea and the charter are the correct responses, if ASEAN member states wish to remain relevant as one group in the emerging Asia. The alternative is for ASEAN members to go their own separate ways in meeting the new challenges.<br><br>Where does this leave Indonesia today?<br><br>Indonesia should go ahead and ratify the ASEAN Charter, but, at the same time, must realize the limitations of ASEAN under present regimes in other member countries, in pursuing many of our foreign policy objectives.<br><br>It is not so much a lack of leadership that makes ASEAN a weak organization, as it is the lack of willingness of other members to change their ways, including the adaptation of universal democratic values and human rights principles.<br><br>ASEAN and its charter is increasingly becoming a straitjacket for Indonesia's foreign policy.<br><br>Rather than pursuing a partnership on the basis of geographical proximity, Indonesia should be looking at forging partnerships and alliances with countries that share the same values and interests with us.<br><br>As far as democracy and freedom are concerned, this would mean closer relations with Japan, Australia and India in our own neighborhood and the United States and the European Union further afield.<br><br>ASEAN, meanwhile, will develop only as fast as its slowest members.<br><br><a href="http://www.thejakartapost.com/detailheadlines.asp?fileid=20071210.A04&amp;irec=3" rel="nofollow">http://www.thejakartapost.com/detailheadlines.asp?fileid=20071210.A04&amp;irec=3</a></div>
