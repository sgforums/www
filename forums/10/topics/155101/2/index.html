So like the frog who got boiled lah...<br><br></div></blockquote>Such amazingly intelligent remark by our MP!<br><br>I bow to his/her superior intelligence.<br><br>The MP must have thought that it is cheaper to pay 1 MRT CEO mega peanuts salary than paying 2 CEOs mega peanuts salaries. Likewise for bus. Also it would save confusing the public when there is only 1 price rise rather than 2 different price rise as in the cases of the taxis. With only 1 MRT operator, the public can look forward to possibly cheaper rides because of economies of scales.<br><br>But of course, the public should also be apprehendable that the CEO need pay rise every year too. So lets be empathetic and agree to price rise every year to encourage our smart MRT and Bus CEO to stay on and discourage any form of corruptions which I think is already at a near zero state (and thus a further justification of the higher pay of the CEOs).<br><br>I so look forward to next year's price hike as I know it will contribute to the salaries of the transportation CEOs and director. When they get pay rise, they will spend more money, such as getting Mercedez SLR for their sons. When they spend more money, they contribute to the economy of singapore (by both buying the cars and paying $70 fines).<br><br>Blessed are we the normal citizens of singapore!<br><br></div>
