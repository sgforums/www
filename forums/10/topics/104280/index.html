Instructions for making bombs can be found on the internet and the resources needed can be easily purchased from NTUC, Guardian, and any agriculturial shop. If you want to make the thingy more potent, you can make a cylinder bomb {which has been done before and killed many}.<br><br>My CSM was a explosive specialist and he showed us different methods of explosive construction. It is not difficult really. Hence, I support the removal of dustbins. I rather walk an extra 100m to dispose my rubbish then to have a potential bomb next to me when I am in the MRT.</div>
