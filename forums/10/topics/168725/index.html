            <div class='col-md body'>In Sahara there is these huge "pools", higher ground surrounded lower areas which are these huge "pools" on desert, that some has even big areas under sea-level in bottom of these "pools". These pools mostly are located very near coast-line, and with pumps and pipes of few hundred kilometers these "pools" could be filled with sea-water, until vaporizing (increasing while wideness of "pools" would expand) would match water flowing in, when surface of "pools" would stop rising and around them would be coming huge oasisÂ’s (as sand filters salt from sea-water, when few meters from coast of these "pools" would be easy to get fresh water with dwells and pumps), and these oasisÂ’s could reach kilometers inland as water travels far away in sand. For agricultural activities and inhabitation there would be huge areas to be used, these "pools" would be biggest lakes in the world.<br><br>But real meaning of these pools would be elsewhere, because vaporizing from those would be huge in worldÂ’s warmest areas with most heat radiation from sun (without clouds). Water-steam would for clouds filled with water, that would be going with major winds to south and east (for example as turned by coriolis-force) into mountains middle of Sahara and mountains west in Arabian peninsula, forming rains at least finally there. It would form rivers and lakes into area, from which there is obvious signs around mountains in middle of Sahara from past times (from last ice age, when Sahara was inhabited by black Africans).<br><br>Reason why these "pools" would change situation so radically is that air-masses rise to upper layers of atmosphere from equator, until arriving to north and coming down at 30Â´-line east-west (at coast of Libya/Egypt), and go from there as winds we notice to south and north, leaving winds going south without moisture from Mediterranean Sea, as winds going to north (Europe) will have all of it. So only way to get moisture to Sahara is to move water-masses from Mediterranean Sea to these "pools" under this 30Â´-line to vaporize (Mediterranean Sea will have water more through Gibraltar straits from Atlantic).<br><br>Only bad side this could have would be destruction of unhabited waste-land desert, when besides worthless deserts there would be lots of land suitable for agricultural and living use, providing living for millions of unemployment workers and people without land (believe me, deserts will be green as long as they get enough water, seeds for plants have come there by wind, in nature-document water was poured in top of dune and green plant rose from it, dying without water until it got more water and got back to life). Here would be huge opportunities for profits, buy worthless desert and change it for agricultural use, even possibly oil could be trilled from bottom of these pools and transported to coast by ships (cheaper than by trucks) or by underwater-pipes (no danger of sabotage). Also water pumping from under Libyan desert would get more fresh water below desert sand from these pools. These ideas can be expanded by even redirecting rivers just before it will end into oceans, so that fresh water of it will not be Â“wastedÂ” but used to water deserts.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Anybody here who thinks this is possible?<br><br>And how about some critics, I can then answer to guestions, with propably more accurately explaining some details that do not come too obvious from this writing.<br><br>If mankind is on earth during next ice age (signs from it already there, like Gulf-stream slowing down 20% in last five years period, some scientist predict that Britain might have climate of Alaska in next 20 years), deserts of Arabs (Sahara+Middle-East) is going to be green, as they were during last ice age when black Africans inhabited even nowadays deserts of Libya.<br>Noticeably here is for example satellite pictures taken from Saudi-Arabian desert, In these pictures anyone can clearly see old river streams going under desert, and from there founded remains of gardens and agricultural activity.<br><br>And so it will be during next ice age after change in climate and rainfalls. But this does not exclude possibility that humans themselves could make them green (increasing so "lungs of Earth" ), and it could happen this way.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
