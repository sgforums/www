              <p><span>SINGAPORE: A majority of Singaporeans will get a full subsidy if they choose a Class B2 or C ward when hospitalised.
              <br> <br> That's because those earning S$3,200 and below a month will now be eligible for it.
              <br> <br> Health Minister Khaw Boon Wan unveiled the benchmark for means-testing
              in Parliament on Monday, after months of public feedback on the issue.
              <br> <br> Means testing will kick in next January.
              <br> <br>The Ministry of Health (MOH) has made good its promise that it will
              "err on the side of generosity" when it comes to deciding how much
              subsidy patients get. <br> <br> Mr Khaw said: "I have assured Singaporeans that we will take a
              practical approach to means-testing. We will be flexible at the margins
              to help those who may appear to be of high-income but who have
              exceptional financial liabilities. We have decided to set the criteria
              more loosely so as to mitigate the impact on those who may be
              affected."
              <br> <br>So patients earning S$3,200 and below will get the full 80 per cent
              subsidy if they opt for a Class C ward and a 65 per cent subsidy for a
              Class B2 ward. <br> <br> Higher income earners will get subsidies on a sliding scale of one percentage point, depending on their income range.
              <br> <br> This is capped at 65 per cent for Class C wards and 50 per cent for Class B2 wards for those earning more than S$5,200.
              <br> <br> Economically inactive patients will also receive full subsidies unless
              they live in a property with an Annual Value exceeding S$11,000. <br> <br> As for Permanent Residents, their subsidies will be 10 percentage points lower than Singaporeans of equivalent income level.
              <br> <br> But the Health Minister hopes patients will subscribe to MediShield to
              help themselves further with the payment of their hospital bills. <br> <br> He said: "Those who earn more, say S$3,000 or S$4,000 per month, should
              top up a rider which would enable them to use the higher ward classes.
              If they do so, then they will not need to use Class B2 or C and compete
              with low-income patients for such resources." <br> <br> MOH is working out the implementation details and has assured that it will be automated and hassle-free. 
              <br> <br> As for those who feel the simplified approach has treated them
              unfairly, a thorough means-test will be conducted upon their appeal and
              will be based on the approach that is currently used by nursing homes."
              <br> <br> And there was more good news.
              <br> <br> From 1 April 2008, Medisave can be used for the outpatient treatment of
              two more chronic diseases - asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary
              disease or COPD.
              <br> <br>The withdrawals will be capped at S$300 per Medisave account per
              year. The existing deductible of S$30 and co-payment of 15 per cent
              will apply.
              <br> <br> This brings to six the total number of chronic diseases under this scheme.
              <br> <br> The other four chronic diseases are diabetes, hypertension, lipid disorders and stroke. 
              <br> <br> Some 180,000 Singaporeans are expected to benefit from the move.
              <br> <br>Mr Khaw also revealed that the 19 per cent increase in healthcare
              budget will be used for greater investment in infrastructure
              development and boosting healthcare manpower.
              <br> <br>Over the next five years, 40 per cent more doctors, nurses,
              pharmacists and healthcare professionals will be added through active
              recruitment and new scholarships for allied healthcare professionals. <br> <br> For example, a new scholarship to sponsor Nanyang Polytechnic graduates
              for a one-year degree courses will be given out. S$1.9 billion will be
              allocated for this manpower recruitment.
              <br> <br> Step-down care facilities, as well as existing hospitals will also be upgraded.
              <br> <br> And from April 2008, the Integrated Care Services will be upgraded into an Agency for Integrated Care. 
              <br> <br>Starting with Changi General Hospital and National University
              Hospital, this will equip public hospitals with resources including
              additional care coordinators. <br> <br> This is expected to cost the government S$20 million over four years.
              <br> <br> These coordinators will help ensure that patients who are fit for
              discharge but who have multiple complex care needs are transferred to
              appropriate step-down care providers. <br> <br> But Mr Khaw also reiterated his belief that everyone has to chip in to keep healthcare costs in check.
              <br> <br> Mr Khaw said: “I will do my part to ensure that Singaporeans will
              continue to enjoy healthcare that is among the best anywhere in the
              world. But higher spending often does not guarantee better health. <br> <br> Indeed, as noted by Mr Yeo Guat Kwang, it is the basics that we must
              continue to focus on which will bring about healthcare improvement:
              prevention and better management of chronic diseases. <br> <br> “For this I need the full co-operation from all Singaporeans: don't
              smoke, keep clean, don't spread bugs, don't overeat and keep active." <br> <br> The Health Minister was responding to MPs who asked about the
              government plans to meet future healthcare needs. -CNA/vm </span></p>

              <p>to get a HDB flat, the combine household salary must be under 8K. so yes,
              most ppl in HDB dwellers do make less then $3.2k each. If husband and wife both
              work, that is $6.4k for a combine household which would include almost 80% of
              all those living in the HDB.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Good thing out of this is that, those old retirees are now looked after. At least
              that left over 20% bill are more affortable by their family compare to the 100%. Dun forgets, the
              one paying need not be earning less then $3.2k in order for their old men to
              get this 80% discount. So does this mean that even a retired wealthy one also
              get the discount if he dun really have any income?</p>

              Yes,class C ward do get subsidy.But by claiming that 
                 govt subsidise 70% or 80%,how did they come out this
                 amount?
                  For example,the class C room charge/per day  at NUH 
                  is $27.(after subsidy).But from the hospital bill itself,the charge for class C bed Before Govt subsidy is
               $155.Is it logical?
                    From the above rate,they tell us class C ward gets 80% subsidy.

              <p>From your info: $155.00 x 80% = $124.00. Therefore Class C room charges after subsidy should be $31.00 and not $27.00. Is that what you mean?</p>

              We are here talking  about health subsidy,my question is,how did they came out the (before subsidy) amount?
                Class C ward is basically a room shared with 8 beds/or 7 beds,with no air-con,no tv.The rate $155 is just the bed charge /or they call it room charge.The above is without treatment fee,doctor fee,medications,investigations fee etc etc.
