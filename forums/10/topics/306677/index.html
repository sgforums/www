              <p> </p>
              <p>i must say maids have their roles to play in a double-income sg.</p>

              <p>maids are strangers 1st.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>maids come from all places.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>what can scan a brain for violence , cheat, liars, evil, crazy?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>how much is your child worth? no offence. what i mean , hope you know.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>for income or double income or convenience or 'comfort',  maids are hired.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>not all maids are bad. needless to say. but the question and subject here is your child - at the weakest stage of a person's life both mentally, physically and psychologically.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>for simplistic convenience, people hire maids to look after their child. I wonder how much they value they flesh and blood.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>some say, boh pian. no choice. what to do.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>ricebowl more important or a child's wellbeing?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i like to bring attention to ways in which your child can be exposed to risks and evils that evil maids or ignorant maids can bring to your child - even without anyone knowing.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>if you know what i talking about, there is no need to exprain. if you no no , also i dun bother to exprain.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>its not easy not to have maids for some. convenience or whatever.</p>
              <p>but as intellectuals, I hope, parents spend a quiet moment of say 10 minutes and think what i say : How much, REALLY, do you value your child?</p>

              <p>... in a country like Singapore, wherein its "leaders" emphasis &amp; focus is soley on Economy &amp; Economic Endeavours, such values &amp; balances between Rice Bowls &amp; Childcare has long since become 2nd priority - or even by now placed further down to 3rd or 4th...</p>

              <p>The world value you based on what you can contribute to the world and they pay you your worth only AFTER you had made your contribution.</p>
              <p>Your parents gave birth to you and brought you up, but your parents certainly never value you based on what you can provide for them. How much are you worth really is entirely up to you to show.</p>

              <p>When I was born, many babies were also born, but there did not make me any less valuable to my parents, because I was the only child to my parents. The other babies were never part of the supply demand equation in my house.</p>
              <p>So what was my price tag? my parent would never sell me for any money, instead, they spent the next 20 years, bringing me up, providing for my education....how to put a price tag? especially the emotional support when I encountered failure, fell sick.... even now, they are helping me with the bringing up of my children. I really don't know how to put a price tag on that.</p>
              <p>It I consider those as your parent's investment in you, then what would be the return on investment? now that you have grown up, what can you provide for you parents, and that would be your worth to your parents. If your parents live till 90, no job after 55, can they count on you fully for their old age, or they have to count on government handouts, or from charitable organisations? I guess that would be the question to your parents: what is your child worth?</p>
              <p>I don't look at the question from the point of the TS. Parents use maids because they wanted to give their kids the best care, even if they have their parents and in laws to help. There are many misconceptions about how best to bring up the kids. It is not about the value of the kids, and certainly not about supply and demand. Happy New Year.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>there is no price tag on a kid though. when i was born, i have both parents though. then my dad left the home, my mum left us for a while too. my bro and i were put up at a boarding school. my mum came to visit us, saw us in the pitiful state that we are in. She is still so young then, she could have walked away, she could have chosen not to turn back . but she did chose in the end to take care of us. why? there's no benefit to her, two children with her would only be burden to her. but she did not think of it this way. she loves us and could not bear to see us live like this though. she took us to go live with her. she is a mother and a father to us. she try to give us the best that she could with the best that she could. she did all these because she loves us. we are priceless to her. so there is no price tag on the kids, because a mother's love is unconditional, with no strings attached.</p></div>
