              <p>my take is this is a very clever letter. it steer clear of specifics less jbj loses his pants again, yet get the point across the LHL should come out a defend the system rather than hide behind the daddy.</p>
              <p>this is the type of alternative voice we need, thought provoking but not inciteful (of violence), so people are expose to an alternative view and decide and make informed choices for themselves.</p>
              <p>can the present opposition write as succinctly as jbj? i think not. that's why LKY praise Low TK; because he is entry level.</p>

              <p>To me, it seems like JBJ is itching for an election to come asap. This letter is written as a 'dare' to our PM. If PM accepts, he will likely be labelled as behaving like a kid who accept dares just like that. Yet if he don't accept, he will likely be labelled as a coward by JBJ. Hmmm....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And seems like our resident autistic troll has nothing to say about JBJ's article with his new nicks.</p>

              <p>I support the idea that to bring across any message, there is usually no need to be too direct.  Being too direct or without tact could be self-defeating.</p>
              <p>TOC's style of 'commenting' is quite safe.</p>
              <p>However, I wonder how TOC came about. Is it supported by any agency?</p>
              <p>I really am clueless 100%.</p>

              <p>Again u show yourself to make lousy conclusions based on insufficient facts. I do not like democracy and think liberal democracy do not works, doesn't mean I have to hate all the opposition party members.Andy lau acted in some lousy shows before. Just because I hate some of the movies doesn't means I have to everyone involved in the movie. Just because u hate the PAP, it doesn't means u hate all the "old guards" and all the MPs in it as well.</p>
