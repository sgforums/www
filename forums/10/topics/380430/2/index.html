              <p>I think only in Singapore are PRs allowed to write to the media to tell citizens to be more loyal to the country.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>One funny point picked up in another forum was that this guy mentioned in his letter that uni grads he met wanted to migrate to Spain and Italy, which is very funny since not many singaporeans can speak spanish or italian, so why would they want to migrate to those countries.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Expect more of these kinds of propoganda letters in the coming months.  I reckon one publication per month in the local papers should be good enough reminder to singaporeans that they should be grateful to the incumbent party. </p>

              <p>Haha sorry to burst your bubble,I'm a graphic designer (which means I'm working not living off my parents), I think I hardly fit the bill of a dog. I'm 22 most probably younger than you, and I don't give a flying rat's ass about politics. It's just your tone I dislike to the core, so I had to point it out. Free speech, if you don't like everything people say about what you post, then don't come on here and bring in the "hate".</p>
              <p>And I was right. You haven't been overseas long enough. Oh well. Good day to you.</p>
