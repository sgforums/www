              more than permanent residents per year. For that, you have to serve NS
              if you are male, and watch some of your PR friends sell their HDBs for
              a good profit and then return to their (sometimes) cheaper home
              countries to enjoy retirement.<br> <br> <br> As a Singapore citizen, here’s what you enjoy (reference: ST, 24 Oct 2009):<br> 
              <ul>
              <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Child birth</span>.
              If you stay in a Class B2+ ward, you pay $475. For PR, it’s $506, which
              is $31 more. The average Singapore woman has about 1 child and will
              thus get the $10,000 baby bonus (we ignore the fact that she will have
              to split the bonus with her husband). Spread over 20 years of providing
              for the child, the baby bonus amounts to $500 per year. Total child
              birth benefit: $31 + $500 = <strong>$531/yr</strong>.</li>
              <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Childcare subsidy</span>. Singaporean working mum gets a $300/mth subsidy while PRs get nothing. Total childcare benefit: <strong>$3,600/yr</strong>.</li>
              <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">School fees</span>. PRs pay $2,884 more than Singaporeans per child for the 16 years of education all the way to university. This is <strong>$180/yr</strong>.</li>
              <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Marriage fees</span>. Insignificant.</li>
              <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Housing</span>. Though PRs are not eligible to buy new flats, many
              Singaporeans also do not buy new flats. Since both citizens and PRs are
              eligible to buy resale flats, for ease of comparison, we will treat
              housing benefit as insignificant.</li>
              <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Health subsidies</span>. Citizens get about 10% more subsidy than
              PRs. Assuming that an average citizen spends $20k over 10 years, this
              10% difference amounts to <strong>$200/yr</strong>.</li>
              </ul>
              Grand total: <strong>$4,511 per year</strong>. Note that if you’re single, it would be just $200 per year.<br> <br> <br> No wonder the ST reporter Zakir Hussain said “the distinctions between citizens and PRs could not have been clearer.”</div>

              <p>xtreyier we don't owe a living to the ruling party.  They owe us a living.  Without us there is no PAP.   We are the ones who feed them.     But they are behaving the other way round.</p>

              <p>Amazing that you should ask how much does Yxxxone cost at this stage ?</p>
              <p>Considering the X-rated intellectual performance displayed todate, it is obvious that not much have been spent at your birth and on your development.</p>
              <p>Do you believe that the items you managed to list from 1 to 9 - are infrastructural development made possible as a result of our CPF money that the PAP Government borrowed at 2 per cent a year, but will in turn repeatedly charge Singaporeans for their use throughout their economic life ?</p>
              <p>The CPF monies borrowed have also been supplemented by a slew of government imposed taxes - both  direct and indirect - that include Income Tax, GST, Stamp Duties, Development Tax, Property Tax, Petrol Tax, COE, ERP, Utility Consumption Tax, Toilet Tax, Garbage Tax, Radio &amp; TV Licensing Fees,</p>

              <p>Arapahoe, I pity you, really.</p>
              <p>Your lack of comprehension coupled with naivety is telling. No wonder people like you is so easily manipulated by the more devious turds here to achieve their nefarious aims.</p>
              <p>Where did i say or even IMPLIED the people owes PAP or the govt a living???</p>
              <p>I know others to twist my words, but you too? And for what? To destroy all that our forefathers had achieved?</p>
              <p>I stress here and make it clear on my stand - NO ONE OWES ANYONE A LIVING except BEING RESPONSIBLE TO EACH OTHER AS CITIZENS.</p>
              <p>You talk of generalities, yet you have not admitted WHO provided the funds to build our infrastructures. Is it the govt, is it the foreigners. who? No one but US and our forefathers. How much had they contributed, as a member of our society? More than money, for there was sacrifices made. Our freedom came at a price they made which is priceless and beyond whatever calculation any model can derive upon, which is my point i am trying to bring across in my post, which you, blinded by your hatred,personal contempt for law, order and democracy, is unable to comprehend.</p>
              <p>Be glad i am personally responding to you, for i dont respond to turds, unless I intend to lead the idiot deeper into her graves, But for you, i made an exception, because i dont for 1 minute presume you a turd, just naive only.</p>

              $4,511 More Than a PR Per Year</strong></span><br> October 31st, 2009<br> <br> According to our calculations, your citizenship is worth $4,511
              more than permanent residents per year. For that, you have to serve
              NS if you are male, and watch some of your PR friends sell their
              HDBs for a good profit and then return to their (sometimes) cheaper
              home countries to enjoy retirement.<br> <br> <br> As a Singapore citizen, here’s what you enjoy (reference: ST, 24
              Oct 2009):<br> 
              <ul>
              <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Child birth</span>.
              If you stay in a Class B2+ ward, you pay $475. For PR, it’s $506,
              which is $31 more. The average Singapore woman has about 1 child
              and will thus get the $10,000 baby bonus (we ignore the fact that
              she will have to split the bonus with her husband). Spread over 20
              years of providing for the child, the baby bonus amounts to $500
              per year. Total child birth benefit: $31 + $500 =
              <strong>$531/yr</strong>.</li>
              <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Childcare
              subsidy</span>. Singaporean working mum gets a $300/mth subsidy
              while PRs get nothing. Total childcare benefit:
              <strong>$3,600/yr</strong>.</li>
              <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">School fees</span>.
              PRs pay $2,884 more than Singaporeans per child for the 16 years of
              education all the way to university. This is
              <strong>$180/yr</strong>.</li>
              <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Marriage fees</span>.
              Insignificant.</li>
              <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Housing</span>.
              Though PRs are not eligible to buy new flats, many Singaporeans
              also do not buy new flats. Since both citizens and PRs are eligible
              to buy resale flats, for ease of comparison, we will treat housing
              benefit as insignificant.</li>
              <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Health
              subsidies</span>. Citizens get about 10% more subsidy than PRs.
              Assuming that an average citizen spends $20k over 10 years, this
              10% difference amounts to <strong>$200/yr</strong>.</li>
              </ul>
              Grand total: <strong>$4,511 per year</strong>. Note that if you’re
              single, it would be just $200 per year.<br> <br> <br> No wonder the ST reporter Zakir Hussain said “the distinctions
              between citizens and PRs could not have been clearer.”</div>

              <p>No, citizens get 30,000 to 40,000 CPF grants for buying a HDB flat for the first time in the resale market. PRs do not, unless the PR is married to a citizen.</p>
              <p>And for the ward subsidy, I believe that is $31 per day right? I'm pretty sure one doesn't just stay in the ward for a day after childbirth, but I'm not 100% confirmed about it.</p>

              <p>This must be the most pathetic performance by the X-rated intellect of a X-rat to sink so low as to insult others to be as low as itself for being naive in allowing itself to be manipulated by intelligent propaganda created by those with intelligence much higher than its X-rated intellect.</p>
              <p>Only a X-rated intellect will believe that a human can be manipulated by a turd, which perhaps the X-rated intellect has no capacity to make its own, as it suffers from a constipation of ideas and must depend on swallowing all the turd produced by those with far higher intellect than its little mind cannot imagine.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>When so many can read the implication of the message from a X-rat, does anyone need it to be told in more explicit terms that "<em>NO ONE OWES ANYONE A LIVING except BEING RESPONSIBLE TO EACH OTHER AS CITIZENS</em>" ?</p>
              <p>Do Singaporeans expect another Singaporean to owe them a living, or is it incorrect for Singaporeans to expect the PAP that formed the Singapore Government to be responsible to the well being of Singaporeans ?</p>
              <p>Why is the X-rat so consistent in following the PAP Government in dissuading anyone from depending on the PAP Government - to claim on behalf of the PAP government that it does not owe Singaporeans "a living", and will insist that Singaporeans are to be responsible for our own well being ?</p>
              <p>Is it due to the fact that the PAP Government is like th X-rat with both being bankrupt of ideas as to how to move forward, and bending Golden Rules to move ahead ?</p>

              <p> It is amazing that the X-rated intelligence of a rat will know that the money taken for the development of our infrastructure - is from the pockets of Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>Yet it is stupid enough not to realise that after taking our money in all the various sly forms created to suck our hard earned money, the government will use the money to build all the essential services and all the infrastructure <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">to make more money by charging us at market rates</span></strong> for our required dependence on the infrastructure.</p>
              <p>Even when infrastructural investments such as the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.smrt.com.sg/trains/fares.asp">‘Singapore MRT’ (*1) </a>are built with PUBLIC Money and with the infrastructure costs stated to be subsidised, the fares charged are more expensive than <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mtr.com.hk/jplanner/flash_eng/index.php">‘Hong Kong’s MTR’ (*2) </a>that had been built by PRIVATE money - (a fare calculation of one station distance and six stations travelled show that the Singapore fare is consistently higher than Hong Kong's).</p>
              <p>Even when our CPF money is loaned to the PAP Government at a low cost of two per cent per annum to build HDB estates, the homes are sold at market prices that allow the government to achieved a profit of more then 100 per cent.</p>
              <p>Is it any wonder that Singaporeans retire with the bulk of their CPF spent to achieve an 'asset rich' but 'cash poor' situation ?</p>
              <p>Still the X-rated intelligence of a rat will have Singaporeans to depend on ourselves, and not to expect ANYONE - especially the PAP Government to owe us a living.</p>
              <p>Somehow the X-rat is only interested in being a dumb plagiarist without any scruples to be discerning but will merely regurgitate any critique that the PAP has defensively created to counter-attack any criticism when it cannot counter any legitimate critique levelled at its position.</p>
              <p>It is plain dumb for the X-rat to think that it has the capacity to imitate the PAP, who is far more cunning than the X-rated intellect of a dumb rat. </p>

              <p>Does anyone respond to the turd that one produces every day ?</p>
              <p>With all the verbal turd that the X-rated intellect has been producing, does anyone expect the X-rat to have any honesty to claim responsibility for its own turd let alone to answer to any turd ?</p>
              <p>It must be desperate time for a bankrupt mind of a X-rated intellect to even have to consider talking to a piece of turd that it sees, perhaps that is the only way that it must be so as to avoid replying to the honest truth that has exposed the bankrupt position that a X-rated intellect has plagiarised but has no capacity to defend.</p>
              <p>With the X-rated intellect possessed by a turd, surely it must be suffering from daily constipation as it avoid to face the truth revealed even by a turd.</p>

              <p> It is only characteristic for a rat - that has been cornered - to continue to be deluded in its struggle that it will find an opening in the cage.</p>

              <p>Is it not typical of the X-rat to believe in its own hot gas and think that turds will fall from the sky without any efforts from the X-rat ?</p>
              <p>Obviously the X-rat will believe that without any effort it will move its food along its digestive system into its bowels, which unfortunately has been clogged by its refusal to put any effort to move it out of its bowels, and has caused its state of constipation.</p>
              <p>The resulting constipation of ideas is a result of its brains being stuck in the matters of its bowels - if only it had placed some effort to move it out of its own body to benefit mankind instead of waiting for its turd to drop from the sky.</p>
              <p>Only the X-rat will not appreciate the value of what it so quickly dismiss, when a piece of turd has revealed more value than the X-rated intellect can hope to produce.</p>
              <p>The supposedly worthless and derided fecal waste, offal and odours has provided for the betterment of life amongst the poorest communities in India - in that the gas that a piece of turd can produce has provided cheap energy for cooking and for lighting.</p>
              <p>What good is the hot gas that a X-rat produced that it hang on so preciously and only to become intoxicated by its gas of self-importance ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Thank you Atobe, for finally revealing and admitting you are a piece of Turd. A piece of turd that no more displays the truth as what a turd represents - rubbish.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Can we depend on the proven dishonesty of a X-rat - who has been repeatedly exposed for its own rubbish that does not even take any solid form, but based on its expertise in creating the hot gas that it produces from its constipation of ideas ?</p>
              <p>The X-rated intellect can hardly be comparable even to the solid waste in rubbish that has even proven to be a worthy source of alternative energy.</p>
              <p>What can anyone make from the recycled parts of a rat when its parts are too toxic and the X-rated intellect is not even worth any trouble to be used as research ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Let no one else here forthwith with her this latest post need be bothered by the turd, for she is only a self admitted piece of comtemptible offal offering only twisted coils of rubbish.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is pathetic that the X-rat has lost its calm composure to display its creative insulting best that can only come from a bankrupt mind unable to counter the puncturing points that deflated its untebable position to attract attention to its presumptious importance - with plagiarised pieces from others more capable then its hopeless self.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Herzog, you take credit for coining her as such, for I remember you the first one who saw thru her as what she was and named her for what she really is. Bravo!  </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As have been noted, the bankrupt mind of a X-rated intellect has only the abilities to plagiarized other's works while it prefer to wait for the sky to fall on its tiny brain.</p>
              <p>It must be so lonely to stand on an unstable position of speculated facts that have been shown to be hollow, and it is stupid to attempt to desparately find a way out of the trap that it walked itself into while its head is filled by its own hot gas of self-import.</p>
              <p>Is there any use to attempt to draw support from others who prefer not to stand with a charlatan who will even double-cross its own tongue - to support the WP, SPP and RF - even as it defend vigorously the harmful policies of the PAP government towards ordinary Singaporeans, who only expect the minimum from the government in terms of job security, social and economic security, and national security ?</p>
              <p>Still the dumb X-intellect will tell Singaporeans that "No One - not even the PAP that make-up the Singapore Government - will owe us anything, and that we should look after ourselves".</p>

              <p>I see.</p>
              <p>So, the only option seems that one should be like the PRs ie save much as one can while in Singapore and move to an adopted country to live and retire comfortably or choose to move to another adopted country when better opportunities prevail in the adopted country as what the PRs do.</p>

              <p>SG Doesnt allow dual citizenship. means that if u get another country citizenship, you have to revoke your sg one.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and if you revoke your citizenship, you arent entitled to reapply back as a PR. (if not im sure many would have done so)</p>

              <p>does that mean the old, sick,weak and unfortunate will have no place in singapore?</p>
              <p>well....thats a harsh society even by eastern or western culture!what culture is this anyway?</p>
              <p>sure no one owes anyone a living (u only tell this to a gangster extorting money from you)...........some people sits down at werk and dont werk all day......sees people take 2hr lunch and 1 hr teabreak............even saw people have sex during lunchtime !i dont know what the folklore of "no one owes anyone a living" means!as long as u can do your job  with good initial guidance and system within company,there shouldnt be any problems.</p>
              <p>hmmm,.......appears quite a few people here dont know much about singapore.....perhaps they arent even singaporeans from the way they address things here.anyway im sick of foreigners cumin in here n tellin nobody owes nobody anythin n how the ancestors built up spore crap.i can imagine some US president telling america "no one owes u anything but tell what u can give to your country"kinda crap!that us president was eventually targeted and shot dead next to his wife. kinda dumb speech and thoughts coming out from people leaders who are supposed to help people.</p>
