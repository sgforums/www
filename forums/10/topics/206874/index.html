            <div class='col-md body'>The talk of the town on Monday was the Prime Minister's National Day Rally speech.<br><br>Many felt it touched their lives. <span style="color: red;">Come on la... How the reporter know people are touched?? Media should report unbiasedly, not to curry favour the top</span><br><br>One was glad that it wasn't just about dollars and cents.<br><br>Even foreign-born citizens wanted their say.<br><br>Channel NewsAsia spoke to Singaporeans among the lunchtime crowd at Raffles Place, one day after PM Lee Hsien Loong's speech on Sunday.<br><br>They said they liked what they heard from PM Lee.<br><br>It was a speech that resonated with them, especially when the topics were close to their hearts.<br><br>"I quite like the part that he said that you know that Singaporeans need to have more babies. I feel that it is true," said a Singaporean. <span style="color: red;">Come on la... Insufficient babies problem is here since 1990s... it is a famous Singapore problem... I don't think Singaporean's intelligence is so low.</span><br>"I'm glad it wasn't just about goodies and dollars....I think the Singapore psyche is really a lot more than just dollars and cents," said another.<br><br>The Prime Minister's message on immigration also struck a chord with many Singaporeans.<br><br>They said that new immigrants add diversity.<br><br>And for those who have just arrived on our shores, they said that Singapore is a most welcoming home away from home.<br><br>"I'm here for more than 15 years now. For the local culture, I am used to it, I like the Singapore style," said one immigrant turned citizen.<br><br>"It means that you are all inclusive, that you welcome other people and not so protective," said another immigrant.<br><br>"People are very forthcoming, so that's a good sign that people are welcoming newcomers here," said a third.<br><br>"........Given a chance, definitely, I feel it's a good place to settle down," said a fourth.<br><br>Singaporeans also welcomed the idea of plugging into a new digital age, though some had reservations.<br><br>"It would definitely make information more readily available to more people," said one Singaporean.<br><br>"I think it's superb for our productivity, and the people get connected," said another.<br><br>But a third Singaporean said: "If it's viable, why aren't the schools already into it in the first place?"<br><br>Whatever their views, Singaporeans took Mr Lee's message to heart.<br><br>Although the Prime Minister spoke on wide-ranging topics, it seemed that the local issues mattered most. - CNA/ir<br></div>
