It is still happening everywhere creating situations like Shin Corp Merryl Lynch or Citibank where leaders of government can become their advisor while making decisions through grey areas without any one to stop them from potential wrong doings.<br><br>Through such widespread use of administrative and discretionary power in the laws, any ministers of government can tell the citizens "I should be paid more than the CEOs in the private sector because as government my responsibility is higher.<br><br>Actually he is elected to serve the people from his low position not worth a penny in many cases. How to compare is a trick. After getting into power one can definitely give a different twist to his own worth.<br><br>So many ministers without inventing apples or micros and creating values or jobs can reward themselves as presumed talents and pay themselves legally and beyond the law and our judges or people cannot do anything to stop such crooked conduct.<br><br>So leaders can do all sorts of things of such nature and wrong beyond the law because they can go in and come out of all grey areas to serve to do things for their own personal benefits.<br><br>They can take monies from public fund legally though immorally by such power from the people without brinking an eyelid:-<br><br>They can make decisions by power while protected by the laws because such use of power fall into the grey areas where the judges cannot judge legally.<br><br>So anyone elected to government can take monies in the following legal manner including (non-exhaustive) :-<br><br>(1) Pass laws through elected parliament<br>(2) Tell the world we govern by rule of law<br>(3) Tell the world anyone breakers of law will be jailed or fined<br>(4) Then pass laws to protect them from queries,<br>(5) Then have a lot of front men and committees,<br>(6) Give them monies and power to act like proxies,<br>(7) Cover themselves nicely legally but always act from behind,<br>(8) Put up excuses to change laws<br>(9) Launch projects to spend monies<br>(10) Say grey things like we need talents,<br><br>Then one will succeed in governing corruptly yet legally and look good.</p></div>

              <p>Hi Stupidissmart,</p>
              <p>There is nothing wrong with rewarding talents or meritocracy in theory or concept. What is wrong is the selfishness in narrowly implementing it to create protectionism or cronyism of all kinds. This point has been made many times too by ex-civil servant an insider of the ruling party who knew the facts. He called it auto-piloting in the context that once the supreme made a policy of such nature, no one can change it and it becomes auto-piloted until big problems came to stare at his face. Yet with such glaring errors - there are too many - he is too proud to admit mistakes and keep giving excuses to postpone problems and refuses to change.</p>
              <p>That is why Singapore has been straitjacked by one man who is too proud of his many concepts aimed at taxing the people to the fullest and sucking monies for the government without creating values to sustain the whole business environment for the people.</p>
              <p>Look at all the prime jobs in the government and civil service. They go to whom? Except for hypocrisy in admitting lower to middle rung jobs all the senior positions are practically reserved for their own elites and connections. There is even an inner circle or some elite club who will be on the quiet preserve jobs for those in the circle. Those who are not in the circle have no chance of smelling the senior CEO posts.</p>
              <p>What about promotions they go to whom? Study the HR practices adopted department by department you will find those with insider connection getting these prime jobs? Is it not precisely some kind of Bumiputra as practised by UMNO. On the surface it is good as it assures the indigenious of opportunity to climb the economic ladder. But when it comes to implementation who will get those opportunities? The Malays as a whole are still not benefiting from such policy like NEP.</p>

              <p>Stupidissmart,</p>
              <p>I do not need to name names, many senior posts in government are reserved for elites connected to the government. There is a clandestine elite club somewhere which determines who get what senior posts. Very often these senior posts were filled by party insiders.</p>
              <p>There is no open system to determine the quality or ability of such connected candidates and these connected elites were not even interviewed by an independent panel to evaluate the real ability and potential for such positions.</p>
              <p>MPs and ministers may be politicians who may be selected from their own internal system. However positions of ministers and senior civil servants and senior positions in GLCs should be more open as they are paid by public funds and should be people who are independent so that they will by loyal to citizens and not to power that be.</p>
              <p>If senior chief justices, CEOs, permanent secretaries, and certain senior civil servants were chosen based on political loyalty it will bring about cronyism which is bad for the country.</p>
              <p>Let all public positions like these be chosen by meritocracy by an  independent panel unconnected to the party of leaders.</p>
              <p>Talking about meritocracy, it is therefore up to now only a facade or hypocrisy. There are many people outside the party with higher qualifications and abilities. But senior positions like CEOs and permanent secretaries are only limited. Without opening such positions to all the thousand of good people outside the connections are being bypassed so how can we claim such a system a real meritocracy?</p>

              <p>I don't know wat information u have access to but my impression is all these allegations r not founded on concrete evidence but on your own thinking. R they in because they r relatives of some people or they r in because of their results and other merits ? U sure they did not go through any interview at all ? Someone just write a note saying "Mr A is political secretary" then he become political secretary ?</p>
              <p>I think for such a big claim, u need to produce a big evidence. Otherwise I find it hard to believe.</p>

              <p>Just last week saw a Bollywood movie in tv. It showcases the culture of corruption in India. The story is about a family whose soldier son was killed in action. The government compensated by giving the family the licence to operate a petrol station. The bureaucratic nightmare then began for the family. Getting the land, the permit, the utilities, dealing with thugs, police, and even the military, all gave not too subtle "what will I get" whats in it for me". Complains to superiors get the response that that is the system. The story is about the patriach that refuses to pay a single cent in bribes. He succeeded in the end, with the intercession of the Prime Minister Ragiv Ghandhi. It is credited as a true story.</p>
              <p>One line in the dialogue struck me. A senior civil servant, told the patriach in all honesty: <strong>That the employee who takes bribes and does the job is an honest one. The one that takes a bribes and does not do the job is the corrupt one.</strong> </p>
              <p>I would rather corruption not be a way of life in Singapore.</p>

              <p>Dear Forummers,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>MP's Mr. Charles Chong has replied to my post as reproduced below for your information. Obviously he has not replied to the main issues and has evaded the issues which is the government has merely painted a good picture of itself using excuses like Meritocracy, Danger of Welfarism etc to do what it wants at the expense of the people.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He comes across as merely repeating what the government has always been telling the people - we are lucky and we could have been worse. Do you agree that he has dealt with the main issues raised in my post?</p>

              <p>QUOTE:</p>
              <p>Everything you listed below has been done and probably are still being done<br>by corrupt, incompetent or unscrupulous Governments in many countries. In<br>some ASEAN countries there isn't even an elected Government e.g. Myanmar.<br> <br>Ultimately, what is important is a sophisticated electorate that is able to<br>vote in capable leaders with integrity and empathy for the people. And a<br>political system that permits the electorate to vote out the corrupt,<br>incompetent and the unscrupulous and an opportunity to change its Govt.<br>through the ballot box.<br> <br>An example would be the recent Malaysian elections where the electorate in<br>some areas wanted change and voted out many incumbent veteran leaders and<br>voted in new leaders instead. The ruling coalition was also denied a two<br>thirds majority of seats in Parliament, thus denying them the ability to<br>change the constitution without the support of the opposition MPs.<br> <br>It is still left to be seen if this new situation will bring about a better<br>life for all Malaysians. However we wish the Malaysians well as any<br>turmoil in Malaysia or any neighbouring country is likely to have adverse<br>consequences in Singapore and the region.<br> <br>In Singapore, although we have adopted the Westminister style of<br>Government, we have also adapted it somewhat to introduce some degree of<br>checks and balance for the Govt. The Elected President (EP) is one such<br>institution. The EP has constitutional powers to check the Govt's spending<br>of the country's reserves, over the appointment of key personnel in the<br>Civil Service, military and judiciary and the protection of minority<br>rights.<br> <br>However if the electorate fails to elect a good President, then even the EP<br>will not be an effective check on a crooked Govt.<br> <br>Our political system is by no means a perfect system and is still evolving.<br>However it has served us not too badly over the years during the<br>transformation of Singapore from an impovershed state with a much higher<br>level of poverty and unemployment than what we have today (despite the<br>rising inflation and cost of living).<br> <br>Can it be better? Of course it can. In my view what is missing from our<br>local political scene is an opposition that can form a viable alternative<br>to the present Government. In many developed countries, e.g. USA, UK, etc.<br>the oppostion tries to win elections to take over the Govt. However in<br>Singapore the opposition only aspire to serve as "a check on the PAP Govt"<br>and at best to deny the Govt a two-thirds majority. What is the benefit to<br>the people if the opposition merely wants to check or deny the PAP Govt a<br>two-thirds majority? The Govt can govern the way it wants (short of<br>amending the constitution), even with a simple majority. Only by taking<br>over Govt. can a political party change policies and implement better<br>alternatives.<br> <br>Will we ever reach a situation where a viable alternative emerges? Well,<br>again in my view, it is likely only if the present Govt. mismanages badly<br>and the majority of the electorate feels there is a much better<br>alternative.<br> <br>Best Wishes<br> <br>Charles Chong<br>MP for Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC</p>

              <p>To: MP Charles Chong</p>
              <p>I have actually written this same email to nearly all MPs because I
              feel that the matter raised concerns all of us as citizens and MPs
              should be conscientious to look into all or any such issues and
              problems and do something to correct them in parliament<br><br>The
              problems I have raised concern the many policies put up by the
              government like "anti-welfarism", "meritocracy". "rule of law" etc as
              listed in my email which have been wrongfully implemented only to
              benefit certain elites and not the ordinary citizens. My conclusion is
              that these past policies were put up merely as facade to justify its
              narrow interest or hidden agenda of clinging onto power or glorify
              themselves at the expense of the people.<br><br>Is there a need to
              revisit these policies in the long term interest of the people? Is the
              past system of taxing and underspending tax monies to hoard them as
              surpluses a correct policy? is raising of GST at a time when we are
              having surpluses of some $6 billions pretended not to know of it a
              right move? Who is answerable for the raising of GST based on
              misrepresentation of the surplus almost amounting to deceit causing
              untold misery and hardship and runaway inflation of some 6% with no
              prospect of the government changing its course of perpetually raising
              taxes, fees and charges and hoarding tax monies as surpluses.<br><br>I
              sincerely feel that with so many highly educated elites and scholars in
              our government paid the world's best salaries and other reward they
              should be able to think out of the box and start looking for a good,
              healthy and more sustainable solutions honestly without all the same
              facade and hypocrisy.<br><br>I feel that we should be open with this
              topic and be prepared to discuss such issues as listed openly and be
              not shy to put up our views on websites and if necessary all the MPs'
              replies.<br><br>With due respect I feel that while I agree with you
              that we are not the worse country politically, and we have come a long
              way since independence, we could have been governed with greater
              compassion and righteous morality over the past many years. We are not
              a matured democracy and are too young a country to have realized the
              full goodness of democracy much as democracy has its own particular
              shortcomings.<br><br>The problem is today the government seems to
              believe it has all the solutions preferring to compare with worse
              scenarios in other younger democracies which suits them without being
              bothered to drop its many wrongful policies as stated in my email.<br><br>I
              feel sincerely that if our government leaders do not understand or
              bother with such problems preferring to  be obstriches burying their
              heads in the sand our MPs as elected representatives of the people
              should at least be more concerned and be courageous to raise them for
              discussions in parliament. I have put up a proposal to MPs to review
              our current constitution but have yet to elicit any response. Obviously
              the MPs only sidestepped all the main issues by pretending to by busy
              or away and to give an appropriate reply after looking into the matter.
              This sadly has been the standard replies received from other MPs. <br><br>I
              do hope the MPs will be as candid and forthcoming as yourself in
              engaging me on my particular views and inputs on our current political
              system which I regarded as full of pretentiousness and hypocrisy. Many
              policies as I have described in my email were put up as facade to serve
              only the narrow interest of the governing elites and leaders. In actual
              implementation the citizens do not benefit from such policies which
              have produced many unintended fallout and consequences.<br><br>I do not
              intend to elaborate further on these wrong policies of the government
              as many citizens have already done so including even the ex-civil
              servant like Mr. Ngiam Tong Dow with the insight of being part of
              government for many years who should therefore know what he is talking
              about and civic people like Dr. Catherine Lim.<br><br>Therefore what I
              have mentioned in my email is not unsubstantiated criticisms or
              problems caused by wrong policies of the government as many people have
              expressed them better all these time. <br><br>I do hope other MPs will
              be able to engage citizens on such issues and not avoid them like what
              they are now doing. Nearly all of them except for a few are giving some
              excuses to the effect they are outstation or away or busy and will look
              into my inputs as soon as possible. Are they truthful or putting wool
              over my eyes or are they complacent and becoming only yes-men because
              they have such a large comfort zone due to largely over-generous reward
              of jobs, monetary and other benefits cleverly put in store for them to
              keep them quiet and well behaved. These are the kind of MPs which were
              just thrown out by the people in the latest Malaysian elections because
              people have suffered from inactions due to their large comfort zone and
              complacency.<br><br>I pray that our MPs will act in the honest interest
              of the citizens and not give some excuses like "outstation" or "away"
              and never quite give a damn to reply or not.<br><br>This state of
              affair has been called complacency by no less than MM Lee. I look
              forward to more MPs being candid and will collectively raise issues I
              have raised to parliament in the next sitting in the interest of the
              country irrespective of the authoritarianism of the higher echelons as
              they as MPs are truly the conscience keeper of the people.<br><br>Yours faithfully<br><br>Robert Teh</p>
