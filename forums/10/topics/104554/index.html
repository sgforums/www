            <div class='col-md body'>Hi , i would like to address a serious issue in singapore, land , water ,  human shortage...<br><br>As you can see, indonesia and malaysia has no lack of it, but these above<br>4 points ive mentioned , might limit singapore's growth potential..<br><br>Singapore, although with it's "high-value added" industries.. is still a very small market , with low population growth rates, i am still sceptical about our future.<br><br>Water Resources, in about a few decades from now, we will be drinking completely NEWater.....These NEWater plants , if damaged could cause severe damage to singapore's infrastructure..<br><br>Land Resources, the most important issue for singapore's development,<br>our population , 1 critical point i must address, is that, IF Singapore's population increase...it will be "disastrous"  and IF Singapore's population decreases...it will also be the same..<br><br>Why? Firstly, according to a news report, Singapore only have enough land more to house 700,000 more people..<br><br>That means, our population will have problem shooting up above 5 million..<br><br>Considering that 1000 years later from now.. Indonesia , even with it's slow progressing rate, but with huge land resources...can effectively get it's population much above few hundred million<br><br>Malaysia as well, one day with high population...they will definitely catch up with us..<br><br>Our growth potential for our market is small...The "lboundaries" are small..<br>don't be surprised..1000 years later, we might be sandwiched in between giant super powers..<br><br>Even if we reclaim til the edge of the singapore waters...we definitely can't expand towards riau or batam..<br><br>Our land resources development potential is very limited..<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yaHz so? So do you recommend singapore build up her military powers and start our expansion programme? We take down Batam and Bintan first because we can ensure our survival?<br><br>Or do u recommend we use our tiny brains to overcome this obstacle? By looking dearly for ideas, i think the best way is to let commercial expansion towards johore, batam and bintan. Singapore itself will retain its 'hub' status where our core activities are held. By then there will be much technology that perhaps allow our borders to be transparent so travelling in and out of the country will be like getting on and off the mrt. Do you know now besides physically attacking a country, another country can commercially attack a country and bring it down? lolx..use ur blainlah</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>LOL here you go again. lemme just have fun by addressing the issue you have on physical land expansion. i personally have access to a super accurate and updated map of singapore.(don't ask me how). after taking a look at it, i was shocked by the amount of local territorial water available. for example, the dist of the indonesian border from the lowest tip of sentosa, is nothing more than the distance from cityhall mrt to around kallang mrt. that might seem alot at first thought, until you realise that whatever land is reclaimed = loss of sea routes and anchoring areas for ships, which import and export everything that is important in singapore. these areas, to me at least, really seemed to be absolutly maxed out. don't even freaking bother to "go international waters" if we can do that, so can malaysia and indonesia, and every other country in this small world.<br><br>i believe the key to singapore's survival would be the high standard of education of the younger generations and imparting good moral values to the youth, so they do not freaking only think about themselves and pangseh singapore.</div>
