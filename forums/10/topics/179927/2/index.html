So she may have been partially responsible for her own injuries.<br><br>And then after the expat agreed to extend her further compensation, she gave a wild figure of 50k, which was rightfully rubbished by his lawyer (she claims the money was to 'teach him a lesson' and that it would have been donated to charity, but can anyone truly believe that?).<br><br>Really, if she's disappointed, she has only herself to blame, seeing that she had the opportunity to be properly compensated but spit in his face instead.<br></div></blockquote>The issue is whether a fine of $1000 is adequate for such a behavior.What's the real problem for it?</div>

A jail term was probably warrented, but there are always mitigating circumstances in these cases and i doubt the ST was impartial in their reporting.<br><br>I don't doubt for a moment that the lady abused the guy the moment he kicked out at her dog in 'self-defence'.

That's because she asked for too much !<br><br>I was wrong. The $1000 was the maximum fine for the offence he had committed.
