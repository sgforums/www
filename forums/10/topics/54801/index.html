PI officially began operations in September 1995.<br><br>(Source: Sembawang venture to buy Technet for $2.5 m, The Straits Times, 20 Jun 1995, p. 40; Pacific Internet can start its services today, The Straits Times, 5 September 1995, p. 36).<br><br>Meanwhile, in May 1995, tenders were called for a third ISP. When tenders closed, six companies had bid for the license. The highest offer was from a joint venture between Times Publishing and AT&amp;T, which offered Singapore $5.101 million. The lowest bid was Singapore $450,000 by Cyberway , a joint venture between Singapore Press Holdings Multimedia, and ST (Singapore Technologies) Communications.<br><br>The Telecommunications Authority of Singapore said it hoped competition between the three ISPs would stimulate growth and diversity in the quality and range of Internet access services.<br><br>In September, it was announced that Cyberway had won the bid. The amount Cyberway had bid - $450,000 - became the amount each ISP in Singapore had to pay for the one-time license fee. If the highest bidder had won, each ISP would have had to pay $5.101 million.<br><br>(Source: Tender for third internet service provider, The Straits Times, 18 May 1995, p. 40; Times Pub and AT&amp;T submit highest bid for Internet license, The Straits Times, 1 July 1995, p. 47; Cyberway to become third Internet service provider, The Straits Times, 6 September 1995, p. 3)<br><br>In March 1996, Cyberway - now 55 per cent owned by Singapore Press Holdings, and 45 per cent by ST (Singapore Technologies) Communications - began operations.<br><br>(Source: Cyberway's Net entry heralds new price cuts, The Business Times, 22 March 1996, p. 2).<br><br>Only three ISPs are allowed to operate in Singapore at the moment, though other companies can buy access from these three ISPs and subsequently re-sell them. Singapore CableVision, the local cable company, looks to be an important re-seller if its cable modem trials are successful. It hopes to offer Net access at speeds of up to 10 Mbps.<br><br>By the year 2000, Singapore will be wired with fibre to the curb, and then co-ax to the home. Once this is in place, the infrastructure for high-speed Net access will be available to most Singaporeans.<br><br>(Source: Cable link promises fast access to the Net - in two years, The Sunday Times, 28 April 1996, p. 25).<br><br>Because only three companies are allowed to directly provide access to the Internet, problems have arisen. The launch of Windows95, which allows easy access to the Microsoft Network, and from there, the Internet, was marred because access to MSN would allow Singapore subscribers to bypass the three ISPs.<br><br>In December 1995, Microsoft and Singapore Telecom signed an MOU to create a new category of subscribers - Singnet/MSN.<br><br>These users would log on to MSN, and from there to the Internet, presumably via Singnet. Other arrangements were supposed to be made with the other two ISPs, and MSN was supposed to be officially launched in March this year (1996). So far though, there has been no news.<br><br>(Source: Launch clouded by questions over built-in access to Internet, The Straits Times, 23 August 1995, p. 40; SingNet will offer access to Microsoft Network next year, The Straits Times, 8 December 1995, p. 68; Micosoft Network targets March launch, Business Times , 17 January 1996, p. 3)<br><br>In another case, a local PC company Aris Microsystems, advertised that it was offering unlimited Internet access for its customers for Singapore $50 a month for a minimum subscription of six months. It was thought that the company was offering direct Net access, bypassing the three local providers.<br><br>The Telecommunications Authority of Singapore investigated the company. It found that Aris was re-selling access it had bought from Singnet, and that it was not offering a direct link to the Net. No action was taken against the company except a reprimand for offering "unauthorised access to the Internet."<br><br>(Source: TAS probes firm for unlicensed Internet services, The Straits Times, 12 December 1995, p. 3; TAS raps Aris for offering unauthorised Internet access, The Straits Times, 16 December 1995, p. 46).<br><br><a href="http://web.singnet.com.sg/~jimmyyap/old_homepage/banned/isp.html" rel="nofollow">http://web.singnet.com.sg/~jimmyyap/old_homepage/banned/isp.html</a><br><br></div>

"I think there are some regulatory risks."<br><br>Taiwan's finance ministry said on Monday the island's banks are free to acquire overseas units, but "they cannot use a Hong Kong or Macau subsidiary as a springboard to mainland China."<br><br>Nevertheless, Taiwan has said it was willing to negotiate with Beijing on lifting these restrictions and is well aware that an overbanked home market offered Taiwan banks few prospects for growth.<br><br>Strained political ties between Taiwan and China have meant that banks are still waiting for the green light, but many of Fubon's competitors have already opened representative offices in China.<br><br>They hope Taiwan and Beijing can resolve political differences and allow these offices to be upgraded to operating branches as early as next year.<br><br><strong>A STEP BEHIND</strong><br><br>Fubon, Taiwan's fourth-largest listed financial holding company, is a step behind its peers in getting a toehold in the mainland market as it could not meet minimum capitalisation requirements set by the Taiwan government.<br><br>"Fubon couldn't go directly to China, so merging with IBA is one of its few options left," said Victor Tseng, a banking analyst at KGI Securities in Taipei.<br><br>Fubon said the acquisition of Hong Kong's smallest listed lender, IBA, would add three to five percent to Fubon's earnings per share after the company is absorbed. Fubon has forecast earnings of T$2.05 per share this year.<br><br>Analysts figure the overcrowded Hong Kong banking sector will offer little real boost to the Taiwan parent's bottom line.<br><br>The real target is China, they say, where Taiwan firms have funnelled some $100 billion since late 1980s and are in need of reliable banking services to maintain those operations.<br><br>Fubon hopes to use recently relaxed rules in the Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement (CEPA) between Hong Kong and China that allow smaller banks in the territory to set up shop in the mainland, analysts said.<br><br>Analysts also noted that Fubon would first have to build up IBA's asset base to US$6 billion, the minimum set by China, from the present US$4 billion.<br><br>Fubon's Tsai said he expected to achieve that in two years, and added that he was pleased with the price-to-book value for the IBA deal of 1.16 times.<br><br>"In medium to long term it is a fairly positive strategic move by Fubon," said Sherry Lin, the research head at Credit Suisse First Boston in Taipei.<br><br>Fubon said it has T$10 billion (US$293 million) in cash and would raise US$225 million in an upcoming convertible bond issue. It will also gather another T$10 billion from subsidiaries to pay for IBA.<br>It expects to complete the deal by the end of the year by buying a 55 percent stake in IBA owned by Arab Banking Corp and is considering an offer for the entire bank.<br><br>Beijing-backed financial conglomerate China Everbright Ltd said on Tuesday it won't rule out selling its 20 percent stake in IBA.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkred;">This article was printed in February 2002, and most would have missed it from the Singapore Press due to obvious reasons that are not at all complimentary to the Ruling Elites.</span><br><br><strong><span style="color: red;"><span class="large">Up in smoke</span></span></strong><br><strong>SingTel's Lee Hsien Yang paid A$14 billion for Optus and its growth story. </strong><br><br><span class="small">Eric Ellis and Geoff Elliott write the next chapter<br>Australian<br>February 9, 2002<br><br>RELATED:<br>Optus weighs on SingTel profit </span><br><br>BRITISH royalty aren't the only people who have <span style="font-style: italic;">anni horribili</span>. Singaporean princelings have them too.<br><br>Like the one that Lee Hsien Yang, youngest heir to Singapore's self-styled philosopher king Lee Kuan Yew, and SingTel Optus shareholders are having as they grapple with the grim truth that he paid way too much, $14 billion, for Optus.<br><br>The reality that's long been evident in the market -- where SingTel shares are down almost 40 per cent in the past year -- hit home with Lee yesterday on the plush 32nd floor of SingTel's head office in the city state.<br><br>Flanked by Optus chief executive Chris Anderson, an uncomfortable Lee fidgeted through an unconvincing briefing that was part results announcement but in larger part a justification of the struggling Optus deal.<br><br>``We paid fair value for Optus,'' Lee stoically maintained, <strong><span style="color: darkblue;">and if you are Cable &amp; Wireless, Anderson and Optus's recently departed finance director Norman Gillespie, you couldn't agree more. C&amp;W got $14 billion for Optus and the two executives pocketed upwards of $10 million between them as their options kicked in on the sale to SingTel</span>.</strong><br><br>But the harsh truth for Lee Hsien Yang is that Optus is burning a big hole in his well-tailored pockets.<br><br>He clearly thought he was buying a company at the bottom or near the bottom of a cycle. He was wrong, and yesterday's results offer stark proof.<br><br><strong><span style="color: red;">Optus is not self-funding</span>.</strong> SingTel's anticipated Australian growth hub requires $1.7 billion a year from outside the business to keep going. And that's at a time when debt funding for telecommunications companies is tight and share market investors don't want to touch phone companies.<br><br><strong><span style="color: red;">SingTel will pay to keep the operation ticking over, and with its publicly unquestioning Singapore Inc government controllers it can. In fact, it's going to pay big-time through higher borrowing costs</span>.</strong><br><br>If economic conditions turn around quickly it will surely turn out all right, since in advanced economies like Singapore and Australia higher GDP invariably equates to more phone calls, more emails, and thus better sales for phone companies.<br><br>But SingTel's Lee admits capital markets have shut off the valve, in the area where it hurts most -- telecommunications. The glossy interpretation of that, and one Mr Lee exploited yesterday, is that it means less competition for Optus in Australia.<br><br>But it also means that the funding for all those internet and telecommunications-hungry companies -- the dotcoms and the e-commerce divisions of big corporates -- has stopped. It was an area where Optus achieved huge sales growth and was a key impetus for SingTel to pay so much for the company in the first place.<br><br>Little wonder, then, that yesterday both Lee and Anderson were stressing that growth was now in mobile retail, when six months ago the sexy part was data and wholesale.<br><br>From a run rate of more than 20 per cent a year, sales in the last quarter in the ``Optus Business'' division have hit a brick wall, down more than 11 per cent in the last quarter compared with the previous corresponding quarter.<br><br>``There is no doubt that there has been a very significant fall in wholesale traffic,'' Anderson said yesterday.<br><br>Now, SingTel is looking to recover the situation. To cut the costs of running Optus it will need to pare back Optus's business dramatically through lower capital expenditure, a fact acknowledged yesterday by Lee and Anderson.<br><br>Anderson said the company was working through that issue now, but it looks set to slash capital expenditure to about 20 per cent of sales compared with 32 per cent before.<br><br>When Anderson and Lee sign off on that and wind back the business it will be the most tangible evidence that SingTel's $14 billion acquisition has blown up in Lee's face.<br><br><strong><span style="color: blue;">But Australian consumers should be thankful: without the deep pockets of SingTel, Optus would hit the wall and Telstra would have the game to itself<br><br>With that huge funding requirement of $1.7 billion, Optus is still a start-up company. That's fine when growth is running at 20 per cent or more but it's dire when growth starts evaporating. </span>.</strong><br><br>``There will be continuing weakness in the fourth quarter,'' Lee told reporters yesterday.<br><br>While the headline numbers for the nine months ended December 31, 2001, scream a headline loss of $213 million for Optus, it's a red herring -- and has nothing to do with the main game when it came to SingTel's acquisition of Optus and why it's turning out to be such an expensive move.<br><br>Lee, his advisers, telecommunication analysts -- even some Optus executives -- were always circumspect about former Optus chief financial officer Norman Gillespie and his attempts to tart up the company's bottom line.<br><br>As soon as SingTel arrived it slashed nearly $500 million of Optus's net profit line, undoing years of Gillespie's work. Gillespie quit suddenly last month. He was a former executive at Cable &amp; Wireless in the UK, the former owner of Optus and the company on the other side of the Optus transaction that did so well to get out when it did, as it also did when it sold Hong Kong Telecom at the top of the market to a now struggling Richard Li.<br><br>The newly enriched Gillespie has gone and it appears only a matter of time before the polished Anderson does likewise, despite the denials to the contrary and his mateyness with Lee in Singapore yesterday.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>cont.<br><br><strong>The joke doing the rounds in the market was that Optus's past accounting practices were ``Norman Gap'' accounting, a satirical reference to how Singapore GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) were far more conservative than the Australian principles that Gillespie applied.<br><br>And <span style="color: red;">while all that might strike one as similar to the collapsed US energy giant Enron, everyone knew what Gillespie and Optus were doing</span>. <span style="color: blue;">Optus was never about the bottom line and the ability to pay dividends, anyway. It was always about growth</span>.</strong><br><br>Singapore is an island state, small economy, dominated by one of the biggest cash generators in the world: Singapore Telecommunications. <strong><span style="color: blue;">With its docile government a major shareholder, SingTel cares less about the bottom line of the companies it buys; it has enough cash to splash around and to absorb the operations. Still, it doesn't want a business going backwards</span>.</strong><br><br><strong><span style="color: red;">But two of the three businesses within Optus that SingTel has bought have been slammed into reverse</span>.</strong><br><br>``At the growth rates for Optus when SingTel acquired the company last year they paid a premium,'' said one analyst of the $14 billion acquisition price. ``<strong><span style="color: red;">At the growth rates now, SingTel paid at least 50 per cent too much.''<br><br>On that analysis, that's $5 billion of shareholders' funds, mostly the Singapore government since it is the dominant owner of SingTel. </span></strong><br><br>The US consulting giant Stern Stewart takes an even harsher view, noting that since 1996 -- about the time Lee took over as SingTel CEO -- the company has lost a staggering $US30 billion in shareholder value.<br><br><strong>Could the news get worse? Yes. Singapore is struggling out of the world's worst recession outside of Afghanistan, and last week came the US$12 billion collapse of the trans-Atlantic Global Crossing group, <span style="color: blue;">bailed out in a US$700 million deal by Hong Kong tyro Li Ka-shing, Richard Li's much savvier father, in joint venture </span>-- deliciously -- <span style="color: red;">with Singapore Technologies, the company run by Lee's sister-in-law</span>. </strong><br><br>Global Crossing's dramas suddenly make SingTel's own $2.1 billion pan-Asian data carriage play, C2C, look a little less sexy than it did when Global Crossing was valued at $12 billion. That's about when Lee started pushing ahead with the C2C platform in a part of the world less economically active that the Atlantic region.<br><br>Yet things change. <strong>Rapid shifts in market conditions often can catch executives holding the bathwater and no baby. But the folly of buying growth in a sector when asset prices have gone through unprecedented price appreciation -- the thing that also meant Telstra chief executive Ziggy Switkowski had to admit to a humiliating $1 billion writedown on his Asian investments with Richard Li -- has become something <span style="color: red;">that now dogs Lee Hsien Yang and Singapore Inc.</span> </strong><br><br>Optus's chief operating officer Paul O'Sullivan, who has been promoted since SingTel took over, says Lee is taking a long-term view.<br><br>He says the company is not run by asset traders.<br><br>``They have bought a company in the region that is stable and growing and there is daylight between Optus and its nearest competitors,'' O'Sullivan says.<br><br>``In the short term (the acquisition price) may look one way or another, but I don't think it is the way they view it.''<br><br>And O'Sullivan offers some blue sky, saying Optus expects to make some big wins with big corporate telco accounts. It won late last year a big contract with St George Bank and the company is down to a shortlist of two in a contract for the IAG, formerly known as the NRMA, the big NSW insurance group.<br><br>Optus will no doubt benefit from the consolidation in the industry and probably be able to charge higher prices. It's already followed Telstra's lead on some price increases, hiking charges on some of its mobile phone products.<br><br>But it's this same consolidation that is savaging companies that were buying Optus's products in the first place.<br><br>It's a big contraction in the industry and O'Sullivan, more than Anderson, has his hand on the tiller in Australia for Lee, steering the ship in tough times.<br><br>O'Sullivan acknowledges the difficulties, and he obviously thinks things will get tougher before they get easier.<br><br><strong>And he's not looking for survivors: all merger and acquisition activity has been shelved this year at Optus and the focus is on costs and other operating expenses. <span style="color: blue;">No doubt capital expenditure will be slashed, a sure signal that the growth company that SingTel thought it acquired is hardly that. </span></strong><br><br>O'Sullivan will just be trying to keep things afloat until the storm passes, so that he and his crew can see brighter days. In fact, in all the controversy over SingTel's acquisition, it is O'Sullivan who will play a key role in determining whether SingTel can eventually claim success for its Australian strategy.<br><br>For now, SingTel and its chief executive are nursing some mighty bruises.<br><br><a href="http://www.singapore-window.org/sw02/020209au.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.singapore-window.org/sw02/020209au.htm</a><br><br></div>
