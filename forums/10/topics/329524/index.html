              <p>Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce posted a net loss of $1.11
              billion in the second quarter as its Canadian retail operations, a key
              profit driver, suffered a slowdown and the bank recorded a huge
              writedown at its investment banking division.</p>
              <p>The bank (TSX: <a href="http://torontostar.morningstar.ca/cb/member_TORSTAR.asp?targetcontent=5&amp;targetID=CM">CM</a>)
              said Thursday the second quarter loss was worth $3 per share. That was
              down from net income of $807 million or $2.27 per share in the same
              period last year.</p>
              <p>Retail banking revenue from CIBC's consumer
              operations slipped three per cent to $2.24 billion, and the segment's
              earnings fell to $509 million, compared with $617 million a year ago,
              which included an $80-million tax recovery.</p>
              <p>CIBC was the only
              big Canadian bank to report lower results in its retail banking
              operations during the February-April period, which is the second
              quarter of its 2008 financial year.</p>
              <p>"CIBC's quarter was
              disappointing in that core businesses were less profitable than we
              expected and writeoffs were larger than we expected, partially offset
              by a benign quarter from a credit perspective," wrote Andre-Philippe
              Hardy of RBC Dominion Securities.</p>
              <p>The loss included a charge of
              $2.48 billion, or $1.67 billion after tax, on writedowns of structured
              credit, adding to $3.46 billion in first-quarter writedowns.</p>
              <p>Shares in the bank slipped $1.38 to $69.47 on the Toronto Stock
              Exchange after falling as low as $69 earlier in the session – down from
              over $100 before the credit crunch hit last summer.</p>
              <p>The
              $1.1-billion quarterly loss came as "the deterioration in credit and
              liquidity conditions, particularly for securities with exposure to the
              U.S. residential mortgage market, has required CIBC to record asset
              writedowns and counterparty credit reserves within its structured
              credit business," the bank stated.</p>
              <p>"In addition, market
              conditions have had a negative impact on performance in other areas,
              particularly within CIBC's wholesale and retail brokerage operations."</p>
              <p>CIBC stressed that its Tier 1 capital ratio at April 30 was a robust 10.5 per cent.</p>
              <p>The CIBC World Markets investment banking division lost $1.64 billion,
              including the $1.67-billion setback, and warned that ``market and
              economic conditions relating to the financial guarantors may change in
              the future, which could result in significant future losses."</p>
              <p>Further after-tax losses of $92 million were logged on foreign
              exchange, derivatives and other items – including $18 million of
              ``higher than normal severance expense in CIBC World Markets."</p>
              <p>The results were weak and credit losses were worse than expected, said Brad Smith, an analyst at Blackmont Capital.</p>
              <p>Operating earnings per share, worth $1.62, fell "well below" market expectations, Smith added.</p>
              <p>The bank said it expects Canadian economic growth "to remain very
              sluggish in the coming quarter, held back by weak exports as the U.S.
              appears to be entering a mild recession."</p>
              <p>The bank said in its outlook that it foresees a return to moderate growth by the final calendar quarter of 2008.</p>
              <p>"For CIBC World Markets, mergers and acquisition and equity activity
              will likely remain slower than in the prior year due to credit concerns
              affecting global leveraged deals," CIBC added.</p>
              <p>"We expect loan
              demand to increase due to reduced investor appetite for asset-backed
              securities. U.S. economic softness and a strong Canadian dollar could
              lead to a less favourable period for corporate credit risk in certain
              parts of the Canadian economy."</p>
