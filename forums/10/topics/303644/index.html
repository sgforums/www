            <div class='col-md body'>in terms of technical definitions of the growth model, then yes, it can be interpreted that way.<br><br>that the GDP growth is achieved from population influx.<br><br>this would mean that overall productivity has fallen.<br><br>this would mean that we have been nett importing workers with poorer productivity as compared to previously.<br><br>but i bet our ministers sure have a quick answer that the average singaporean is better compared to years ago, and cannot be measured via gdp per capita.</div>

              <p>Singapore's GDP per capita is 31k leh, not 26k</p>
              <p>I think you want to mean the ranking has been steadily dropping, not the GDP per capita.</p>

              <p>Aiyah don't know how they count also lah... Since GDP per capita is about averaging anyway, the average wage did rise in Singapore, and so did the average household income. So think got rise lor.</p>
