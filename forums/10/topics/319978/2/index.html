              <p>i would then get the judge to charge my detractors/opposers in contempt for just calling me SIR instead of Supreme Overlord of Singapore. This would ensure all my detractors/opposers are bankrupt <strong>AND</strong> in jail.</p>

              <p>1 - taxing my peasants until they are unable to make ends meet.</p>
              <p>2 - be polite only to people who can give me money</p>
              <p>3 - use my peasants money anyhow i want and if problems are encountered, i would call it long term investment.</p>

              Heehee, I see all the MIW die-hard fans here; they're such a funny sight. Yay for blind people! Maybe we can get the Lees to build more conveniences for blind people, yes? So you can continue supporting them the way you do.
              
              On topic: Yes indeed. We can change the whole governance if the main infrastructure of governance is changed itself. Alas, the MIWs have conveniently adopted the parliamentary republic form of governance and not a full republic one, thus giving them more control over politics and thus lesser political freedom for those who don't happen to be with them.
              
              If you ask me, not much difference from autocracy, but of course, "parliamentary republic" sounds much nicer, yes?
              
              ANYWAY, the way things are set to go, the Money man possesses the uber hax defamation card which allows him to put all his political opponents in jail and basically strip them of every shred of dignity, power and wealth as much as he can. So awesome right? You can already gauge the power of such individuals by the kind of response the MM elicits. The more drama, the more power. =D
              
              So if you ask me if they exist, yes, but they're fighting a losing battle.
              
              Honestly, I find it more worthwhile to immerse myself in Msia politics; maybe I'll move there to engage myself in it cos Singapore no chance already. Fight also fight for what? The own people are not receptive of the effort expended by the WP, SDp, etc, and here they are, fighting for the rights of those who still have hope for a brighter future.
              
              Cannot beat them, don't join. Run away.
              
              Which is what muscle man is doing. Driving all the talents away because he wants to assert his position here. 
              
              HAHAHAHA GG LAH SINGAPORE!

              <p>Heehee, I see all the <span>MIW</span> die-hard fans here; they’re such a funny sight. Yay for blind people! Maybe we can get the Lees to build more conveniences for blind people, yes? So you can continue supporting them the way you do.</p>
              <p>On topic: Yes indeed. We can change the whole governance if the main infrastructure of governance is changed itself. Alas, the MIWs have conveniently adopted the parliamentary republic form of governance and not a full republic one, thus giving them more control over politics and thus lesser political freedom for those who don’t happen to be with them.</p>
              <p>If you ask me, not much difference from autocracy, but of course, “parliamentary republic” sounds much nicer, yes?</p>
              <p><span>ANYWAY</span>, the way things are set to go, the Money man possesses the uber hax defamation card which allows him to put all his political opponents in jail and basically strip them of every shred of dignity, power and wealth as much as he can. So awesome right? You can already gauge the power of such individuals by the kind of response the MM elicits. The more drama, the more power. =D</p>
              <p>So if you ask me if they exist, yes, but they’re fighting a losing battle.</p>
              <p>Honestly, I find it more worthwhile to immerse myself in Msia politics; maybe I’ll move there to engage myself in it cos Singapore no chance already. Fight also fight for what? The own people are not receptive of the effort expended by the WP, SDp, etc, and here they are, fighting for the rights of those who still have hope for a brighter future.</p>
              <p>Cannot beat them, don’t join. Run away.</p>
              <p>Which is what muscle man is doing. Driving all the talents away because he wants to assert his position here.</p>

              <p>I think you people are looking at this too politically. Think about it, in the beginning even if there is another similarly capable person like LKY, but a more democratic man, to mastermind the shaping of Singapore into what it is today, could anyone of us be for certain that Singapore would enjoy certain aspects of success that modern Singapore enjoys now?</p>
              <p>"If only.. if only.." All of us often say this alot, hoping to change the current bad situations by changing the variables at the root. But if we had taken out the bad variables at the root, would the ideal course of action that we hope for still take place?</p>
              <p>This world is runned by the idea of give-and-take. Look at all our personal lifes first. Can we run our own lifes such that career-wise we are so successful, yet still able to drive around our dream car with our girlfriends all day long, beat the traffic light if we don't feel like it, do all the stuff we enjoy without going back to office to work, and still continue to maintain our salary at work? Don't think there is.. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/BoxedEmoticonSet/confused.png" alt="confused.png"></p>
              <p>Similarly, if there is a government capable of maintaining success and yet let us have what we hope for, all of us would hope for this kind of government to overthrow the current one and let it run Singapore. But the reality of this world doesn't allow for such a government to form. It's all about give-and-take..</p>

              <p>With the present Political Party - forming the present Government - constantly fearing the loss of their Political Powers, and finding any ways to thwart and flatten any heads that dare to pop up to challenge their political position - is Singapore's future secure when the option is only with ONE Political Party, and no one else can freely participate in the political process ?</p>
              <p>Is this my views alone, or has this not also been observed by none other than a PAP stalwart - its past Chairman of the Party - Dr Toh Chin Chye ?</p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">“I would say the generation of the ‘50s and ‘60s took the plunge into politics without ever calculating the costs of the risk and the benefits to be gained. They were driven by ideology. Today’s generation has no culture and averse to taking political risk. Really,<strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">an interest in politics is very necessary for the future</span></strong>. But I cannot blame the present generations, because they see the heavy-handed response by the government to dissenting views, even though they know that these matters involve their daily lives.<br><br>So the result is that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">we have produced a younger generation who are meek and therefore very calculating</span>. They are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">less independent-thinking and lack in initiative</span>. <strong>It does not bode well for the emergence of future leaders in politics and business</strong>. Robots and computers can be programmed or if you like, can be trained. But the trouble, of course, is that computers lack soul and what we need in Singapore is soul. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Because it is soul that makes society</span></strong>.”</span></p>

              <p>Can you hope for Singapore to continue if one is dependent entirely on ONE Personality, ONE Party, ONE Dream - all from ONE Man.?</p>
              <p>Do you believe that it is not better for Singapore to free ourselves from the cap placed on each of our hidden potential ?</p>
              <p>Or are you preferring to be shepherded by your God Father - to be like ''SHEEP'' - a term that you have ironically accuse everyone in this thread to be a 'Sheep' for criticising your beloved God Father and his Party ?</p>
              <p>Have you no more honesty as an Aelop, in the manner of your unwise honesty as a Gazelle in admitting to your bad habits with panties ?</p>
