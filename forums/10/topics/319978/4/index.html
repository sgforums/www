              <p>is there any 'points' in the 'Point_blank' statements that you have made in response, other than a grand display in your creative ability in spouting out profanities like a true 'word-whore' that you attempt to label on others ?</p>

              <p>To come back to the topic....is there a better gov to run Singapore..</p>
              <p>I personally cannot envision such a scenario...</p>
              <p>In my opinion, PAP is a center-party, or how to say, a party which is already entrenched, and draw the technocrats and middle class people.</p>
              <p>So the 'opposition' are people who are apart from this group, the marginalized people, left out.</p>
              <p>Someone pointed out before, Potong Pasir is a poor area, and Orchard, district 10 always PAP.</p>
              <p>This makes sense, and also a natural phenomenon.</p>
              <p>In a working and fine country, the ones who will become the opposition are the disgruntled people. Disenfranchized people. They form these breakaway groups apart from the center group.</p>
              <p>This is not to badmouth or insult them, this is just a discussion, no disrespect.</p>
              <p>So.....I find it really hard to imagine there is another PAP clone kind of opposition....maybe Singapore size is too small.....or PAP is very good in recruiting the potential ones...whatever the reason, fact is, the opposition now is in another class. And they are serving a certain niche or ideology.</p>
              <p>If we see, for instance Workers Party.</p>
              <p>Have u ever thought how come the name is Workers Party?  and then the logo, there is hammer actually....it is quite similar to Soviet style sickle.</p>
              <p>This tells me without much, they are a kind of 'labour' party, or socialist party, populist party, etc so on, can see the style and the ideology already.</p>
              <p>So my thinking is....this is another reason why opposition will never win....not only because of lack of talents, it is also because they serve a certain niche ideology, not in the center. It will attract some people, but not enough people.</p>
              <p>Judging from what they persue, I rather have PAP continue to govern Singapore. PAP is the macro-managers, center-positioned, and very much a technocrats party. They will persue whatever policy is good for the overall future of Singapore.</p>
              <p>WP, and other opposition, I tell you something. Their brand of vision will be bad for Singapore, overall. Why..? Because these are disgruntled people with niche ideology. It will be bad to have them rule over the majority.</p>
              <p>One example, easy one.......in election campaigns, a theme getting repeated in recent years is the issue of so-called Foreign Talents (FT).</p>
              <p>You will see the oppositions saying all sorts of things against FT.....</p>
              <p>But is that good for overall health of Singapore?</p>
              <p>This brand of politics is what will derail Singapore, fake populism and pandering.</p>
              <p>This is no different with similar phenomenons in other countries.</p>
              <p>In Australia, disgruntled people made birth to a politician named Pauline Hanson, her party is anti-immigrant. In USA recently the Democrats in the campaigns in industrial states had to repeatedly launch anti-NAFTA retoric, although they know free trade is actually good for their country. These 2 phenomenons play to the interest of disgruntled peoples of their societies but actually harm their long term objective as a successful country.</p>
              <p>That is why I dont like to see WP, SDP, winning. In my opinion it is harmful to Singapore's interest.</p>

              <p>Those views were exactly that held in Taiwan when the Kuomintang was entrenched as the only viable political party to rule Taiwan.</p>
              <p>Then came the maverick Chen Shui Bian, and a political party that was set up by Taiwanese Nationalists on the sly - with Lee Teng Hui being the 'Devil's Advocate' while serving as a Kuomintang President-Elect.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, during the two term of Chen Shui Bian's presidency, he owed it to Lee Teng Hui to carry forward the Taiwan Independence Agenda, and lost the opportunity to show that an Alternative Political Party can match the prowess of the previously entrenched Kuomintang in managing the Taiwanese economy.</p>
              <p>The Kuomintang loss over two presidential term had given them the opportunity to straighten their agenda, fine tune their programmes, and shook them to the core requiring a complete make-over into a more responsive Political Party to become relevant again in Taiwanese Politics.</p>
              <p>Never say never in politics.</p>
              <p>It happened in South Korea, and their economy is none the worst since losing several strong military generals turned politicians, after the assassination of Presidential Dictator Park Chung Hee.</p>
              <p>The democratic practices in South Korea allowed more political space to the citizens then ever possible since WW-2, and made the Presidential Office and Government more responsive and accountable for their policy decisions.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans have been too cloistered and subjected to the humdrum propaganda that peace and stability is good for the economy, hence public demonstration and public protest will only destabilise the economy and break investors' confidence.</p>
              <p>It is surprising that public demonstration and public protest will only affect the economy, but nothing was ever mentioned that in reality the main effect is on the political stability of the Ruling Political Party.</p>
              <p>Without any avenues to vent citizens' grieviances, and with the government paying only lip service at being aware of the hardship that Singaporeans faced, and their continued intransigence at with-holding welfare to the down and out - how long can Singaporeans continue to live under pressure ?</p>
              <p>Even the imensely paranoid autocratic communist state of Soviet Russia had to finally succumb to the the pressures that exploded from the people, and brought down decades of autocratic communist central government.</p>
              <p>The years of dependence on a rigid system has left the ordinary Russians with little experience in exercising initiative and self-enterprise, except for the hoodlums and economic opportunists that thrive in a closed system will now have a wider space to exercise their tested initiative and enterprise.</p>
              <p>Like the tides of the sea, the political fortunes of governments and political parties will rise and fall, political change will surely happen - when the strings are stubbornly held too tight, or when no one pays any attention to the affairs of the state.</p>
              <p>The other question is the choice of personality.</p>
              <p>If the present lot of Singaporean Politicians do not present themselves as acceptable, and those already chosen are mediocre in performance, there will come a point in time, when crisis will throw up someone with the ability to project his program with new enthusiasm and vision, and mobilise the ground again.</p>
              <p>We have seen this in the political history of other countries across the globe.</p>
              <p>Crisis will bring out the best in every man, and this is practised by LKY in his scheme of things by having each Minister attend to two portfolios, Minister-of-State supporting the Ministers and gaining experiences, and Permanent Secretaries kept on their toes with a multitude of duties from different portfolios in different ministries.</p>
              <p>This has even extended into the manner in which MINDEF and the SAF operates - with a high tempo of continuous exercises that keep the organisation alert, and constant training hone the basic skills to become second nature.</p>
              <p>Never say never - as LKY and his first group surfaced at a time of political challenges after the end of WW-2, which inspired his generation into action.</p>
              <p>If it does not happen during this decade, it will happen in the next, or....</p>
