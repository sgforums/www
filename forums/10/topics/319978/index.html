              <p>Can there be no Government to be formed by any Alternative Political Party ?</p>
              <p>It is a lie that there is a dearth of talented good men and women in Singapore other than those in the present lot harvested by the MIW.</p>
              <p>If there are no talented men and women, how could the MIW Team continue to find these new personalities that hide themselves in the woodwork ?</p>
              <p>Surely there will be more talented men and women, who will be willing to stand-up for Singaporeans - if and when LKY will throw out the ''knuckle-duster and hatchet''  methods of his famed Mafia politics.</p>
              <p>MM LKY continued dependence on his five decade old ''knuckle duster and hatchet'' clearly shows that his First World country has not been delivered, and is all part of his delusion of achieving First World order while still dependent on his Third World laws.</p>
              <p>Under such an environment, alternative government has never been allowed to exist in similar Third World countries such as Zimbabwe - where Mugabe has lost a rigged election, and continue to have the audacity to declare the necessity of a run-off re-election, but will meanwhile has prevented a re-run of the presidential election while he is using the time to prepare the ground through intimidation, arrests, and the silent assassination of community leaders. Foreign Aid Workers are forced to suspend their operation in the country as the citizens are left in hunger, so as not to become witnesses to the on-going atrocities being committed before the re-election.</p>
              <p>Similarly, the Myanmar military regime has prevented Aung San Su-Kyi from forming a government after her party won an election that was organised by the Military Regime, and has been locked up for the last ten years. Meanwhile, the Military Regime hunker down in their new Capital City built with forced labor, and ignore the World Community even during the massive destruction in its cyclone hit south.</p>
              <p>MM LKY had already set the ground for the SAF to interfere in politics, when he declared that the SAF should step in when a new Government is formed by any Alternative Party, and begin to use its mandate to draw on the National Reserves.</p>
              <p>This will be THE PRETEXT to allow the SAF - or any other para-military force in Singapore - to throw out a legitimately elected Political Party to form a New Government, and to retain MM LKY and his PAP to continue 'THEIR RULE OVER' Singapore.</p>
              <p>The question asked by Gazelle a.k.a Aelop should have been :-</p>
              <p>Will the PAP and MM LKY graciously accept an electoral defeat when Singaporeans give the mandate to an Alternative Political Party to form the next Government ?</p>
