              <p><br>OMFG, this wanker is now trying to tell the sheep in this forum that the reason for Singapore success has got nothing to do with LKY which indirectly he is saying that the Malaysia actually give this piece of GOLD land to LKY just because his sir name is LEE. And after 40 years, Malaysia is trying to copy what Singapore is doing.</p>
              <p>M13, my advice to you is that, go find yourself a nice quiet little place to wank all you want, and please spare us with all that moaning and whining.  </p>

              <p><br>This was said by MM LKY sometime back in 2006, and was also a subject discussed in another forum in ''littlespeck.com'' - which was also featured in a thread in this Speakers' Corner : <a rel="nofollow" href="http://politics.sgforums.com/forums/10/topics/212104">‘’Lee Kuan Yew warns of army intervention’’  </a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Lee Kuan Yew warns of army intervention<br></span>As last resort, if an opposition government plunders hard-earned reserves. Possible?<br></strong>By Seah Chiang Nee., litterspeck.com<br>Sep 24, 2006<br><br>AS he ages in the midst of an undercurrent of political pressures, Lee Kuan Yew seems to become more concerned about the safety of Singapore's US120bil (RM454.4bil) reserves accumulated over four decades.<br><br>His worry is two-fold; firstly, the rising popularity of opposition that he said could result in 'freak' defeat for his ruling People's Action Party (PAP), and secondly, corrupt opposition leaders squandering the nation's wealth.<br><br>He had earlier warned that PAP must not take for granted that it will always win.<br><br>Lee had valid reasons to worry. There's a political wind blowing across the land and politics may be entering - helped by the Internet - a less predictable era.<br><br>In the May election, the PAP's popular vote fell from 75.3 to 66.6% with no sign of reversing.<br><br>If it erodes further, more Singaporeans will hop on to the (currently weak) opposition's bandwagon.<br><br>The new recruits could include the bright and honest, but also crooks and self-serving people with an eye on the nation's riches.<br><br>In an interview with a Harvard University professor last week he hinted that in case of a plunder - and the elected president could not or would not prevent it - then "in two or three years" the army would step in to stop it.<br><br>His talk of possible military intervention - no mention of coup - caused a stir among Singaporeans.<br><br>Ironically the warning came only three days before the military coup in Thailand.<br><br>Singapore is one of the richest countries when it comes to reserves per capita. Lee once promised to 'rise up from the grave' if future leaders lead it into chaos.<br><br>Before he resigned as PM in 1990, Lee created 'a second key' to safeguard the reserves, an elected presidency that could stop the Cabinet of the day from spending money it had not accumulated during its own five-year tenure.<br><br>No government could dig into funds earned by previous governments without approval from a public referendum.<br><br>But this is the first time Lee has spoken of 'military intervention' if the elected presidency was absent or captured by the opposition, to save the nation's billions.<br><br>Educated Singaporeans, however, have often discussed the prospect of a military coup here if PAP loses an election, not to protect national assets. Lee probably sees the two as connected.<br><br>In 1984 when the PAP suffered a 12.4% vote decline - a mini-crisis to him in those days - a small think-tank committee set up by the newspaper that I edited had discussed this possibility.<br><br>Lee had angrily accused young voters of being ungrateful when so many turned against a party that did 'so much for them'.<br><br>We discussed what would happen if something worse were to happen like losing an election: Would Lee stage a military coup to stay in power? Almost to a person, we dismissed it for several reasons.<br><br>Firstly, the United States, Singapore's powerful trading partner, would come down hard on it, foreign investors could dry up but more crucially, Singapore's army and people - unlike others - would strongly oppose it.<br><br>It would even split the PAP. In short Singapore could not survive the impact.<br><br>Besides, the full-time army is a small one. Singapore's frontline soldiers are overwhelmingly made up of 'reservists'.<br><br>This would have meant that if the country voted out the PAP, these soldiers - sons, brothers and husbands - were likely to have voted along with it, so a coup against the elected leaders was far-fetched.<br><br>The army here is vastly different from the Thais, Vietnamese, Filipinos and other coup-marked countries. Its value comes from its colonial British 'no-politics' traditions.<br><br>So how seriously are Singaporeans taking Lee's coup warning? Most dismiss it as next to impossible.<br><br>If it wasn't possible 20 years ago, it is even less so today as the society has become more sophisticated.<br><br>"It will be a sad day if it is attempted. One coup will lead to another and start a culture," said a businessman.<br><br>Besides any takeover general would probably enjoy power too much to want to return to the barracks."<br><br>Nothing could then prevent them from plundering the reserves themselves, the very thing Lee wanted to stop.<br><br>So far none of the other PAP leaders or rank-and-file has echoed Lee's sentiments, so it is far from being a party position. I don't think it was seriously discussed.<br><br>To put it into perspective, Lee did not condone a military takeover but probably mentioned it as a last option if everything else failed to stop a corrupt government.<br><br>Instead he advised Singaporeans to preserve the present political arrangement, which could also mean - to his critics - 'don't vote in an opposition' or "don't introduce a multi-party system."<br><br>In his interview with Prof Lawrence Summers, Lee said: "Once you break that, by military intervention, you have destroyed a system which works on the basis of who was voted into office," he said.<br><br>There are, however, some old-timers who believe Lee never says anything flippantly and that he must have given it much thought.<br><br>So where can an out-of-office PAP, assuming the scenario were to unfold, get the troops to grab power from the (corrupt) government other than the 'people's' army?<br><br>Singapore is a small island that doesn't take much to start a coup.<br><br>Imaginative Singaporeans believe the PAP may one day launch a highly paid Presidential Guard-type unit, while others say a battalion of Gurkha troops now used for security duties could be used.<br><br>Lee, however, insisted his goal was maintaining the present governance. "My ambition is not to preserve the PAP," he said.</p>

              <p>To get talent is easy. Just offer  millions a year for the right candidate eg. top scholar, very good at study, and issue a piece of cert called citizenship to them and voila! you get a citizen to represent the pore. With this talent, he can be given the chance to prove. Give him say 10 years. Thus, to me, talent citizen is easy to get/create when they are attracted to come here. there are many ways to attract them.  </p>
              <p>Who builds the economy?</p>

              <p>Inventors like sim mong who?</p>
              <p>The toilet cleaners clean the toilets several times every day, laborously, doing things no one else wants to do so that office workers need not hold their urge to urinate and die of some disease or bursting of their pipes.</p>
              <p>The office workers work laborously so that the business can run and operate and the boss can continue to profit.</p>
              <p>Salaries earned by workers is expensed into businesses of food , clothing and transport and entertainment, education, travel, medicals, financial investments etc..</p>
              <p>Lucrative earnings from bosses are expensed into luxury cars and homes, even overpriced ones.</p>
              <p>Tax comes from workers and bosses flows into the country coffers.</p>
              <p>So, who are the engines of growth?  Just a few 'good' men?  </p>
              <p>People are paid to do a job, they better do it. Else get sacked. No one owes anyone any credit.</p>
              <p>HK also has some kind of concept similar to the pores.</p>
              <p>HK also has thriving airport.</p>

Thus, to me, talent citizen is easy to get/create when they are attracted to come here. there are many ways to attract them.  </p>

              <p>The toilet cleaners clean the toilets several times every day, laborously, doing things no one else wants to do so that office workers need not hold their urge to urinate and die of some disease or bursting of their pipes.</p>
              <p>The office workers work laborously so that the business can run and operate and the boss can continue to profit.</p>
              <p>Salaries earned by workers is expensed into businesses of food , clothing and transport and entertainment, education, travel, medicals, financial investments etc..</p>
              <p>Lucrative earnings from bosses are expensed into luxury cars and homes, even overpriced ones.</p>
              <p>Tax comes from workers and bosses flows into the country coffers.</p>

              <p>I have mixed feelings.</p>
              <p>In my humble opinion, Singapore's past achievement of the last few decades is indeed remarkable.</p>
              <p>I remember a BBC interview of a former Singaporean UN ambassador, I think his name is Kishore.</p>
              <p>He said, he grew up without a flush toilet.</p>
              <p>In
              the short span of one generation, Singapore totally transformed itself.
              From third world to first world. Sons are able to live a better life
              than their fathers.</p>
              <p>Up to today this transformation is still
              happening, althought not as rapid, and there is general stability and
              peace. There is tranquility and progress.</p>
              <p>In my opinion, discussing the performance of the Singapore government, people have to look at the overall picture.</p>
              <p>Although some people now are agitating for more press freedom, political freedom, I have a mixed feeling about this.</p>
              <p>I
              think people really dont care very much about press freedom, political
              freedom, etc. In the so-called Maslow Hirearchy of Needs, maybe it is
              very minuscule, a minor and tiny needs.</p>
              <p>This same government
              which saps political freedom, press freedom, has as a result produce a
              very stable and sturdy environment. It is a sterile one, but this
              condition has brought enormous stability, in political, economic, and
              social spheres.</p>
              <p>This created a peaceful and tranquil 'zone' and became a basis for progress and growth, in all areas.</p>
              <p>Not
              only economically people's incomes have jumped by leaps and bounds,
              healthcare standards, educational standards, also improve dramatically,
              and still in good conditions today.</p>
              <p>Today, a Singapore science student can enter science competition and be ranked near the top of the world.</p>
              <p>Today, Singapore has one of the lowest crime rates in the world.</p>
              <p>Today, a racial riot which took place just 1-2 generation ago would be virtually unthinkable.</p>
              <p>Judging
              from the results, which is not bad, I have a mixed feelings whenever I
              see critism of the Singapore goverment, in particular with regards to
              greater press freedom and political freedom.</p>
              <p>I often ask myself
              and have a doubt, a real doubt, a nagging doubt in my mind, is this
              so-called greater freedom really in the interest of Singapore?</p>
              <p>What has been the case so far in the past few decades?</p>
              <p>I
              see it as something interlinked. This strong government which enforce
              political sterility has brought these results. There is no political
              freedom and press freedom. Sterile and peaceful conditions has created
              this enormous stability and enabled the government to persue meaningful
              and sustained long-term projects, which benefit everyone, young and
              old. This is much more meaningful for people's everyday lives than
              debates about greater political freedom, press freedom.</p>
              <p>I am really not convinced.</p>
              <p>In practical terms, for certain things, such as racial
              relations, I can see the benefit of a strong government and lack of
              political freedom. Certain policies like integrated housing, or uniform
              policy in schools, can be implemented due to this condition. Today 
              because of this, we wont have any racial riots, and nor will our
              children or grandchildren.</p>
              <p>In another example, CPF tweaking, this
              strong goverment can implement this measure, with minimum disruption or
              protests. Hopefully our children and grandchildren will have a better
              future, that when we get old we dont burden them too much. But I can
              see in other political environment, such policies will meet stiff
              resistance, get bogged down in parliament,or never get passed.</p>
              <p>So I close with these questions:</p>
              <p>In
              your opinion, has Singapore's remarkable achievement in many areas, has
              been separate from the fact that it has a strong government with little
              press freedom and political freedom?</p>
              <p>In your opinion, has this
              trade-off been overall beneficial to Singapore? How much are you
              willing to change, and for what purpose, what benefit, what objective?</p>
              <p>I think u must be wise when considering these questions.....</p>

              <p>The Lee's formula of suppressing press and political freedom is common practice back in the tremulous era. Necessary evil much used by leaders of the past.</p>
              <p>BUT, the leaders must know to roll with the times.</p>
              <p>When they fail to do so, they become obsolete, and becomes a hindrance to progress.</p>
              <p>Eventually, people will get tired and sick of their old man's way and seek to remove the piece of dead skin that clung stubbornly to their nose.</p>
