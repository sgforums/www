              <p class="first"> KUALA LUMPUR, July 21, 2009 (AFP) - - A religious court in Malaysia has
              sentenced a tearful Singaporean Muslim model to six strokes of the cane
              after she drank beer in a nightclub, reports said Tuesday.</p>
              <p>Kartika Sari Dewi Shukarno, 32, pleaded guilty to consuming alcohol
              at a hotel nightclub in the eastern state of Pahang last year, the New
              Straits Times newspaper reported.</p>
              <p>"We feel the sentence is fair
              after going through the prosecution's argument and since the rotan
              (cane) is provided for in the law," Pahang Sharia High Court judge
              Abdul Rahman Yunus said, according to the paper.</p>
              <p>"The rotan is
              aimed at making the accused repent and serves as a lesson to Muslims,"
              he added, also fining Kartika 5,000 ringgit (1,412 dollars).</p>
              <p>The model, who cried when the judgement was delivered, said she would appeal.</p>
              <p>State religious officials could not be reached for comment on the case.</p>
              <p>Malaysia,
              which has large Indian and Chinese minorities freely enjoying alcohol,
              has a two-track legal system. Civil courts operate alongside
              state-based sharia courts, which can try Muslims for religious offences.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.straitstimes.com/Breaking%2BNews/Singapore/Story/STIStory_326132.html">A HOLIDAY in the Malaysian state of Pahang last August set off a chain of events that could see Kartika Sari Dewi Shukarno, 32, being caned six times, as ordered by the religious court there.</a></p>
              <p>The Malaysian Muslim was caught drinking alcohol with her Singaporean husband in a Kuantan hotel lounge by syariah officers. He was let off.  </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Why was the Singaporean husband let off ?</p>
              <p>Is he not a Muslim ?</p>
              <p>Most non-Muslim males who married a Muslim female, must convert to Islam.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This will be the first time in Malaysia that a woman will be given a lashing, and one can only wonder if the sentence was made harsher due to the fact that she was married to a non-Muslim Singaporean - who should have converted to Islam when marrying her.</p>
