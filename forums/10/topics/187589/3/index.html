            <div class='col-md body'>I applaud LTK for a very good strategy, typically Sun Zi Bin Fa - use your weakest team to fight against the strongest team of the opponent and use your strongest team to fight against the 2nd tier team of the opponent.<br><br>1. Anything less than 70% will be considered a failure for LHL<br>2. The WP team has nothing to lose, the candidates are so young they can afford to lose 1 or 2 GEs and gained experience from there.<br><br>As for Aljunied GRC, I expect to see a very close fight. PAP is very serious that they pull one of their strongest woman candidate over and the team has no new faces. I hope the fight will be gentlemanly and no dirty tricks used.<br><br>LKY / LHL has repeatedly said they have found the best candidates the country can offer and I think they can afford to lose 1 foreign minister and find a replacement easily. Although the PAP team are more experienced, I think it's better to have 5 full time MPs serving the GRC than 5 part time MPs.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The reason they send these young people down is probably because they have potential to become leaders of tomorrow. So now they are taking the chance to let the voters in AMK to know them first, so by the next election they wouldn't be some mysterious figure who pops out from nowhere. Another reason is probably to show the whole of Singapore if they are satisfied with what the PM have done since he took over. Since majority of the west side won't be contested, it cant show how much support the government have from the Singaporeans, therefore its kind of unbalanced. Thus contesting in AMK GRC would probably be the only way to let the public know how much support and faith they have with the PM.</div>

Like earlier said, he is out to let more people know about him, and the rest of the new faces in WP. They don't expect to win also ah. It is for them to gain experience and keep PM Lee busy since he has been "walking over" for 18 years.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br>So next time election these batch of new faces will be known as "the ones who came out to challenge PM".
