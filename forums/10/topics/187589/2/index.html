But as always, I wonder at your fascination for the MM or SM role? Is it really necessary? Other developed countries like UK and NZ don't have these, and they still function well. And it's not tt MPs in those countries are very young either. But even if we weren't benchmarking against these countries, or if we sought to improve the model of democracy, I don't see much value in having SMs or MMs, especially if these are going to be positions not necessarily filled by elected leaders i.e. positions granted to elderly statesmen by default. In fact, they might be an impediment to progress, especially if they are over-cautious and afraid of change, or fail to recognize new circumstances. LKY unfortunately is falling into the latter category. His dogged insistence that the young will change their mindset as they are shaped by experience is - with no intention of rudeness - a delusion. Whatever he wishes, the young will never experience WWII or the Maria Hertogh Riots again. Even if there are to be fresh riots in the future, they will take place in vastly different conditions and probably in vastly different forms.<br><br>2) So do I.
