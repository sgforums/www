              <p><strong>Littlespeck.com, 24 May 2009, subbaiyer.wordpress.com</strong><br> <br> <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Singapore vs Israel -  A study of contrasts</strong></span><br> <br> By Subba’s Serendipitous moments<br> <br> I had a chance meeting with a NUS don and we ended up discussing my
              post on whether East Asia can produce a Susan Boyle. While remaining
              neutral about the arguments that I put forth, he mentioned the reason
              about Singapore being “small”.<br> <br> <em>(Littlespeck: Susan Boyle is an ordinary Scottish church singer
              whose talent was unknown until she took part in a "Britain's got
              talent" contest and "I Dreamed a Dream" from Les Misérables which won
              world acclaim.)</em><br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>I have heard the argument of Singapore being
              “small” ad nauseam. Singapore uses that as a convenient excuse whenever
              there’s a short coming or if they have to justify any hard measure to
              contain order.</strong></span><br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>They also use it to explain away many of the things where they have come short.<br> <br> But, if you turn around and ask them how Singapore achieved some
              wonderful things in specific areas despite its small size, the
              discussion has veered off into a different direction.</strong></span> <br> <br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Size and stability may be good, but lack of size and stability is not a deterrent to be successful.</strong></span></span> This reminds me of the famous lines in the old classic The Third Man:<br> <br> ”For 30 years under the Borgias, they had warfare, terror, murder and
              bloodshed, but they produced Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci and the
              Renaissance.<br> <br> In Switzerland, they had brotherly love and 500 years of democracy and peace, and what did that produce? The cuckoo clock.”<br> <br> To serious skeptics, I usually cite Israel (population of 7.2 million) as an example.<br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>Israel</strong></span> since its independence in 1948 has <strong><span style="color: red;">fought a several wars with its neighbours. It is always in a state of military preparedness.</span></strong><br> <br> <span style="color: blue;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Yet it ranks highest in terms
              of human development, freedom of the press and economic competitiveness
              amongst Middle East countries.<br> </strong></span></span> <br> It is a parliamentary democracy and the average span of Israeli
              government of 22 months. The governments have often changed for a
              number of reasons — political scandals, peace process with their
              neighbors and the role of religion.<br> <br> <span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>It has the highest level of
              civil and human rights comparable to any Western world democracy and
              the freedom of press has been ranked highest amongst the Southwest
              regions.</strong></span></span><br> <br> <span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Economically it is rated 3rd in
              the World Economic Forum’s Global competitiveness report. It has the
              2nd largest number of start-ups after the US and the most number of
              companies listed in NASDAQ.</strong></span></span><br> <br> Many of the large technology vendors like IBM, Microsoft, Cisco have advanced development centres in Israel.<br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Contrary to the Singaporean thinking</span>,
              the Israelis have used the small size of Israel as an advantage. A
              Israeli start up knows that is home market is limited and hence
              function as a “mini-multinational” from day one.<br> </strong></span> <br> A surprising thing among Israelis is that they are never scared of
              failure and if 5% of the start ups in US are headed by repeat
              entrepreneurs, in Israel the ratio is well over around 30%.<br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>Now coming to creative arts, Israel music has influences from all over the world. </strong></span>The
              Israel Philharmonic Orchestra has been operating for over 70 years and
              performs over 200 concerts each year. It also has a vibrant theatre
              scene.<br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>How does one explain these successes in so many diverse fields despite its size and lack of peace?</strong></span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>My view is their ability to be an inclusive society and they valuing diversity.</strong></span></span><br> <br> All Jews irrespective of their lineage are welcome and they constitute
              75% of the population. Muslims are the largest minority and it equally
              welcomes Christians.<br> <br> The difference between Singapore and Israel was neatly summed up by Guy Kawasaki in one of his recent visits to Singapore.<br> <br> He called Singapore an one-opinion town. His precise words were: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Israel has 5 million people, six million entrepreneurs, and fifteen million opinions.<br> <br> Singapore has 5 million people, six entrepreneurs and one opinion.</strong></span></span> <br> <br> Yesterday Lydia Lim a political correspondent from Straits Times
              referred to this difference, but only to defend Singapore and make a
              statement that Singapore has more than one opinion.<br> <br> Her effort was painstaking, but what she ended up doing was only to
              reinforce the Singapore’s stability mantra which gives the society the
              order, but fails to deliver the innovation and creativity that
              Singapore badly needs in these times of global slowdown.</p>

              <p><strong>Littlespeck.com, 24 May 2009, subbaiyer.wordpress.com</strong><br><br><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Singapore vs Israel - A study of contrasts</strong></span><br><br>By Subba’s Serendipitous moments<br><br>I had a chance meeting with a NUS don and we ended up discussing my post on whether East Asia can produce a Susan Boyle. While remaining neutral about the arguments that I put forth, he mentioned the reason about Singapore being “small”.<br><br><em>(Littlespeck: Susan Boyle is an ordinary Scottish church singer whose talent was unknown until she took part in a "Britain's got talent" contest and "I Dreamed a Dream" from Les Misérables which won world acclaim.)</em><br><br><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>I have heard the argument of Singapore being “small” ad nauseam. Singapore uses that as a convenient excuse whenever there’s a short coming or if they have to justify any hard measure to contain order.</strong></span><br><br><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>They also use it to explain away many of the things where they have come short.<br><br>But, if you turn around and ask them how Singapore achieved some wonderful things in specific areas despite its small size, the discussion has veered off into a different direction.</strong></span><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Size and stability may be good, but lack of size and stability is not a deterrent to be successful.</strong></span></span> This reminds me of the famous lines in the old classic The Third Man:<br><br>”For 30 years under the Borgias, they had warfare, terror, murder and bloodshed, but they produced Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci and the Renaissance.<br><br>In Switzerland, they had brotherly love and 500 years of democracy and peace, and what did that produce? The cuckoo clock.”<br><br>To serious skeptics, I usually cite Israel (population of 7.2 million) as an example.<br><br><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Israel</strong></span> since its independence in 1948 has <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">fought a several wars with its neighbours. It is always in a state of military preparedness.</span></strong><br><br><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Yet it ranks highest in terms of human development, freedom of the press and economic competitiveness amongst Middle East countries.<br></strong></span></span><br>It is a parliamentary democracy and the average span of Israeli government of 22 months. The governments have often changed for a number of reasons — political scandals, peace process with their neighbors and the role of religion.<br><br><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>It has the highest level of civil and human rights comparable to any Western world democracy and the freedom of press has been ranked highest amongst the Southwest regions.</strong></span></span><br><br><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Economically it is rated 3rd in the World Economic Forum’s Global competitiveness report. It has the 2nd largest number of start-ups after the US and the most number of companies listed in NASDAQ.</strong></span></span><br><br>Many of the large technology vendors like IBM, Microsoft, Cisco have advanced development centres in Israel.<br><br><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Contrary to the Singaporean thinking</span>, the Israelis have used the small size of Israel as an advantage. A Israeli start up knows that is home market is limited and hence function as a “mini-multinational” from day one.<br></strong></span><br>A surprising thing among Israelis is that they are never scared of failure and if 5% of the start ups in US are headed by repeat entrepreneurs, in Israel the ratio is well over around 30%.<br><br><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Now coming to creative arts, Israel music has influences from all over the world.</strong></span> The Israel Philharmonic Orchestra has been operating for over 70 years and performs over 200 concerts each year. It also has a vibrant theatre scene.<br><br><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>How does one explain these successes in so many diverse fields despite its size and lack of peace?</strong></span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>My view is their ability to be an inclusive society and they valuing diversity.</strong></span></span><br><br>All Jews irrespective of their lineage are welcome and they constitute 75% of the population. Muslims are the largest minority and it equally welcomes Christians.<br><br>The difference between Singapore and Israel was neatly summed up by Guy Kawasaki in one of his recent visits to Singapore.<br><br>He called Singapore an one-opinion town. His precise words were: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Israel has 5 million people, six million entrepreneurs, and fifteen million opinions.<br><br>Singapore has 5 million people, six entrepreneurs and one opinion.</strong></span></span><br><br>Yesterday Lydia Lim a political correspondent from Straits Times referred to this difference, but only to defend Singapore and make a statement that Singapore has more than one opinion.<br><br>Her effort was painstaking, but what she ended up doing was only to reinforce the Singapore’s stability mantra which gives the society the order, but fails to deliver the innovation and creativity that Singapore badly needs in these times of global slowdown.</p>
