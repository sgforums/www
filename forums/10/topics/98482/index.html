            <div class='col-md body'><br>2) HDB issue. Is the HDB overpriced? Additional information here. HDB is running at a budget deficit if you have look at it's annual report. It is taking grant from the government every year. So, what are the plans?<br><br>Unless you have more details on why this budget deficit exist, you can draw any conclusion from this fact.  By itself, it does not means HDB flats are not overpriced.<br><br>If HDB accounting practice books the flat price based on market value and sell them at "subsidized price", it will explain this deficit easily.<br><br>Before answering the question, we need HDB to tell us what is the cost of buidling HDB flats, and it is avoiding the questions.<br><br>The following letter was published on ST at around Aug 11, 2004.  HDB never response to it.<br><br>==============================================<br><br>Flat buyers pay more than cost unless resale prices take a sharp dip<br>I REFER to the reply by the Housing Board, 'HDB pricing keeps new<br>flats affordable to most Singaporeans' (ST, Aug 6), in response to<br>Mr Mohamed Rafiq Hamjah's letter, 'Subsidy should be based on flat's<br>building cost' (ST, July 27).<br><br>Mr Desmond Wong said the difference between what the buyer pays HDB<br>for his flat and what it is actually worth in the market is a direct<br>and real subsidy.<br><br>Mr Wong also used the analogy of a first-time HDB buyer who is<br>indifferent between buying direct from HDB and from the resale<br>market. I think he has missed Mr Mohamed's point.<br><br>The dictionary definition of a subsidy is a form of payment to a<br>person. To me, this market subsidy is neither direct nor real. It is<br>more an opportunity cost than real cost, and it is indirect to the<br>extent that it does not physically deplete HDB's coffers as would be<br>the case if HDB really subsidises the price by giving a discount on<br>the flat's actual construction cost.<br><br>I think the public has a misconception with regard to the HDB<br>subsidy. Many think that the subsidy represents a true discount<br>given by the Government by footing the difference between what it<br>pays to the main contractor and how much it sells a flat for.<br><br>This is similar to the ongoing argument on whether companies should<br>expense stock options. By issuing stock options at a discount to the<br>prevailing market price, it actually costs the company close to<br>nothing other than depriving itself of the premium it could have<br>fetched through issuing shares to the public. The premium is the<br>difference it can derive from the share issue and the exercise price<br>of the options. It is therefore an opportunity cost rather than a<br>real cost.<br><br>What Mr Wong has done is explain HDB's long-established practice in<br>this subsidy matter but he has not answered Mr Mohamed's question as<br>to why HDB does not practise cost-based pricing.<br><br>Does this market-subsidy practice also apply to other public<br>services, such as health care? Does the Ministry of Health subsidise<br>the health-care cost of Singaporeans based on market prices of<br>commensurate services provided by the private sector?<br><br>What about previous reports that some hospitals and polyclinics<br>belonging to the two health-care clusters charge higher prices for<br>certain treatments and drugs than those in the private sector?<br><br>If I could answer Mr Mohamed, I would explain that the HDB subsidy<br>is never a cost subsidy. It is more like a price discount or simply<br>a market subsidy, as stated by Mr Wong. Unless the price of a resale<br>flat falls below the cost of building a similar flat in the<br>vicinity, which is extremely unlikely, the buyer will always have to<br>pay more than cost.<br><br>EE TECK SIEW<br></div>
