            <div class='col-md body'>Public housing in S'pore is definitely overpriced NOW. The escalation in HDB prices came about during the 1990s when private property market boomed and the govt allowed inflation to spillover into HDB market for "More Good Years".<br><br>Buyers back then were speculating as prices were rising at double digit rates. Couples queued up for new HDB flats either for fear of prices rocketing if they wait longer, or for a way to make easy money when they can resell the flat later at higher prices, and this property craze spurred reckless demand. Since HDB can also gain from selling new flats and the 20%-25% levy on resale flats, more new flats were being built (and bigger 5-rm flats too as they can fetch higher margins and levy). Both the people and the govt gained, so everyone were happy in the belief of "More Good Years" to come.<br><br>When the property bubble burst during the Asian Crisis, the govt was stucked. Prices of new HDB flats can't be allowed to fall freely like the private housing market, because that will drive down resale HDB prices, which will reduce the paper wealth of majority Singaporeans, leading to political suicide. No choice but to let time digest all the inventory excesses and that's why u see so many unsold HDB flats - not becoz ppl dun need housing, but it's an affordability issue. What to do but to delay marriage and children until financially more able to afford that roof first.<br><br>After all the property euphoria, govt now also realise mistake but can't admit past mismanagement (due to political suicidal risk or elitist attitude?), so just have to maintain high prices with more credit controls to curb future speculation. Hence, the poor man is now struggling for a HDB flat, while the average man has to decide whether to buy a cheaper (but overpriced) HDB flat, or fork out more for a rock-bottom priced private condo in the hope of better living and asset value protection. The rich man, needless to say, is always irrelevant to this topic. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
