Co.<br></div></blockquote>This is a matter of the rule of evidence. I'm not a legal trained personal, but from my understanding, evidence obtained through illegal means are normally not admissible in court. So if you put something inside your trash bin and the trash bin belongs to you, the thing is your personal property and somebody steals it, the evidence is obtained via illegal means and is thus not admissible. But this does not mean that, you are safe to do bad things as long as you throw your evidence into the rubbish bin, because if the police has sufficient reasons to suspect that you are doing something fishy, they can apply for a search warrent, in which case if they found the evidence in your trash bin, they have the power to obtain it and the evidence is thus admissible.<br><br>With regards to your analogy, the mafia boss is not protected. Because although the video tape may not be admissible in court, the police can use is as a ground to launch an investigation and apply for court order in which they can obtain other evidence through legal means.</div>

Like I said, although the evidence (obtained illegally from other people's property) is not admissible, there are other ways of looking for evidence. The video that you mentioned in your analogy, might actually be a legal source of evidence because while the burgular had entered the house illegally, video taping in other people's house was not illegal. And if it is varified that the video had not been edited, it can be admissible.</div>
