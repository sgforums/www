We have to treat them as the best, we have to treat visitors well too but citizens have to be treated better," Mr Lee said.<br><br>"Right now, PRs enjoy the same subsidies as Singaporeans for education and healthcare, and in fact in healthcare, foreign workers also receive subsidised treatment. I think we should make a clear difference Â– PRs should pay more than Singaporeans but less than other foreigners, there is a distinction.<br><br>"If you are not a PR and not a citizen, you should be given good treatment but we will not give you special privileges."<br><br>For education, Mr Lee said there are plans to charge non-citizens more, but not to set fees so high that foreign students will not come.<br><br>While for healthcare, foreign workers will have to bear the full costs of their medical bills.<br><br>Halimah Yacob, Chairman of the GPC for Health, said that employers of foreign workers should do a proper costing to cover their full healthcare need so that Singaporeans would not end up paying for them. She also hopes that employers will not ignore the needs of these foreign workers.<br><br>"We got feedback from many Singaporeans and even from my own constituents that since everything's equal for Singaporeans, foreigners and PRs, what's so special about being Singaporean? To some extent, short of being nationalistic, PM's message of 'citizens first' is well overdue. It'll be much appreciated among Singaporeans who are wondering what's in it for me holding that red passport," said Zaqy Mohamad, MP of Hong Kah GRC.<br><br>More details about the review will be announced by the respective ministries over the next few months. - CNA/so<br>=======================================================<br><br>Something heartening FINALLY come out from our GOV. Although its late, but at least it arrived. Been wondering for years (I guess more than a decade):<br>- "What is/are the difference(s) being a Singaporean, Foreigner &amp; PR in our little island?";<br>- "Why are Foreigner &amp; PR given almost the same benefits as Singaporeans and enjoying the fruits of our forefathers?";<br>- "What is the use of being #1 in some areas &amp; being a 1st World Country, but with so many Poor Citizens &amp; 1 by 1 dying un-naturally?";<br>- "Why are elected MP complaining that Singaporeans are complaining instead of solving the issues (Certain things/issues only those in Power can solve?)?";<br>- etc etc.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>Hope this is not a NATO (No Action Talk Only) kinda proposal. Also hope that this is not another REASON for them to rise our living expenses (No point giving/subsiding from right hand &amp; taxing on left hand). I am getting sceptical of 'good' things that they annouced nowadays.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Anyway, let's hope and wish for a better tomorrow &amp; a humane society.<br><br></div>
