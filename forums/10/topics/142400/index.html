            <div class='col-md body'>NFK saga symptom of bigger problem in S'pore<br>14 Jul 05<br><br>The matters surrounding the National Kidney Foundation (NKF) make for sorry reading. But as ghastly as the revelations have been, the saga is only symptomatic of what ails our system, which is the lack of transparency and accountability.<br><br>Can anyone say that he/she is truly surprised at what has been revealed about the pay and perks of NKF? DidnÂ’t our Ministers set the tone for Singapore Â– that we should pay top dollar for top talent even though Â“top talentÂ” is open to wide interpretation, and that the idea (and ideal) of public service and sacrifice is no longer worthy of consideration in this country?<br><br>Why should our executives not demand out-of-this-world salaries when our Ministers do? Is it any wonder then that the authorities are not speaking out on the matter? How can they without looking like unmitigated hypocrites?<br><br>If Singaporeans want to get to the root of the problem, then they cannot but look at the way the Government handles itself. Not only is the pay that our Ministers pay themselves an outrage, there is no accountability as to why they are paid more than the president of the United States when our economy has just come through two recessions in five years and presently hovers on the brink of a third. Working Singaporeans continue to see their pay packets shrink and bankruptcies rise. The result? It affects the MinistersÂ’ obscenely lavish salaries not one iota.<br><br>Singaporeans knew very little, until recently, about the problems of the NKF. But this is nothing compared to the darkness that shrouds the GovernmentÂ’s handling of our financial reserves. Most people continued to have trust in the NKF and donated generously to the charity whenever called. Now theyÂ’re up in arms. Will our lack of holding the Government accountable for the use of our reserves also result in a similar problem? The difference here is that in the latter case, our futures and lives are at stake.<br><br>The lesson from this episode is clear: transparency and the ability to verify what those in charge tell us is absolutely essential. They are the tenets of democracy and good governance. As indignant as Singaporeans are with NKF, they should target their concerns at the real problem Â– the Government. The question is: will Singaporeans realize this or have the courage to act before it is too late?<br><br>Chee Soon Juan<br>Secretary-General<br>14 July 2005<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>1. Both lack transparency.<br><br>2. Both keep huge reserves as the people the are SUPPOSE<br>to help suffer. Both keep adding unnecessarily to reserves,<br><br>3. Both use DEFAMATION to slience critics.<br><br>4. Both pay their leaders astronomical sums. The Singapore leaders are paid higher than US leaders.Both see nothing wrong in overpaying the leadership even as Singaporeans suffer the high unemployment and recessions.<br><br>5. Both have unsatiable need for money. One keep expanding its fund raising activities, the other keep raising fees, GST etc.<br><br>6. Both love nice buildings. Compare NKF building to SingPost.<br><br>7. Both pretend to care for the poor as the leaders take astronomical pay.<br><br>8. Both have used the word "PEANUTS" in the same context.<br><br>7. Both believe in use of spin and deception. The masses were led to believe they were getting Swiss standard of living.<br><br>8. Both are not cost effective in serving the people.<br><br>9. One is run by a Durian the other built 2 durians with tax payer's money.<br><br>10. Both believe in the extensive use of Foreign talents instead of Singaporeans. In NKF more than 60% are FT.<br><br>11. Both are led by authoritarian style leadership.<br><br>12. Both coerced the public for rising donations and votes in resent years due to extensive use of the media and unfair tactics. NKF has been getting more and more donation using hard sell tactics, the PAP threatens to not to upgrade your flats if you vote the opposition.<br><br>13. Both like to use fuzzy statistics and spin. One once claims Singapore workers are paid higher than US workers, the other claimed its reserves will last only 3 years.<br><br>14, Both have leadership with directorship in external companies...potentially resulting in conflicts of interests.<br><br>15. Both are arrogant.<br><br>16. Both like to use the word world class.<br><br>17. Both used the reserves for overseas investment instead of helping Singaporeans. Durai invested in a call center while the PAP regime invests in everything. Both make Singaporeans pay more for their medical treatment than necessary while keeping montrous reserves.<br><br><a href="http://forums.delphiforums.com/sammyboymod/messages/?msg=77082" rel="nofollow">http://forums.delphiforums.com/sammyboymod/messages/?msg=77082</a></div>
