              <p>we all have to thank LKY's foresight on ubs, who else but lky could have thought of such masterstroke. now, another uniquely singapore achievement is waiting in the wing as ubs stands to `win' this year 2008 coveted award as the worst performer in the swiss market index. hands down if one might add.</p>
              <p>there are talks of a parade in orchard road to showcase this trophy to all singaporeans. afterall, we all have a share in ubs. we should be out in force to celebrate this. and don't worry, no arrest will be made as PAP is exempted from getting a permit.</p>
              <p>to compound this achievement, ubs is like to announced writedowns and losses of billions in the 2q quarterly result announcement next month. i hope lky can be there in the analysts briefing to share the good news with fellow singaporeans. cna should telecast this `live' since we should hear this news.</p>
              <p>so far, ubs is only $37b down the drain. small longkang according to lky. we must be patient as it is the canal we are targeting in 50 years.</p>

              <p>manchester city, as some knows, was paid for by thaksin using the shincorp purchase money by our own `investment gurus'. i love to see ronaldinho (minus the pouch) plays for the blues next season because we can claim of him to be one of our own. maybe, he can also grace our s-league since he is after all a foreign talent, a sought after species in this part of the island.</p>
              <p>we must also lay claim to be virtual owners of queens park ranger fc. not long after singapore parted US$100m+ to bernie ecclestone for the right to host a f1 race here, bernie used this to buy QPR. i used to hate the hoops, but now, i cannot. it is rumored that QPR will send a feeder squad to the s-league as the 4th foreign team in the league. i must make it a point to buy the s-league seasons ticket next year if this happens.</p>

              <p>we all have to thank LKY's foresight on ubs, who else but lky
              could have thought of such masterstroke. now, another uniquely
              singapore achievement is waiting in the wing as ubs
              stands to `win' this year 2008 coveted award as the worst performer
              in the swiss market index. hands down if one might add.</p>
              <p>there are talks of a parade in orchard road to showcase this
              trophy to all singaporeans. afterall, we all have a share in ubs.
              we should be out in force to celebrate this. and don't worry, no
              arrest will be made as PAP is exempted from getting a permit.</p>
              <p>to compound this achievement, ubs is like to announced
              writedowns and losses of billions in the 2q quarterly result
              announcement next month. i hope lky can be there in the analysts
              briefing to share the good news with fellow singaporeans. cna
              should telecast this `live' since we should hear this news.</p>
              <p>so far, ubs is only $37b down the drain. small longkang
              according to lky. we must be patient as it is the canal we are

              <p><br>Share with you something from the past which is in Francis Seow's book "To Catch a Tartar".</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In 1959, Singapore was granted limited self-government with a fully elected legislature with full powers to run its own internal affairs, save on matters of foreign policy and defence, (which included internal security) which remained in the hands of the British government expressed through the governor. In June that year, the general election saw teh P4P under LKY returned with an overwhelming majority to form the government. <strong>But LKY ostentatiously refused to take office unless until all his pro-communist colleagues, who had been detained without trial by the Labour Front government under the Preservation of Public Security Ordinance (PPSO) (a law enabling the government to detain persons, without trial, for subversive activities) had been unconditionally released from prison. A number of them were accordingly released.</strong></p>
              <p>Amongst them was <strong>C.V. Devan Nair, who was destined to become the future president of the Republic of Singapore</strong>. However, his tenure as such was to prove as uneasy as it was short-lived. <strong>He was a founder-member of P4P and a trusted confidant of LKY. And, until he fell out with him, enjoyed considerable influence over government policy directions.</strong></p>
              <p>In 1961, the inevitable P4P split occured; the breakaway faction, calling itself Barisan Socialis (Socialist Front), joined the ranks of the opposition. They comprised many of the selfsame person for whom LKY had so pretentiously refused to pick up the reins of government, unless they were released from prison. And, whom he was to arrest and put back behind bars with no trace of guilt or irony.</p>
              <p><strong>In August 1963, notwithstanding internal opposition to merger, Singapore became a constituent state within the Federation of Malaysia.</strong> Early in February the same year, the Internal Security Council, (consisting of the representatives of governments of Singapore, Malaya, and Great Britain) had ordered the arrest and detention of over hundred dissidents, including leading opposition Barisan Socialis members of parliament and trade union activist, "to safeguard national defence and the security of Singapore and the other territories of Malaysia." The mass arrest eased the entry of Singapore into the Federation of Malaysia and crippled a formidable parliamentary opposition. It does not require much imagination to fathom the posture adopted by the Singapore representatives, of whom LKY was one, at that fateful Internal Security Council meeting.</p>
              <p>Under the new constitutional arrangements, the powers hitherto exercised by the governor were transferred to the federal government. But Singapore shrewdly retained for itself certain powers relating to, among other things, finance, education, labour, and communications. <strong>This union with Malaya, which was intended "to endure for the next hundred years," was doomed to failure from its very inception owing to the political psyche and ambition of several leading personalities on either side of the causeway. It was a troubled union.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>In over zealously promoting Singapore's political philosophy of union with Malaysia, Lee clashed repeatedly with the federal government. Given his abrasive political style, he appeared fractious, blligerent, and insultingly intolerant and provocative in his dealings with federal ministers, which seriously offended the sensitivity of the Malay people. It was not long before tension built on political tension seriously threatened the stability and integrity of the new Federation.</strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The benign and princely Prime Minister of Malaysia, Tungku Abdul Rahman Putra al-Haj, intervened. Rather than yielding to the strident cries of the Malay <em>ultras </em>to detain Lee under the Internal Security Act for instigating and inciting communal unrest, he decided to boot Lee and Singapore out of the Federation.</span> British Prime Minister Harold Wilson had apparently warned the Tungku that the British government would not take it too kindly if Lee were arrested and detained. Lee later rather overstated the situation: "Mr. Wilson who is a personal friend cannot see me languishing in jail for ever." Thus Singapore became a sovereign and independent nation.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Francis Seow was educated at Saint Joseph's Institution in Singapore and at the Honorable Society of the Middle Temple, London. He joined the Singapore Legal Service in 1956, serving as a deputy public prosecutor until 1972, when he entered private law practice. Prime Minister LKY approved his appointment as senior counsel to a Commission of Inquiry which "successfully exposed communist tactics" in the Secondary IV examination boycott by Chinese students. Seow received the award of the Public Administration (Gold) Medal for his work on the Commission, and was ultimately appointed Solicitor General of Singapore. Seow dates the beginnings of political friction between himself and LKY's government from 1986 when Seow was elected president of the Law Society. Seow was appointed the first Orville Schell Fellow, Yale Law School, in 1989, and in 1990, a Fellow of East Asian Legal Studies, Harvard Law School. A widower, Seow now lives with his daughter, Ingrid Annalisa, in Arlington, Massachusetts.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I know very little of this great person Francis Seow, I've spoke to older folks, they said that he used to be the Mentor of LKY.</p>
              <p>Has the student surpassed the teacher?</p>
