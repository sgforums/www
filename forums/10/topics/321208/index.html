              <p>I believe the main issue is not healthcare, but an incredibly low birthrate that will mean the eventual extinction of a local native populace and culture.</p>
              <p>What this means is that eventually if not curbed, our population will become largely divided between the local "greying population" and first-generation "imports" that our government is shipping in to solve the short term issues. However without a long term solution this will still lead to all kinds of serious issues at the end of the day.</p>
              <p>Like how to you make Singapore attractive enough to encourage people to come without causing social issues and problems? We are already seeing the some of the effects in the percieved inbalances between the local and the FT.</p>
              <p>Worse, who will be the one footing the bill of this policies? The local who has to do NS as well as compete in other things while the red carpet is rolled out for others?</p>
              <p>Is FT bad? No, but for those noisy lions out there who think that this solves our brain drain and population issues... they are in for a very rude shock. This is akin to heart bypass for heart disease, but if you don't curb the root problem (unhealthy lifestyle), you won't get better.</p>
              <p>Is enough being done to raise our birthrate and encouraging our people to start families younger? I still don't think so. The reality of things is that we've backed outselves into a corner with our myopic population policies just a few decades ago.</p>
              <p>Is this something healthcare will fix? We may live till 85 but the question is if Singapore then is a nation really for us.</p>

              <p>Boh leh...both the articles were published by WHO, UN and CIA, how can you simply call them as PAP propaganda?</p>
              <p>IMO, one of the best way to tell if we have a good health system is to analyze the life expectancy of the people, not politics.  Just think about it, Singapore is just a tiny and crowded country, where people live in a stressful and the fast pace enviroment, and yet, Singaporeans are still living longer other countries in the world.</p>
              <p>Do you have any explanation to that?</p>
              <p>America claimed that they have the best health care system in the world, however critics are saying that their best hospitals are only accessible to a small % of their population.  </p>

              <p>Worse, who will be the one footing the bill of this policies? The local who has to do NS as well as compete in other things while the red carpet is rolled out for others?</p>
              <p>Is FT bad? No, but for those noisy lions out there who think that this solves our brain drain and population issues... they are in for a very rude shock. This is akin to heart bypass for heart disease, but if you don't curb the root problem (unhealthy lifestyle), you won't get better.</p>
              <p>Is enough being done to raise our birthrate and encouraging our people to start families younger? I still don't think so. The reality of things is that we've backed outselves into a corner with our myopic population policies just a few decades ago.</p>
              <p>Is this something healthcare will fix? We may live till 85 but the question is if Singapore then is a nation really for us.</p>

              <p>No that's not where I am coming from, I have nothing against FTs nor do I think they bring in diseases... can't say the same for those who work illegally here without santion though, an issue that our government has pointed out.</p>
              <p>However what I am pointing out is that unless our extremely low local fertility rate is turned around, we are going to see a lot of new healthcare issues rise in the future, and in fact, the low fertility rate ought to be a national healthcare isse, one that our own government unfortunately, as they have admitted, have utterly failed at solving despite decades of effort.</p>
              <p>Of course, there were some questionable policies that we put in place, which started to cross the line into eugenics as well:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>By the 1980s, the government had become concerned with the low rate of population growth and with the relative failure of the most highly educated citizens to have children. The failure of female university graduates to marry and bear children, attributed in part to the apparent preference of male university graduates for less highly educated wives, was singled out by Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew in 1983 as a serious social problem. In 1984 the government acted to give preferential school admission to children whose mothers were university graduates, while offering grants of S$10,000 to less educated women who agreed to be sterilized after the birth of their second child. The government also established a Social Development Unit to act as matchmaker for unmarried university graduates. The policies, especially those affecting placement of children in the highly competitive Singapore schools, proved controversial and generally unpopular. In 1985 they were abandoned or modified on the grounds that they had not been effective at increasing the fecundity of educated women.</p>
              <p>The eugenic principle was abused by the Nazi Party in Germany during the 1930s and early 1940s to justify the attempted extermination of entire social and ethnic groups and the establishment of selective breeding programmes. Modern eugenics is concerned mainly with the elimination of genetic disease.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The term was coined by the English scientist Francis <a href="http://sgforums.com/forums/10/topics/m0008015.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Galton</span></span></a> in 1883, and the concept was originally developed in the late 19th century with a view to improving human intelligence and behaviour.</p>
              <p>In 1986 Singapore became the first democratic country to adopt an openly eugenic policy by guaranteeing pay increases to female university graduates when they give birth to a child, while offering grants towards house purchases for nongraduate married women on condition that they are sterilized after the first or second child.</p>

              <p>I would be glad if you could provide us some example of the healthcare issues which you think singapore is going to face due to low fertility.</p>
              <p>AFAIK, public healthcare subsidies are only meant for local citizens and PR, so if we have a strinking Singapore resident population, wont that give Singapore government the ability to offer better healthcare services?</p>
              <p>Plus as far the life expectancy report goes, I believe their measurement doesnt include FT who goes in and out of the country. So how would an influx of foreigners and immigrant affect our healtcare system?</p>
