              Dr Chee's recent interviews on America's talk shows have sparked a wave of criticisms from PAP propagandists and supporters. These propagandists have repeatedly claimed that by granting interviews to the foreign press, Dr Chee is trying to 'do us in'. So really, they are merely parroting our own MM Lee when they said that by alerting the world to our plight (lack of human rights), our economy will suffer and we will get done in.
                      
              The nonsense spouted by these propagandists is nothing more than unwarranted extrapolation and a desperate attempt to mislead Singaporeans.
                      
              First of all, let us take a look at Dr Chee's intention and statement, and see how that was mangled by the PAP propagandists to mislead the public.
                      
              "He will call on the US to deal with Singapore on the basis of equality where America's political and business leaders don't collaborate with the Singapore Government on trade at the expense of democracy and human rights.
                      
              Such an approach only allows and even encourages the PAP to continue its exploitation of Singaporeans where wages are depressed while the cost of living continues to rise."
                      
              From: http://yoursdp.org/index.php/news/singapore/3041-chee-soon-juan-to-do-a-series-of-radion-shows-in-us
                      
              No rational person can possibly misunderstand Dr Chee's call on the US to deal with Singapore on the basis of equality to mean 'severing business ties' or 'don't invest in Singapore'. It is clear that these PAP propagandists simply highlighted the 'don't collaborate with the Singapore Government' bit, and purposely misunderstood it to mean 'severing business ties'. They are simply taking advantage of the fact that many Singaporeans do not understand the subtle nuances of the English language, and that many skim through web articles and focus on highlighted portions.
                      
              Surely, foreign businesses that respect workers' rights can only be a good thing! Surely foreign businesses that do not wantonly retrench Singaporeans in favour of cheaper Third World labour can only benefit Singaporeans!
                      
              But of course, it doesn't bother officers working in ISD offices if Singaporean workers are paid lesser and lesser despite growing living costs.
                      
              While they are in the throes of their 'righteous' rant, these propagandists also cleverly omitted the fact that the PAP are the ones collaborating with foreign powers!
                      
              "The PAP even consults these foreign companies on how much Sinaporeans' should be paid. The National Wages Council has on its 2007/2008 board representatives from the US (Douglas Miller), Japanese (Shigeru Kobayashi), and German (Alexander Melchers) chambers of commerce." 
                      
              From: http://yoursdp.org/index.php/news/singapore/3063-chee-stop-the-exploitation-of-workers
                      
              Dr Chee's interviews have given him greater access to the American public and helped spread the message of Singapore's struggle for democracy and freedom. The PAP are getting worried. With increased international scrutiny, they will have to learn to curb their excesses. And with the typical PAP paranoia of losing even a small fraction of their power and wealth, we see an increase in propaganda messages both online and in the print media. I wonder who is paying for all that overtime our hardworking State propagandists are putting in?
