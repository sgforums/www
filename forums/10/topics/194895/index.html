These bloodsuckers own alot of properties. Of course, they cannot allow properties' price to come down.  The gov had over priced the land and no way they are going to bring down the price of properties or land cost....they own and stucked with lots of properties in hand, especially, the individuals that privately own and the few giant corporate land owners.  These blood suckers knew that properties in singapore have come to stagnant.  So... to enhance the properties and land values further...they had to introduce Casinos into singapore which many people had objected.<br><br>Of course, there were many people singing the same tune with the gov.... but who are these people?  These were the elites and high ranking officials that you know and I know, whether they are direct or indirectly employed by the bloodsuckers. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Whatsoever that they are doing.....they are only thinking of their pockets first.  They have been proven to be very ungentlemen as you can see during the General Erection.  Speculating and ''creative'' imagination of the oppositions' doing and intention of discrediting the erection department. See the way they attacked the small ant (Gomez...) four to five heavy gunners bombard and shooting an ant for so many days and ended with only a stern warning for gomez from the police. what a joke!</div>

They can 'trust' singaporeans to manage their own savings. This will translate to instant 'higher earnings' since the companies will pay out the portion meant for CPF back to the employee. (else there will be an uproar, so your worry that employees will earn less without CPF is moot)<br><br>But they INSIST on having a CPF system. And why not? It represents an excellent 'investment' account for the govt to use to invest in the open market and generate greater revenue. Such things almost always works both ways.<br><br>If you earn your own living, will you prefer to manage your own savings or 'surrender' a portion to the govt to manage? The CPF account is simply a time-saving account with a pre-set maturity date made compulsory by the govt because they feel many among us cannot look after ourselves come old age. It is indeed your hard-earned cash, but you can't touch it apart from paying your housing loan etc.<br><br>I just view it as an untouchable savings account till i walk on 3 legs.<br><br></div>
