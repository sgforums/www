            <div class='col-md body'>The ongoing media bombardment on our senses as to why their pay should increase.<br><br>A few interesting points about LHL's argument which many in cyberspace have more or less debated and found wanting<br>1. Salary increase = competent honest government<br>2. Benchmark = fallacy, do ALL lawyers earn 4.29M. Who are the ones included in both benchmarks. Can the same senior PS, minister, AO who have been in the service for as long as they have to gain experience and seniority be as easily "hunted"? Why use lawyers when the speech mentioned mainly those who are in their early 30s being drawn to financial services? What are the statistics of turnover during those "critical years"? Can the benchmark be made more transparent?<br><br>3. Without the ministers == will the civil service (a fine-tuned bureaurcratic machinery) fail to function. Quote "'Unless there is a first-class political leadership and judiciary, the Civil Service, however capable and dedicated, will not be able to function properly,' he said."<br><br>This is a testable hypothesis and the 1994 "crisis" year is a natural experiment. With "all" the critical and good people leaving, did the civil service fail to function? What was the impact of those who left on the overall performance of the government? From my layman perspective, nothing great happened. Can the government and civil service provide reports detailing the loss of talent on the performance of the government?<br><br>4. Accordingly, these top talent are supposed to provide cutting edge public policy as per quote "With Singapore now operating near the 'leading edge' in public policy, public-sector leaders cannot rely on the best practices of other countries, but have to break new ground and find fresh solutions." Yet we read of one account after another of study trips that our government civil servants taking overseas to learn from the best overseas (whose civil servants are much poorly paid and by their logic, functioning at sub-par levels). See our ERP system -- adopted from Europeans? transportation system - getting aussie consultants? Errmm... something is lost in the whole speech that I am not getting.<br><br>Can someone enlighten me?<br><br>PM discloses the wide gap and urgent need to retain talent in public sector<br><br>By Lydia Lim, SENIOR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT<br>Mar 23, 2007<br>The Straits Times<br>TOP private-sector salaries have surged ahead of those in the public sector and Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong revealed last night just how far the pay of ministers and civil service leaders has fallen behind.<br><br>A minister should be drawing $2.2 million a year or more, according to benchmarks approved by Parliament in 1994 to ensure competitive salaries for a competent and honest government.<br><br>But their actual salaries have fallen to 55 per cent of the benchmark, that is $1.2 million, and 'we have to close this gap', Mr Lee said last night.<br><br>He did not say if ministers' pay will be raised fully to this amount, or when it will go up. Details of the salary changes across the civil service will be announced in Parliament on April 9 by Defence Minister Teo Chee Hean, who oversees the public service.<br><br>Speaking at the annual Administrative Service dinner, Mr Lee explained that salaries had to be reviewed so the public sector can keep its share of talented Singaporeans.<br><br>'This is an urgent problem. We have experienced on previous occasions the painful consequences of responding too slowly when the private sector surged ahead,' he said.<br><br>In the 1990s, this led to the Administrative Service, the key service from which most public sector leaders are drawn, losing entire cohorts of young and good officers.<br><br>Administrative Officers (AOs) in their early 30s are at a 'critical decision point' in their careers, and the Government must keep their salaries market competitive to retain the able ones.<br><br>Today, their salaries are in line with the private-sector benchmark created for this group. But with salaries for young professionals moving up, especially in the financial sector, Mr Lee expects salaries in this group to 'soon come under pressure'.<br><br>Fast-growing salaries explain why the Government has embarked on a review of civil service salaries covering all services where pay has fallen behind the private sector.<br><br>Also important is to review the salaries of ministers, judges and statutory appointment holders such as the Attorney-General and Auditor-General, said Mr Lee.<br><br>'It is even more critical for us to keep these salaries competitive, so as to be able to bring in a continuing flow of able and successful people to be ministers and judges.<br><br>'Unless there is a first-class political leadership and judiciary, the Civil Service, however capable and dedicated, will not be able to function properly,' he said.<br><br>Ministerial and top public sector salaries have been pegged to those of top private-sector earners since 1994, when Parliament debated and approved the use of benchmarks to ensure the public sector continued to attract its share of talent, and to provide for regular adjustments to keep pace with private-sector earnings.<br><br>There are two benchmarks or formulae spelling out how the salaries are to be pegged.<br><br>The first is the MR4 benchmark for ministers and senior permanent secretaries.<br><br>Yesterday, the Public Service Division released data on the median incomes of the top eight earners in the six professions to which MR4 salaries are pegged. Lawyers earned the most, with a median income among the top eight of $4.29 million.<br><br>The second benchmark is the SR9 benchmark for top AOs in their early 30s.<br><br>Mr Lee mapped out how in the years since 1994, the 'scramble for talent' has become a global phenomenon.<br><br>Talented Singaporeans are now being head-hunted by top global companies as well as by other governments keen to replicate the Singapore success story.<br><br>Top students are turning down government scholarships as their families or universities were willing to fund their education.<br><br>At the same time, the demands on high-quality governance have gone up, as a result of globalisation and a more advanced economy, he said.<br><br>With Singapore now operating near the 'leading edge' in public policy, public-sector leaders cannot rely on the best practices of other countries, but have to break new ground and find fresh solutions.<br><br>First-class people are therefore needed to anticipate problems, come up with creative solutions and lead teams.<br><br>He said 'first-class governance' which can be provided only by a top-grade public sector was a 'sustainable advantage' that Singapore should 'zealously uphold'.<br><br>While public officers must serve from a sense of idealism and duty and not be motivated mainly by financial reward, they should not be expected to make 'unreasonable financial sacrifices' to be in public service, he added.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>We need tighten media control, the world press stating that we have 148th worst media is nonsense. We give a lot of freedom. </blockquote>Actually, there is something very simple that we can do. So simple that it probably has been overlooked by many pple cos they are too caught up in the rat race, and it has been ingrained into our lifestyle that we find it hard not to do it. i refer to reading of the local papers.<br><br>Stop reading local papers. Read The International Herald Tribune,The Washington Post, New York Times, etc..any foreign papers as long as its not from sph.<br>It seems such an easy task to do but not many can do it cos we have been "engineered" to get our daily dose of info from ST,TNP cos of accessibility and convenience.  Foreign papers are more expensive but are readily available in libraries.<br><br>Has anyone ever wondered the degree of bombardment we get frm the papers and how they easily influence pple who accept everything they read (which is sadly,the case for many s'poreans) ? And wats more, it is subconscious. Example is when 'A' lvl results were released,on a pg of the section, 80% of the pg is dedicated to straight As students while maybe less than 20% is abt average students. And who can forget the '4As-only-gal-who-cried-like-its-the-end-of-the-world' ? Wat is media trying to prove? Wat abt issues like FTs,Employment,Wages,GST etc..?<br><br>We cant stop media from publishing wat they(gahmentt) wan us to read, but we have a choice NOT to read it. Y allow ourselves to get brainwashed (subconsciously) ?<br><br>Juz food for thought..<br><br></div>
