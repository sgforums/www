            <div class='col-md body'>Govt subsidizes $2B for HDB housing programme over the last 5 years.<br><br>_______________________________________________________________<br><span style="color: red;">This is the same misguided bitch that keeps mouthing HDB propaganda sentences. Like the people are so stupid, they cannot see thru it.</span><br><br>&lt;<br><span style="color: red;">In the first place, values of housing in Tampines were already inflated to begin with. The fishing ponds and kampongs that used to be there were expropriated for a few cents on the dollar. If they want to use market value, than they should use what they actually paid for the land. If they had done this, each Tampines flat would have cost around $50,000 and not the $250,000 they sold to the public. So, its all inflated. I used to live around Tampines, and I can tell you they moved out all the villagers into flats and paid them pennies on the dollar. </span><br><br>&lt;<br><span style="color: red;">Don't dare to reveal it, just say so lah.</span><br><br>&lt;<br><span style="color: red;">Someone forgot to give this bitch a basic lesson in econs. The input costs of land and building is a major deciding factor on the market value of the end product. No builder in his right mind will dare sell you a flat at the "market" value if he did not know his own costs. What if the market is down for that year? A developer selling his units at "market" value in a down year could easily suffer losses. The input costs are totally relevant to his calculation if the breakeven</span>.<br><br>&lt;<br><span style="color: red;">As the HDB controls 90% of the residential market, there is therefore no"open" market. If the land in S'pore were divided up among 50 developers, than maybe there might be an open market</span>.<br><br>&lt;<br>If this subsidy is not real, why should many flat buyers choose to buy new flats from HDB instead of resale flats in the open market using the CPF Housing Grant?&lt;&lt;<br><br><span style="color: red;">The subsidy is not real because the cost of the land was marked up many hundreds of percent. A true subsidy would be to base the cost of the flat on the cost of what they actually paid for the land. In any case, if she is confident that they is a subsidy, than lets open up the books and see what the real costs are</span>.<br><br>&lt;<br><span style="color: red;">Its all a numbers game.The HDB was a huge cash cow for the PAP for decades, and now suddenly running into red ink. The presence of red ink in their estimation means that there is a subsidy. What bullshit. The financial statements were audited by the Auditor general of S'pore, another civil servant, and not by a big accounting firm. I fail to see how it can be impartial</span>.<br><br></div>

Relying on the concept of opportunity cost, the Chief Valuer, at the behest of either the Ministry of National Development or the Ministry of Trade and Industry (I am not sure which), has valued land across Singapore using Raffles Place land as the benchmark.

We wish to state that it is not so.<br><br>It is a fundamental valuation principle that lands are valued based on the specific attributes of the site, such as location, the permitted use of the land, and tenure.<br><br>The Chief Valuer's valuation has to be supported by comparative land-sales evidence.<br><br>It is simply not tenable to benchmark every plot of land to Raffles Place pricing, as this would drive property prices beyond the reach of most Singaporeans.<br><br>For example, state land alienated by the Singapore Land Authority for housing in Tampines will be valued taking into account the market values of housing in Tampines, while state land for industrial use in Tuas will take into account industrial- land values in Tuas, etc.<br><br>Second, Mr Leong asked HDB to reveal its land and construction costs to prove that HDB flats are subsidised. He has missed the point.<br><br>To understand the full extent of public-housing subsidy for new HDB flats, one should be comparing the market value of the flats with the sale prices charged by HDB, rather than look at the input costs of land and building.<br><br>New flats are subsidised as they are being sold at prices that are lower than what they would otherwise fetch in the open market.<br><br>If this subsidy is not real, why should many flat buyers choose to buy new flats from HDB instead of resale flats in the open market using the CPF Housing Grant?<br><br>Third, Mr Leong asserted that HDB has not kept up with the standards of disclosure in the private sector. He is wrong.<br><br>HDB's financial statements are prepared in accordance with the Financial Reporting Standards, audited by the Auditor-General and tabled in Parliament for information.<br><br>HDB's standards of disclosure and governance are no less than those required of publicly listed companies and real-estate investment trusts in Singapore.<br><br>Overall, HDB is unable to recover the development cost of new flats that it offers to the public, and has incurred a deficit averaging $390 million in its home-ownership programme in the last five years. These figures are reported in HDB's audited financial statements, which are publicly available for inspection and scrutiny.<br><br>Kee Lay Cheng (Ms)<br>Deputy Director<br>(Marketing &amp; Projects)<br>For Director (Estate Administration &amp; Property)<br>Housing &amp; Development Board<br><br>[/b]</blockquote>All i can say is that her answers are not sound.<br><br><blockquote>Second, Mr Leong asked HDB to reveal its land and construction costs to prove that HDB flats are subsidised. He has missed the point. </blockquote>It is beyond condescending to claim a person was pursuing the wrong line of argument when one has hardly stated their own case. Despite Mr Leong's demand that HDB 'show hand', Ms Kee deflects the argument with a weak salvo and a poor one-line explanation that the flats are indeed 'subsidised'; in effect simply reiterating her earlier point, without providing new substantial evidence to back it up.<br><br><blockquote>If this subsidy is not real, why should many flat buyers choose to buy new flats from HDB instead of resale flats in the open market using the CPF Housing Grant? </blockquote>Singaporeans will obviously go for the one option that can provide a line of credit to avoid the maximum amount of debt. Coupled by the fact that resale flats are always more costly than new flats, her response completely lacks substance. Why on earth is this even considered an answer?</div>
