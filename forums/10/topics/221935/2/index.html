Many Executive flats unsold.<br><br>There is only 1 reason - Pricing. They are priced so much higher than 4 rooms flats.<br><br>So again, it support my argument. Gov, go on and sell land parcel to Private Developer and try to sell to the bulk of population as Pte apt/condo. Even now, there are still plenty entry level/mid level condo still unsold.<br><br>The arugument of "land could be sold at higher price to pte developer, etc" is just BS.</div>

Relying on the concept of opportunity cost, the Chief Valuer, at the behest of either the Ministry of National Development or the Ministry of Trade and Industry (I am not sure which), has valued land across Singapore using Raffles Place land as the benchmark.

If they suspect that the flats are not 'at market price', they can buy private apartments.<br><br>However, the ongoing demand for the flats speaks for their market value. If a comparison were to be made, private apartments are still beyond the reach of the majority of Singaporeans.<br><br>Secondly, in view of the subsidy, owners should sell their flats back to HDB if they want to upgrade. However, HDB is good enough to allow owners to sell their flats in the open market and make a tidy profit.<br><br>Thirdly, the flats have improved in design and size since they were first built. If the flats are not 'at market price' and therefore unattractive, why are some Singaporeans using the names of their siblings, aunts and uncles who are still single to purchase these flats with the intention of selling them later?<br><br>I voted for a government which is trustworthy, honest and capable in every sense of the word and I have no cause to doubt the credibility of the HDB.<br><br>In fact, I appreciate what the Government has done to house poor Singaporeans like me in the 1960s when we were desperate for a roof over our heads during the Indonesian Confrontation.<br><br>Today, our housing system is a pride of the nation.

I think ST Forum is trying to publish the other side of the argument.  Just like in any forum out there, I think there are anti-PAP as well as pro-PAP supporters, just that this particular forum of ours seems to have a greater collection of anti-govt topics.<br><br>In any case, I agree with your point that nowadays, no Singapore govt agency is being run under a loss-making model.<br><br>Most of the govt agencies have govt scholars at the helm being trained to balance whatever monies that they are given from MOF.  To excel (or to show that they are one-up on other scholars), some of them will even propose ideas that are revenue-earning somehow forgetting the context of the govt agency they are working in.  Sometimes these ideas will get recognised, sometimes they get modified or sometimes abandoned and the poor scholar gets rotated to some other govt agency to be replaced by other scholars to inject new ideas.<br><br>Whatever the case, there is already intense pressure for scholars within govt agencies to bring the agencies to higher levels of excellence, so it is unlikely we will come across a knowledgeable and learned scholar who can think differently and explain himself against these trends.</div>
