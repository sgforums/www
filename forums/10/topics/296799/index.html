            <div class='col-md body'>Don't think our 147th will report on this:<br><br>Asia Times<br>Southeast Asia<br>Dec 12, 2007<br>Malaysia's crackdown on dissent widens<br>http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/IL12Ae01.html<br>By Anil Netto<br><br>PENANG - The administration of Malaysian Prime Minister Abdullah<br>Badawi, rattled in recent months by a series of street protests,<br>launched on Sunday another tough crackdown against peaceful<br>demonstrators in which at least 23 human-rights lawyers, activists and<br>opposition politicians were arrested.<br><br>The Malaysian Bar Council planned its annual walk for human rights in<br>downtown Kuala Lumpur, which some predicted could have seen a turnout<br>similar to an earlier march held in the administrative capital of<br>Putrajaya in September where some 2,000 people participated.<br><br>But the council backed down in the face of warnings from the<br>authorities that stern action would be taken against those involved in<br>public demonstrations. Its "Festival of Rights" celebrations were then<br>moved to its premises in Kuala Lumpur. A group of prominent<br>human-rights lawyers and several dozen activists and supporters,<br>however, decided to press ahead with the march. Observers said police<br>outnumbered the marchers by a ratio of around five-to-one.<br><br>Eight demonstrators were arrested after they tried to negotiate an<br>extension of the short time that police had granted them to complete<br>their march on the planned route. They were charged in court Monday<br>with participating in an "illegal assembly" and failing to disperse<br>when ordered. They were later released on bail, but the offenses carry<br>possible fines and jail terms of 30 months.<br><br>"If the choice is between public safety and public freedom, I do not<br>hesitate to say here that public safety will always win," said Prime<br>Minister Abdullah, according to media reports. "Malaysians must never,<br>ever, take their peace for granted and they must continue to be<br>responsible to each other."<br><br>Rights groups, for their part, slammed the arrests. "We are appalled<br>that even a small gathering of marchers to a nearby destination in an<br>orderly manner without obstructing the traffic or causing any chaos to<br>the public cannot be allowed or tolerated by this oppressive regime,"<br>said P Ramakrishnan, president of the social reform group Aliran.<br><br>"If this little act of a democratic principle cannot be exercised in a<br>responsible manner, can we pretend to be a democratic country any<br>longer?"<br><br>Police also detained Edmund Bon, head of the Bar Council human-rights<br>committee, for allegedly trying to obstruct security personnel from<br>removing publicity banners placed on the Bar Council's buildings. A<br>Malaysian Bar official said that the banners were clearly within the<br>Bar's premises. Bon was released on bail Monday.<br><br>On Sunday evening, two prominent opposition politicians, Tian Chua and<br>Mohamad Sabu, along with 12 activists, were also arrested for their<br>involvement in another gathering the authorities considered an<br>"illegal assembly". Most of them were crowd control marshals from the<br>opposition Parti Islam Malaysia (PAS) who had participated in a<br>November 10 rally in the capital which called for electoral reforms.<br><br>The rally was organized by the Coalition for Clean and Fair Elections<br>(BERSIH), an initiative spearheaded by civil society groups and backed<br>by a number of opposition parties. PAS marshals were widely credited<br>for ensuring a peaceful and orderly rally attended by some 50,000<br>people, mostly ethnic Malays, though other ethnic groups also<br>participated. Police, however, used tear gas and water cannons on<br>sections of the crowd in a bid to disperse them.<br><br>The BERSIH rally was followed by another large protest on November 25,<br>when an estimated 30,000 ethnic Indians from across the country<br>converged in Kuala Lumpur to highlight what they perceived to be<br>systematic ethnic marginalization and religious discrimination by the<br>government.<br><br>The rally was spearheaded by the Hindu Rights Action Force (HINDRAF)<br>and led by a small group of vocal ethnic Indian Malaysian lawyers.<br>Last week a group of 31 HINDRAF protesters were slapped with the<br>charge of "attempted murder" of a policeman during the November 25<br>rally, while 16 of them were also charged with taking part in an<br>illegal assembly.<br><br>In the eastern state of Trenggganu, two PAS members have been charged<br>with causing injury to a police officer during another rally in<br>September which similarly called for electoral reforms. Both<br>opposition party members have been denied bail.<br><br>Still, the string of arrests have not deterred another small group of<br>five lawyers and opposition politicians from marching in Kuching, East<br>Malaysia on Monday morning in a symbolic gesture to mark Human Rights<br>Day, reported the independent news portal Malaysiakini.<br><br>Some analysts believe that the widening gap between rich and the poor<br>in Malaysia is fueling the growing number of protests. They point out<br>that neo-liberal economic and privatization policies, cuts in<br>subsidies for essential services, and rising fuel and food prices have<br>burdened the poor.<br><br>Indeed, most of those attending the recent large BERSIH and HINDRAF<br>protests appeared to be from lower income groups. "The underlying<br>causes [of the protests] are economic," said prominent economist<br>Subramaniam Pillay. "There is a widening income disparity between<br>unskilled and semi-skilled workers on the one hand, and skilled<br>workers and connected people on the other."<br><br>He added that the incomes of unskilled and semi-skilled workers had<br>been depressed by cheap foreign labor. Subramaniam is also chairperson<br>of the steering committee of the civil society Coalition Against<br>Health Care Privatization. The Coalition today received the 2007<br>Malaysian human rights award from the Kuala Lumpur-based rights group<br>Suaram for its campaign.<br><br>The mass arrests and trials of demonstrators in court are worryingly<br>reminiscent of the mass trials during the so-called Reformasi streets<br>protests of 1998-2001, when dozens were hauled to court to face<br>charges of illegal assembly. Some believe that the protracted trials<br>of that period, including of former finance minister Anwar Ibrahim,<br>served two purposes: they sapped the energy of the Reformasi<br>demonstrators by dragging them through the court system, while the<br>trials also deterred others from taking part in more protests.<br><br>Unlike his predecessor Mahathir Mohamad, Prime Minister Abdullah has<br>not yet used the draconian Internal Security Act against those<br>mobilizing the demonstrators - though he has not discounted the<br>possibility. Abdullah, whose reform agenda to stamp out corruption and<br>abuse of power has floundered, now faces a ground swell of popular<br>disenchantment which has spilled onto the streets.<br><br>The year-end season of discontent could force him to delay plans for<br>calling an early snap general election, which is due at the latest by<br>early 2009. Instead, prominent opposition politicians believe the<br>embattled premier is on the brink of ordering a major crackdown<br>against dissent.<br><br>(Inter Press Service with editing by Asia Times Online)</div>
