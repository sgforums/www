              <p>Very nice but remember why the KPE was built to begin with?   To ease traffic off other roads.  Now they put ERP there under the guise of safety to discourage use?</p>
              <p>The way I see it, if you put a room full of monkeys together for a long enough period, they will be able to come up with excuses for anything.    However, if you stop and look at all the excuses at one go, you'll find them all contradicting each other.</p>

              some crowed places.</p>

              <p><br>ANd to be very frank, according to our govt, our CPF and ERP system is an envy of other countries. But they are unable to follow us, why??, cos they dun hve the kind of citzens like we, the so called guai guai citizens, let say if govt is going to put 20 ERP gantries up tomorrow, most of us will be grumbling and commenting, but no one is stopping it, the project carry on as usual. Likewise, if it happened in other countries, riot and street protest may even tear the Ministry of Transport down.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So actually our govt jobs is the most relax and simple in the world, just implement and let the crowd grumbles and complain over any forums or kopi tiams, cos they knew nothing will surface, all just talk cork only</p>

              <p>...<em>right</em>.</p>
              <p>The increased number of babies would, in turn, lessen the number of foreign talents needed, therefore allowing more jobs for our own homegrown Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>With jobs, the standard of living of the people would increase.</p>
