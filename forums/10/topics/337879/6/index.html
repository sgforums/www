              <p>True. A business is run by people so as far as possible the people there should be touched last. Easier for me to say this here than for me to act if I am confronted with the situation.</p>
              <p>I suppose one could cut the profit margin....</p>
              <p>If I go back to discussing property, you are the second person that tells me "Property down does not means people are unhappy", although I am trying my best to link "cut cost of living" to "lower in property price"</p>
              <p>But if I just sink in $600k into the 5 room AMK flat and next year I am seeing next door resaling 5 room at $300k, wouldn't I feel very unhappy?</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>To seek the easy way in business cost is to cut wages, retrenchment is also a cut in wages, so to speak, if wages come down, workers suffer, bosses and the rich ones still remain the same. And when workers/wage earners who lost his/her job or wage reduced, they cannot keep up with the inflation, installment, bills..etc etc, they sell their properties to survive, with so many selling, price of property goes down, and the rich ones/bosses will take this opportunity to buy at a low cost from the wage earners. So, the wage earners is in a lost lost condition, whereas the bosses/rich ones are in a win win situation.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Property down does not means people are unhappy, some take it as an opportunity to exploit further. Afterall, if these rich ones dun sell their millions dollars house, up or down is not worrying for them, it is only a paper lost.</p>

              <p>We are all being cheated of our CPF already.  Can see cannot touch.  Retirement age up to 85? Is that the average longetivity of all man or just certain people?</p>
              <p>What if the average age raise up to 110 based on one è€�ä¸�æ­»ã€‚Then you can come back with your spirit to demand your CPF.</p>
              <p>Oh i almost forget.  Minimum sum increase hor.... Maybe next time min sum to withdraw at 110 will be $1m with benchmark of your minister.  So how then you expect to take out?  WLL also dun have.  So is that being cheated?</p>
              <p>Also with the increasing Highly Dangerous Building price going up like rocket hor.... people who buy it will empty their CPF.  And to get that min sum maybe company will be paying hades notes to their employees as salaries and cpf.  Only then made be can be hit the target.</p>

              <p>True. A business is run by people so as far as possible the people there should be touched last. Easier for me to say this here than for me to act if I am confronted with the situation.</p>
              <p>I suppose one could cut the profit margin....</p>

              <p>But if I just sink in $600k into the 5 room AMK flat and next year I am seeing next door resaling 5 room at $300k, wouldn't I feel very unhappy?</p>
