              <p>Whether people are happy about the property price or not really depends on what they want.   Some people buy and rent property, buy and sell property.  If the property price is roaring it is good news to them but bad news to tenants.</p>

It is clear that he is here to find fault.   Anyone who does not speak according to his fancy he will show his colour.   He is here to disrupt discussion and expect us all to say things to please him.   To say things to please him means we are not allowed by him to say anything negative about the ruling party.  He is ever so fast defending the ruling party.   </p>

              <p><br>actually you did not saying anything wrong....</p>
              <p>my comment was solely a reply to your earlier statement. fact remains that most people will make a tidy sum when they sell their flat.... i made 200 grand.</p>
              <p>you can, of course, take that 200 grand and together with your CPF, buy a condo.... your choice.</p>
              <p>i have asked this question before, maybe not to you.... has anyone been cheated of the CPF? ie, anyone who did not get back their CPF either in cash or assets?</p>
              <p>the fact that the garmen amassed more wealth through our CPF is another issue altogether.</p>

              <p>Bro, you have said nothing wrong, don't heck care about this frustrated man. It is clear that he is here to find fault.   Anyone who does not speak according to his fancy he will show his colour.   He is here to disrupt discussion and expect us all to say things to please him.   To say things to please him means we are not allowed by him to say anything negative about the ruling party.  <strong>He is ever so fast defending the ruling party.   </strong></p>

              <p>Hey all</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I'm new to SG forums! Great to see an active community posting their thoughts and opinions so candidly! Who said freedom of speech is dead in Singapore?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Just though I'd post some thoughts that have been burning in my mind the past few years.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I'm a Singaporean, born and bred and I'm damn proud of Singapore. Politically, I am happy with the way the government has tried to raise the quality of life for its citizens and create a sustainable economy. Is it a perfect government? Definitely not! Has it made mistakes? Of course! Can it go easier on the opposition? Maybe.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But I'd question the views of some who would like Singapore to be a democracy more like the US and similar western countries. Does a Confucian culture like ours really suit a western style democracy?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>One only has to look at Taiwan and maybe the Philippines to see that a western democracy may not work in Singapore. Can a small country and resource-less country like S'pore really prosper without the ability to plan ahead due to ever changing governments? Can it attract FDI with a unstable political climate?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Why not focus on the good the government has done for Singapore? We have transformed ourselves from a third world nation to a first in a lifetime. With the majority of country having themselves and their offspring alleviated in their quality of life. Do we actually understand the enormity of that accomplishment?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Why not focus on the bigger picture when there is a policy you disagree with? ERP went up? Yes, but road tax went down. So the government does not charge you for ownership, but for usage instead. Sounds wise for a country with small land size and increasing car ownership.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Whew! I do think Singaporeans do sometimes forget how blessed we are to have a government that tries its best. I look forward to hearing your replies.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>NB: the author does not work in the civil service and is not propogating a biased view of the Singapore government. He just really is proud of Singapore. : )</p>

              <p>If wage comes down, some people will find property at existing price (if it could be "controlled" like you say) less affordable. Lower rent may also induce people to stop delay buying and switch to rent instead. Therefore property price will also come down since less people buying?

              <p><br>To seek the easy way in business cost is to cut wages, retrenchment is also a cut in wages, so to speak, if wages come down, workers suffer, bosses and the rich ones still remain the same. And when workers/wage earners who lost his/her job or wage reduced, they cannot keep up with the inflation, installment, bills..etc etc, they sell their properties to survive, with so many selling, price of property goes down, and the rich ones/bosses will take this opportunity to buy at a low cost from the wage earners. So, the wage earners is in a lost lost condition, whereas the bosses/rich ones are in a win win situation.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Property down does not means people are unhappy, some take it as an opportunity to exploit further. Afterall, if these rich ones dun sell their millions dollars house, up or down is not worrying for them, it is only a paper lost.</p>
