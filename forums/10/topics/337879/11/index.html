              <p>Tis is wat i think la...</p>
              <p>ther r people who think PAP did a good job while there r people who think they do not. I try to classify them into categories</p>
              <p>Hate PAP</p>
              <p>1) Believe in democracy. Hate gov in their dealing on freedom of speech and dealing with opposition</p>
              <p>2) Hate the salary of ministers and connections of a certain family</p>
              <p>3) Felt life is getting worse than before and blame on gov</p>
              <p>4) Believe gov r genuinely incapable</p>
              <p>Love PAP</p>
              <p>1) Respect figures, statistic and results showing singapore achieving a lot despite many limitations</p>
              <p>2) do not believe in democracy as it does not work in many areas while singapore model is getting popular among emerging countries. Democratic countries seems to face problems with model of democracy</p>
              <p>3) genuine believe gov is helping citizen in many areas using scientific and logical ways</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If i am not wrong, u will see arguments going about these few points above.</p>
              <p>My personal belief is tat democracy is not working as well as others thought it should. It has nothing to do with confucious etc but by seeing news and how good the governance these countries r doing. In democratic countries, people r spoilt and no matter who become gov, the popularity drops like crazy over silly small things. People r no longer united and seems to split into different sides of the fence. Gov to please the people start to do ridiculous and short term decisions. People just wanted change as though it is some miracles and they just keeping changing gov while life simply becomes worse and worse because no one wanna lose out for the greater good.</p>
              <p>I just do not see why people think democracy is good. I think it is just western propanganda</p>
