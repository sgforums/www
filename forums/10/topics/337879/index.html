              <p>Hey all</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I'm new to SG forums! Great to see an active community posting their thoughts and opinions so candidly! Who said freedom of speech is dead in Singapore?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Just though I'd post some thoughts that have been burning in my mind the past few years.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I'm a Singaporean, born and bred and I'm damn proud of Singapore. Politically, I am happy with the way the government has tried to raise the quality of life for its citizens and create a sustainable economy. Is it a perfect government? Definitely not! Has it made mistakes? Of course! Can it go easier on the opposition? Maybe.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But I'd question the views of some who would like Singapore to be a democracy more like the US and similar western countries. Does a Confucian culture like ours really suit a western style democracy?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>One only has to look at Taiwan and maybe the Philippines to see that a western democracy may not work in Singapore. Can a small country and resource-less country like S'pore really prosper without the ability to plan ahead due to ever changing governments? Can it attract FDI with a unstable political climate?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Why not focus on the good the government has done for Singapore? We have transformed ourselves from a third world nation to a first in a lifetime. With the majority of country having themselves and their offspring alleviated in their quality of life. Do we actually understand the enormity of that accomplishment?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Why not focus on the bigger picture when there is a policy you disagree with? ERP went up? Yes, but road tax went down. So the government does not charge you for ownership, but for usage instead. Sounds wise for a country with small land size and increasing car ownership.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Whew! I do think Singaporeans do sometimes forget how blessed we are to have a government that tries its best. I look forward to hearing your replies.</p>

              <p>I hardly think I'm Confucian in my beliefs and practices.  The new generation of Singaporeans who are more westernized are coming up.  Time for a change don't you think?  After all, why should a generation of westernizd Singaporeans be governed by Confucian standards that obviously do not reflect the will of the people?</p>
              <p>The problem here is not with the politics but rather the quality of the future leaders.  Both the governing party and opposition party MUST have a high calibre of leadership (brain power) in order for a future multi-party legislature to exist effectively.</p>
              <p>Current standards opposition members are just too low to risk anything other than token opposition to policies.  Opposition needs to show that they have people who can think far ahead in good rationality for Singapore especially in crafting economic policies. That needs to change before we can see any changes in the political climate.</p>

              <p>Assuming you're an ethnic Chinese who susbcribes to Confucian values, you have no business to believe in a democracy, is there? After all, did your ancestors not live in a monarchy for more than two millenia?</p>
              <p>So what's a "non-westernised concept of democracy" besides a smokescreen utilised by despots and tyrants to mask their authoritarian regimes? For starters, is democracy actually a western or universal concept (regardless of its history of origin)?</p>
              <p>Taking this regime's argument further, where should the "non-western" standards stop? Should we extend these standards further such that it would justify preaching a brand of "non-western" human rights and press freedom to fit in with "Confucian values"?</p>

              <p>I'm new to SG forums! Great to see an active community posting their thoughts and opinions so candidly! Who said freedom of speech is dead in Singapore?</p>

Politically, I am happy with the way the government has tried to raise the quality of life for its citizens and create a sustainable economy. Is it a perfect government? Definitely not! Has it made mistakes? Of course! Can it go easier on the opposition? Maybe.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But I'd question the views of some who would like Singapore to be a democracy more like the US and similar western countries. Does a Confucian culture like ours really suit a western style democracy?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>One only has to look at Taiwan and maybe the Philippines to see that a western democracy may not work in Singapore. Can a small country and resource-less country like S'pore really prosper without the ability to plan ahead due to ever changing governments? Can it attract FDI with a unstable political climate?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Why not focus on the good the government has done for Singapore? We have transformed ourselves from a third world nation to a first in a lifetime. With the majority of country having themselves and their offspring alleviated in their quality of life. Do we actually understand the enormity of that accomplishment?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Why not focus on the bigger picture when there is a policy you disagree with? ERP went up? Yes, but road tax went down. So the government does not charge you for ownership, but for usage instead. Sounds wise for a country with small land size and increasing car ownership.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Whew! I do think Singaporeans do sometimes forget how blessed we are to have a government that tries its best. I look forward to hearing your replies.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Not too sure of the government's popularity currently, but if votes are anything to go by, the majority of Singaporeans are at the very least confident that the current administration can deliver a better Singapore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When I say Confucian, I refer generally more to the culture values that the majority of Chinese Singaporeans (which make up almost 76% of the local population) hold to. As you will know, though there are more and more western minded people in Singapore, the majority of heartlanders do still adhere more to Confucian values like community mindedness, respect for elders etc.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>I'm not working for the government nor am I am monitoring the forum for them, trust me, they have smarter people than me analysing the forums and are aware of the anti-establisment sentiments here.</p>

              <p>Wow!</p>

              <p>So many responses in less than a 12 hours, many disagreements to a few personal attacks. Geez, you guys really have alot of resentment.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Let's try to tackle the responses one at a time.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My previous post is not a joke nor am I making a mistake- I am serious and clear headed when I say I am proud of Singapore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Not too sure of the government's popularity currently, but if votes are anything to go by, the majority of Singaporeans are at the very least confident that the current administration can deliver a better Singapore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When I say Confucian, I refer generally more to the culture values that the majority of Chinese Singaporeans (which make up almost 76% of the local population) hold to. As you will know, though there are more and more western minded people in Singapore, the majority of heartlanders do still adhere more to Confucian values like community mindedness, respect for elders etc.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I'm not working for the government nor am I am monitoring the forum for them, trust me, they have smarter people than me analysing the forums and are aware of the anti-establisment sentiments here.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Rude of me to not have intro myself further. I'm....</p>
