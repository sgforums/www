              <p>If Ho Ching had not made these investment losses, Singapore would not have to take the unprecedented step of dipping into our reserves to fund the Resilience Package. Good job Mrs Lee, for setting another national record!</p>
              <p>And what is our 'elected' President Nathan doing? Why is he not asking Temasek and GIC the tough questions that need to be asked? Why is it that after the budget announcement, he has not come out to defend the decision of using the second key himself? He is the president and yet he lets others defend his decisions for him, same as Ho Ching. Is this what we call leadership? Is this accountability?</p>
              <p>Wake up Singaporeans! The system is broken because the ruling party has circumvented all the checks and balances. Our complacency has led to this. Wake up before it is too late!</p>

              <p>well done for pointing that out.   If it is just any other Singaporean doing the job, she or he would have been sacked.   ho jinx is an exception as she belongs to the lee family.</p>
              <p>nathan is a puppet, his masters are senile dictator and hopeless bloody lee hsien loong.    IN the history of Singapore, only the beloved late President Ong Teng Cheong dared to ask for it but unfortunately after that someone took over his position.   The rule of the game to continue to be PResident in Singapore is never do anything that does not please the senile tyrant and PAP.   </p>

              <p>And guess what, you may be anti-PAP but the moment you say that you are against what Dr CSJ did to discredit the opposition in the eyes of Singaporeans, they brand you as ass-licking dogs of the regime.</p>
              <p>They frequently accuse the regime of being close-minded but frankly speaking, they are no better.</p>
              <p>Sometimes, not worth getting pek cek over these bigoted people who just rant and rant against the regime. They are just anarchists who will spare no effort in attributing any pseudo-mistake on the regime. Their raison d'etre exists because the regime is there. Remove the regime and their arguments suddenly sound very hollow and baseless.</p>

              <p><br>Interestingly, the only 2 Presidents that did not get a state funeral was Devan Nair and Ong Teng Cheong. For Devan Nair  - it was understandable since he had to step down due to alcoholism (but I personally feel that he was still a President and for the so called slight personal problem, he still did his job as President in a dignified way for most part, and deserved a state funeral).</p>
              <p>Ong Teng Cheong retired gracefully like former President Wee Kim Wee. Yet Wee Kim Wee got a state funeral but Ong Teng Cheong did not. Did Singaporeans ever wonder why? Because Ong Teng Cheong did his best to do his job to test the boundaries of the elected Presidency by daring to ask questions about the country's reserves and daring to speak out that he was hindered in his role. This takes courage and integrity. Hats off the the man, woo-hooo!</p>

              <p>I agree. I am not into PAP bashing, or criticise the ruling party just for the sake of it. But I believe in the saying that "<strong>absolute power corrupts absolutely".</strong> History has proven this correct. However, well intentioned the original aim was, over time human nature takes a selfish road because there is an intrinsic self-preservation mode built into human pysche.</p>
              <p>Look at the communists - the original intention was to get rid of abuse and unfairness by the rich, the royal and the landed. But in the end, what happens? After the so-called class struggle - there are still the rich, the royal and the landed (the new communist ruling elite).  <strong>But they are so entrenched,  no one dared questioned them for decades</strong>!</p>
              <p>Remember the book "Animal Farm" by George Orwell? In the book, the animals revolted against the farmers but in the end, among them, the pigs brainwashed the rest of the animals so that the animals give up their will, rights and liberty. </p>
              <p>So while PAP has done much for Singapore in the past, and had generally been an efficient government, that does not mean that they will remain so. The future belongs to us - not a single political party. We must have alternative voices to keep not just PAP but any future ruling party in check - because absolutely power corrupts absolutely.</p>
              <p>Multi-party systems in other countries may be more messy, but we have to live with that for liberty. Quoting a Christian scripture (which is also a value shared by all other religions) - "man does not live by bread alone." Thus, material wealth aka a strong economy while important, is on its own not enough for a good life. It is not a good enough justification to agree to chain down your human spirit, your creative mind, your independant thoughts, your integrity. Man is meant to be free.</p>
