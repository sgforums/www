              <p><span class="postbody">Temasek takes severe hit 
              <br> By Thanong Khanthong 
              <br> The Nation 
              <br> Published on February 9, 2009 
              <br> <br> CEO Ho Ching's exit won't alter fortunes of the sovereign wealth fund in short term 
              <br> <br> Ho Ching's resignation as CEO of Temasek Holdings would not cloud heavy
              losses of about 40 per cent at Singapore's sovereign wealth fund amid
              the global financial market meltdown. <br> <br> The Government Investment Corporation of Singapore (GIC) is also suffering similar heavy losses. 
              <br> <br> An investment analyst in Singapore said Temasek's results will be
              released in April and he estimated that of its US$125 billion portfolio
              as of March 2008, Temasek would have lost 40 per cent, leaving it with
              about US$75 billion left. <br> <br> As for the Government Investment Corporation of Singapore or GIC, the
              investment analyst said it would also lose more than a third of the
              value of its investment portfolio. <br> <br> "GIC started the crisis with roughly Singapore $550 billion in
              reserves. My estimate is that it has lost about $190-$200 billion of
              that, leaving it with about $350 billion left. This amount is
              equivalent to 200 per cent of Singapore's gross domestic product," he
              added. <br> <br> "So both have lost money but their performance has not been out of line
              with other large funds, possibly a bit better. These are all worst-case
              estimates." <br> <br> Ho, the wife of Prime Minister Lee Hsieng Loong, announced last week
              that after almost seven years at the helm of Temasek, she would step
              down by October this year. She would be succeeded by Chip Goodyear, a
              former CEO of BHP Billiton Ltd, who would be the first foreigner to run
              the sovereign wealth fund. <br> <br> Temasek Holdings was set up by proceeds from the privatisation of
              Singapore's state-owned firms, while GIC by international reserves of
              the Monetary Authority of Singapore. Both represent the investment
              vehicles of Singapore, which has eyed for a global reach for its
              investment. <br> <br> The transition is taking place at a time when Singapore is suffering
              the worst economic problems since 1960s. Temasek, racked a return of
              about 17 per cent a year since its inception in 1974 and March this
              year, is also going to face a drastic restructuring of its investment
              strategy. <br> <br> Under her leadership, and also as wife of Prime Minister Lee Hsian
              Loong, Ho led Temasek to embark on audacious acquisitions in China,
              Asia, Europe and the United States. Temasek's buy-out of Shin Corp,
              previously owned by former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, in
              January 2006 sparked out a political turmoil inside Thailand followed
              by a military coup in September that same year. <br> <br> Ho's resignation has also sparked a debate inside Singapore. Tharman
              Shangmugaratnam, the finance minister, preferred to handle the issue
              with a diplomatic term, saying that Ho's departure wasn't linked to the
              performance of Temasek's investments. <br> <br> "Whether this is a way of making a change of someone who is related to
              the prime minister, this has been a point that I've dealt with since
              the first day Ho Ching was appointed as CEO. I was very instrumental in
              bringing in Ho Ching and it was based purely on merit and has nothing
              to do with her relationship to anyone," he said. <br> <br> The investment analyst in Singapore said Ho's resignation was planned
              for about a year. "I don't think it has much to do with Temasek's
              performance. This is Singapore, favoured people are not made to resign
              for performance! I think Singapore leaders are more concerned over the
              Sovereign Wealth Fund issue. It becomes more difficult to defend
              Singapore's sovereign wealth fund as a non-state actor with no
              political agenda if the wife of the prime minister is running it," he
              said. <br> <br> Singapore's economy is facing a severe downturn, with growth rate
              plunging into the negative territory. "We recently revised downward our
              GDP forecast to minus 2.8 per cent to reflect the likelihood that the
              contraction in the first half of 2009 could be deeper than previously
              expected," said Citi's Asia Economic Outlook and strategy (January 23,
              2009). "Advance estimates for the fourth quarter of 2008 showed a
              contraction of 2.6 per cent from a year ago, down sharply from 0.3 per
              cent the previous quarter. On a quarter on quarter seasonally adjusted
              annualised rate, the fourth quarter GDP contracted 16.9 per cent - the
              worst on record."</span></p>

              <p><br> Interestingly, the only 2 Presidents that did not get a state
                  funeral was Devan Nair and Ong Teng Cheong. For Devan NairÂ  -
                  it was understandable since he had to step down due to alcoholism
                  (but I personally feel that he was still a President and for the so
                  called slight personal problem, he still did his job as President
                  in a dignified way for most part, and deserved a state
                  funeral).</p>
              <p>Ong Teng Cheong retired gracefully like former President Wee Kim
                  Wee. Yet Wee Kim Wee got a state funeral but Ong Teng Cheong did
                  not. Did Singaporeans ever wonder why? Because Ong Teng Cheong did
                  his best to do his job to test the boundaries of the elected
                  Presidency by daring to ask questions about the country's reserves
                  and daring to speak out that he was hindered in his role. This

              <p>Haha, because that is the source you drew from with google. Shallow search, with shallow thinking, so shallow result. Was hoping you can do more research, but guess that is impossible.</p>
              <p>Giving Mr Ong a state funeral is simple, and doing it will appear to be gracious. Not doing it will make the government look stupid, and serve no purpose in furthering it's end. if you can come up with how not giving Mr Ong a state funeral will benefit PAP exclusively, let me know</p>
              <p>So this lead to the simple solution. They want to, but can't do it. Answer A will be Mr Ong asked not to have a state funeral. Unlikely, because PAP will just use that as a reason straight away.</p>
              <p>So the obvious answer, will be timing. Mr Ong died on Chinese New Year. Holding a state funeral on Chinese New Year? Not a savvy thing to do. But at the same time, they cannot announce no state funeral because of chinese new year, because that will seem racist or something. The thing probably dragged a bit, than ended with no state funeral, the end.</p>
              <p>So the official reply is "Singapore is still developing state funeral requirements" something like that, which is sort of true,considering that there was concern of having a funeral on chinese new year.</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>If you think PAP didn't give Mr Ong a state funeral because of some petty unhappiness, you misread the dept of the PAP. They are not morons who will let what happened to a dead guy affect their reputation, unless they can actually gain something from it. That's probably something CSJ will do, but not PAP.</p>

              CEO Ho Ching's exit won't alter fortunes of the
              sovereign wealth fund in short term
              
              
              Ho Ching's resignation as CEO of Temasek Holdings
              would not cloud heavy losses of about 40 per cent at
              Singapore's sovereign wealth fund amid the global
              financial market meltdown.
              
              The Government Investment Corporation of Singapore
              (GIC) is also suffering similar heavy losses.
              
              An investment analyst in Singapore said Temasek's
              results will be released in April and he estimated
              that of its US$125 billion portfolio as of March 2008,
              Temasek would have lost 40 per cent, leaving it with
              about US$75 billion left.
              As for the Government Investment Corporation of
              Singapore or GIC, the investment analyst said it would
              also lose more than a third of the value of its
              investment portfolio.
              
              "GIC started the crisis with roughly Singapore $550
              billion in reserves. My estimate is that it has lost
              about $190-$200 billion of that, leaving it with about
              $350 billion left. This amount is equivalent to 200
              per cent of Singapore's gross domestic product," he
              added.
              "So both have lost money but their performance has not
              been out of line with other large funds, possibly a
              bit better. These are all worst-case estimates."
              
              Ho, the wife of Prime Minister Lee Hsieng Loong,
              announced last week that after almost seven years at
              the helm of Temasek, she would step down by October
              this year. She would be succeeded by Chip Goodyear, a
              former CEO of BHP Billiton Ltd, who would be the first
              foreigner to run the sovereign wealth fund.
              
              Temasek Holdings was set up by proceeds from the
              privatisation of Singapore's state-owned firms, while
              GIC by international reserves of the Monetary
              Authority of Singapore. Both represent the investment
              vehicles of Singapore, which has eyed for a global
              reach for its investment.
              
              The transition is taking place at a time when
              Singapore is suffering the worst economic problems
              since 1960s. Temasek, racked a return of about 17 per
              cent a year since its inception in 1974 and March this
              year, is also going to face a drastic restructuring of
              its investment strategy.
              
              Under her leadership, and also as wife of Prime
              Minister Lee Hsian Loong, Ho led Temasek to embark on
              audacious acquisitions in China, Asia, Europe and the
              United States. Temasek's buy-out of Shin Corp,
              previously owned by former prime minister Thaksin
              Shinawatra, in January 2006 sparked out a political
              turmoil inside Thailand followed by a military coup in
              September that same year.
              
              Ho's resignation has also sparked a debate inside
              Singapore. Tharman Shangmugaratnam, the finance
              minister, preferred to handle the issue with a
              diplomatic term, saying that Ho's departure wasn't
              linked to the performance of Temasek's investments.
              
              "Whether this is a way of making a change of someone
              who is related to the prime minister, this has been a
              point that I've dealt with since the first day Ho
              Ching was appointed as CEO. I was very instrumental in
              bringing in Ho Ching and it was based purely on merit
              and has nothing to do with her relationship to
              anyone," he said.
              
              The investment analyst in Singapore said Ho's
              resignation was planned for about a year. "I don't
              think it has much to do with Temasek's performance.
              This is Singapore, favoured people are not made to
              resign for performance! I think Singapore leaders are
              more concerned over the Sovereign Wealth Fund issue.
              It becomes more difficult to defend Singapore's
              sovereign wealth fund as a non-state actor with no
              political agenda if the wife of the prime minister is
              running it," he said.
              
              Singapore's economy is facing a severe downturn, with
              growth rate plunging into the negative territory. "We
              recently revised downward our GDP forecast to minus
              2.8 per cent to reflect the likelihood that the
              contraction in the first half of 2009 could be deeper
              than previously expected," said Citi's Asia Economic
              Outlook and strategy (January 23, 2009). "Advance
              estimates for the fourth quarter of 2008 showed a
              contraction of 2.6 per cent from a year ago, down
              sharply from 0.3 per cent the previous quarter. On a
              quarter on quarter seasonally adjusted annualised
              rate, the fourth quarter GDP contracted 16.9 per cent
              - the worst on record."
              
              Singapore has recently entered into a currency swap
              arrangement with the US Federal Reserve, which worked
              out the swap arrangements with selected countries
              including Brazil and Korea, to avert the financial
              crisis, data of the US Federal Reserve show.
              Unlike Korea, which has drawn down the currency swap
              arrangement, Singapore has not yet drawn down the
              swap.

              <p><br>C'mon, paper loses are not realize lost, it is not the time to change gove/mgt, this will make more chaotic into the current situation, actually, if you look closely, we are still capable of maintaining our selves, we still got much work to do, surf internet, go exercise, drinks, etc etc as per our normal life but just abit lower due to the gloomy times, perhaps mentally, there maybe some worrying but rest assure that everything is A ok.</p>

              <p>One hv to prepare himself, train himself, prepare to take on lower income, stay relevant by education and reskilling. When the upturn come around, he/she will be in a better position to take on a better challenge, by then, we can then talk abt changing of govt, but certainly not now, you cannot change a general in a middle of a war.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>You can change a general in the middle of a war . Like co-operation when the leader did not manage to keep the company on track or even took up losses. The middle management will lose confidence with the leader also the authority and credibility of the leader will be forfieted ... So it will be time to change .</p></div>

              <p>All I can say is Well DONE!!! 58 Billion in 8 months wow!!! GREAT JOB!!!.........For those who want to give excuse to the current financial melt down by all means......</p>
              <p>But I would like to say if you pay someone sitting there to share Common views than he/She is no Great Talent because they are just commoner.....day 2 day folks....</p>
              <p>She probablyÂ have no clue andÂ not know that thereÂ were 67 Trillion dollar globallyÂ in default swap....Thanks to theÂ coupleÂ who createdÂ default swapÂ and Option who infact is justÂ basically passing the buck to the next person gameÂ Theory and does not reflect anything to the Economies.......</p>
              <p>In Sg we always tell our people to think out of the box. Obviously our leaders think that passing the buck to the next personÂ is thinking out ofÂ box........</p>
