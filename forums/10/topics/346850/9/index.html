              <p>Oh you noticed me all this while? I am deeply honoured. I am but a nondescript peasant but the great Fantagf actually noticed me.</p>
              <p>To provoke others? Of course that's one of my aims. How am I going to spark debate if I don't provoke their thoughts? If you have a way to do so without 'provoking' others, in all sense of the word, please do tell me. I am open-minded.</p>
              <p>Now onto open-mindedness, no I don't expect everyone to do as I please. It's precisely there are idi... sorry, dumbasses (it would be an insult to idiots to label you as one) that I derive my entertainment. Not because you hold different views (which I must emphasise again that I have some sort of respect for walesa, albeit grudgingly) but rather due to your bigotry and refusal to open up your mind more than that intellectual naometre.</p>
              <p>Yep I am accountable for my words and actions once I am in hell. So do you. See you there.</p>

              <p>Oh you noticed me all this while? I am deeply honoured. I am but a nondescript peasant but the great Fantagf actually noticed me.</p>
              <p>To provoke others? Of course that's one of my aims. How am I going to spark debate if I don't provoke their thoughts? If you have a way to do so without 'provoking' others, in all sense of the word, please do tell me. I am open-minded.</p>
              <p>Now onto open-mindedness, no I don't expect everyone to do as I please. It's precisely there are idi... sorry, dumbasses (it would be an insult to idiots to label you as one) that I derive my entertainment. Not because you hold different views (which I must emphasise again that I have some sort of respect for walesa, albeit grudgingly) but rather due to your bigotry and refusal to open up your mind more than that intellectual naometre.</p>
              <p>Yep I am accountable for my words and actions once I am in hell. So do you. See you there.</p>
