              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Singapore Exchange's mainboard-listed BBR Holdings has 
              secured a <strong>S$104.2-million</strong> contract from the Housing &amp; Development 
              Board (HDB) to build <strong>seven blocks of flats </strong>in Yishun Neighbourhood 4.
              <br> <br> This is the company's first HDB contract and work is expected to begin next month. 
              <br> <br> The project will be carried out in 10 phases and is expected to be completed by 2012. 
              <br> <br> The work comprises <strong>864 homes, a Child Care Centre, a roof garden, 
              communal amenities and site works, as well as contingency works.</strong> <br> <br> With this latest win, BBR said on Monday its order book for civil 
              engineering and building projects stands at S$396 million, with projects
               predominantly spread out in Singapore and Malaysia.

              <p>Just a rough estimate ok.....out of the S$104m, S$80m is used to build the 864 homes, therefore each house will cost about S$90k plus. Each house will sell for $250k to $350k. That works out to about $155m of profit for that little estate alone.</p>
              <p>And considering that the HDB is so rich, we still need to fork out our own money for Life Upgrading Programme. They built the HDBs, they omitted the lifts back then and now that singaporeans are old, they ask us for money to co-share in building the lifts. Some of the struggling old folks have to fork out thousands. Think of those aunties who scavenge cardboards and collect plates in the foodcourt.....got money meh?</p>

              <p>But still, expecting the land to be given free? HDB needs to pay SLA leh, or so I think <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Anyway, the economic implications of selling HDBs now at $90k is very big. It will result in a major property crash, and devalue the networth of all asset rich Singaporeans. Rentals drop, housing prices drop. This will in turn lead to property companies to experience drops in profits, and in turn lead to lesser borrowings and lesser constructions, etc. And when everyone's profits drop, it will lead to retrenchments, etc. It will be a destructive cycle.</p>
              <p>"it is wrong and immoral to use these tenements which were built
                                          for the people as instruments for speculation and profit..."  -- the question is, how true is this?</p>
              <p>My take is, the prices of HDBs are so planned to ensure long term growth in property prices, and make citizens happy. And with inflation, how could we ever expect the prices to remain the same as in 1980s, when my dad bought a 5-rm flat for around $80k+? Fast forward to 2010 at $325k with lifts at every block in a more affluent Singapore. It's still a tad expensive as the prices grew greater than the inflation rate, but it still isn't too bad yet.</p>
              <p>So was it to gouge profits, or was it to put paper profits into the people's hands? Would you prefer to buy a HDB for $100k and see it devalue to $50k after 20 to 30 years?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And while people are complaining 110sqm HDBs going at $325k, there are others snatching mickey mouse units at between $600k to $900k!</p>

              <p>You are comparing HDB with Private Condominium to substantiate your point??</p>
              <p>Price you paid for private condo and only those who paid get to use within the compound.  In HDB, area covered the development is now consider the cost of the HDB buyer yet u are not exclusive to it. </p>
              <p>Even to take in land cost, take consideration of S$ 150 psf (already higher then private land sold by SLA), for a 112m² (1250ft²) divide by assuming 10 household per vertical plot = S$ 18,750.</p>
              <p>Add whatever you want, the cost will always lower then the HDB selling price at a huge percentage.</p>

              <p>You are right that they are all part of the government. And indeed, 99 yrs might not mean 99 yrs too. The same goes for condo as well. Remember the case where SLA paid only $1 for a huge slice of a condo's carpark space?</p>
              <p>If the price is readjusted to 90k, I wouldn't be sure of the resultant effects, although it is true that 1 person or 1 couple can only own 1 flat at any one time. Perhaps people would want to change house every 5 years by buying from HDB given the current affluence?</p>
              <p>HDB indeed should not be profit-oriented. Fact is, it's hard to even get a flat at recent BTOs, even at $300k and 90% being allocated to first timers. It has to boil down to the fact that there a crunch of new BTOs earlier. A poor planning by HDB planners at that time on hindsight.</p>
