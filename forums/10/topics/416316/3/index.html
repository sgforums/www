              <p>Me and my gf could pay down our BTO 5-rm HDB straight, but there's no point to. It makes more sense to take advantage of the low 2.6% interest for 30 years. It's all about how one manages one's finances, and how early one starts to do it.</p>
              <p>In fact, there are a few ways to play around the 2.6% and profit from this low interest rate.</p>

              <p>One have to consider the reasons for taking up the loan, i.e. your finances, your earning capability, your current assets, and possibly your financial strategy in life.</p>
              <p>A 30 yr loan will benefit some people greatly and accelerate them towards financial freedom. Yet it can also sink others into a debt they become a lifelong slave too.</p>
              <p>It really depends on what one wants. I have pm-ed ditzy my plans, but he didn't understand it anyway. It was taught to me by others who have already been doing it and benefiting greatly from it. I like proven paths :)</p>

              <p>Yes, that's indeed worrying. $1.4k means just $200+ into CPF OA, which is clearly insufficient to pay down most HDB's loans.</p>
              <p>I have a Malay colleague under me (with only poly cert). I guess his salary is about $2.5k/mth, and his wife's salary, I'm not sure, is less than his. He can afford a 4-rm HDB, a car, a motorbike, a maid, and still bring his family (2 children) for tours to Europe, and recently Bali. That's amazing.</p>
              <p>But I also have another colleague who told me (early this year) she cannot quit because her husband just lost her job, and the whole family depends on her income. Didn't say anything about the house though.</p>
              <p>Well, there are always some who fare better and some who fare worse. Those who fare better should try to help those who fare worse.</p>

              <p>Talking about my cousin, she got 3 kids, and all studied secondary school. Heard that the housing loans are deducted at her cpf? And every month need to top up her cpf. Something like that.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Yes, that's indeed worrying. $1.4k means just $200+ into CPF OA,
              which is clearly insufficient to pay down most HDB's loans.</p>
              <p>I have a Malay colleague under me (with only poly cert). I guess
              his salary is about $2.5k/mth, and his wife's salary, I'm not sure,
              is less than his. He can afford a 4-rm HDB, a car, a motorbike, a
              maid, and still bring his family (2 children) for tours to Europe,
              and recently Bali. That's amazing.</p>
              <p>But I also have another colleague who told me (early this year)
              she cannot quit because her husband just lost her job, and the
              whole family depends on her income. Didn't say anything about the
              house though.</p>
              <p>Well, there are always some who fare better and some who fare
              worse. Those who fare better should try to help those who fare
              worse.</p>

              <p>so once he lose his job, he will have to sell off his car at a loss as car prices are always dropping, unlike house prices.</p>

              <p>I am sure your malay collegue is paying his house, car etc
              everything by installment with high interest rates.</p>
              <p>so once he lose his job, he will have to sell off his car at a
              loss as car prices are always dropping, unlike house prices.</p>
