              <p>What is worse, I realise the flats are right next to Clementi MRT and are 34 years old! In this case, how is 50K fair compensation for 65 remaining years of lease! And how do you expect them to buy the new flats offered to them, also next to Clementi MRT?</p>

              <p>The problem is not whether they can retire or not. They cannot get bank loans. They will have to move to lousier flats, start paying interest all over again, and never retire.</p>

              price of houses should be low.if price is higher n u can pay for it n spend all yer resources on it....then that is result of greed in the market...in which case under an gov be it PAP,WP,communist....with a high cost of housing...people will be unhappy with their current state of salary needing to pay houses.
                  
                  greed by consumers who intend   on selling their homes for a profit and greed by organisation who builds these homes will kill themselves off.cant tango without 2 people.
                  under any gov ....the greed of people will ensure that these houses will remain high forever.
              
              may i remind all that these are hdb flats thats only 99 years.
