              <p><br>no, some poors are also very happy, and most are hardworking workers, see them enjoying life more than the rich, family together at ECP, just get together, happy, BBQ, enjoy the sea, togetherness and the bliss of life. As for the rich, they alienated themselves from enjoying with the poor, husbands got mistress here and there, son, a spoilt kid who knows how to spend money only and wife who keep worrying about her image and fashion more than her family. As long as you hv a decent job, have bone in you, work hard, being poor can be very happy. Why make life difficult just becos of a few papers</p>
