              <p><strong><span style="color: #800000;">Anyone keen in joining opposition after Andrew Kuan?</span></strong></p>
              <p>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Kuan</p>
              <p><strong>Kuan Yoke Loon Andrew</strong> (<a title="Simplified Chinese character" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_Chinese_character">simplified Chinese</a>: <span lang="zh-Hans">å…³çŽ‰éºŸ</span>; <a title="Pinyin" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin">pinyin</a>: <span>GuÄ�n Yùlín</span>) is the managing director of executive search firm <a title="Blue Arrow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Arrow">Blue Arrow</a>. From 2001 to 2004, Kuan was the group <a title="Chief financial officer" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_financial_officer">chief financial officer</a> of the <a class="mw-redirect" title="Jurong Town Corporation" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurong_Town_Corporation">Jurong Town Corporation</a>, one of four designated statutory boards that confer eligibility to contest in the presidential elections.</p>
              <p>Kuan applied to run as a candidate in the <a class="mw-redirect" title="Singapore presidential election, 2005" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore_presidential_election%2C_2005">Singapore presidential election, 2005</a>.
              However, his application for a Certificate of Eligibility was rejected
              as his seniority and responsibility as JTC's Group Chief Financial
              Officer were, in the opinion of the Presidential Elections Committee,
              not comparable to those required under the <a title="Constitution of Singapore" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Singapore">Constitution</a>.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Kuan announced his intention to compete in an election where the incumbent president <a class="mw-redirect" title="S R Nathan" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S_R_Nathan">S R Nathan</a> is a candidate. However his application for a certificate of
              eligibility to compete was unsuccessful resulting to Kuan alleging
              conspiratorial theories involving the government.</p>
              <p>Kuan was disqualified by the Presidential Elections Committee for
              failing to meet the criteria for running for President in Singapore.
              The Committee said Mr Kuan's seniority and responsibility as JTC's
              Group Chief Financial Officer were not comparable to those required
              under the Constitution. A presidential candidate is required to have
              experience as chairman or chief executive officer of a statutory board
              or a company with a paid-up capital of at least S$100 million.</p>
              <p>Singaporean media have reported extensively on the circumstances
              surrounding Kuan's departure from his condominium's management council
              in 2001. Kuan originally said he left amicably, but later admitted to
              being voted out with 13 council members voting against him, 2
              abstaining and 1 voting for him. Kuan attributed this to enmity aroused
              after he filed a police report against council member <a class="new" title="Chia Boon Teck (page does not exist)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chia_Boon_Teck&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1">Chia Boon Teck</a>, who is also a member of <a title="People's Action Party" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Action_Party">PAP</a>, accusing him of forging signatures. The case was closed without <a class="mw-redirect" title="Prosecution" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecution">prosecution</a>, but Chia filed a <a title="Defamation" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defamation">defamation</a> suit against Kuan in 2005 after details of the case and his identity were leaked by <em><a title="The New Paper" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Paper">The New Paper</a></em>.</p>
              <p>On 9 August 2005, <a title="Singapore" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore">Singapore</a> <a class="mw-redirect" title="Prime Minister" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister">Prime Minister</a> Mr <a title="Lee Hsien Loong" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Hsien_Loong">Lee Hsien Loong</a> called for all candidates to be open about their records, so that
              Singaporeans can make an informed judgement on them. He also encouraged
              Andrew Kuan's former employers to come forward, speak freely and tell
              Singaporeans what they know about him. <a class="external autonumber" title="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/162289/1/.html" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/162289/1/.html">[1]</a></p>
              <p>2 days later on 11 August 2005, Kuan's former employer government-linked <a title="JTC Corporation" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JTC_Corporation">JTC Corporation</a> called a news conference to provide details on the circumstances leading to Kuan's resignation in July 2004. <a class="new" title="Chong Lit Cheong (page does not exist)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chong_Lit_Cheong&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1">Chong Lit Cheong</a>, chief executive officer of <a title="JTC Corporation" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JTC_Corporation">JTC Corporation</a> said that Andrew Kuan's work at JTC was unsatisfactory since his first
              year there and was asked to resign twice on 2003 and 2004. No details
              of why his work was unsatisfactory were provided, other than to note
              that no fraud or other crime was involved and that Mr Kuan required
              "quite a fair bit of hand holding". In reply, Kuan noted that he had
              worked at JTC Corporation for 37 months, extending his contract several
              times, and he was given performance bonuses and a raise during this
              period.<a class="external autonumber" title="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/162697/1/.html" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/162697/1/.html">[2]</a>.</p>
