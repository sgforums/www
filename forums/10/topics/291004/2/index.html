Middle east materialistic ? Perhaps but they are not going around building casinos are they ? We have to recall that a huge proportion of indonesians are living in poverty and religion is one of the things that keep them going. You do something that goes against their beliefs, it won't be good. All it takes is for an opposition party to pay 100,000 people to protest and stir feelings across the nation. Anyway, just speculation..we'll see how it goes.</div>

Casino gambling is haram everybody knows that..but not many will be patient or can see the good it brings.</div>
