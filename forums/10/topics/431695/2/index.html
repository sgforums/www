              <p>Bear, this bootlicker is here treating himself a cut above the rest of us and expecting we listen to him.    He is here with the agenda to stop people from stating the facts and reality of PAP.    Such a failure is pathetic.</p>

              <p>Been saying that for so many years through different connotation, but
                   then 200,000 citizens are working overseas now. Why is this so?</p>
              <p>Many young citizens have also emigrated and more will follow after this election.</p>
              <p>Just who they kidding?</p>
              <p>Singapore
                   is a weak country simply because it depends on MNCs which have to be 
                  given tax breaks, cheap labour and employer benefits. It will just break
                   down even more in the years to come.</p>
              <p>His
                   antics have turned off many people, who trust him?</p>
              <p>One last chance, but I don't expect much, in a 
                  few years time things will get worse because PAPist government needs even 
                  more foreigners to come in to prop up the HDB resale and private condos 
                  market.</p>
              <p>Jobs also needed for foreigners, they will buy big value 
                  purchase like even old HDB resale flats because they will bug off after a
                   few years, selling it when they bug off back to their country as 
                  millionaires. They will prop up the government coffers more and better 
                  than local peasants can. Foreigners are PAPist Inc valued customers.</p>
              <p>And
                   if foreigners can't afford those flats, PAPist Inc will just introduce 
                  more higher level foreign workers like company directors etc to afford those 
                  flats.</p>
              <p>Where, where will the jobs expected for locals come from?</p>

              <p>Been saying that for so many years through different
              connotation, but then 200,000 citizens are working overseas now.
              Why is this so?</p>
              <p>Many young citizens have also emigrated and more will follow
              after this election.</p>
              <p>Just who they kidding?</p>
              <p>Singapore is a weak country simply because it depends on MNCs
              which have to be given tax breaks, cheap labour and employer
              benefits. It will just break down even more in the years to
              come.</p>
              <p>His antics have turned off many people, who trust him?</p>
              <p>One last chance, but I don't expect much, in a few years time
              things will get worse because PAPist government needs even more
              foreigners to come in to prop up the HDB resale and private condos
              market.</p>
              <p>Jobs also needed for foreigners, they will buy big value
              purchase like even old HDB resale flats because they will bug off
              after a few years, selling it when they bug off back to their
              country as millionaires. They will prop up the government coffers
              more and better than local peasants can. Foreigners are PAPist Inc
              valued customers.</p>
              <p>And if foreigners can't afford those flats, PAPist Inc will just
              introduce more higher level foreign workers like company directors
              etc to afford those flats.</p>
              <p>Where, where will the jobs expected for locals come from?</p>

              <p>the "tightened" work permit quota is bullshit.</p>
              <p>yes, it has definitely tightened, so employers simply upgrade their workers onto S passes.</p>
              <p>so at my workplace, for the same job post, i have work permit holders earning $500/mnth, singaporeans $1k/mnth, and S-pass holders earning the required $1.8k/mnth.</p>
              <p>foreigners ends up getting paid close to twice the salary singaporeans are getting. wad logic is this. and the management still wonders why they can't seem to attract and retain enough local workers.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>Sure, S pass do not hv to paid high levies, from the perspectives of an employer like me, who do not want a low cost workforce, given a chance and choice, we are sure to employ a lower paid younger workerforce, that is part of business concept. The key word here is "Given", employers like us are GIVEN a choice by the govt to employ foreigners in a 1 sg to 3 Foreigner ratio, and that 1 sg include the office and bosses like me, that is to say, I alone can get 3 foreign workers. So good.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans are really taken for a fool, in my taiwan, if govt allow foreign to come in,,..tomorrow the whole street go riot and the President would had to fled for his life.</p>
