              <p>Lim swee swee likes to talk alot, very lor sor one, but whatever he said, nothing works, even if it works, it dun benefit the general, only a few peoples, then he will show that particular people to all as tho, all of us gain from what he had done, but, what had he done so far?? Beside getting more of his members, talkatives and funny dressing, I see this minister without portfolio really did nothing without a portfolio.</p>
              <p>As a labour chief, he should be hard on employers who did not raise wages and yet exploit workers further, but end up seem like he drink, dine and play golf with them leh, saw him once at Marina rising funds, have to beg from employers somemore. what the hell.</p>
