            <div class='col-md body'>... take for example a real life case, wherein an individual who has only recently started doing his own small business and who makes an average of around $2000 per month. This amount goes to caring for his aged parents, as well as household bills &amp; daily meals. One day, after submitting his Income Tax Returns online, he was notified by CPF that he owes more than S$3,000.00 to his Medisave account. After much arguments and talks with his MP, he is still made to pay a monthly amount of $50 for 58 instalments...<br><br>... then he was recently sent a notice that he received S$300.00 as WIS, but, this entire amount was immediately entered into his Medisave, but which does not off-set the S$3,000.00 plus that he was alleged to have owed...<br><br>... tell me, who the hell would want this sort of financial burden???<br><br>... Supplement? I think it is more a bloody BURDEN!</div>
