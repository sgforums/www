Kindness movement, he talked about this, yucks!!!   His kindness is questionable and he talks about kindness!  He is not fit to launch the kindness movement.

He wanna talks about kindness he be kind to his own people in Singapore lah!!!  Phui, lee hsien loong!!!  Go look himself in the mirror lah before talking about kindness!!!
