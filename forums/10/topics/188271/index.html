            <div class='col-md body'>Tell me if you guys agree with me.<br><br>There's this story from OCBC a long time ago about a reknown Singapore tyre manufacturer. Accordingly, the company was started by his father and he had a great relationship with banks and partners. Everyone respect and trust his father.<br><br>When his father passed away suddenly due to a stroke, he had to return from UK to assume the company. The bank suddenly decides to pull out all financing and the partners refuse to trade with him because he is unknown and they don't trust him. He nearly went bankrupt when the bank force him to repay all the mortgages. Lucky for him, OCBC saved him.<br><br>Relating this story to Singapore. Remember LKY says during the TV forum that only certain things can be done by him "..the PM knows it, the SM knows it.."<br><br>If he had step of politics after handing the baton to GCT, he could have given the new government leadership enough time to prove it's worth and that would happen smoothly because foreign investors, countries etc.. knows that he is still around.<br><br>Imagine today LKY gets a stroke and passes on (not impossible considering his age and that all his peers have all pass on also), what will to Singapore?<br><br>I think he is doing a disservice to all Singaporeans by staying on. How long can he live? Everybody dies. How long can be 'protect' Singapore? I hope he is not thinking of becoming the next Qin Emperor.<br><br>I have great respect for the old man and I agree 100% that Singapore is what it is today mainly because of him. Hell! I'm almost willingly to accept some cronism and corruption to have this stability...<br><br>But, every year he holds on to power, my respect for him lessen.<br><br>If I were on the set with the young journalist, I would have answered "Yes, MM Lee, I would like to see you retire from politics completely. For the sake of the nation, the government and the security of our future generations"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think what MM Lee contributes most to Singapore now is his immense prestige, the aura of authority and respect which accompanies him, which gives Singapore an edge in its relations with other countries. Such intangibles take very long to build up. You can see SM Goh trying to do it, and he's not there yet. It'll take the present PM Lee even longer. So, in my humble opinion MM Lee still has something to contribute to the country, and I don't see why he should step down as yet.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>oh please grow up.. while we can admit that he has been doing a good job in bringing us out of that backwater society in the 1960s..we cannot simply ignore the fact that he is old and probably going to pass away in a few years if not a decade's time.. once he is gone, what will happen then?<br><br>Look at the vey nature of PAP politics.. look at Lee Hsien Loong, he is in his 50s would you think he would have been the postition he is now without his father's influence? look to his peers and party, there are people who are as qualified as he is, or even better? so what he got a wrangler in his Uni days.. there are others who are better than him when he stepped into politics..eg. DR Tony Tan while others had to climb up from party ranks, he came into the PAP and straight away became 2nd minister. if this isnt nepotism then i dunno wad is...<br><br>furthermore, the security of the nation is still unknown. remember while the dear PAP government claims we have emergency reserves that can help tide off crisises for a while.. how much do we have? is the money there? to be frank..no one knows.. for the PAP holds the key...even if the president holds the key so what...he cannot open it up for audit...we would not even know if the funds are there... in this case we can only trust that the PAP government is what they claimed to be back then when MM first set it up.. a clean and fair government they said... PROVE IT I SAY!! let us have an independant commission to investigate the NKF saga... open up the national coffers for an independant audit.... then we will know if the GOVT is wad it claims to be..<br><br>given all these i would say that it is time for MM to let go and let the younger generation take charge...stop being a meddling influence in the government..he should realise his mortality by now...and he has a good enough legacy to leave on.... all he is doing now is juz being a extra in the government..and tax payer's money is used to pay for the position he is having...i really wonder if he passes on...would there be a MM position? i doubt so.. in this case.. i would say..MM pls retire full frm politics...ur proteges are doin well enough without you.. think its time you let go and enjoy ur golden years</div>

These are the real big pictures and big issues - will the old policies still work for another 20 years and will the population be motivated once again because they could participate and do what they are best at without all the character challenging and threats as we are seeing every day.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>That's one of the reasons why the culture of rental is discouraged.Behind the facade of "universal home ownership", is the reality of high-value consumption that will secure the people to a 20-30 year debt to the CPF and the stat boards.<br><br>If more people rent their houses, this link will be broken, and citizens would be financially much more mobile.It is not in their interests to see citizens who are free of any property debt other than rolling rental spending month on month.<br><br>Entreprenuership is utter bollocks, and I agree with you totally.The GLCs are getting involved in all segments, under the pretense of offering lower prices at economies of scale.<br><br>Rent a flat, stop supporting NTUC.Spend only when needed, and don't live beyond your means, do not get sucked into the debt trap.</div>

This ocean parable probably revealed the true insight of his way of thinking and governing the country.<br><br>He perceives people as fishes in the ocean and deal with them according to the degree of threats. If anyone simply talks and give ideas, no matter how true or how good is an idea it is of no value to him. Unless the person concerned is a bigger fish, he would not listen to him. So this ocean threat parable indeed is the very realistic way of looking at how he runs the country.<br><br>People talk often about good ideas and how to solve certain problems and suggested to him many time to be more proactive and caring. Will he care about such problems? Look at how he replied to people's complaint about high costs of living being created by his high-wage push over the 1970s-1990s. But to him : government is a big fish and people and oppositions are all small fishes so why should he listen to them?<br><br>So by the fish parable, he would not change his past tax and recover policies allowing HDB to double-charge on land or LTA to triple-charge on vehicles after the COE was supposed to replace the past system of charging for vehicles.<br><br>So would he give way to opposition politicians and would carry on with defamation suits to check them for any fishy stories so it is a matter of who is a bigger or smaller fish in the ocean.<br><br>So big fishes like Port Palepas and USA and China souzhou local authority will make him change not all the smaller fishes swimming in the ocean. If the smaller fishes talk about high utility and high land charges and these are the problems alright but the fishes are too small and would be ignored.<br><br>So what if the CEOs of NKF, PSA or Comfort Taxi, essentially superannuated ex-government officers are overpaid he would not bother with the small fishes. He must see some big fishes in the ocean e.g. Maersk Lines or port palepas or Air Asia then he would make some changes to his old policies.<br><br>Problem is : people are not yet politically matured or sophistication to become big fishes in the ocean so there will be no change to old policies.<br><br>If Singaporeans understand the importance of their votes and not give in on all the GRCs and gerrymandering they would not have to suffer the dropping wages and rising costs while the government is denying their complaints.<br><br>It is the real ocean we are living in and people must understand enough about the fish parable before there can be a change.</div>
