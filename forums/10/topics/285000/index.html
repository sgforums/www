            <div class='col-md body'>Does SDP expect Ms Liew to project foreign diplomats in Singapore deplorably ? Whats wrong with Ms Liew describing the situation as such ? That the diplomat refused to entertain him. Ms Liew got her facts wrong, allegedly it was Mr Ambalam who read out the letter rather than Chee. SDP projects that Ms Liew was trying run down Chee. However, if that act does not put Chee or SDP in a good light, then why let Ambalam do it in the first place? What does that mean ? "Hey it was Ambalam ok, not Chee! Don't try to run me down, run him down ?" Should it be reported that the diplomat doesn't want to take a picture with SDP?</div>

Our rules against that are as strict as any other financial centre - London, Hong Kong, New York," Lee told CNN.<br><br>Singapore's three banks -- all of which operate offices in Myanmar -- have declined comment, citing banking secrecy laws.<br><br>"DIRTY LIST"<br><br>Analysts say that without Singapore's expertise in areas such as airline, airport, and hotel management, Myanmar would be a much less comfortable place for its ruling elite.<br><br>Myanmar's top international airline, Myanmar Airways International, is a joint venture between the Myanmar government and Region Air, a company owned by hotel and property tycoon Ong Beng Seng, one of Singapore's best-connected businessmen.<br><br>Activist group Burma Campaign UK lists 10 Singapore firms on its "Dirty List" of companies for their involvement in Myanmar, including banks DBS, UOB and OCBC, and conglomerate Keppel Corp.<br><br>Yangon's The Strand Hotel, Myanmar's top hotel and sister to Singapore's Raffles Hotel, is jointly owned by Myanmar's tourism authorities and Singapore-based General Hotel Management.<br><br>The Singapore bourse is also host to the only Myanmar listed firm -- Yoma, a real estate firm with close junta links.<br><br>Myanmar, too, has come to the aid of a friend in need.

Myanmar prime minister General Soe Win, 59, was treated for cancer at Singapore's General Hospital for months before he reportedly died on Oct. 2.

"I think a strong stand by Singapore will be helpful. But a strong stand has to be a quiet stand.
