A price too high to pay especially when SIA learnt a huge lesson.<br><br>You are living in a dream world of Singapore . The Singaporean government does not care about experienced workers - it's just the money to them - a million dollar per year salary supported, as long as they get their pay - they don't give a damn.<br><br>We are not talking about incompetence here - the government continues to generate propaganda about lowering expectations of jobs and people not wanting to do them. Don't talk to me - I know people who ran off elsewhere  with invitations because they know what is coming to them if they stay in Singapore after they hit a certain retrenchable age.<br><br>As far as I see it, Singapore will leak talent. With zero loyalty from your worker and plenty of your so called cheaper foreign talents  , don't expect a high quality of work done - expect the standard of work to be just acceptable and <strong> in the eyes of the Australian public who values Qantas proudly - NOT acceptable </strong> .<br><br>Yesterday I felt so ashamed from that damning news report, not only for Singapore but my countrymen . Singapore is known for being high tech and now its workmanship will be known as substandard. Remember how people used to make fun of <span style="font-style: italic;"> made in taiwan </span>....I can see how people will start to make fun of <span style="font-style: italic;"> made in Singapore </span>.<br><br>Other countries do it for the quality which in turns generate the money and help the national economy . I remember how SIA  retrench their workers  and then find out that they have to contract them back. What a big joke.</div>

If it is more economical to pay higher wages for experienced workers, they will keep them. On the other hand, what's the use of an old IT specialist who may be an expert in COBOL and FORTRAN when the industry no longer has demand of these programming languages?<br><br>Experience does not always matter in all industries. At the end of the day, what matters is that you have the worker who is able to deliver the most productivity at the lowest cost. Quality certainly matters, but so does cost.

They have to upgrade all the time.<br><br>She is working for an american company - head hunted by them . If she worked in Singapore like her other friends - she will be retrenched by now because she costs "too much".<br><br>Don't talk to me about most productivity at the lowest cost. Some of the old SIA engineers and technicians got headhunted by Emirates.<br><br>The Singaporean government wishes to encourage intake of cheaper foreign talents to push wages down for locals. Fine , it is their perogative . If you want to treat local workers like dirt , don't complain about them leaving the country and most of all don't ask them to come back to work for the country .<br><br>My parents got the call requesting me to come back to Singapore  - " how about asking her to come back and serve the country" ....after how one of their hospitals treated me like dirt . I was thinking of fellow Singaporeans in the SARs period. Then I realised that if I died serving Singapore, the government in Singapore will not even take care of my parents.  FU<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>cK that!  One miserable medal for a life lost?  What even happened to that fund they set up?<br><br>At least in Australia, if I died in the course of duty helping Australia , my parents will be surviving quite comfortably on all the pay outs they get from my death including from the government if they were dependent on me.<br><br>Oh and what the WHO consultant said about the communicable disease system in Singapore was really sad during SARS: Great technology but no one used it practically. That is what we get for paying for a million per annum ministers and foreign talents. Great technology with no practical use .</div>
