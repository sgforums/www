              Of migration and the Singaporean diaspora
              By Kelvin Teo â‹… April 14, 2009
              
              SINGAPORE - A survey conducted by the Singapore Polytechnic revealed one sobering statistic - more than 50% of youths aged between 15 and 29 years old want to migrate overseas if given the chance. Another ironic piece of statistic is that despite going through National Education in their schools, 37% admitted that they are not patriotic. Another interesting number is that despite 60% of the youth not being interested in local politics, half of them want to see more opposition in parliament.
              
              And this migration statistic is worrying our leaders. Senior Minister (SM) Goh Chok Tong admitted in a meeting with Iranian leaders that Singapore is leaking talents, especially the top notch ones. And this leakage of talents extended to the civil service as well. This was ironic considering the fact that SM Goh fired a rhetorical salvo in challenging Singaporeansâ€™ resolve to stay to fight for the nation instead of taking flight at the first sign of trouble, ending with a famous question - â€œare you a quitter or a stayer?â€�
              
              Admittedly, this rhetorical question triggered an emotional response. The quitter reference didnâ€™t go down well amongst a number of Singaporeans, especially those who have migrated or have already considered migrating. A variety of reasons were offered to explain their unhappiness. Be that as it may, sometimes it would be interesting to dwell on the causes behind Singaporeansâ€™ decision to migrate rather than the furore over the stayer-quitter remarks.
              
              Mr Seah Chiang Nee, in an article published in the Sunday Star, attributed one of the causes to a self-centred generation with no personal bond to the nation. Half of it is figured by Mr Seah. The other half is possibly attributable to the fact that Singaporeans are rarely offered a part to play in the running of the nation. Singapore has always been run in a top-down approach, the catch phrase for that is a paternalistic form of governance. Basically, Singaporeans have not much say in the running of Singapore.
              
              Thus, there is a need to engage Singaporeans in the sense that they should be given a say in the direction that Singapore should take, and in doing so, shoulder more responsibilities. When citizens are given more responsibilities in running the country within a decentralized system of governance, the national bond naturally comes. In fact, this engagement should be extended to Singaporeans who have left our shores.
              
              The case study of India has taught us that despite the brain drain, the Indian diaspora worldwide has benefitted India in terms of cash injection and technology transfer. It would be tragic if the Singapore government fails to engage the Singaporean diaspora worldwide.
              
              One solution to the brain drain in SM Gohâ€™s words is â€œto turn to talented people from other countries, get them to work here and eventually turn them into Singaporeansâ€�. That in itself is a gamble because not all foreigners would end up taking up Singapore citizenship.
              
              However, the pertinent question is - has the government completely forgotten the former sons of Singapore? It appeared that SM Gohâ€™s reference to them as â€œquittersâ€� will only further alienate them. One really wonders if it has ever occurred to the Singapore government that the Singapore diaspora worldwide can still be considered a valuable resource in terms of knowledge and finance. Even SM Goh conceded that these talented former Singaporeans are â€œharvested straightaway by top companies and institutionsâ€�. Thus, wouldnâ€™t a friendly engagement allow Singapore to tap on their expertise or benefit from their cash injection? Alienation would only burn the bridges for eternity.
              
              When there was talk about building up a knowledge-based economy, the government rolled out the red carpet in welcoming foreign luminaries. Perhaps, the same red carpet should also be rolled out to welcome overseas-based Singaporean or ex-Singaporean experts too.
              
              Prime Minister Mr Lee Hsien Loong envisioned Singapore as â€œan inclusive society where no one will be left behindâ€�. It is a beautiful vision worth attaining. However, former Singaporeans should also be included in this vision. Even as they have left our shores, they are still a part of us nonetheless. Instead of burning bridges, more bridges should be built to reach out to such Singaporeans.

              <p>The problem is systemic.</p>
              <p>When you impose an alien language on the local population and supress local culture and promote alien culture, the local identity, the roots, the bond is weakened, thus it is easier for someone to throw away his roots and migrate to foreign country, since the alien language was there from the beginning to undermine the local culture and identity.</p>
              <p>All thanks to the dog's political agenda.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Fang Chuang Pi is very wise to point it out:</p>

              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>SINGAPORE is a "freak", because it is lacking in terms of geopolitics, economics, size, population and culture,</strong></span> said former communist leader Fang Chuang Pi, dubbed the "Plen" by Mr Lee Kuan Yew.<br><br>He added that, in his assessment, the country had <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>"narrow room for manoeuvre in various areas and will run into difficulties in future".</strong></span><br><br>He gave this assessment of <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Singapore as an unnatural country, a freak of history,</strong></span> in an interview with Malaysia's Chinese-language newspaper, Nanyang Siang Pau, in which he disclosed that he had discussed the Republic's prospects with the Senior Minister when they met in Beijing in August 1995.<br><br>He told Mr Lee: "I said that Singapore was a 'freak', but a 'freak' was often a genius, and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>most geniuses died young. For in terms of geopolitics, economics, size and population, Singapore is congenitally deficient."</strong></span><br><br>The two men also discussed the issue of culture, he added.<br><br>"I said that <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>using a certain language to create a culture, the culture created can at best be a commercial culture, or technology culture, or we may call it pasar culture. It has no roots, and identifies itself with a certain material interest. It is the product of expediency.</strong></span></span><br><br>"It is like duckweed, floating at the harbour. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>When it absorbs fertilisers, it will flourish very quickly.</strong></span> But <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">once it rains and floods set in, it will perish</span></span></strong>," he said in an interview conducted in a restaurant in Haadyai, near the Thai-Malaysian border...</p>

                  Of course, there has not been any society that has lasted forever,
                  but some will last for hundreds of years. Singapore will never be
                  able to.</p>
              <p>glanced up a bit and i have this to say: Present day Singapore
                  has no 'local' culture. Colonialism has killed whatever there was
                  in Singapore before they came. almost everything about present day
                  Singapore is based on colonialism.</p>
              <p>and no, i don't support the PAP. in fact, i dont give a hoot
                  about Singapore politics.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Way i see it, Singapore is a product of a particular age in history much like the ancient cities that were built  along the Silk Road.</p>
              <p>It just doesn't have the conditions neccessary to have an enduring civilization. I would think the reasons are more economical and geological, rather than some vague notions of culture or politics.</p>

              yet and that is the reason for what you claim. If it is that good,
              then the system would not have died out and be replaced by
              Democracy!!!</span></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Democracy can only work well
              when you have honorable people in power, though, but checks and
              balances can if not eliminate, then mitigate the effects when
              dishonorable people come into power.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">The baba siao, cursed despot,
              removed that checks and balances while Silliporeans looked
              on.</span></p>

              <p>Democracy has hardly seen its test yet. I'm just not as eager as you to use it as an excuse to lash out at others who disagrees with you to swell up your epeen.</p>
              <p>Honestly i do agree with you Democracy only works with honourable people in charge, but you seemed to have a very naive concept of what "honour" means.</p>
