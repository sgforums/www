              <p>The Tat Lee Bank Group (TLB Group) has reported an after-tax loss of $38.7m for 1997. The MAS is satisfied that the TLB Group is financially sound. The Group is solvent and fully capable of meeting all the obligations of TLB and its finance company subsidiary. Depositors need not worry about the safety of their deposits.<br><br>The TLB Group's loss of $38.7 million in 1997 arises from the substantial provisions of S$150 million that it is setting aside for its regional loans. The loss equals 2.4% of its shareholders' funds. The TLB Group has shareholders' funds of $1.6 billion, equal to 19% of its risk-weighted assets as at 31 Dec 97. This is well in excess of the 12% capital requirement for Singapore banks, which is itself higher than international norms1.<br><br>The MAS is confident that the impending merger of the TLB Group and Keppel Bank (KB) Group will create a more resilient and competitive bank. The KB Group is a subsidiary of Keppel Corporation, the largest shareholder of which is the Government-owned Temasek Holdings (Private) Limited. The combined bank will be able to consolidate and streamline the operations of the two banks. It will be well positioned to build a diversified portfolio and achieve healthy growth.<br><br>MONETARY AUTHORITY OF SINGAPORE<br>4TH MAR 1998</p>

              <p>Only
                  way for business to thrive is to minimise regulations. No labour laws,
                  no currency laws, no limit on foreign shareholdings etc.<br> But too much emphasis on capitalism will bring great volatility, and this is not good for the community.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>During the time of the british, Singapore was already an established trading centre.</strong></span></span><br> The only university in Malaya was in Singapore(mahathir studied there).
                  All trains from Malaya stops in Singapore. Singapore has the only
                  international port and airport to serve Malaya. All rubber/tin whatever
                  that come from malaya, was exported from Singapore, and some from
                  penang. Singapore already had refineries and was one of the busiest
                  port during the british.<br> <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Singapore was not a swamp PAP and LKY wants all of you to believe.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p>After the british left, Singapore traders made money by smuggling,
                  due to punitive luxury import taxes imposed by the then independent
                  Indonesia and malaysia.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>During the time of suharto, unscrupulous businessmen from Indonesia
                  smuggled subsidised refined oil and sold to bunker companies in
                  Singapore. </strong></span></span>Those money never came back, but Indonesian taxpayers
                  suffered as they had to pay the difference between the selling price
                  and the subsidise prices. The subsidised refined oil actually helped
                  the rich as they are the owners of cars and transport, and eleviated
                  the poor, who could have got that money instead in the form of
                  educational aid or grant for communal upgrade.<br> <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>In fact, money from much of Indonesia resources never came back but are
                  parked in Singapore. </strong></span></span>So Singapore do not require any resource to be
                  rich. Those resources include timber, coal and possibly sand which were
                  underdeclared when exported.<br> <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Now you know why Singapore evolved into a financial centre.</strong></span></span> presently,
                  it is trying to attract unscrupulous businessmen from china who are
                  uneasy about parking their money in hong kong, which is in chinese
                  territory.<br> The idea of a casino is more about money laundering than gambling tourist.</p>
              <p>LKY hates dissent. hence anyone who challenge him will be put away under ISA or made bankrupt, if they decide to stay put.<br> Paying ministers and civil servants good money is how he corrupts
                  Singapore. Because they are so highly paid, nobody will dare question
                  LKY’s policies.<br> Cronyism exist in Singapore. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Tat Lee bank belonged to his brother. It
                  was rescued after 1997 financial crisis by merging with Keppel finance
                  and after that both were rescued by merging with DBS. LKY’s son is
                  current PM. </strong></span></span>His other son was the CEO of singtel, until he was
                  discovered to be having an affair with a women in australia. He
                  resigned, and is now living in australia, I suppose with the new girl.
                  Funny enough, the women is from the company singtel bought at a high
                  value called OPTUS.</p>
              <p>If you regard LKY highly, then think about the fate of the current
                  PM’s first wife, who was a doctor from Malaysia, who committed suicide,
                  maybe due to the fact that their two children were albino and the other
                  autistic. But I think it was more due to disappointed father-in-law who
                  could not obtain a perfect grandchild who pressured her into the
                  ultimate oblivion.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>LKy’s father, I believe was from semarang. During WWII LKY was a
                  translator for the japanese, whilst his chinese counterparts were
                  fighting against them. </strong></span></span>The most successful anti japanese army was the
                  MPAJA (Malaya peoples anti japanese army) which were mostly ethnic
                  chinese. They were fighting the japanese because Japan conquered China
                  and the fighting in Malaya was an extension of that war. After the war,
                  the MPAJA transformed and became the CPM (communist party of malay)
                  following the footsteps of China’s Mao Ze Dong. Anyone with any
                  socialist inclination was jailed by LKY under ISA (intenal security
                  act-no need for legal proceedings). The biggest challenge to PAP in the
                  first election, incidentally was Barisan sosialis. The leader of that
                  party have just been freed after many decades in confinement.</p>
              <p>Temasek is now controlled by PM’s second wife, LKY’s daughter in
                  law. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>In fact the whole of Singapore are controlled by one family.
                  Nobody dissent because they are paid to be silent.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p>The two child policy of LKY rebounded on him. Singapore’s
                  populations is now shrinking. In order to maintain the standard of
                  living, the country now welcomes any rich people from anywhere to
                  reside as PR or citizen. That of course includes many Indonesians.
                  These rich indivuduals will bring countless millions into the island
                  state, i.e. making money without having to work is Singapore’s policy
                  from the start.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>LKy’s wife has a legal frim which controls the S&amp;P agreement to
                  all HDB flats. One of her junior partners was her ex-daugther-in-law
                  (not sure divorce already or not) who married her second son, who was
                  caught with an affair with a buxom australian from Optus.</strong></span></span> (Now we know
                  why singtel paid so much for that australian telco).</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>In the 70’s most Singaporean can speak a sprinkling of bahasa
                  melayu. </strong></span></span>Presently, the aid workers they sent to aceh in the tsunami
                  aftermath couldn’t communicate with their Indonesian counterpart.</p>
              <p>Singapore is rich only because the natives of Nusanatara do not
                  understand business philosophy and how the world revolves. As an
                  example, people of timor who welcomed the australian army, only to be
                  told that the gas under the timor sea now belongs to australia.</p>
              <p>The natives of nusantara are so comfortable with their lives in the
                  islands that they could not be bothered to sail just a little bit more
                  and establish in australia. Because of this attitude towards life,
                  Singapore has no competitor in the vicinity.</p>
