(in term of world regions and lenght of time)<br><br>same to columbian rebels vs. muslim terrorists ..<br><br>same to basque rebel bombing vs. muslim terrorist attacks ..<br><br>just by comparing anyone of the non-muslim terrorists you have mentioned vs. muslim terrorists, you can see my rational ..<br><br>i am not biased against anyone, just that this is a very common impression of any non-muslim but not asked or told since it is sensitive.<br><br></div>
