I feel most sucidal bombers are those who are very poor people living in the rural area. How much would u go for the survival of your family? for the goodness of them. To be able to live in a proper environment and have the food always ready on the table. Yep I think the root of evil is still 'MONEY' ! Anyone would have done that if being approached with a huge sum of money and that sum can last their poor family for the entire life. Under that circumstances, that kind of mentality, moral value doesn't matter anymore that's why not many people will think twice on accepting the mission. Imagine right now, as I am typing this and you are reading this, how many poor people there actually exist in this world, and how many is already resorting to this means to provide for their families? (Signing a contract with the terrorist militants?) It is because they don't get much help from the government, often feeling neglected and outcasted where as u know thier government would probably 'help' the rich more then the poor. So not neccesarily religious do come into play that much as a mean of allowing your loved ones to live a more comfortably live. Thought I empathize on their situation but I still very stongly condemm their act. This is a very cowardic act, how I wish everyone would play fair on the battle-field but that is never going to happen because that is the nature of all human beings.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>
