              deny the truth even as they have denied it, so that you should be like
              them. Do not, therefore, take them for your allies until they forsake
              the domain of evil
              Asad(4,108)

              and slay them wherever you may find them. And do not take any of them

              <p>I would like to stress here on the identity of "they". Most people translate "they" as non-muslims so muslims have to kill non-muslims. But the thing is, the "they" here are anti-muslims. People who get out of their way to distory Islam and Muslims. And this verse specifictly say that only fight back if the anti-muslims tries to kill muslims. And kill the "anti-muslims who tries to kill you" where ever you find them. Usually in a war scenerio.</p>

              <p>Suran 2:216<br>All SAF and NS men know, if Singapore kena war, touch wood, all soldiers have to fight, weather they like it or not, or else Singapore dies.</p>
              <p>So, even if fighting is a bad thing, still have to fight to protect the ones you love.</p>
