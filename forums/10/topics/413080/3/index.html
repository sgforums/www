              <p>i beg to differ, thinking too much is good for mental health, otherwise most with empty brain will go insane sooner or later, and if you think you dun want to offend people, just keep your eagle beak shut.</p>

              <p><br>why?? my goodness, you dunno why meh!!, i thot in here every day peoples are talking about it, high property prices, high cost of living, high inflation, lack of press freedom, high govt paid, millions of foreigners, lower wage against a high cost of expenses, yet with stress in work both in meeting demand and competiting with Foreign talents, leading to low wages, all end up with heavy loans and still have to bear to listen and look at those rich govts style of living and talking shit. and so on.....siao liao lor.</p>
              <p>My friend, it is not easy to raise from a kampung to a world class developed country in just 40-50 years, many within will go mad, they just dun realise it, Singaporean are a bunch anguish people, you see on the street, no smiling at all, old, sian sian and everyday like struggling to them, and even if they do smile, it is basically a short one or those who want to sell something to you, and peoples here get angry very fast, and that is no good for both mental and physical health.</p>
