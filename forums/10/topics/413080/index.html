              SINGAPORE: Singapore's GDP expanded by 10.3 percent on a year-on-year basis in the third quarter of 2010.
              
              On a quarter-on-quarter basis the economy contracted by 19.8 percent, a reversal from the growth of 27.3 percent in the previous quarter.
              
              The advance estimates released by the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) on Thursday said that the Singapore economy remains on track to achieve the overall growth forecast of 13 to 15 percent for the whole of 2010.
              
              Commenting on the sectoral decline on a quarter-on-quarter basis, MTI said the manufacturing sector contracted by 57 percent in the third quarter, after expanding by 67 percent in the preceding quarter. 
              
              It attributed the decline largely to the biomedical manufacturing cluster, where some pharmaceutical companies switched to producing a different value-mix of active pharmaceutical ingredients. MTI also cited some plant maintenance shutdowns during the quarter. 
              
              The construction sector also contracted by 12 percent, compared to an expansion of 29 percent in the preceding quarter. MTI said this was mainly due to the completion of key commercial and industrial building projects earlier in the year. 
              
              The services-producing industries registered a modest sequential growth of 1.6 percent, following a 13 percent expansion in the previous quarter.
              
              MTI said growth for the rest of the year will be underpinned by a number of industry-specific factors. 
              
              It said continued growth in global demand for electronic products will lend some support to the electronics and precision engineering clusters. 
              
              It added that increasing visitor arrivals, drawn by the Integrated Resorts, will continue to bolster tourism in Singapore. 
              
              MTI will release the preliminary GDP estimates for the third quarter of 2010, including performance by sectors, sources of growth, inflation, employment and productivity, in November 2010.

              <p>If comparing year on year - expansion (which they report first).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If comparing quarter on quarter - contraction (which they report second)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Yes, if you are looking at recent performance, it is a contraction.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Funny how the sg economy is so volatile these days - swinging up and down in double digits every quarter.</p>

              <p>Singapore's economy shrank by a jaw-dropping 19.8% quarter-on-quarter during Q3, according to data released by the Monetary Authority of Singapore yesterday.</p>
              <p>While GDP was still 10.3% higher than the same quarter last year, the quarter-to-quarter contraction was the worst ever, and is a reminder of how volatile Singapore's economic output can be:</p>
              <p><a href="http://sbr.com.sg/economy/news/singapore-economy-just-hit-brick-wall-worst-quarterly-drop-1975"><span style="color: #1d637d;">Singapore Business Review (SBR):</span></a></p>
              <p style="padding-left: 30px;">According to DBS Bank, this is a record sequential contraction and one that is worse than the supposedly “free-fall” in GDP experienced in the recent US financial crisis, the slump during the dot.com bust as well as the doldrums during the Asia financial crisis.</p>
              <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><img src="http://static.businessinsider.com/image/4cb7e4d77f8b9a392fa10100/chart.png" border="0" alt="Chart"></p>
              <p>The drop was caused primarily by a sharp reduction in output from the pharmaceutical industry:</p>
              <p style="padding-left: 30px;">Indeed, noted DBS, growth wouldn’t have fallen by more dramatic fashion than this considering that we had a record expansion not too long ago in the first quarter. Sharp pullbacks in production from the volatile pharmaceutical segment have brought down overall industrial production in recent months. "And the exceptionally high comparison base in 1H10 further amplifies the drop. That is, it’s drug effects plus technical payback!"</p>
              <p>Yet it's all just part of what makes Singapore's economy such a fun ride, and the island is far from sinking.</p>
              <p>The government isn't concerned, they even just <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/39663938"><span style="color: #1d637d;">tightened monetary policy yesterday</span></a> in a bid to cool the economy and reign-in inflation, which is expected to hit <a href="http://sbr.com.sg/economy/news/singapore-inflation-rise-4-mas"><span style="color: #1d637d;">2-3% next year</span></a>. DBS also still expects Singapore to achieve full-year GDP growth of 15% and has explained that pharma contractions such as the one just experienced don't normally last more than a quarter.</p>
              <p>Still, by the looks of the <a href="http://sbr.com.sg/economy/news/singapore-economy-just-hit-brick-wall-worst-quarterly-drop-1975"><span style="color: #1d637d;">SBR chart</span></a> above, this was still a shockingly volatile quarter, even for Singapore.</p>

              <h1>Shock 19.8% slump in Singapore Q3 GDP may foretell double dip recession</h1>
              <p><span class="date">Posted on 14 October 2010 with <a title="Comment on Shock 19.8% slump in Singapore Q3 GDP may foretell double dip recession" href="http://www.arabianmoney.net/global-economics/2010/10/14/shock-19-8-slump-in-singapore-q3-gdp-indicates-double-dip-recession/#comments">1 comment</a> from readers</span></p>
              <div class="left-col"><img class="attachment-post-thumbnail wp-post-image" title="singapore3" src="http://www.arabianmoney.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/singapore3.jpg" alt="" width="243" height="175"></div>
              <p>The surprise 19.8 per cent slump in GDP from Singapore in the 
              third quarter indicates a slowdown in global trade that could be the 
              precursor to a double dip recession.</p>
              <p>Singapore is the Asian nation most exposed to swings in the global 
              trade cycle as some 50 per cent of GDP is from exports. The 19.8 per 
              cent contraction in Q3 GDP was worse than the 15.7 per cent fall 
              forecast by 19 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.</p>
              <p>This kind of downswing in trade is what we saw in Q3 of 2008 before 
              the global financial crisis. But the slowdown in Q3 is all relative. 
              Singapore is still on schedule for 13 to 15 per cent GDP growth in 2010,
               making the city state the world’s fastest growing economy.</p>
              <p>Of course, that is only possible because of the depth of the 
              recession. Singapore’s GDP fell 12.5 per cent in Q4 2008 and 11.5 per 
              cent in Q1 2009. The big slump has been followed by a big rebound.</p>
              <p><strong>Like the UAE?</strong></p>
              <p>Indeed, some economists note that an accurate interpretation of UAE 
              economic data might show similar wild swings because of the UAE’s 
              exposure to global trade flows and the ups and downs of the oil market. 
              But that is not how the IMF sees things in the UAE (<a href="http://www.arabianmoney.net/gcc-economics/2010/10/07/imf-forecast-too-low-and-fails-to-show-true-uae-recovery/">click here</a>).</p>
              <p>However, the Q3 data is cause for concern. As Alvin Liew, an 
              economist at Standard Chartered in Singapore told Bloomberg today: 
              ‘Singapore is typically a bellwether for the region’s export outlook and
               it is the first to show cracks as global growth slows, and threats to 
              Asian growth include the fading impact of stimulus packages, stubbornly 
              high unemployment rates and austerity measures that are likely to crimp 
              consumption in the West’.</p>
              <p>How can the East continue to grow so strongly if the West is stuck in
               near recession conditions and a further deterioration in demand likely?
               But hey don’t tell that to global stock markets!</p>
