              Shocking Worst-Ever GDP Contraction</span></a></h3>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/singapore-suffers-shock-worst-ever-gdp-contraction-2010-10">http://www.businessinsider.com/singapore-suffers-shock-worst-ever-gdp-contraction-2010-10</a></p>
              <div class="small">
              <div>
              <p>Singapore's economy shrank by a jaw-dropping 19.8%
              quarter-on-quarter during Q3, according to data released by the
              Monetary Authority of Singapore yesterday.</p>
              <p>While GDP was still 10.3% higher than the same quarter last
              year, the quarter-to-quarter contraction was the worst ever, and is
              a reminder of how volatile Singapore's economic output can be:</p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://sbr.com.sg/economy/news/singapore-economy-just-hit-brick-wall-worst-quarterly-drop-1975"><span style="color: #1d637d;">Singapore Business
              Review (SBR):</span></a></p>
              <p style="padding-left: 30px;">According to DBS Bank, this is a
              record sequential contraction and one that is worse than the
              supposedly “free-fall” in GDP experienced in the recent US
              financial crisis, the slump during the dot.com bust as well as the
              doldrums during the Asia financial crisis.</p>
              <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><img src="http://static.businessinsider.com/image/4cb7e4d77f8b9a392fa10100/chart.png" alt="Chart"></p>
              <p>The drop was caused primarily by a sharp reduction in output
              from the pharmaceutical industry:</p>
              <p style="padding-left: 30px;">Indeed, noted DBS, growth wouldn’t
              have fallen by more dramatic fashion than this considering that we
              had a record expansion not too long ago in the first quarter. Sharp
              pullbacks in production from the volatile pharmaceutical segment
              have brought down overall industrial production in recent months.
              "And the exceptionally high comparison base in 1H10 further
              amplifies the drop. That is, it’s drug effects plus technical
              payback!"</p>
              <p>Yet it's all just part of what makes Singapore's economy such a
              fun ride, and the island is far from sinking.</p>
              <p>The government isn't concerned, they even just <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/39663938"><span style="color: #1d637d;">tightened monetary policy yesterday</span></a> in
              a bid to cool the economy and reign-in inflation, which is expected
              to hit <a rel="nofollow" href="http://sbr.com.sg/economy/news/singapore-inflation-rise-4-mas"><span style="color: #1d637d;">2-3% next
              year</span></a>. DBS also still expects Singapore to achieve
              full-year GDP growth of 15% and has explained that pharma
              contractions such as the one just experienced don't normally last
              more than a quarter.</p>
              <p>Still, by the looks of the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://sbr.com.sg/economy/news/singapore-economy-just-hit-brick-wall-worst-quarterly-drop-1975"><span style="color: #1d637d;">SBR chart</span></a> above, this was still a shockingly volatile quarter, even for
              Singapore.</p>
