I think its hardly appropriate. Even if we want land we will still consider very carefully the TYPE of land that benefits Sg both in short term and long term...more land does not mean a richer or wealthier country, it just shows more of the country's presence in the world map.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's all about money. Clearing forests by burning is cheaper. If you want them to stop, you have to pay them not to burn their forests lor. Say, if the economic costs of the haze is 10 million dollars, then how about paying 10 million dollars to them not to slash and burn.</div>

Haze is not (controlled by) a magic wand where you say one or two words and it disappears," Environment Minister Azmi Khalid told reporters.<br><br>Parts of Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore have been covered with the gray haze for the past three weeks, causing economic losses and some health problems.<br><br>The forest fires, an annual occurrence, are started by farmers or agricultural companies looking for a cheap way to clear brush land for plantations, often palm oil.<br><br>Despite promises, the Indonesian government has failed to stop the practice.<br><br>At an Oct. 13 meeting of environment ministers, Jakarta was urged by others to ratify a regional treaty to fight the brush fires. Officials will meet again in Jakarta in November before a ministerial meeting in the Philippines in December.<br><br>"This is again meetings and meetings and meetings but not much on the ground," Azmi said. "Personally I am not happy with so many meetings when people are suffering. But something is better than nothing," he said.<br><br>He said "there are no short cuts" to preventing the haze, which can be stopped only by preventing forest fires.<br><br>Heavy rains over the past one week washed away the gray smog and fine particles in the air over Malaysia, but there is still a threat of more haze.<br><br>"I am frustrated like every citizen of Malaysia. We are helpless at the present moment. We are thankful that the rain is here," Azmi said.<br><br>Although the downpours have caused flooding in some parts of Malaysia, Azmi said people are still thankful. "They are enjoying a better life in the floods than in the haze."</blockquote>Msia is making noise/complain to indonesia.... and we are praising them for the effort to admit the fire? !@#$%^&amp;</div>
