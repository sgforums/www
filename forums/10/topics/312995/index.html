              <p>Ask any of your malay friends the meaning of Fitnah. Fitnah is commonly used here as "defemation".</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/cna/cgi-bin/search/search_7days.pl?status=&amp;search=fitna&amp;id=338010"><br></a></p>

              <p>I have seen many self made videos defaming Muslims thru lies, quoting out of context, etc. But this is the first time I've seen an officially made film of the matter.</p>
              <p>I really can't believe what's going on. The movie is filled with quotes from the quran out of context, one sided views, terrorist and extremist. And this is suppose to "expose" the truth about islam?</p>
              <p>The film itself doesn't bug me (ok, maybe a little), but what really bugs me is that it is an officially made movie and accepted by the government of the country to be published. The film is pure lies and it is still accepted!</p>
              <p>I understand the concept of freedom of speech. So does this mean people are allowed the freedom to Fitnah (defame)? Apparently people can publish anything they want under freedom of speech these days...</p>

              <p>many things are now subject to `open' interpretations. even christianity is not spared. I don't think anyone can stop it nor prevent future occurance. some did it out of naivety while others are out to stir things up.</p>
              <p>curryman is correct, if it is a farce, most will know. and there are relevant authorities to take care of things. we shouldn't take matters in our own hand, other than just having a discussion here, i guess. at least, we can dispel and debate over its content w/out any worse.</p>

              <p>Geert Wilder is infamous for spreading atrocities about Islam in his country and all over the world. If u can recall a video about a nude woman dressed in translucent hijab and having images of Quran Surahs superimposed on them, that is done by him.</p>
              <p>We, as muslims, are taught to be compassionate and to be strong when they are attacks to our religion. We confide in Him and Rasullulah (pbuh) should we face problems and we follow on with our daily passages in life.</p>
              <p>Such fitnah, Allah knows...and we know there will be consequences to that.</p>

              <p>I haven't made my official answer, but here's one very good answer from Kamran in yahoo answers...</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Geert Wilders has raised many points in his movie Fitna. He has tried
              to give a face to Islam that he and people like him (eg Osama Bin
              Laden) like to project. Misquoting Quran, and picking verses of his
              choice from the holy book ignoring verses just next to them. Giving
              half information is same as creating misinformation. However, for
              people who are wise, the same fitna created by Geert Wilders will lead
              to understanding the truth and salvation, once they read Quran and
              understand the real context.<br> While this response does not intend to explain reactive behaviours of
              some muslims (including clerics), it will explain the misquoted text
              from the source - Quran.<br> <br> Movie starts with following verse quoted from holy Quran:<br> <br> First Quran verse presented in the movie:<br> Quran: 008.060<br> "Against them make ready your strength to the utmost of your power,
              including steeds of war, to strike terror into (the hearts of) the
              enemies, of Allah and your enemies, and others besides, whom ye may not
              know, but whom Allah doth know. Whatever ye shall spend in the cause of
              Allah, shall be repaid unto you, and ye shall not be treated unjustly. "<br> <br> But Geert refuses to read and quote just the next verse without
              understanding context, showing his ill intentions. Courage is being
              brought into hearts of fearful muslims against whom war has been
              declared and peace has been taken away:<br> <br> Quran: 008.061<br> But if the enemy incline towards peace, do thou (also) incline towards
              peace, and trust in Allah: for He is One that heareth and knoweth (all
              things).<br> <br> Islam encourages peace, will somebody want a better proof than this.
              Even against those who started to go against peace, you also get ready
              to respond to maintain peace, fighting those who distroy peace, but if
              they go back to peace, then there is no reason for war.<br> <br> <br> A little earlier in the same chapter the context becomes even more clear:<br> Quran: 008.039<br> And fight them on until there is no more tumult or oppression, and
              there prevail justice and faith in Allah altogether and everywhere; but
              if they cease, verily Allah doth see all that they do.<br> <br> Permission is being given to fight those who cause tumult or oppression
              without letting justice and forcing people not to choose what religion
              is right for them.<br> <br> Quran: 008.058<br> If thou fearest treachery from any group, throw back (their covenant)
              to them, (so as to be) on equal terms: for Allah loveth not the
              treacherous.<br> <br> It is all about terms and conditions. "IF". Permission is being given
              to fight with given circumstances of treachery from hostile group.<br> <br> Same chapter again, to make context even more clear:<br> Quran: 008.056<br> They are those with whom thou didst make a covenant, but they break
              their covenant every time, and they have not the fear (of Allah).<br> <br> "Those" are the people who break agreements and treaties.<br> <br> <br> <br> Doesn't make the same chapter clarify people like those who made "Fita" with all the wrong intentions misquoting Quran,<br> Quran: 008.049<br> "Lo! the hypocrites say, and those in whose hearts is a disease: "These
              people,- their religion has misled them." But if any trust in Allah,
              behold! Allah is Exalted in might, Wise."<br> <br> <br> --------------------------------------...<br> The second verse from Quran presented is:<br> Quran: 004.056<br> Those who reject our Signs, We shall soon cast into the Fire: as often
              as their skins are roasted through, We shall change them for fresh
              skins, that they may taste the penalty: for Allah is Exalted in Power,
              Wise.<br> <br> These are the warnings for disbelievers. And there is sign of God in it
              for the wise. Can an illiterate man (Mohammad, p.b.u.h) who didn't know
              how to read and write say such a thing which only MD's of today's
              medical sciences are able to explain.<br> Today science has discovered that the only place where pain of fire is
              felt is not the meat, but it is skin. God is giving His sign for the
              wise people in it to know the Quran is from God only. Punishment
              through roasting the skin, again and again, only the skin. Still there
              are many like Geert who did not think about it. For sure there are many
              signs for believers in Quran.<br> --------------------------------------...<br> The third verse quoted is:<br> Quran: 047.004<br> Therefore, when ye meet the Unbelievers (in fight), smite at their
              necks; At length, when ye have thoroughly subdued them, bind a bond
              firmly (on them): thereafter (is the time for) either generosity or
              ransom: Until the war lays down its burdens. Thus (are ye commanded):
              but if it had been Allah's Will, He could certainly have exacted
              retribution from them (Himself); but (He lets you fight) in order to
              test you, some with others. But those who are slain in the Way of
              Allah,- He will never let their deeds be lost.<br> <br> Again same chapter explains the context:<br> Quran: 047.020<br> Those who believe say, "Why is not a sura sent down (for us)?" But when
              a sura of basic or categorical meaning is revealed, and fighting is
              mentioned therein, thou wilt see those in whose hearts is a disease
              looking at thee with a look of one in swoon at the approach of death.
              But more fitting for them-<br> <br> Chapters 25-78 were revealed during the early stage of Madani life
              after migration, at the time when muslims were weak, and feared to
              participate in wars staged on them by disbelievers.<br> <br> --------------------------------------...<br> Fourth time a verse is mentioned:<br> Quran: 004.089<br> They but wish that ye should reject Faith, as they do, and thus be on
              the same footing (as they): But take not friends from their ranks until
              they flee in the way of Allah (From what is forbidden). But if they
              turn renegades, seize them and slay them wherever ye find them; and (in
              any case) take no friends or helpers from their ranks;-<br> <br> Geert again ignores the context from the same chapter, a few verses away:<br> Quran: 004.075<br> And why should ye not fight in the cause of Allah and of those who,
              being weak, are ill-treated (and oppressed)?- Men, women, and children,
              whose cry is: "Our Lord! Rescue us from this town, whose people are
              oppressors; and raise for us from thee one who will protect; and raise
              for us from thee one who will help!"<br> <br> Islam is all about self defence, getting people (men, women, children)
              their right away from oppression, ill treatment, who cry and ask God
              for help.<br> <br> --------------------------------------...<br> And the final Verse quoted in the movie:<br> Quran: 008.039<br> And fight them on until there is no more tumult or oppression, and
              there prevail justice and faith in Allah altogether and everywhere; but
              if they cease, verily Allah doth see all that they do.<br> <br> Geert picks the right verse that explains the whole context, but verily,<br> <br> Quran: 047.024<br> Do they not then earnestly seek to understand the Qur'an, or are their hearts locked up by them?<br> <br> Quran: 2:171<br> The example of such disbelievers is that of parrots who repeat what
              they hear of sounds and calls, without understanding. deaf, dumb, and
              blind; they cannot understand.<br> <br> Again it says that if they cease to fight, don't fight. And permission
              is given to fight until all oppression is nulified, and people have the
              freedom to choose the right religion and faith as they want.<br> <br> --------------------------------------...<br> Islam strictly condemns religious extremism and the use of violence against innocent lives.<br> <br> There is no justification in Islam for extremism or terrorism.
              Targeting civilians’ life and property through suicide bombings or any
              other method of attack is haram – or forbidden - and those who commit
              these barbaric acts are criminals, not “martyrs.”<br> <br> The Qur’an, Islam’s revealed text, states: "Whoever kills a person
              [unjustly]…it is as though he has killed all mankind. And whoever saves
              a life, it is as though he had saved all mankind."<br> <br> (Qur’an, 5:32)<br> <br> Prophet Muhammad said there is no excuse for committing unjust acts:
              "Do not be people without minds of your own, saying that if others
              treat you well you will treat them well, and that if they do wrong you
              will do wrong to them. Instead, accustom yourselves to do good if
              people do good and not to do wrong (even) if they do evil."
              (Al-Tirmidhi)<br> <br> <br> The Holy Prophet Muhammad(s) puts it in these words: "All creatures are
              like a family of God: and he loves the most those who are the most
              beneficent to His family. (Narrated by Anas. Mishkat al-Masabih,3:1392.)<br> <br> Even duty of prophet was to clearly defined as to convey the messege of God to human beings:<br> So if they dispute with you (Muhammad SAW) say: "I have submitted
              myself to Allah (in Islam), and (so have) those who follow me." And say
              to those who were given the Scripture (Jews and Christians) and to
              those who are illiterates (Arab pagans): "Do you (also) submit
              yourselves (to Allah in Islam)?" If they do, they are rightly guided;
              but if they turn away, your duty is only to convey the Message; and
              Allah is All-Seer of (His ) slaves.<br> ( Ø³ÙˆØ±Ø© Ø¢Ù„ Ø¹Ù…Ø±Ø§Ù† , Aal-e-Imran, Chapter #3, Verse #20)<br> <br> Then, if they turn away, your duty (O Muhammad SAW) is only to convey (the Message) in a clear way.<br> ( Ø³ÙˆØ±Ø© Ø§Ù„Ù†Ø­Ù„ , An-Nahl, Chapter #16, Verse #82)<br> <br> <br> <br> Quran<br> 2:256 There is no compulsion in religion.<br> <br> Don't give bad rating to a Mercedes only because the driver didn’t know
              how to drive such a good car and had an accident. Don't judge islam by
              the actions of bad Muslims who take out their frustration with west
              with wrong interpretation of Islamic teaching. Know islam by yourself.
              Give yourself a chance to know truth with open mind<br> <br> Your reply please!!!</p>

              <p>sigh ......</p>
              <p>look dudes ..... there are hundreds of violently anti-non-muslims, jihadist and terror videos available on the net, railing against the jews, the christians, the west, the non-believers, everyone who's not a muslim .... including lots on youtube ... no one goes on protest on the streets  ... no one calls for their removal ... why ? .... because  we know to  write these people off as cranks and nutjobs, ..... (except  for those  head cutting videos,  which  I  think  are also psychopaths) .... you stumble onto them, you watch them, you laugh, and you go watch something else ..... that's what free speech is about, everyone gets a say, including, unfortunately, the nutjobs and the cranks and terrorists ... but normal people knows what's right and wrong, what's black and white, I do that, what's so difficult about it ? ...</p>
              <p>would you like these sort of vids removed as well ? .... or is it just a one way street ? ....</p>
              <p>Like I said above ... many muslims are playing right into these chaps' hands ... you are behaving in exactly the way these chaps' said you would, with demonstrations, with intolerance, with loud protests with bits of violence thrown in .... you're not helping to clear up mis-perceptions against your religion, you're vindicating what he's been trying to say ....  if you just come along and laugh and say, haha, he's a racist and a nutjob .... hey, I'd agree with you and forget about it ... and file this film together with those beheading and jihadi vids in my brain, the folder marked recycle bin ....</p>
              <p>but now I see indonesia threatening to ban youtube if the video is not removed, I see supermarkets in malaysia labelling dutch products, I see flag burnings in pakistan, protests everywhere, for the work of one man .... you know what I see ? ... I see an us versus them attitude ... I see a "I can say what I like about me, but you can't say anything bad about me" mindset .... again ... maybe you can stop the mouths of some people talking, you can never stop the minds of people thinking .... so what may be a better way to go about this ? ....  go chew on it dude ...</p>
