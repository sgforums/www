              <p>Maurizio, I believe you have got yourself to blame for all these because you are one of the biggest critics of Temasek making money from local monopolies such as utilities.</p>

              <p>Now that the are opening up the market to encourage competition, you are again criticising their move.</p>

              <p>2670MW is very huge. But US$2.8-3.0 billion is a high premium to pay considering it's a old plant with high O&amp;M.
