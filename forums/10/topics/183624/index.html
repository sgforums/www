            <div class='col-md body'>Why  so many cars despite the high cost of car ownerships?<br><br>The relaxation of financing of up to 95%  which run contrary to the prohibitive car taxes ruling meant to curb the car population make it easier to own a car now.  It used to be 80% financing for new car for a very long time.<br><br>Also the loan period has been extended to ten years from seven years for new cars. Though many part with their cars before five years. Ten-year tenure  has reduced the monthly instalment amount.<br><br>The number of cars scrapped affects the number of COEs issued. The authority already has in mind a quota on the number of cars to be allowed on the road for a given period of time.<br><br>Whether there is bidding or not, the number of COE available is already fixed for the year.<br><br>The control of car via the quota system has become an offering of prices in a bidding system. Such a system has seen rocketing COE price reaching astronomical sums.<br><br>Whether its right or wrong depends on how you look at it.<br><br>Perhaps speculative factor in a bidding system ought be avoided in the transport policy of a country.<br><br>Comments  pls???<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Tax is unavoidable in  containing the car population in most countries. The amount payable is clearly stated. Unlike taxes, COE is unpredictable with the upswings and downswings, it is speculative in nature. And what have a quota system got to do with a Certificate of Entitlement in a bidding system. We are not bidding for a piece of antique or re-possessed property. Many just need a basic car in the course of their daily work.<br><br></div>
