B pushes A away and A falls to death.</div></blockquote>A further highlight on the differences on both cases.<br><br>As shown on Case 1, B has done nothing to A that was directly the cause of death. Thus, as A had forcefully gripped B, B was only swinging B's arm and A would have not died if A released the grip on B's hand.<br><br>As shown on Case 2, B has applied force onto A, though without any intent to harm, causing the death. Thus, B is directly involved in A's death as even if A released the grip on B's hand, the push would be the cause of A's death. As the force applied by B was insufficient to kill, thus it's considered involuntary manslaughter.<br><br>Case 3 is simpler, as A has applied sufficient force to kill, thus proving the statement voluntary manslaughter.<br><br>Case 4 is without debate, a higher degree of voluntary manslaughter which is considered murder in Singapore.</div>
