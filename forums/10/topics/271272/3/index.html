Switzerland has four national languages: German, French, Italian, and Romansh. The German spoken in the German speaking part of Switzerland is predominantly a range of Swiss dialects, but newspapers and some broadcasts use High German as used in Germany. Many Swiss speak more than one language. English is widely known, especially among professionals.<br><br>More than 75% of the population live in the central plain, which stretches between the Alps and the Jura Mountains and from Geneva in the southwest to the Rhine River and Lake Constance in the northeast. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Resident foreigners and temporary foreign workers make up about 20% of the population</span>.<br><br>Almost all Swiss are literate. Switzerland's 13 institutes of higher learning enrolled 99,600 students in the academic year of 2001-02. About 25% of the adult population hold a diploma of higher learning.<br><br>The constitution guarantees freedom of worship and the different religious communities co-exist peacefully.<br><br>Switzerland consistently ranks high on quality of life indices, including per capita income, concentration of computer and internet usage per capita, insurance coverage per individual, and health care rates. For these and many other reasons, such as the four languages, it serves as an excellent test market for businesses hoping to introduce new products into Europe.<br><br></div></blockquote>The high literacy rate of the Swiss is to be commended. On the other hand, although 20% as mentioned in the article is foreign talent, it failed to specify the workscope they are in.<br><br>The majority of FTs are on a strict employment pass, and the pass itself is extremely dififcult to obtain, due to the strength of the Swiss workforce. My friend just successfully applied for such a pass and is now employed in a water treatment and purification plant in Basle, despite being a Singaporean.<br><br>But the construction workers, road cleaners etc are still very much swiss to a large degree, as personally witnessed in Zurich, Interlaken, Bern and Luzern.</div>

He worked in various auto-part factories that employ cheap foreign labour, till his arrest on Nov. 30.<br><br>Among the many human rights violations committed against the suspect were the public statements made by his court-appointed lawyers who told the media that he had confessed to the murder, point out activists................"I realised that the policy of teaching Japanese language and culture to children of migrant workers does not result in equality for foreigners. Japanese people must learn more about the other side for real cooperation and understanding," she explained. (END/2005) </div></blockquote>With the greying population becoming a REAL problem for future Japan, it will not be surprising for an inclusive culture to finally accept that opening up their shores to foreign workers may be the only solution, especially for benign work that is considered unglamourous. Modern day Japan is still very staunchly supportive of local employment, and it will take some cajoling to convince the die-hards that FT, and lots of it, are needed.<br><br>The discrimination of women in Japan's male-dominated society has resulted in a steady growth of capable and talented japanese women seeking careers abroad, in MNCs and other established companies. The chances of them marrying abroad are heightened, further increasing the odds that Japan's population is now at a crossroads.<br><br>Perhaps this is also a senario our govt is wary of, considering the increasing number of overseas bond-breakers and locals plying their trade abroad, and finally settling down in foreign countries and even giving up their citizenship.</div>
