            <div class='col-md body'>apart from age discrimination, this issue of decreasing wages for the lowest wage earners is something our million dollar ministers perversely refuse to tackle!<br><br>Straits Times<br>S'pore's dirty secret<br><br>They keep offices, shopping centres and the roads clean. But their wages look shabby compared to the rest of boomtown Singapore. SUE-ANN CHIA finds out why the pay of cleaners and labourers declined over the past decade<br><br>EVERY DAY, Madam Aishah Mohamed Yunos, 30, toils at four blocks in a Bukit Panjang housing estate, wiping walls and lifts and sweeping and mopping floors.<br><br>The neighbourhood is spick and span. But the job pays crumbs.<br><br>At least that is what Madam Aishah feels when she pockets her monthly wages of $400. If that's not lousy enough, she has not had a pay rise in two years on the job.<br><br>'There's nothing else I can do,' she says with a careless shrug. She left school at Primary 6.<br><br>Her story, if she sticks to cleaning work, could soon mirror that of another cleaner's, Madam P. Devi, 60.<br><br>Nine years ago, she earned $500 a month cleaning offices. Today, she earns $440 cleaning at a mall in Holland Village.<br><br>'I have enough to eat,' she says, by way of prefacing how she has no right to be unhappy because she is illiterate. She and her retiree security guard husband, 69, who gets a pension, are supporting two children still in school.<br><br>The two women, across two generations, are in the beleaguered brigade of Singapore workers whose pay packets have slackened even as other workers have marched ahead in an expanding economy.<br><br>In the last 10 years, the starting salaries of all occupational groups rose - except one.<br><br>That group: cleaners and labourers. Their median monthly starting pay fell 30 per cent between 1996 and 2006 - from $860 to $600.<br><br>The Government's latest wage report says the group's median pay was being dragged down by a sizeable number of this category of workers languishing in extremely low-paying jobs.<br><br>At the bottom of the heap: office cleaners and aircraft loaders. They start with a monthly pay of $500 and $550 respectively.<br><br>In 1996, newbie cleaners made $550 while newbie aircraft loaders made $650.<br><br>While aircraft loaders' pay went up with experience, office cleaners had no such gains. Their median monthly salary fell from $708 in 1996 to $657 last year.<br><br>Twin forces thwarting rise in wages<br><br>WHAT accounts for their shrinking wages?<br><br>Labour economists blame two forces: competition from low-skilled foreign workers and the growing trend of outsourcing.<br><br>'Salaries are unlikely to rise as long as low-skilled local workers compete with low-skilled foreign labour who are often paid less,' says Associate Professor Hui Weng Tat, vice-dean of the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy.<br><br>His view that foreign workers depress the wages of local workers has been aired before by others, including Mr Lim Swee Say when he was deputy labour chief.<br><br>In an interview last year, Mr Lim, who is now the labour chief, said he suspected the easy entry of cheap foreign workers in some sectors has reduced the incentive for employers to improve work processes and raise productivity. It is easier and cheaper to hire cheap, than to invest in better work processes.<br><br>But he made clear he was not opposed to foreign workers, saying that they contributed to the economy.<br><br>Economist Lim Chong Yah, who headed the National Wages Council for 29 years until 2001, also last year warned policymakers to be careful about allowing 'too free a flow' of 'very low value-added labour, very low-wage labour'.<br><br>The other issue to contend with is outsourcing. As firms cut costs and headcount, many outsource non-core functions like cleaning.<br><br>Instead of being on the more stable payroll of these companies, cleaners are now hired at a much lower pay by cleaning agencies which then assign them to different workplaces.<br><br>Cleaning agencies, in their fierce battle to win contracts, slash the price of their bids. The losers: the cleaners who end up with even lower pay.<br><br>Prof Hui notes that outsourcing also encourages service buyers such as building owners to switch to cheaper cleaning contracts. This means some cleaners may continue in the same job under a different employer - often wearing just differently coloured uniforms - while others are forced to seek new employment.<br><br>'This perpetuates the low pay of such workers who do not benefit from any seniority-based component in their pay but are constantly treated as new employees,' he says.<br><br>Part-timers, retirees depress wage figures<br><br>FIGURES from five cleaning companies surveyed by Insight indicate that cleaners' pay may be creeping up.<br><br>Five to 10 years ago, a cleaner would be offered around $580 to $600 a month. Today, he would get about $100 more, says Mr Kevin Loh, the boss of Campaign Cleaning Services.</div>

He worked in various auto-part factories that employ cheap foreign labour, till his arrest on Nov. 30.<br><br>Among the many human rights violations committed against the suspect were the public statements made by his court-appointed lawyers who told the media that he had confessed to the murder, point out activists.<br><br>Television crews fell over each other to enter and film his small apartment, even before his arrest, and interviews with the man's bewildered wife and family in Peru, carried out by Japanese reporters, were aired.<br><br>''I was shocked to see the way his lawyers treated the suspect they are supposed to defend. The lack of media restraint shows the lack of respect for the rights of foreigners," said Luis Albare, editor of International Press, a newspaper catering to the Spanish-speaking population in Japan. ''Many Peruvian workers living in Japan have been badly affected by the way the suspect was treated.''<br><br>Albare reported that Peruvians living in Japan have become the butt of cruel comments by their Japanese colleagues after the over-publicised arrest.<br><br>People freely hint that Â‘Peruvians are all alike' and a Peruvian child in a Japanese public school talked of the mental pain and sadness she felt when the teacher in her class asked the students to name the nationality of the suspect.<br><br>Activists contend that the hysteria over the murder has fanned a deep undercurrent of distrust of foreigners who have been linked, by the police, to rising crime in the country.<br><br>Currently, Japan hosts around 800,000 foreign workers, Of them, 230,000 are of Japanese ancestry, mostly from Latin America where many Japanese migrated and settled in the early 20th century to escape poverty Peruvians account for about 60,000 of that number.<br><br>Police statements repeatedly indicate that crimes committed by foreign nationals are increasing and that 16 percent of all arrests made in 2004 were those of foreigners.<br><br>But human rights activists working with foreigners say the figures are misleading.<br><br>''Foreigners who commit crimes are actually a little less than two percent of the overall figures for criminals in Japan and this has been despite a steady increase in the foreign population," said Sonoko Kawakami of the Japanese chapter of the rights group Amnesty International.<br><br>Kawakami says police hype up the profile of foreigners as criminals by mixing up data on arrests with those detained for non-criminal violations such as overstaying visas.<br><br>''Crime is increasingly becoming a social problem and police are manipulating the statistics to make foreigners take the brunt of this issue,'' she explained.<br><br>Alarmed at the situation following the arrest of the Peruvian, activists working with large minority groups have, among other things, staged a huge rally in Tokyo calling on the police and the government to respect their human rights.<br><br>''The arrest of the Peru migrant worker highlights the vulnerability of foreigners living in Japan,'' said Hideki Morihara, spokesman for International Movement Against Racial Discrimination, one of the organisers of the rally.<br><br>Morihara says migrant workers have no social support such as counselling or Japanese language help. They are lonely and frustrated in Japanese society that does not understand foreign cultures.<br><br>''Foreign workers are treated here as cheap labour, as guests who are here to supply Japanese factories with work, rather than people who must have the same access and benefits as Japanese,'' he said.<br><br>An opinion poll conducted last year by the government found that at least 25 percent of Japanese believe that foreigners were a threat to public security and would rather not have foreigners in their midst.<br><br>And yet, Japan needs foreign workers to make up for the steady shrinking of its population of 128 million, which is also greying.<br><br>Many Japanese businesses are looking to populous countries like China and India as a way out of its looming demographic deficit but others prefer to import migrant labour, especially from among people of Japanese descent in Latin American countries -- though even they cannot escape discrimination.<br><br>There are initiatives to ease the situation. Prof. Chikako Yamawaki, at Bunkyoku University, has launched a programme in two primary schools that teaches Japanese students Spanish language and Latin American culture in the hope of fostering deeper cross-cultural understanding.<br><br>"I realised that the policy of teaching Japanese language and culture to children of migrant workers does not result in equality for foreigners. Japanese people must learn more about the other side for real cooperation and understanding," she explained. (END/2005)</div>

Switzerland has four national languages: German, French, Italian, and Romansh. The German spoken in the German speaking part of Switzerland is predominantly a range of Swiss dialects, but newspapers and some broadcasts use High German as used in Germany. Many Swiss speak more than one language. English is widely known, especially among professionals.<br><br>More than 75% of the population live in the central plain, which stretches between the Alps and the Jura Mountains and from Geneva in the southwest to the Rhine River and Lake Constance in the northeast. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Resident foreigners and temporary foreign workers make up about 20% of the population</span>.<br><br>Almost all Swiss are literate. Switzerland's 13 institutes of higher learning enrolled 99,600 students in the academic year of 2001-02. About 25% of the adult population hold a diploma of higher learning.<br><br>The constitution guarantees freedom of worship and the different religious communities co-exist peacefully.<br><br>Switzerland consistently ranks high on quality of life indices, including per capita income, concentration of computer and internet usage per capita, insurance coverage per individual, and health care rates. For these and many other reasons, such as the four languages, it serves as an excellent test market for businesses hoping to introduce new products into Europe.<br><br></div>
