            <div class='col-md body'>as long as burning fossil fuel remains the only way for singapoer to generate electricity, they is no other way it can be cheaper.<br><br>i think singapore charges 21 cents per kwH now. But it is strictly pay as you use system<br><br>Indonesia charges 11 cents... BUT.. there's lots of hidden charges that could make electricity charge more expensive.<br><br>First, you gotta indent electricity at about 6 cents per KVA, a typical house is 8000 to 11000 KVA. So you pay like $48 as fixed cost.<br><br>On top of the indent, you gotta pay the usage at 11cents kwh.<br><br>So you still think Singapore is expensive?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Very simple, our fees for utility and itelecommunication and internet services are high because the government charges their fees to recover all costs although at one time it promised to charge only the consumption components not fixed asset or infrastructure costs.<br><br>Under the government directive all ministries and departments are required to operate as cost centre and attain break even.<br><br>So taxes paid are not put to use for provision of such services and become surpluses for which ministers claim as cost savings or success.<br><br>Then the government decided to corporatize services like utilities, medical, postal, telecommunication, housing, etc into private or limited companies called GLCs to get rid of burdens whereby all existing operations including lands and infrastructures paid and financed by taxpayers funds were sold to or acquired by such entities.<br><br>The government sold the pre-existing services lock stock and barrel to such GLCs which took over the entire operations including lands and fixed assets already paid by the txpayers.<br><br>GLCs use the opportunity of corporatisation to increase their own ironricebowl salaries by creating higher positions equivalent to those in private sector like CEOs and GMs and directors who are then paid higher salaries.<br><br>Land and fixed asset costs would now be charged by GLCs once again and factored into their fees on services. But such costs on lands and infrastructure were already paid by the citizens but when the GLCs were corporatized the government sold the entire stakes to the GLCs, and keeps the taxpayers' capital monies instead of returning them back to taxpayers through the GLCs to lower fees.<br><br>This explains why HDB has to charge land costs all over again resulting in HDB jacking up their sale prices from $7,800 in 1970s to $150,000.00 in the 1990s for a 3-rm improved flat even though lands were already paid by the taxpayers through the HDB funds with the power of the Land Acquisition Act.<br><br>This explains why Power Supply had to charge the extra 6-9 cents per kilowatt hour for electricity network and infrastructure costs even though such capital and fixed costs were already paid by the taxpayers previously before corporations into GLCs.<br><br>All the double charges on lands and infrastructure were the result of corporatisation or creating accounting through setting up GLCs with huge profits of corporatization going to the government resulting in GLCs having to charge for such corporatisation costs once more thereby increasing the fees and charges and costs of living.<br><br>Such a tax-and-recover system of government has resulted in taxes being idling and accumulating into surpluses which stuff the economy of liquidity and slow down its economic activities resulting in periodic recessions we are frequently witnessing.</div>
