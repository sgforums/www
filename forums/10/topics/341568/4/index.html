              <p>To,<br><br>President Barack Obama<br>The White House<br>1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW<br>Washington DC 20500<br><br>Jan 22, 2009                                                                                                <span style="text-decoration: underline;">First Class Mail<br></span><br>Dear President Obama,<br><br>I
              would like to congratulate you in becoming the President of the United
              States. In your presidency, you carry the hope of many around the world
              who seek freedom. I believe that with your presidency, we can achieve a
              new age where freedom will be the bedrock upon which everything else
              will depend.<br><br>This letter is a plea to you to help the countless
              people in Singapore who are suffering under the crushing yoke of Lee
              Kuan Yew's dictatorship. One of his victims is myself.<br><br>I wish to tell you my story.<br><br>I
              am an American citizen, born in Singapore and formerly a Singapore
              citizen. I lived most of my life in Singapore, and was educated there.
              I then went to England to read law and was admitted to the English Bar.
              Thereafter I returned to Singapore, was admitted to the Singapore Bar,
              and practiced there law until 1991, when I came to the United States,
              obtained asylum for the persecution I suffered for my political
              beliefs. I was admitted to the California Bar and have been practicing
              law here ever since.<br><br>On May 26, 2008, I went to Singapore to
              observe a defamation of character trial in which the Minister Mentor of
              Singapore Lee Kuan Yew and his son, the Prime Minister were suing Dr.
              Chee Soon Juan and his sister Miss Chee Siok Chin who are opposition
              politicians, for having written an article critical of them.<br><br>Being
              a lawyer and someone personally involved in Singapore politics, this
              trial was of particular interest for me, especially since it was
              publicized that Dr. Chee Soon Juan and Chee Siok Chin will be cross
              examining Lee and his son. This particular hearing was to decide the
              quantum of damages the court will award to the Lees since they had
              already won this lawsuit earlier. This hearing was scheduled to be
              heard by Judge Belinda Ang Saw Ean in the Singapore High Court from May
              26, 2008 to May 28, 2008. I planned my trip to Singapore to last from
              May 26, 2008 to June 1, 2008, a period of 7 days to enable me to attend
              the trial as an observer and return after spending the remaining few
              days in Singapore.<br><br>I was in Justice Belinda Ang Saw Ean's court
              for all 3 days listening to the trial. Throughout the 3 days, this
              Judge was completely biased in favor of the Lees. She did not give the
              Defendant Dr. Chee Soon Juan or his sister Miss Chee Siok Chin any
              meaningful opportunity to defend themselves. Anyone who had observed
              the trial would have walked away with the same opinion. Full details of
              Judge Ang's complete abdication of her judicial responsibility is well
              documented in Dr. Chee Soon Juan blog, <a href="http://www.yoursdp.org/">http://www.yoursdp.org/</a>.<br><br>On the 29th of May, 2008 in Singapore, after the court hearing was over, I wrote a blog post on my blog "Singapore Dissident", <a href="http://www.singaporedissident.blogspot.com/">http://www.singaporedissident.blogspot.com/</a> entitled <a href="http://singaporedissident.blogspot.com/2008/05/singapore-judge-belinda-angs-kangaroo.html">Singapore. Judge Belinda Ang's Kangaroo Court</a> in which I criticized her conduct in her judicial capacity during the 3 days of trial. I am attaching a copy of this blog post.<br><br>On
              Saturday May 31, 2008 at about 8.30 pm, while I was descending from my
              7th Floor hotel room at Broadway Hotel, Serangoon Road, Singapore, I
              was arrested by 5 plain clothes policemen when the elevator door opened
              at the ground floor lobby. I was handcuffed, pushed back into the
              elevator, rode to the floor where my room was ransacked and my American
              passport and personal documents confiscated. I was then driven in their
              police car to Central Police Station where I was kept in solitary
              confinement for 6 days during which time I was repeatedly interrogated
              day and night and accused of having sent Emails to this judge and
              others, which I never did. I was charged for this. The charge read that
              I had insulted the judge in the Emails.<br><br>When I denied ever
              sending any Emails, I was charged under the Sedition Act of Singapore
              for having insulted this judge and told that I will be sentenced to a
              prison term of up to 3 years if convicted. Subsequently, they reverted
              back to the Email charge. Finally I was charged for having insulted
              this judge because I had written this blog post in my blog.<br><br>The
              Singapore Constitution has a provision like in most other constitutions
              of the world guaranteeing free speech, expression and assembly. The
              United Nations Declaration of Human Rights guarantees this right to
              every person in this world regardless of race creed or religion. In my
              writing this blog post in criticism of this judge, I was acting just as
              any other human being is entitled to act.<br><br>After holding me in
              solitary confinement for 6 days, they officially charged me in court on
              June 5, 2008. I was then released on bail. My case was fixed for
              hearing before Judge Kan Ting Chiu on September 08, 2008. Although I
              had made several requests for my case to be heard sooner so that I can
              return to my law practice in California, the court simply refused. Two
              attempts for the court to release my passport to enable me to travel to
              the US in the interim to take care of business, even though supported
              by the American Embassy were also ignored.<br><br>This meant that I had
              to remain in Singapore throughout this period which will result in my
              suffering severe financial harm due to neglecting my practice this
              entire time of 6 months. I was not able to earn any income from my US
              practice as well as having to maintain myself to live in Singapore
              during these months.<br><br>Eventually the case came to trial. Judge
              Kan Ting Chiu was determined to send me to prison. No amount of
              argument by me in saying that writing a blog post was lawful criticism
              and a human right, made any difference to him. On the 17th of September
              2008, he sentenced me to 3 months imprisonment, a sentence much harsher
              than even thieves and robbers receive.<br><br>On the 20th of November
              2008, I was released from prison, allowed to remain in Singapore for 5
              days until the 26th of November 2008 when I was permitted to leave
              Singapore. The Singapore Immigration Department has placed a condition
              that I am not allowed to enter Singapore again unless I have the
              written permission of the Singapore Immigration and Customs Authority.
              This effectively means that I am banned from ever returning to my
              country of birth.<br><br>Since my return to Fremont, California on
              November 26, 2008, I have been trying to rebuild my law practice which
              has been shattered. I have also been financially ruined by my forced
              stay in Singapore for 6 months, from which I am trying to recover.<br><br>Despite
              Lee Kuan Yew's attempts to show Singapore as a democracy, it is far
              from it. Today, Singaporeans live in mortal fear of their government.
              The constitution is completely ignored. Singapore Parliament is merely
              a rubber stamp, the country being run entirely on the dictates of this
              one man, Lee Kuan Yew. Although the constitution guarantees freedom of
              speech and expression, the law requires permits to engage in such
              activity and permits are never granted. With one party rule, the people
              have no legal means to voice their dissent. Dr. Chee Soon Juan and
              other activists have engaged in peaceful protests for which they have
              been repeatedly charged and sent to prison. At this very moment,
              Singapore human rights activists, Dr. Chee Soon Juan, Gandhi Ambalam,
              Chee Siok Chin and Yap Keng Ho are undergoing a trial for having
              engaged in a peaceful assembly, one of the many they have suffered.<br><br>In
              Singapore today, there is no free press. Every single newspaper and
              news media is controlled by the government. The judiciary is entirely
              politicized and they invariably abuse the law to punish political
              opponents. The Internal Security Act, giving the government the right
              to detain people without trial is being used. There are a number of
              people presently detained in Singapore under this law. The police force
              is being used as Lee Kuan Yew's private army to arrest detain and
              charge his political opponents.<br><br>Dear President, you have said it
              is your intention to try to uplift people oppressed under the yoke of
              dictators. You have said you believe strongly in the right of people to
              achieve their self determination, to live as men and not slaves. This
              letter that I write carries the hopes of thousands of Singaporeans
              yearning to be free, to live as free men and women endowed with the
              human rights they rightly deserve.<br><br>Singapore unlike other
              countries has no hinterland, no farmland, no place where people can
              survive without government recognition. It is a concrete island where
              one has no choice but to submit to Lee's dictates, because inviting the
              wrath of Lee Kuan Yew would mean being destitute. There are people who
              are able to emigrate leaving Singapore for a freer life elsewhere. But
              for the vast majority, leaving Singapore is impossible. They have
              nowhere else to go. And so they live in submission and fear of Lee Kuan
              Yew's rule.<br><br>You have also said you intend to look into tax
              havens and money laundering centers where foreigners invest to avoid
              paying taxes in their own countries. It is very well documented that
              Singapore banks maintain large investments belonging to Burmese drug
              lords. The US has placed sanctions against the Burmese government. By
              Singapore permitting these assets from Burma to remain in Singapore, it
              is clearly hurting the purpose of the US sanctions. American and
              European businessmen, in order to avoiding taxes in their own countries
              also bank their moneys there. I hope your office will look into this
              and demand that Singapore comply with international standards of
              financial responsibility and stop profiting from illegal funds.<br><br>A
              free and democratic Singapore is a boon for the US, not a bane. Trade
              between the US and Singapore will increase, not decrease if Singapore
              becomes a democracy. Nothing is lost and everything is gained by this.<br><br>Even
              though I am an American citizen, Singapore is dear to my heart. It was
              the place where I was born. I hope to see Singaporeans proud and free,
              standing up tall as men and women, not the sheepish lives they live
              now. Dear President, please do what you can for the people of
              Singapore. Our hopes ride with you.<br><br>Thank you Mr. President.<br><br>Gopalan Nair</p>
