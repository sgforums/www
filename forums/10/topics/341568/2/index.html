In a democratic state, the most appropriate role of the judiciary inside such a system is to interpret the constitution and the laws, not to modify them.

              <p>That's my point, there SHOULD be a line between law and politics. The judiciary is not meant to be another political party. As lawyers, that was one of the very first concept hammered into us.</p>
              <p>I understand your valid concern with section E.4, but you might have misinterpreted that section. Law societies (like SLS) are not political parties, they are meant to be legal think-tanks. They propose and suggest reforms, but do not themselves change the law. Eventually it is still up to the legislators to decide if the proposals should be taken up, hence it is still a political issue.</p>

              <p><em>..."<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The judge Belinda Ang was throughout prostituting herself</strong></span> during
              the entire proceedings, by being nothing more than an employee of Mr.
              Lee Kuan Yew and his son and carrying out their orders. There was
              murder, the rule of law being the repeated victim."<br></em><br>The state controlled Singapore court with its complaint judge Kan Ting Chiu found that the words <em>"prostituting herself during the entire proceedings",</em> among other parts of the blog post, was an insult to her.<br><br>This
              is completely untrue. According to Webster’s Ninth New Collegiate
              Dictionary, other than the usual meaning of a prostitute being a street
              walker, it also means<br><br><em>a) to devote to corrupt or unworthy
              purposes, debase, e.g. to prostitute one's talents <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>b) devoted to
              corrupt purposes</strong></span> c) a person who (as a writer or painter) who
              deliberately debases himself or his talents (as for money).<br></em><br><strong>And
              this was exactly what Judge Belinda Ang did during those 3 days of May
              26 to May 28, 2008 in the High Court of Singapore. Reading the blog you
              will see that my accusation is factually correct. She unashamedly,
              throughout the proceedings permitted her position of a judge to be used
              for Lee Kuan Yew and his son's advantage; not the not the interests of
              the law.</strong><br><br>And I repeat those words I said again here.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> She undoubtedly <em>"prostituted herself in her position as a judge"</em> to serve the interests of Lee Kuan Yew and his son, the Prime Minister of Singapore.</strong></span><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Therefore
              there was no insult at all. My claim is factually correct. I am lawyer
              and I choose my words with discretion</strong></span>. But whatever the truth was, did
              not matter to Lee Kuan Yew's agent, Judge Kan Ting Chiu that day. He
              finds that I insulted the judge when there was no insult at all. And
              now, the state controlled Straits Times picks it up and repeats that
              defamation again and again hoping that people will believe that I had
              in fact insulted the judge....</p>
