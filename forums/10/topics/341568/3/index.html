              <h3 class="post-title entry-title"><a href="http://singaporedissident.blogspot.com/2009/01/singapores-state-controlled-newspaper.html">Singapore's state controlled newspaper Straits Times of Jan 4, 2009 reports "Law Won't tolerate attacks"</a></h3>
              <p><em>Readers of this blog who are unfamiliar with the goings on in Lee
              Kuan Yew's Singapore, may think reading the comments that there are
              many who think Singapore is a democracy based on the rule of law. The
              reader is warned that they may be Singapore government employees whose
              job is to discredit those who criticize Lee Kuan Yew's authoritarian
              rule. Please use your discretion as to how much weight you will give
              these comments. </em><br><br>Ladies and Gentlemen,<br><br>The headline
              news of Singaporeâs state controlled newspaper Straits Times June 4,
              2008 reads "Law wonât tolerate attacks". In Burma too, I am sure the
              law won't tolerate any attacks. And neither would any attacks be
              tolerated in North Korea.<br><br>One thing is clear to me. That is,
              just as they do in Burma, Singapore finds itself in governance by one
              thing and one thing alone; that is fear. This front page article in
              Singapore's state controlled newspaper has one purpose and one purpose
              alone. To intimidate and frighten the pants off every Singaporean from
              criticizing the judges no matter what they do. They are free to abuse
              the law any which way they want, but no one should dare so much as
              raise a whimper.<br><br>And this clearly shows one thing. They are
              clutching at straws. They know the winds are changing. They know the
              people want more accountability from their courts. They know the
              disaffection among the people against the abuse of the law. And they
              are determined to do the one thing which they know, which is, punish
              any critic, any dissenter, who complains.<br><br>Such desperation may
              work in societies like Burma where impoverished peasants have no means
              to resist. The country declines into poverty but the military junta
              remain in power through illegal drug money. This is not something that
              will work in Singapore where the people are better able to fend for
              themselves, with education, skills and money. This desperate act on
              their part will turn counter productive. With open borders unlike
              Burma, the skilled are able to leave, which they are already doing now.
              The sooner they realize this, the better not only for them, but for the
              people of Singapore.<br><br>The Chief Justice and the Attorney General
              in the report based on their speech at the opening of the legal year
              had said "they would not brook any attacks on the courts here". And why
              not? Surely the Law Courts exist on Singapore taxpayerâs money, don't
              they? And if so, why should not a citizen have the right to "attack" a
              judge when there is misuse of the law? No one should be intimidated by
              this arrogance of these judges. Everyone has a right to criticize the
              judiciary or any other branch of the government. This is what free
              speech is all about. And I will do it as many times as I want.<br><br>The
              Chief Justice, Chan Sek Keong says that "the mission of the courts
              requires that its authority be respected by all". But how can anyone
              respect it if throughout its history under Lee Kuan Yew it has been
              nothing more than a tool to silence and punish those who oppose him.
              What about the numerous cases against the late JB Jeyaretnam where the
              courts systematically abused the law to bankrupt him and kick him out
              of Parliament and his law practice for merely engaging in legitimate
              criticisms? How does one respect such a judiciary? And what about Dr.
              Chee Soon Juan, hounded and bankrupted for doing what any citizen of
              any democratic country is entitled to do, that is to criticize? How is
              it possible to respect it? And how is it possible for me to respect it
              when they sent me to jail for 3 months, for doing just that; criticism?
              Can I put it this way? I respect the institution of the judiciary. But
              I have no iota of respect for the individuals who hold that office in
              Singapore. They are one corrupt lot, and they should be told exactly
              that.<br><br>He then goes on to say that the governance of the country
              and the rule of law require that no one should be allowed to scandalize
              the judiciary. My dear Chan Sek Keong, let us not play with words here.
              Lee Kuan Yew has abused the Constitution and whittled it down to such
              an extent that Singapore in effect has no Constitution at all. Let's
              face it, my dear Chan Sek Keong. And let me tell you what I am saying.
              The Singapore Constitution guarantees free speech. And therefore
              illegal laws which Lee Kuan Yew has in place which requires a permit to
              speak publicly is void and illegal. Any first year law student should
              be able to tell you that. No one has made any false or scandalous
              allegations here. All we are doing is to call a rat by its true name,
              which is a rat.<br><br>I should tell Chan Sek Keong this. What you are
              doing is to defend the indefensible. Plain and simply put, your laws
              relating to defamation of character, contempt of court and the laws
              that require permits for public speaking and public assembly are plain
              and simply wrong. And what you are doing is to continue in your abuse
              of the law by convicting people who are engaging in nothing more than
              their constitutional rights.<br><br>The report refers to Walter Woon
              the Attorney General speaking about the need to protect the legal
              system. My question to him is this. If the legal system has lost all
              integrity, what is left to protect?<br><br>He then goes on to say that
              there is a campaign both in Singapore and abroad to attack the
              integrity and independence of the judiciary. What made him think that?
              As far as one can see, foreign newspapers and myself have only reported
              on what we saw, which is that Singaporeâs judges have become corrupt
              and are using the law to prop up the rule of Lee Kuan Yew. And
              punishing someone who says it, which is entirely true, cannot amount to
              anything illegal.<br><br>He then says that critics of the Singapore
              judiciary have been charged for undermining the judiciary for political
              and ideological reasons. I don't know where he got the idea, but in any
              case, there is nothing wrong in attacking the courts either for
              political or ideological reasons. Democracy is a political or
              ideological cause. And democracy demands that the judges are fair and
              just, not stooges of Lee Kuan Yew. Dictatorship is also a political or
              ideological cause and I am entitled to resist a judicial system which
              is determined to further such an ideology as in Singapore, a
              dictatorship.<br><br>Singapore's Attorney General refers to an instance
              where activists had gone to his office and refused to leave until their
              possessions which were illegally seized by the police were returned to
              them. What happened is this. Peaceful protestors had assembled before
              Singapore Parliament demanding that the government show some concern
              for the plight of ordinary Singaporeans who were in poverty. As they
              did not have any permits to assemble, since the police would not give
              it to them, the police arrested them for not having permits. In the
              process the police in their usual high handed manner seized the cell
              phones of several protestors. It is quite clear that seizure of their
              personal belongings was clearly illegal. Their cell phones had no
              evidentiary value in the alleged offence of assembling without a
              permit. So naturally they went to his office to demand the return of
              the items. I am sorry to hear that they left the premises. They should
              have refused to go until their personal possessions were returned. The
              Singapore Attorney General was clearly abusing the law and the people
              have to right to complain.<br><br>He then refers to the Kangaroo T
              shirt case where 3 activists, John Tan, Shafi and Izrizal were charged
              and convicted and sent to jail for wearing T shirts with the image of a
              kangaroo in judicial robes to the court case where Lee Kuan Yew, the
              Singapore strongman was suing Dr. Chee Soon Juan before the government
              stooge Judge Belinda Ang. There was nothing wrong in their actions,
              simply because their implying that Judge Ang was biased and corrupt was
              completely true, as anyone in court that day, like I was will confirm.
              In any case, this was a clear exercise of one's right to freedom of
              speech.<br><br>And then there was the reference to me. He says that I
              had sent various Emails to various people in Singapore stating that
              Judge Belinda Ang, the offending judge, in the case of Lee Kuan Yew
              against Dr. Chee Soon Juan had "prostituted herself" in those
              proceedings. A state owned and controlled newspaper like Pravda or the
              Singapore Straits Times is free to report anything they want, since
              they are only accountable to Lee Kuan Yew and no one else. Let me tell
              you that Singapore Attorney General is not being truthful when he said
              this. In fact, what is worse, it is probably he himself or his agent
              under his instruction that sent any Emails to anyone, if in fact they
              were sent.<br><br>Let me remind the reader of what happened. On the
              29th of May 2008, after I had attended the shameful spectacle of a
              trial between Lee Kuan Yew and Dr. Chee Soon Juan where Judge Belinda
              Ang appeared no longer in her role as a judge but as an employee of Lee
              Kuan Yew and his son, permitting them to get away with whatever they
              wanted, I wrote a blog post in this blog saying among other things that
              "she prostituted her position as a judge" see <a href="http://singaporedissident.blogspot.com/2008/05/singapore-judge-belinda-angs-kangaroo.html">Singapore. Judge Belinda Ang's Kangaroo Court</a>.
              This is factually correct. On May 31, 2008, I was arrested by a party
              of police led by ASP Abdul Razak Zakaria from Central Police Station.
              At the time of arrest, he confiscated a note book from my hotel room in
              which there was my Email password for my Email <a href="mailto:nair.gopalan@yahoo.com">nair.gopalan@yahoo.com</a>.
              He then charges me with sending Emails to various people including this
              judge. Since I did not send any Emails to anyone, it was very probably
              the Attorney General himself who had the conduct of my arrest who sent
              these Emails. I never sent any emails to anyone. I wrote the blog. If
              he is the one who actually sent these Emails himself, and now publicly
              claims that I did, he shows an ability to stoop lower than even perhaps
              Adolf Hitler could. Of course, he can say anything he wants and
              Singaporeâs state controlled press will report any lie that he utters.<br><br>And then he correctly says that I had re-posted the articles from the US but does not say which they are. As to the blog post <a href="http://singaporedissident.blogspot.com/2008/05/singapore-judge-belinda-angs-kangaroo.html">Singapore. Judge Belinda Ang's Kangaroo Court</a> , for which I was charged, this was never deleted by me. So there was
              no question of re-posting as it was always up on my blog. There were 2
              other blog posts which I had deleted which referred to my other case
              where I was falsely accused of disorderly behavior by the Attorney
              General, which I had deleted on orders of the judge. I had no intention
              of keeping my undertaking to judiciary which is devoid of all integrity
              and thus my re-posting them the moment I stepped foot on American soil.<br><br>At
              one point he refers to an attempt by activists to change the laws by
              extra judicial means. Well, Mr. Attorney General, you are both right
              and wrong. Yes, I am trying to change Singapore's laws, but wrong when
              you say it is by extra judicial means. Peaceful protest and criticism
              are lawful means to bring about change. It is a right enshrined in the
              Constitution. Nothing extra judicial about it at all.<br><br>He refers
              to a deliberate attempt to force change in the law. Yes you are right.
              Dr. Chee Soon Juan, the activists, I and anyone else who knows
              Singapore understands that as matters rest, it is impossible to remove
              the dictatorship and restore democracy in Singapore through the ballot
              box. Mugabe of Zimbabwe, Than Swe of Burma, Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore
              and you the Attorney General know that if you give your people their
              constitutional rights, you would no longer be in power. So Mugabe and
              Than Swe use brute force to bring their people to heel. You do the same
              thing, except that you do it by abusing the law.<br><br>You then use
              that very law you abuse and insist that the people should obey the law.
              What law, Mr. Attorney general? It is a law stood on its head. It is
              not a law that anyone should obey. It is not just a right but the duty
              of every Singaporean to break it and break it with pride.<br><br>Let me
              say finally to your Chief Justice, to you Attorney General and to the
              newly appointed Minister for Law, Shanmugam, that there are just laws
              and unjust laws. Just laws must be followed and unjust laws should be
              broken. And that is the duty of every man woman and child in that
              island.<br><br>And this blog is inspiring many in Singapore to do just
              that. I know of more than one young man who have said enough is enough
              and joined the growing number of Singaporean activists to stand up to
              this railroading over them. And it is my hope that many more will
              realize this hogwash being purveyed by Lee Kuan Yew and stand up to
              what is right.<br><br>Gopalan Nair</p>

              <h3><a rel="nofollow" href="http://singaporedissident.blogspot.com/2009/01/singapores-state-controlled-newspaper.html">Singapore's state controlled newspaper Straits Times
              of Jan 4, 2009 reports "Law Won't tolerate attacks"</a></h3>
              <p><em>Readers of this blog who are unfamiliar with the goings on
              in Lee Kuan Yew's Singapore, may think reading the comments that
              there are many who think Singapore is a democracy based on the rule
              of law. The reader is warned that they may be Singapore government
              employees whose job is to discredit those who criticize Lee Kuan
              Yew's authoritarian rule. Please use your discretion as to how much
              weight you will give these comments.</em><br> <br> Ladies and Gentlemen,<br> <br> The headline news of Singaporeâs state controlled newspaper Straits
              Times June 4, 2008 reads "Law wonât tolerate attacks". In Burma
              too, I am sure the law won't tolerate any attacks. And neither
              would any attacks be tolerated in North Korea.<br> <br> One thing is clear to me. That is, just as they do in Burma,
              Singapore finds itself in governance by one thing and one thing
              alone; that is fear. This front page article in Singapore's state
              controlled newspaper has one purpose and one purpose alone. To
              intimidate and frighten the pants off every Singaporean from
              criticizing the judges no matter what they do. They are free to
              abuse the law any which way they want, but no one should dare so
              much as raise a whimper.<br> <br> And this clearly shows one thing. They are clutching at straws.
              They know the winds are changing. They know the people want more
              accountability from their courts. They know the disaffection among
              the people against the abuse of the law. And they are determined to
              do the one thing which they know, which is, punish any critic, any
              dissenter, who complains.<br> <br> Such desperation may work in societies like Burma where
              impoverished peasants have no means to resist. The country declines
              into poverty but the military junta remain in power through illegal
              drug money. This is not something that will work in Singapore where
              the people are better able to fend for themselves, with education,
              skills and money. This desperate act on their part will turn
              counter productive. With open borders unlike Burma, the skilled are
              able to leave, which they are already doing now. The sooner they
              realize this, the better not only for them, but for the people of
              Singapore.<br> <br> The Chief Justice and the Attorney General in the report based on
              their speech at the opening of the legal year had said "they would
              not brook any attacks on the courts here". And why not? Surely the
              Law Courts exist on Singapore taxpayerâs money, don't they? And if
              so, why should not a citizen have the right to "attack" a judge
              when there is misuse of the law? No one should be intimidated by
              this arrogance of these judges. Everyone has a right to criticize
              the judiciary or any other branch of the government. This is what
              free speech is all about. And I will do it as many times as I
              want.<br> <br> The Chief Justice, Chan Sek Keong says that "the mission of the
              courts requires that its authority be respected by all". But how
              can anyone respect it if throughout its history under Lee Kuan Yew
              it has been nothing more than a tool to silence and punish those
              who oppose him. What about the numerous cases against the late JB
              Jeyaretnam where the courts systematically abused the law to
              bankrupt him and kick him out of Parliament and his law practice
              for merely engaging in legitimate criticisms? How does one respect
              such a judiciary? And what about Dr. Chee Soon Juan, hounded and
              bankrupted for doing what any citizen of any democratic country is
              entitled to do, that is to criticize? How is it possible to respect
              it? And how is it possible for me to respect it when they sent me
              to jail for 3 months, for doing just that; criticism? Can I put it
              this way? I respect the institution of the judiciary. But I have no
              iota of respect for the individuals who hold that office in
              Singapore. They are one corrupt lot, and they should be told
              exactly that.<br> <br> He then goes on to say that the governance of the country and the
              rule of law require that no one should be allowed to scandalize the
              judiciary. My dear Chan Sek Keong, let us not play with words here.
              Lee Kuan Yew has abused the Constitution and whittled it down to
              such an extent that Singapore in effect has no Constitution at all.
              Let's face it, my dear Chan Sek Keong. And let me tell you what I
              am saying. The Singapore Constitution guarantees free speech. And
              therefore illegal laws which Lee Kuan Yew has in place which
              requires a permit to speak publicly is void and illegal. Any first
              year law student should be able to tell you that. No one has made
              any false or scandalous allegations here. All we are doing is to
              call a rat by its true name, which is a rat.<br> <br> I should tell Chan Sek Keong this. What you are doing is to defend
              the indefensible. Plain and simply put, your laws relating to
              defamation of character, contempt of court and the laws that
              require permits for public speaking and public assembly are plain
              and simply wrong. And what you are doing is to continue in your
              abuse of the law by convicting people who are engaging in nothing
              more than their constitutional rights.<br> <br> The report refers to Walter Woon the Attorney General speaking
              about the need to protect the legal system. My question to him is
              this. If the legal system has lost all integrity, what is left to
              protect?<br> <br> He then goes on to say that there is a campaign both in Singapore
              and abroad to attack the integrity and independence of the
              judiciary. What made him think that? As far as one can see, foreign
              newspapers and myself have only reported on what we saw, which is
              that Singaporeâs judges have become corrupt and are using the law
              to prop up the rule of Lee Kuan Yew. And punishing someone who says
              it, which is entirely true, cannot amount to anything
              illegal.<br> <br> He then says that critics of the Singapore judiciary have been
              charged for undermining the judiciary for political and ideological
              reasons. I don't know where he got the idea, but in any case, there
              is nothing wrong in attacking the courts either for political or
              ideological reasons. Democracy is a political or ideological cause.
              And democracy demands that the judges are fair and just, not
              stooges of Lee Kuan Yew. Dictatorship is also a political or
              ideological cause and I am entitled to resist a judicial system
              which is determined to further such an ideology as in Singapore, a
              dictatorship.<br> <br> Singapore's Attorney General refers to an instance where activists
              had gone to his office and refused to leave until their possessions
              which were illegally seized by the police were returned to them.
              What happened is this. Peaceful protestors had assembled before
              Singapore Parliament demanding that the government show some
              concern for the plight of ordinary Singaporeans who were in
              poverty. As they did not have any permits to assemble, since the
              police would not give it to them, the police arrested them for not
              having permits. In the process the police in their usual high
              handed manner seized the cell phones of several protestors. It is
              quite clear that seizure of their personal belongings was clearly
              illegal. Their cell phones had no evidentiary value in the alleged
              offence of assembling without a permit. So naturally they went to
              his office to demand the return of the items. I am sorry to hear
              that they left the premises. They should have refused to go until
              their personal possessions were returned. The Singapore Attorney
              General was clearly abusing the law and the people have to right to
              complain.<br> <br> He then refers to the Kangaroo T shirt case where 3 activists, John
              Tan, Shafi and Izrizal were charged and convicted and sent to jail
              for wearing T shirts with the image of a kangaroo in judicial robes
              to the court case where Lee Kuan Yew, the Singapore strongman was
              suing Dr. Chee Soon Juan before the government stooge Judge Belinda
              Ang. There was nothing wrong in their actions, simply because their
              implying that Judge Ang was biased and corrupt was completely true,
              as anyone in court that day, like I was will confirm. In any case,
              this was a clear exercise of one's right to freedom of
              speech.<br> <br> And then there was the reference to me. He says that I had sent
              various Emails to various people in Singapore stating that Judge
              Belinda Ang, the offending judge, in the case of Lee Kuan Yew
              against Dr. Chee Soon Juan had "prostituted herself" in those
              proceedings. A state owned and controlled newspaper like Pravda or
              the Singapore Straits Times is free to report anything they want,
              since they are only accountable to Lee Kuan Yew and no one else.
              Let me tell you that Singapore Attorney General is not being
              truthful when he said this. In fact, what is worse, it is probably
              he himself or his agent under his instruction that sent any Emails
              to anyone, if in fact they were sent.<br> <br> Let me remind the reader of what happened. On the 29th of May 2008,
              after I had attended the shameful spectacle of a trial between Lee
              Kuan Yew and Dr. Chee Soon Juan where Judge Belinda Ang appeared no
              longer in her role as a judge but as an employee of Lee Kuan Yew
              and his son, permitting them to get away with whatever they wanted,
              I wrote a blog post in this blog saying among other things that
              "she prostituted her position as a judge" see <a rel="nofollow" href="http://singaporedissident.blogspot.com/2008/05/singapore-judge-belinda-angs-kangaroo.html">Singapore. Judge Belinda Ang's Kangaroo Court</a>.
              This is factually correct. On May 31, 2008, I was arrested by a
              party of police led by ASP Abdul Razak Zakaria from Central Police
              Station. At the time of arrest, he confiscated a note book from my
              hotel room in which there was my Email password for my Email
              <a rel="nofollow" href="mailto:nair.gopalan@yahoo.com">nair.gopalan@yahoo.com</a>. He then charges me with
              sending Emails to various people including this judge. Since I did
              not send any Emails to anyone, it was very probably the Attorney
              General himself who had the conduct of my arrest who sent these
              Emails. I never sent any emails to anyone. I wrote the blog. If he
              is the one who actually sent these Emails himself, and now publicly
              claims that I did, he shows an ability to stoop lower than even
              perhaps Adolf Hitler could. Of course, he can say anything he wants
              and Singaporeâs state controlled press will report any lie that he
              utters.<br> <br> And then he correctly says that I had re-posted the articles from
              the US but does not say which they are. As to the blog post
              <a rel="nofollow" href="http://singaporedissident.blogspot.com/2008/05/singapore-judge-belinda-angs-kangaroo.html">Singapore. Judge Belinda Ang's Kangaroo Court</a> ,
              for which I was charged, this was never deleted by me. So there was
              no question of re-posting as it was always up on my blog. There
              were 2 other blog posts which I had deleted which referred to my
              other case where I was falsely accused of disorderly behavior by
              the Attorney General, which I had deleted on orders of the judge. I
              had no intention of keeping my undertaking to judiciary which is
              devoid of all integrity and thus my re-posting them the moment I
              stepped foot on American soil.<br> <br> At one point he refers to an attempt by activists to change the
              laws by extra judicial means. Well, Mr. Attorney General, you are
              both right and wrong. Yes, I am trying to change Singapore's laws,
              but wrong when you say it is by extra judicial means. Peaceful
              protest and criticism are lawful means to bring about change. It is
              a right enshrined in the Constitution. Nothing extra judicial about
              it at all.<br> <br> He refers to a deliberate attempt to force change in the law. Yes
              you are right. Dr. Chee Soon Juan, the activists, I and anyone else
              who knows Singapore understands that as matters rest, it is
              impossible to remove the dictatorship and restore democracy in
              Singapore through the ballot box. Mugabe of Zimbabwe, Than Swe of
              Burma, Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore and you the Attorney General know
              that if you give your people their constitutional rights, you would
              no longer be in power. So Mugabe and Than Swe use brute force to
              bring their people to heel. You do the same thing, except that you
              do it by abusing the law.<br> <br> You then use that very law you abuse and insist that the people
              should obey the law. What law, Mr. Attorney general? It is a law
              stood on its head. It is not a law that anyone should obey. It is
              not just a right but the duty of every Singaporean to break it and
              break it with pride.<br> <br> Let me say finally to your Chief Justice, to you Attorney General
              and to the newly appointed Minister for Law, Shanmugam, that there
              are just laws and unjust laws. Just laws must be followed and
              unjust laws should be broken. And that is the duty of every man
              woman and child in that island.<br> <br> And this blog is inspiring many in Singapore to do just that. I
              know of more than one young man who have said enough is enough and
              joined the growing number of Singaporean activists to stand up to
              this railroading over them. And it is my hope that many more will
              realize this hogwash being purveyed by Lee Kuan Yew and stand up to
              what is right.<br> <br> Gopalan Nair</p>

              <h3><a rel="nofollow" href="http://singaporedissident.blogspot.com/2009/01/singapores-state-controlled-newspaper.html">Singapore's state controlled newspaper Straits Times of Jan 4, 2009 reports "Law Won't tolerate attacks"</a></h3>
              <p><em>Readers of this blog who are unfamiliar with the goings on in Lee Kuan Yew's Singapore, may think reading the comments that there are many who think Singapore is a democracy based on the rule of law. The reader is warned that they may be Singapore government employees whose job is to discredit those who criticize Lee Kuan Yew's authoritarian rule. Please use your discretion as to how much weight you will give these comments.</em><br><br>Ladies and Gentlemen,<br><br>The headline news of Singaporeâs state controlled newspaper Straits Times June 4, 2008 reads "Law wonât tolerate attacks". In Burma too, I am sure the law won't tolerate any attacks. And neither would any attacks be tolerated in North Korea.<br><br>One thing is clear to me. That is, just as they do in Burma, Singapore finds itself in governance by one thing and one thing alone; that is fear. This front page article in Singapore's state controlled newspaper has one purpose and one purpose alone. To intimidate and frighten the pants off every Singaporean from criticizing the judges no matter what they do. They are free to abuse the law any which way they want, but no one should dare so much as raise a whimper.<br><br>And this clearly shows one thing. They are clutching at straws. They know the winds are changing. They know the people want more accountability from their courts. They know the disaffection among the people against the abuse of the law. And they are determined to do the one thing which they know, which is, punish any critic, any dissenter, who complains.<br><br>Such desperation may work in societies like Burma where impoverished peasants have no means to resist. The country declines into poverty but the military junta remain in power through illegal drug money. This is not something that will work in Singapore where the people are better able to fend for themselves, with education, skills and money. This desperate act on their part will turn counter productive. With open borders unlike Burma, the skilled are able to leave, which they are already doing now. The sooner they realize this, the better not only for them, but for the people of Singapore.<br><br>The Chief Justice and the Attorney General in the report based on their speech at the opening of the legal year had said "they would not brook any attacks on the courts here". And why not? Surely the Law Courts exist on Singapore taxpayerâs money, don't they? And if so, why should not a citizen have the right to "attack" a judge when there is misuse of the law? No one should be intimidated by this arrogance of these judges. Everyone has a right to criticize the judiciary or any other branch of the government. This is what free speech is all about. And I will do it as many times as I want.<br><br>The Chief Justice, Chan Sek Keong says that "the mission of the courts requires that its authority be respected by all". But how can anyone respect it if throughout its history under Lee Kuan Yew it has been nothing more than a tool to silence and punish those who oppose him. What about the numerous cases against the late JB Jeyaretnam where the courts systematically abused the law to bankrupt him and kick him out of Parliament and his law practice for merely engaging in legitimate criticisms? How does one respect such a judiciary? And what about Dr. Chee Soon Juan, hounded and bankrupted for doing what any citizen of any democratic country is entitled to do, that is to criticize? How is it possible to respect it? And how is it possible for me to respect it when they sent me to jail for 3 months, for doing just that; criticism? Can I put it this way? I respect the institution of the judiciary. But I have no iota of respect for the individuals who hold that office in Singapore. They are one corrupt lot, and they should be told exactly that.<br><br>He then goes on to say that the governance of the country and the rule of law require that no one should be allowed to scandalize the judiciary. My dear Chan Sek Keong, let us not play with words here. Lee Kuan Yew has abused the Constitution and whittled it down to such an extent that Singapore in effect has no Constitution at all. Let's face it, my dear Chan Sek Keong. And let me tell you what I am saying. The Singapore Constitution guarantees free speech. And therefore illegal laws which Lee Kuan Yew has in place which requires a permit to speak publicly is void and illegal. Any first year law student should be able to tell you that. No one has made any false or scandalous allegations here. All we are doing is to call a rat by its true name, which is a rat.<br><br>I should tell Chan Sek Keong this. What you are doing is to defend the indefensible. Plain and simply put, your laws relating to defamation of character, contempt of court and the laws that require permits for public speaking and public assembly are plain and simply wrong. And what you are doing is to continue in your abuse of the law by convicting people who are engaging in nothing more than their constitutional rights.<br><br>The report refers to Walter Woon the Attorney General speaking about the need to protect the legal system. My question to him is this. If the legal system has lost all integrity, what is left to protect?<br><br>He then goes on to say that there is a campaign both in Singapore and abroad to attack the integrity and independence of the judiciary. What made him think that? As far as one can see, foreign newspapers and myself have only reported on what we saw, which is that Singaporeâs judges have become corrupt and are using the law to prop up the rule of Lee Kuan Yew. And punishing someone who says it, which is entirely true, cannot amount to anything illegal.<br><br>He then says that critics of the Singapore judiciary have been charged for undermining the judiciary for political and ideological reasons. I don't know where he got the idea, but in any case, there is nothing wrong in attacking the courts either for political or ideological reasons. Democracy is a political or ideological cause. And democracy demands that the judges are fair and just, not stooges of Lee Kuan Yew. Dictatorship is also a political or ideological cause and I am entitled to resist a judicial system which is determined to further such an ideology as in Singapore, a dictatorship.<br><br>Singapore's Attorney General refers to an instance where activists had gone to his office and refused to leave until their possessions which were illegally seized by the police were returned to them. What happened is this. Peaceful protestors had assembled before Singapore Parliament demanding that the government show some concern for the plight of ordinary Singaporeans who were in poverty. As they did not have any permits to assemble, since the police would not give it to them, the police arrested them for not having permits. In the process the police in their usual high handed manner seized the cell phones of several protestors. It is quite clear that seizure of their personal belongings was clearly illegal. Their cell phones had no evidentiary value in the alleged offence of assembling without a permit. So naturally they went to his office to demand the return of the items. I am sorry to hear that they left the premises. They should have refused to go until their personal possessions were returned. The Singapore Attorney General was clearly abusing the law and the people have to right to complain.<br><br>He then refers to the Kangaroo T shirt case where 3 activists, John Tan, Shafi and Izrizal were charged and convicted and sent to jail for wearing T shirts with the image of a kangaroo in judicial robes to the court case where Lee Kuan Yew, the Singapore strongman was suing Dr. Chee Soon Juan before the government stooge Judge Belinda Ang. There was nothing wrong in their actions, simply because their implying that Judge Ang was biased and corrupt was completely true, as anyone in court that day, like I was will confirm. In any case, this was a clear exercise of one's right to freedom of speech.<br><br>And then there was the reference to me. He says that I had sent various Emails to various people in Singapore stating that Judge Belinda Ang, the offending judge, in the case of Lee Kuan Yew against Dr. Chee Soon Juan had "prostituted herself" in those proceedings. A state owned and controlled newspaper like Pravda or the Singapore Straits Times is free to report anything they want, since they are only accountable to Lee Kuan Yew and no one else. Let me tell you that Singapore Attorney General is not being truthful when he said this. In fact, what is worse, it is probably he himself or his agent under his instruction that sent any Emails to anyone, if in fact they were sent.<br><br>Let me remind the reader of what happened. On the 29th of May 2008, after I had attended the shameful spectacle of a trial between Lee Kuan Yew and Dr. Chee Soon Juan where Judge Belinda Ang appeared no longer in her role as a judge but as an employee of Lee Kuan Yew and his son, permitting them to get away with whatever they wanted, I wrote a blog post in this blog saying among other things that "she prostituted her position as a judge" see <a rel="nofollow" href="http://singaporedissident.blogspot.com/2008/05/singapore-judge-belinda-angs-kangaroo.html">Singapore. Judge Belinda Ang's Kangaroo Court</a>. This is factually correct. On May 31, 2008, I was arrested by a party of police led by ASP Abdul Razak Zakaria from Central Police Station. At the time of arrest, he confiscated a note book from my hotel room in which there was my Email password for my Email <a rel="nofollow" href="mailto:nair.gopalan@yahoo.com">nair.gopalan@yahoo.com</a>. He then charges me with sending Emails to various people including this judge. Since I did not send any Emails to anyone, it was very probably the Attorney General himself who had the conduct of my arrest who sent these Emails. I never sent any emails to anyone. I wrote the blog. If he is the one who actually sent these Emails himself, and now publicly claims that I did, he shows an ability to stoop lower than even perhaps Adolf Hitler could. Of course, he can say anything he wants and Singaporeâs state controlled press will report any lie that he utters.<br><br>And then he correctly says that I had re-posted the articles from the US but does not say which they are. As to the blog post <a rel="nofollow" href="http://singaporedissident.blogspot.com/2008/05/singapore-judge-belinda-angs-kangaroo.html">Singapore. Judge Belinda Ang's Kangaroo Court</a> , for which I was charged, this was never deleted by me. So there was no question of re-posting as it was always up on my blog.

Peaceful protest and criticism are lawful means to bring about change. It is a right enshrined in the Constitution. Nothing extra judicial about it at all.<br><br>He refers to a deliberate attempt to force change in the law. Yes you are right. Dr. Chee Soon Juan, the activists, I and anyone else who knows Singapore understands that as matters rest, it is impossible to remove the dictatorship and restore democracy in Singapore through the ballot box. Mugabe of Zimbabwe, Than Swe of Burma, Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore and you the Attorney General know that if you give your people their constitutional rights, you would no longer be in power. So Mugabe and Than Swe use brute force to bring their people to heel. You do the same thing, except that you do it by abusing the law.<br><br>You then use that very law you abuse and insist that the people should obey the law. What law, Mr. Attorney general?

Just laws must be followed and unjust laws should be broken. And that is the duty of every man woman and child in that island.<br><br>And this blog is inspiring many in Singapore to do just that. I know of more than one young man who have said enough is enough and joined the growing number of Singaporean activists to stand up to this railroading over them. And it is my hope that many more will realize this hogwash being purveyed by Lee Kuan Yew and stand up to what is right.<br><br>Gopalan Nair</p>

              <p>Ladies and Gentlemen,<br><br>The first thing to do in a battle, is to
                  soften the ground, before the attack. Artillery fire, rockets and
                  mortar. And when the enemy is weakened, you launch the attack. This is
                  no different in politics, and this is exactly what Dr. <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_0" class="blsp-spelling-error">Chee</span> Soon Juan is doing now.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>In a sustained concerted and concentrated effort, he demolishes Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_1" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew by exposing his repression, his dirty tricks, his abuse of the law
                  through his blog, through his actions in court and through the
                  punishment he takes at the hands of his oppressor. And slowly and
                  surely, day after day, more and more Singaporeans become aware of the
                  lack of justice and fairness in their country.</strong></span></p>
              <p>And progressively Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_2" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew loses all moral authority to rule. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>People become aware that
                  Singapore is a morally bankrupt country, a country where the laws are
                  abused at will to destroy critics, where the government is corrupt
                  paying themselves millions while the poor teeter on the poverty line,
                  and where human rights are literally non existent.</strong></span><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br>And as time progresses, as more and more people begin to hate Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_3" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew and his millionaire ministers, the country becomes ripe for change.
                  There is a simmering of discontent under the surface only to erupt when
                  the time is right.</strong></span><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>And the right time is when Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_4" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew dies.</strong></span> He is presently 85 and is kept alive with a battery powered
                  pacemaker next to his heart.</p>
              <p>It was reported that he is suffering from
                  irregular heartbeat. I saw him in Judge Belinda <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_5" class="blsp-spelling-error">Ang's</span> court in Singapore from May 26, 2008 to May 28, 2008 which resulted in
                  my unexpected arrest and imprisonment for criticizing her conduct.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> He
                  appeared very weak, with some difficulty walked from the courtroom door
                  to the witness box, with some effort sat down. He did not appear very
                  sound in health.</strong></span><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>With his death, something has to give, there is
                  no doubt about it.</strong></span> I think he knows it too. His greatest mistake is to
                  have chosen the sort of ministers presently with him.</p>
              <p>His son, he
                  appoints prime minister, an obedient child who obeyed his father,
                  passed all his exams and selected first as the highest ranking officer
                  in the army and immediately thereafter, Prime Minister. He has not been
                  leader of anything, not accomplished anything and no one knows anything
                  about him except that he is the Prime Ministers son.<br><br>Law Minister <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_6" class="blsp-spelling-error">Shanmugam</span> was not too long ago, a lawyer in Allen and <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_7" class="blsp-spelling-error">Gledhill</span>, after which we were told that he is now Minister for Law. <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_8" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">No one</span> had any say in it and no one cares. Had he been selling Indian pancakes in a dhoti in <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_9" class="blsp-spelling-error">Serangoon</span> Road, no one would have cared either. I suppose he loves no one, and no one loves him either.<br><br>All of Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_10" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew's ministers are handpicked men whose principle qualification is to
                  do exactly what he tells them. We have no idea as to their principles,
                  convictions and philosophy. Very probably they have none of those. They
                  are there for only one reason, because the pay is good, and because
                  there is Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_11" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew, the 85 year old octogenarian to protect them.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>But everything will change when Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_12" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew dies. Lee knows this too.</strong></span> And that is why his many references to
                  the secrets of longevity, clearly shows that he fears what will happen
                  when he dies. So his desperate efforts to keep living one extra day at
                  a time. But this fear of death, will itself cause him to die sooner
                  than later. The obsession to stay alive will itself turn into a killer.
                  So I expect him to be saying goodbye very soon.<br><br>And that is why I say they should be packing. Judge Belinda <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_13" class="blsp-spelling-error">Ang</span>,
                  if she knew what was best for her, should pack her suitcases and leave.
                  If she does not, the people might want to know why she deliberately
                  abuses the law to punish Lee's critics.</p>
              <p>And knowing what she has done,
                  it will be difficult to come up with an answer satisfactory to the
                  people. Not knowing whether Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_14" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew will live one week or one year, his days are numbered and the time of reckoning is also numbered for Judge Belinda <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_15" class="blsp-spelling-error">Ang</span>.<br><br>Judge Judith <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_16" class="blsp-spelling-error">Prakash</span>, Judge Kan Ting <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_17" class="blsp-spelling-error">Chiu</span>, <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_18" class="blsp-spelling-error">DSP</span> Mohamed <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_19" class="blsp-spelling-error">Hassan</span>, ASP Abdul <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_20" class="blsp-spelling-error">Razak</span> <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_21" class="blsp-spelling-error">Zakaria</span>, Judge <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_22" class="blsp-spelling-error">VK</span> Rajah, <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_23" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kalaselvi</span> d/o <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_24" class="blsp-spelling-error">Rengasamy</span> of the Bankruptcy office and the list goes on.</p>
              <p>If I were them, I would ask <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_25" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">myself</span> one question. Is it safe? Is it safe to continue misusing the law to please Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_26" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew, when he is just about to die. Will the people hold men and women
                  who oppress their fellow citizens to account when the time comes? These
                  men and women who please Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_27" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew for money should, if they were smart, start thinking about their
                  actions, and whether it is safe to go on as they have done so far.<br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br>And in the meantime, as Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_28" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew takes one more step to his grave, Dr. <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_29" class="blsp-spelling-error">Chee</span><span id="SPELLING_ERROR_30" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew is nothing but one <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_31" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">corrupt</span> dictator, who is propped up by minions such as Judge Belinda <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_32" class="blsp-spelling-error">Ang</span>, who do it for money.</strong> <strong>Soon Juan and the other brave activists continue to spread the message throughout the island that Lee </strong></span><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>I

                  with the expected irrational actions of this government, we expect the
                  minions of the dead Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_33" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew to arrest them.

                  Perhaps they would not insist that she get into a coffin. But I don't
                  think they will let her go scot free either.<br><br>Gopalan Nair</p>

              <p><br>Well yes.Â  So you are the 40 year old man of some Adrain Lim who listened to complaints about his ex wife to you and then decide that you want to cause trouble to that ex wife who would by chance be your ex neighbour?</p>
              <p>And it was understood that you suffered no damage, but is keen to have the adrain's ex wife damged in reputation and whatever you think its important to her.</p>
              <p>And suing you?Â  Me?Â  nah....I merely offered to supplied $$$ to the ex wife to sue you and adrian for being such ignorant about how your ex neighbour is truly is.</p>
              <p>Might be interesting to do before I die wouldnt it.</p>
