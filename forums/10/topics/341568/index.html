              <h3 class="post-title entry-title">Singapore's lawyers</h3>
              <p>Ladies and Gentlemen,<br><br>Singapore's lawyers dress in their traditional black suits <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_0" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">pulling</span> formal leather <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_1" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">briefcases</span> <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_2" class="blsp-spelling-error">looking</span> all serious and hurrying in and out of <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_3" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">Singapore</span> courtrooms. You cannot be faulted if you believed that they were real lawyers. Sadly, except for their <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_4" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">outward</span> appearance, they are far from lawyers in the real sense. Truly, they
              are not in a position to further the interests of their client one bit,
              except with the <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_5" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">agreement</span> of Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_6" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew and his complaint judges. They are helpless in furthering the law.
              They can go through the motions, but truly, the law is Lee unto
              himself, through the medium of his willing judge.<br><br>Any red blooded lawyer in this situation would have protested to high Heaven and demanded <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_7" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">that</span> the law should rule, not Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_8" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew. But not in <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_9" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">Singapore</span>.
              In Singapore, the lawyers themselves are terrified of him and therefore
              their main purpose is to stay out of prison and earn a living, <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_10" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">because</span> to demand that the law be upheld would mean ruination in every sense of the word.<br><br>I had to remain in <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_11" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">Singapore</span> for 6 <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_12" class="blsp-spelling-error">months</span>, 2 of which I spent in <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_13" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">prison</span> for writing an article critical of one of his judges. During the <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_14" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">rest</span> of the time, I spent a great deal of time in court defending myself, where I met many lawyers going about their work.<br><br>One of the <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_15" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">lawyers</span> I met, whom I knew from the days I practiced in Singapore was G. <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_16" class="blsp-spelling-error">Raman</span>. The meeting with him was short. I asked him <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_17" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">whether</span> he was aware of the abuse of the legal system by Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_18" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew and what was he doing about it. He answered me with a question. He asked me <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_19" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">whether</span> I wished that he should lose his house, meaning of course that if he challenged Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_20" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew, he would be sued and would have to sell his house to pay him. And then he promptly left, wearing his black suit and <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_21" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">tie</span> and pulling a large bag with many files in it, looking very intelligent and wise.<br><br><span class="blsp-spelling-error">Another</span> lawyer I spoke to in court was <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_23" class="blsp-spelling-error">Mangalam</span> <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_24" class="blsp-spelling-error">Amaladass</span>. To the same question, he had nothing to say, and after that meeting he never spoke to me again when I met him.<br><br>If
              there is one profession that should be ashamed of themselves, it is the
              lawyers. It is they who have intimate knowledge of the law, the
              importance of the <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_25" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">Constitution</span>,
              and the need to uphold it. It is upon their shoulders that lie this
              burden by the very fact they are lawyers. And it is very sad to see
              their complete abdication of their duty to their calling.<br><br>Dr. <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_26" class="blsp-spelling-error">Chee</span> Soon Juan has to fight his cases himself because no <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_27" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">Singapore</span> lawyer is <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_28" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">prepared</span> to represent him. <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_29" class="blsp-spelling-error">Chia</span> Ti Lick, solicitor, is one lawyer who is <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_30" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">prepared</span> to do it, and we give him credit for it. But understandably he too is <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_31" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">constrained</span> from going the full extent of calling a rat a rat. He has to moderate his arguments, making sure that it will not invite the <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_32" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">wrath</span> of Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_33" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew which would be the end of his career. So in effect, sadly, someone who is being persecuted by Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_34" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew in his courts might feel it best to argue his own case, since there is <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_35" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">no one</span>; not a single lawyer who is <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_36" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">prepared</span> to say it as it should, come what may, because that is <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_37" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">what</span> the duty of a lawyer really is.<br><br>I understand the legal profession in <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_38" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">Singapore</span> is shrinking, which shows that many lawyers are unwilling to continue
              with this charade. Many are emigrating. New entrants to the profession
              are declining. We must applaud those who take this route. But it is
              those who stay behind and continue practicing without protest who must
              think of what they are doing. They must examine their conscience.
              Pretending to be lawyers, going around dressed in <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_39" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">black</span> suits and pulling bulky files in and out of courtrooms is not enough.<br><br>Gopalan Nair</p>

              <p>Ladies and Gentlemen,<br><br>On
              the 17th of September, 2008, after a trial of 8 days, Judge Kan Ting
              Chiu of the High Court Singapore found me guilty of insulting Judge
              Belinda Ang. I did no such thing, but in Singapore they can make
              anything happen. The corrupt judges are there to do anything Lee Kuan
              Yew wants. And in this case, it will please Lee to have me arrested and
              jailed for criticizing a Singapore judge. It is as you know, Lee Kuan
              Yew's Singapore. What I did was to write a blog post on the Internet
              criticizing Judge Ang for being biased in favor of Lee Kuan Yew and his
              son in their defamation case against Dr. Chee and the SDP. It was
              nothing more than an exercise of freedom of speech guaranteed to me by
              United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights.<br><br>The trial
              before Judge Kan was nothing but a show trial. The judge of course went
              through the motions of legalese and procedures. But in the end, as
              expected I was found guilty. He was not acting as a judge in a case. He
              was sending a signal on behalf of Singapore’s Lee Kuan Yew that it is
              dangerous to criticize Lee's government or his judges. I have a blog
              post just on my case here. Please read it.<br><br>My sentence was 3 months jail. I had asked for time to arrange my matters before I surrendered my person to jail.<br><br>A
              day before surrendering myself to jail, I went to see Dr. Chee Soon
              Juan at his office at Jalan Gallegos off Jalan Leban along Upper
              Thomson Road in the afternoon. We both came down to talk at a coffee
              shop below. He gave me good advice. He told me not to lose my spirit in
              jail. "Always keep your chin up" he says. "Lee Kuan Yew wants to break
              your spirit. Don’t let him", he says. “The thing that Lee hates most is
              when his victim refuses to give in”. “Never let him win”, he says. “If
              you stand tall despite the punishment, you win and he loses”. “Keep
              your spirits about you”, he says. And he finished with reminding me
              that “it is an honor to go to jail for your beliefs”. Not many in
              Singapore can claim to do that.<br><br>My request for time was granted.
              I reported to the High Court registry 3 days later on the 20th of
              September 2008 at 12 noon. I had brought along some books to read, as I
              knew that prison meant nothing to do at all every day. At the High
              Court registry I was ordered to hand over my books to the police there
              who promised to hand them to the prison and later I could receive them.<br><br>I
              was handcuffed and taken down from the 5th floor of the High court to
              street level in an elevator. 2 policemen were escorting me. At street
              level, I rode the prison van from the High Court to Queenstown Prison.
              I still had my watch with me. The time was about 2 pm. After a ride of
              about 30 minutes, I arrived at Queenstown Remand Prison.<br><br>I was
              taken to a room and asked to take off all my clothes and change into
              prison clothes which were a blue pair of shorts and a white T shirt. A
              prison warden was watching me do it. I was asked to put my own clothes
              and shoes into a container which was taken away.<br><br>I was then told
              to sit at a counter facing an officer in the next room. Here there was
              a row of about 4 counters where prison officers will carry out the
              procedures for prisoners recording their personal items for
              safekeeping. The officer was seen taking out all the items I had and
              recording them one by one; one watch, one wallet, one comb, etc. After
              recording, he takes a picture with mounted cameras of the items taken
              and they were recorded.<br><br>I was given a plastic bracelet which I
              was asked to wear. This bracelet had my prisoner number 101232008.
              Thereafter I was prisoner 101232008.<br><br>Once that was over, I was
              given a box with an open cover and a thin floor mat. In the box were
              one towel, a piece of soap in a container, a small toothpaste which had
              no fluoride and no brand which was made in China, a plastic cup and a
              soft plastic toothbrush which could be bent any way and a plastic
              container for holding water.<br><br>The warden ordered me to carry the
              floor mat and the box 4 flights of stairs to the 4th floor. My cell was
              to be cell 422 on the 4th floor A block. I entered the cell. There were
              2 other men in that cell, Mr. Pham, a Vietnamese national who was given
              50 days in jail for being a cashier for a roadside gambling operation
              in Lorong 14, Geylang and Mr. Chu, also Vietnamese, who was given 20
              days for selling duty unpaid cigarettes at Lorong 23 Geylang. Pham was
              26 years old and Chu was 36. Pham could speak a little English but Chu
              nothing at all.<br><br>The cell is about 10 feet wide and about 25 feet
              long. The ceiling was very high. There are no windows. From an opening
              covered by a mesh of about 1 foot in breath at the ceiling on the
              opposite end of the door, you could tell whether it was day or night
              because of the light from outside. There was also a similar opening
              above the door.<br><br>On the 4th floor just as in the other floors, there are a long row of cells like mine on both sides of a walkway.<br><br>The
              door of my cell occupies half the front of the cell. On the other half
              of it is an open squat down toilet. This means there is no privacy when
              you relieve yourself. You sleep on the hard cement floor on your thin
              mat. There is no bed or cushions. The sleeping was in cramped
              conditions as the floor space was small for 3 people.<br><br>The first day was hard for me. There was 8 weeks to go, and this was my first day.<br><br>Thereafter
              there was the daily routine. As you have no watch, you cannot tell the
              time. But it was roughly like this. You get up before sun up when it is
              still dark. No one wakes you up but you get into that routine. At about
              7.30 am, you hear a bell ringing five times. This means you have to
              stand up with your cell mates with your hands behind you. An officer
              passes your cell and slides open the peep hole. You then say "Good
              Morning Sir" all together.<br><br>After that you go back to sleep if
              you want. About an hour later your cell is opened by a warden. Outside
              there is another prisoner who brings a large vessel with either tea or
              coffee with bread spread thinly with either butter or jam. This
              alternates daily each day. One day, coffee with bread and jam and the
              next day, tea with bread and butter. Breakfast is the same routine day
              after day. You also take fresh water in your container that you have.
              Then your cell is locked. You eat your breakfast in your cell.<br><br>After
              your breakfast, you and your cell mates arrange each of our boxes in a
              row, one against the other, waiting for the cell to be opened again for
              you to go to the yard. Each day, we are allowed 45 minutes in a yard
              outside the cell. I was kept away from the other prisoners at all
              times. The other prisoners in the building were taken to a large yard
              where they could play games and interact with others. In my case, they
              made sure that I had no contact with the prison population. I together
              with my cell mates were taken to a special rooftop yard where there was
              no one else other than the three of us. They did not want me to speak
              to the other prisoners. They did not want the other prisoners to know
              why I was in prison.<br><br>Before we could go to the yard, we were
              subjected to an unpleasant procedure. We were required to strip naked,
              hold the T shirt in one hand and the shorts in the other, squat down
              and open your mouth while a warden watched. There was also a camera
              watching you. The reason given for this procedure was to ensure that we
              did not have any hidden contraband in any orifice or in the mouth. But
              this was demeaning. There is no way we could have any contraband since
              we were locked up 23 hours of the day and the rest of 45 minutes we
              were under guard. It is quite clear that the reason for this demeaning
              procedure was to belittle the prisoner. To humiliate him and humble him.<br><br>The
              small rooftop yard was one flight of stairs above my cell floor. After
              the 45 minutes in the yard, we were brought back to our cell. We then
              took our soap and towels and accompanied the warden to a shower. Again,
              they made sure that even my shower was separate from the other
              prisoners. We were led to a small shower room where only myself and my
              2 other cell mates had our shower.<br><br>The shower was about 15
              minutes. At the shower the warden will ask you if you need a shave. If
              so, another prisoner will bring your shaver, specially marked with your
              number. You are required to use the same razor throughout your prison
              term. Being Indian I had more facial hair than my cell mates, they
              being Vietnamese. But I never got a new razor throughout my 8 weeks in
              prison. Maybe if I asked for a new razor, I would have been given one,
              but it was not necessary.<br><br>While you shower and shave a warden will be watching you. You get used to nakedness and being constantly watched.<br><br>After
              your shower you are taken back to your cell and locked up. After about
              an hour or so, your cell door opens again and outside you find another
              prisoner with 3 trays of food and a water bucket. You take fresh water
              in your small water container and each of us bends to the ground to
              pick up our food tray. The demeaning thing about it is that a warden
              stands next to your food tray and you have to bend down to pick it up
              from his feet. As if you are bowing to him. I have no doubt they do it
              intentionally. Sometimes to avoid the humiliation of this, I used to
              pick up the food tray from the floor with my back facing the warden. I
              was not challenged for doing it that way.<br><br>Lunch was again
              routine. Sometimes you had a piece of fried fish with rice and
              vegetables which I liked the most. Other days the food was a fish cake
              or sausage or sometimes just noodles and vegetables. On occasion we had
              Nasi Lemak which was small pilchards fried and peanuts and curry paste.
              The food was all right but it wasn't good. For lunch you also had a
              fruit which was invariably an apple, an orange or a small banana.
              Almost everyday, the best thing I enjoyed was that single fruit.<br><br>About
              an hour later you hear the bells again. And you stand in a row with
              your hands behind you back to say "Good Afternoon Sir" when the peep
              hole opens on your door and the warden passes.<br><br>After about 2
              hours later the door opens again, this time for dinner. The same
              routine with changing your water bucket for fresh water and taking your
              food tray. About an hour later, you hear the bells again and you stand
              up in a row and say "Good Morning Sir" when the officer opens your peep
              hole on your door.<br><br>And then it gets dark and you go to sleep for another day of the same routine tomorrow.<br><br>You
              get a pen and paper every 14 days to write a letter to someone. After
              you have written the letter your paper and pen is taken away. The same
              happens 2 weeks later. Once I had some cancellations made in my letter
              and it was rejected and I was told to write again without erasures.
              Since I had all the time in the world with nothing to do, I read. But
              the books are not given to you immediately. You only get the books
              about 2 days after you had requested them. The reason for the 2 day
              delay is because the books have to be cleared by a censor, whatever
              that means. I read about 6 books while in jail. Had I anymore more
              books, I would have read more, but that was all I had. You see, in
              prison, there is absolutely nothing to do, being locked up 23 hours a
              day. In fact, you wouldn’t be entirely wrong if you would call it, a
              full room service hotel with no stars.<br><br>During my time there, US
              Consul Learned Dees visited me and provided consular assistance. Just
              before my release, Jamie Revitz took over from Learned Dees and met me
              twice.<br><br>On one occasion, I had told Rehabilitation Officer
              Mohammed Fahim that I was unhappy to be forced to suffer the indignity
              every day of having to strip naked before a prison warden before going
              to the yard and opening my mouth. I told him that I was contemplating
              disobeying that rule since it was totally unnecessary and demeaning of
              a human being. A little while later this officer came to see me and
              asked me to sign a disciplinary warning that I had threatened to
              disobey a prison regulation and that I was being warned for a
              violation. I refused. I said that the way the report was written did
              not reflect what actually happened.<br><br>A little while later the
              Officer Commanding of Block A, my cell block, Assistant Superintendent
              of Prisons G Savier came to see me. He is an Indian Tamil. He appeared
              to relish the fact that I was in prison because I criticized a judge. I
              told him that I refused to sign something that was inaccurate. After
              some discussion, another warden came to see me. He asked me to take my
              box from my room and follow him. He took me to another cell, where I
              was to be all alone. This cell had a camera inside. This was solitary
              confinement. He locked me inside. As I knew that I cannot win in an
              argument in prison, regardless of how right I was, I asked G. Savier if
              I could now sign whatever he wanted. I then signed the document that he
              prepared even though it was not what had actually happened. I was
              prepared to sign anything he wanted. I knew that in prison, they are
              always right. I signed it, and I was returned to my own cell with my
              cell mates. I escaped solitary.<br><br>What they are trying to do in
              prison is to humiliate you. To humble you. To make you submit. For
              instance each time an officer speaks to you, you are ordered to squat
              down on the floor. You are not allowed to speak to him standing up. I
              tried to avoid squatting on the floor as much as I can by saying that
              my foot hurt.<br><br>While in prison, I was not allowed a single
              visitor other than the US Consul, even though I gave the wardens
              several names of people that I would like a visit from. I wrote to them
              in prison stationary asking them to visit. But I was told that no one
              applied to visit me. After I was released, I found out from Singapore
              Democratic Party activists that as many as 15 people applied to visit
              me. The prison did not allow a single one. I also did not receive a
              single letter. I do not know whether it was because no one wrote to me,
              or because the prison did not give me any of the letters.<br><br>Throughout
              my time in prison of 8 weeks, I kept my spirits up. To give myself
              comfort, I thought of Nelson Mandela who had to spend 26 years in
              prison. Of Gandhi who spent many years in it. Of Dr. Chee Soon Juan. Of
              Marwan Bargouti, the Palestinian who is serving a life sentence in an
              Israeli Jail. Of Ahmed Kathrada in Robbin Island, South Africa. Of
              Steven Biko who was murdered in custody. And not forgetting Chia Thye
              Poh and Lim Chin Siong who languished for a long time in Lee Kuan Yew’s
              jails. Compared to them what was 8 weeks. Cheer up, Gopalan Nair, you
              are stronger than that, I would say.<br><br>Finally the day came for my
              release. On Nov 20, 2008 I was taken in handcuffs in a prison van to
              Immigration and Checkpoints Authority next to Lavender MRT. I was
              processed again, fingerprints taken, my pictures taken and given a
              warning by Mr. Hughes Tan who works there that I was deported from
              Singapore. I was allowed 5 days to remain in Singapore to arrange my
              affairs and to leave Singapore permanently on November 26, 2008 from
              Changi Airport. I arranged my ticket in the meantime, and then it was
              Goodbye Singapore forever. I boarded flight SQ2 enroute to Hong Kong
              and San Francisco.<br><br>I had lost a lot of weight. That was one good
              thing that came out of it. Of course, it was a great adventure. Also a
              great honor to have been in Lee Kuan Yew’s prison for a cause that I am
              proud of.<br><br>Gopalan Nair</p>
