              <p>Ten years ago, China would <span style="font-weight: bold;">NEVER Demand</span> anything from the US's military.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Today?  Things are so different now</span>.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333; font-family: tahoma; font-size: 11px; line-height: 13px;">
              </span></p><p style="margin-top: 2.5ex; margin-bottom: 2ex;">China on Tuesday demanded the United States cease what it called illegal activities in the South China Sea, as it rejected Pentagon assertions that Chinese vessels harassed a US Navy ship there.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 2.5ex; margin-bottom: 2ex;">Foreign ministry spokesman Ma Zhaoxu said US complaints that five Chinese ships had harassed a US Navy ship in the South China Sea were "totally inaccurate."</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 2.5ex; margin-bottom: 2ex;">"The US Navy ship Impeccable broke international law and Chinese laws and regulations," Ma told reporters in a news briefing.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 2.5ex; margin-bottom: 2ex;">"China has made solemn representations to the United States requesting that the US immediately stop these activities and take effective measures to avoid similar activities in the future."</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 2.5ex; margin-bottom: 2ex;">The United States said it had formally protested to Chinese authorities over Sunday's incident in the South China Sea, about 75 miles (120 kilometres) south of China's Hainan Island in international waters.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 2.5ex; margin-bottom: 2ex;">The dispute added a new dimension to fragile military relations between the world powers, which had enjoyed a brief period of slight optimism after the two held defence talks in Beijing last month.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 2.5ex; margin-bottom: 2ex;">The Pentagon said the incident saw Chinese boats move directly in front of the Impeccable, forcing it to take emergency action to avoid a collision, and then dropped pieces of wood into its path.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 2.5ex; margin-bottom: 2ex;">"This was a reckless, dangerous manoeuvre that was unprofessional" and violated international law, Defence Department spokesman Bryan Whitman told reporters on Monday.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 2.5ex; margin-bottom: 2ex;">Ma rejected that account, saying it was "absolutely unacceptable to China," although he did not provide an alternative version.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 2.5ex; margin-bottom: 2ex;">The Impeccable is a surveillance vessel designed to support anti-submarine warfare.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 2.5ex; margin-bottom: 2ex;">Ma said it violated the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea but declined to answer when repeatedly asked to specify exactly which part of the convention was broken.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 2.5ex; margin-bottom: 2ex;">The Chinese vessels included a navy intelligence ship, a government fisheries patrol vessel, a state oceanographic patrol boat and two small trawlers, the Pentagon said.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 2.5ex; margin-bottom: 2ex;">Whitman said one of the Chinese ships came within 25 feet (7.5 metres) of the Impeccable and that the Chinese crew tried to snag the cables that tow the ship's underwater sonars.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 2.5ex; margin-bottom: 2ex;">The White House demanded China respect international maritime law and said it would keep up naval operations in the area.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 2.5ex; margin-bottom: 2ex;">Beijing has long expressed its dissatisfaction with US surveillance operations by having Chinese ships and planes approach US naval ships in what it considers an "economic exclusion zone".</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 2.5ex; margin-bottom: 2ex;">The incident followed "increasingly aggressive conduct by Chinese vessels" in the past week -- with Chinese boats steaming near US ships and aircraft flying low overhead, the Pentagon's statement said.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 2.5ex; margin-bottom: 2ex;">The stand-off came after China and the United States agreed at last month's talks to resume high-level military exchanges cut off last year by China amid anger over a proposed US arms package to Beijing's diplomatic rival Taiwan.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 2.5ex; margin-bottom: 2ex;">Military ties were also strained in 2001 after the mid-air collision of a US surveillance aircraft and a Chinese fighter jet in the same area.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 2.5ex; margin-bottom: 2ex;">The collision killed the Chinese jet's pilot and the US plane was forced to make an emergency landing on Hainan. The 24-member US crew were held by China for 11 days.</p>

              <p><br>The reason was that the US ship was gathering underwater acoustical data near Hainan. Basically someform of under water spying thingy looking out for subs and potential subs ambush locations. Essentially USS impeccable was there on a military mission.</p>
              <p>The location where Impeccable was on belongs to China's economic exclusive zone. Under international marinetime law, ships have the right of innocent passage (meaning can jalan jalan sail pass) there, but are not allowed to conduct military activities.</p>

              <p><strong> Beijing raises stakes with tit-for-tat deployment in South China Sea </strong></p>
              <p>Beijing has increased tension in a disputed part of the South China Sea by
                  sending a patrol ship to protect fishing boats after the United States
                  deployed a destroyer in the area. The American move was in response to

                a U.S. military vessel lingering perilously close to a Chinese base on <a href="http://www.sunnysanya.com/images/map-sanya-china.gif">Hainan 
                Island</a>, in the South China Sea, <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/us_world/2009/03/09/2009-03-09_chinese_sailors_strip_to_underwear_after.html">reportedly</a> stripped down to their underwear when our sailors turned water hoses on them. 
                Maybe the shower facilities on Chinese fishing vessels – it was fishing trawlers, 
                not military gunboats, that met the Americans on China's doorstep – are insufficient, 
                or maybe the Chinese were mooning us. I'm inclined to think the latter. In any 
                case, Sunday's incident ratchets up tensions with China – which have been roiled 
                in recent weeks, not only by a series of <a href="http://www.fas.org/blog/ssp/2009/03/incident.php">similar</a> incidents, but also on account of issues broader than China's claims to virtually 
                the whole of the South China Sea.</p>
              <p>To begin with, the U.S. claims that the <em>USNS Impeccable</em> was manned 
                by civilians and was just going about its undefined business when, suddenly, 
                those big bad Chinese started "harassing" us – the bullies! But wait. 
                Take a <a href="http://www.fas.org/blog/ssp/2009/03/incident.php">look</a> at the <em>Impeccable</em>:</p>
              <p><img src="http://antiwar.com/justin/impeccable.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="301"></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: xx-small;"> </span></p>
              <p>This baby is 5,368 tons, and over 281 ft. long: it is a surveillance ship, 
                designed to track enemy submarines. China's contingent of nuclear-powered subs 
                are <a href="http://www.worldtribune.com/worldtribune/06/front2453955.079861111.html">reportedly</a> based at Yulin, on Hainan. And while the U.S. government maintains that the 
                crew is "civilian," <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USNS_Impeccable_%28T-AGOS-23%29">half</a> its crew are military personnel.</p>
              <p>Now look at the Chinese vessels that were supposedly "harassing" 
                this rather intimidating U.S. warship:</p>
              <p><img src="http://antiwar.com/justin/chinaboat1.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="301"></p>
              <p><img src="http://antiwar.com/justin/chinaboat2.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="253"></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: xx-small;"> </span></p>
              <p>As John Stossel would put it: Give me a break! <em>These </em>are the ships that 
                <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/7933171.stm">supposedly</a> "aggressively maneuvered" around the <em>Impeccable</em> – as the Pentagon put 
                it – "in an apparent coordinated effort to harass the U.S. ocean surveillance 
                ship while it was conducting routine operations in international waters"? 
                Behind the whiny rationale, however, lurks a damning admission: Yes, the U.S. 
                routinely spies on the Chinese, and fully expects to get away with it. After 
                all, for <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE6DD1130F93AA25751C1A96F958260">centuries</a> foreigners have been lurking on the Chinese coastline, establishing colonies 
                and warily poking and prodding the Chinese, with mostly limited responses – 
                until now...</p>

              collision, and then dropped pieces of wood into its path.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 2.5ex; margin-bottom: 2ex;">"This was a
              reckless, dangerous manoeuvre that was unprofessional" and violated
              international law, Defence Department spokesman Bryan Whitman told
              reporters on Monday.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 2.5ex; margin-bottom: 2ex;">Ma rejected that
              account, saying it was "absolutely unacceptable to China," although
              he did not provide an alternative version.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 2.5ex; margin-bottom: 2ex;">The Impeccable is
              a surveillance vessel designed to support anti-submarine
              warfare.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 2.5ex; margin-bottom: 2ex;">Ma said it
              violated the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea but
              declined to answer when repeatedly asked to specify exactly which
              part of the convention was broken.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 2.5ex; margin-bottom: 2ex;">The Chinese
              vessels included a navy intelligence ship, a government fisheries
              patrol vessel, a state oceanographic patrol boat and two small
              trawlers, the Pentagon said.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 2.5ex; margin-bottom: 2ex;">Whitman said one
              of the Chinese ships came within 25 feet (7.5 metres) of the
              Impeccable and that the Chinese crew tried to snag the cables that
              tow the ship's underwater sonars.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 2.5ex; margin-bottom: 2ex;">The White House
              demanded China respect international maritime law and said it would
              keep up naval operations in the area.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 2.5ex; margin-bottom: 2ex;">Beijing has long
              expressed its dissatisfaction with US surveillance operations by
              having Chinese ships and planes approach US naval ships in what it
              considers an "economic exclusion zone".</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 2.5ex; margin-bottom: 2ex;">The incident
              followed "increasingly aggressive conduct by Chinese vessels" in
              the past week -- with Chinese boats steaming near US ships and
              aircraft flying low overhead, the Pentagon's statement said.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 2.5ex; margin-bottom: 2ex;">The stand-off
              came after China and the United States agreed at last month's talks
              to resume high-level military exchanges cut off last year by China
              amid anger over a proposed US arms package to Beijing's diplomatic
              rival Taiwan.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 2.5ex; margin-bottom: 2ex;">Military ties
              were also strained in 2001 after the mid-air collision of a US
              surveillance aircraft and a Chinese fighter jet in the same
              area.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 2.5ex; margin-bottom: 2ex;">The collision
              killed the Chinese jet's pilot and the US plane was forced to make
              an emergency landing on Hainan. The 24-member US crew were held by
              China for 11 days.</p>
