The problem is when characters like Harimau come here to create trouble, start flame wars. As he himself said, his first post was the MAF Orbat, I've got nothing against that, but look at his follow on posts from then on. He brings up his arguments in a confrontational manner, calling us names, insulting us and I could go on and on. Well, what are we to do? I'll happily debate any topic with anyone here, with reason and civility. But if someone cannot show me the civility which I ask for, then he cannot ask that of me. If ssomeone wants to flame me and call me names, hes should be prepared to receive the same back from me.<br><br>Two sayings come to mind: If you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen, and If you want to gamble, then be prepared to lose like a man<br><br>You assert your points are correct, well, like I've challenged him on a number of issues already, show the proof. If you can show the proof to back up your point, theres nothing anyone can do to deny it. Otherwise, one would do well to keep their mouths shut.<br></div>

What we do in our country is our business. If that piece of land across the causeway likes to be a busybody, why don't she pick on someone her own size? I don't seem to recall malaysia picking on china in every domestic incident? Tell me why does it concern you when we reclaimed land within our boundary? Malaysia on the other hand deemed that it was not necessary to inform us when she did the same. Did we make any noise about it? No, we did not. That is just one of the many cases of your country being nosey.<br><br>We are not denying anything. What we are saying is that some of your arms procurement sucks and we do back up with proof. We welcome good discussion, but when a flaming start, we will go all out to make your life miserable. Maybe you did like to know, if a flame war can get so intense, think about what will happen if a real war should break out.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Post stuff with relevance, dun degrade yourself in the first place my Malaysian friends. We don't appreciate people who come in and behave as if they know everything. When I made a mistake of posting a wrong point, did i not apologise? Did i try to shift the majority to another aspect of the discussion? Now, did you apologise when clearly the facts deny your points? Sometimes yoru own facts dun correspond to what you post. You guys do not see the big picture my friends. You only view things on a 1 v 1 basis. MIG 29 vs F16, 1 on 1? MLRS and our arty, 1 on 1? Those scenarios will NEVER happen.</div>
