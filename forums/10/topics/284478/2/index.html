            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by Othello_Red:<br><strong>[b]Minister explains why bus fares cannot remain unchanged</strong><br><br>"Transport Minister Raymond Lim commented on the bus fare hike during his visit to Thomson division of Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC on Sunday, 7 Oct 07.  He urged Singaporeans not to politicise the issue.<br><br>If fares were to be frozen, the bus service standards will suffer, according to Mr Lim.  He cited other countriesÂ’ experiences and when governments give in to such pressures, the service standards would deteriorate.<br><br>The reason:  bus companies, unable to afford new buses, will have a shrinking fleet, resulting in overcrowding.  As the situation worsens, people will complain to the government, which will feel compelled to raise fares.<br><br>Freezing fares will be a popular move, but it would not be a responsible thing to do, he added.<br><br>Responding to a residentÂ’s comment that the two public-listed companies, SBS and SMRT, look out for their shareholders and not the commuters, Mr Lim said even if the government takes over the running of the public transport companies, fares will still rise, and either the user or taxpayer pays for the increase."<br><br>I wonder why the $56.1 million in net profit for FY06 is not enough for new buses? Are new busses that expensive? Maybe they are built with carbon-fiber bodies, with cutting-edge F1 technology in the engines?<br><br>It's not as if every single bus in Singapore is air-conditioned with comfy leather seats. It's not as if the bus-captains are earning ever increasing salaries. I believe the public would accept it more willingly if the reason for the raise was to better compensate the bus-captains. They aren't earning much and work long hours even on public holidays. Surely the raises should go to helping them out? Why is it ending up in retained earnings then?<br><br>Seriously, with replies like this, they are really inviting criticism. The only believable line there is that either way, the citizens pay.  [/b]</blockquote>Its just an excuse to increase their coffers.<br><br>Being a private company, SMRT and SBS can blatantly work on maximizing their profits (since this is the objective of a private corp), and give this cash back to Temasek, which is their biggest shareholder<br><br>Just imagine what happens if SMRT and SBS are run by the govt? It would be the most disastrous move in our govt's perspective, because they cannot make profits out of the 2 vehicles.<br><br>His response is unacceptable. I can think of many reasons why it should be run by the govt.<br><br>YES, fares may still rise if run by the govt. But if the govt runs this as a cooperative, then a cooperative would run this ensuring its able to cover its costs, and not make blatant profits.<br><br>Even if there are profits earned by the cooperative, this can then be returned to the people. In a way, it can be used as a tool to narrow the gap between the richer and poorer Singaporeans. The profits can be returned in the form of cash to the poorer income group.<br><br>The above beats the current model, whereby we are taxed from numerous invisible forces that ultimately direct our money back to the Govt.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>why is a Minister, who is suppose to be working for the interest of the people, supporting companies who they keep insisting are "private businesses"? Why is a Minister trying to save the ass of a private business? If the shareholders of these companies are unhappy that the transport company is not making enough money, sack the management first before passing the buck to consumers. So really, the Minister is saving the ass of these million dollar directors in these transport companies. Who are they? Why are their jobs more important than the lives of ordinary citizens?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Think it this way. More and more foreigners are staying in this country. So theoretically there would be more people using the public transport and hence more revenue for the transport companies; the companies have been increasing bus and mrt intervals and not following the schedule given, they would probably save some more biz costs here. Aircon not cold - another biz cost savings here. With these, won't they earn even more profits? So where's the rationale for transport hike?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>When bus fares increase, the profits increase too times the number of people taking public transport. So i dun see a reason for the increase because whether increase or never increase, SBS transit and SMRT are still making profits.
