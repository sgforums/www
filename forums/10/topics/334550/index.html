              <p>At the ceremony, the university's honorary president, a Professor
              Bernard Cadet, delivered an inspiring speech, urging graduands to
              transform the world.</p>
              <p>'Believe nothing is impossible. West Coast University (WCU) will
              be proud of you in the future,' he told the 76 graduands from
              Singapore, Indonesia and China, before handing them their doctorates,
              master's and bachelor's degrees.</p>
              <p>But this was a ceremony for an unaccredited university based
              in Panama, not Los Angeles, as its school in Singapore had claimed.</p>
              <p>The Asia-Australia School of Management (AASM), a
              Case-certified school in Middle Road, offers West Coast University
              programmes here with a related company, Huanyu Training Expert.</p>
              <p>At least two American states have outlawed degrees from WCU,
              describing it as a 'degree supplier' that offers 'fraudulent or
              substandard degrees'.</p>
              <p>The Texas State Higher Education Coordinating Board warns on
              its website that WCU 'is used by multiple unaccredited entities. The
              extent to which they are related is unknown, but more than one operator
              is suspected.'</p>
              <p>In some parts of the United States, it is a criminal offence to use degrees from unaccredited institutions.</p>
              <p>'Dr' John Huang, one of the owners of AASM and Huanyu, insisted
              that the university is based in Los Angeles and faxed The Straits Times
              documents showing West Coast University International registered as a
              business in California.</p>
              <p>But he confirmed that it was not the California-based West
              Coast University reputed for nursing and health science-related
              degrees. He admitted that WCU was unaccredited, but said his students
              had been given the facts.</p>
              <p>His doctorate is from Ashwood University, the same degree
              mill that granted this reporter's pet dog a doctorate for US$599
              (S$886) just two months ago.</p>
              <p>The guest of honour at Monday's ceremony was MP for Joo Chiat
              Chan Soo Sen, who delivered a speech in Mandarin and English.</p>
              <p>Contacted afterwards, he said he had been invited by a
              grassroots leader and accepted as he wanted to encourage the habit of
              life-long learning.</p>
              <p>Told that WCU was unaccredited, he said he had not been given
              any information about it. 'If my presence there had given the
              university credibility, that was not my intention,' he said.</p>
