              <div id="post_message_282466">SINGAPORE, Aug 3 – Malaysian
              Inspector-General of Police (IGP) Tan Sri Musa Hassan was today awarded
              Singapore’s Distinguished Service Order for his “outstanding
              contribution in fostering excellent ties and cooperation” between the
              Malaysian police and the republic’s police force.<br> <br> Musa, 57, had enhanced “the safety and security of both countries”,
              according to the citation read out before Singapore President S. R.
              Nathan conferred the award on Musa at an official ceremony at the
              Istana, here.<br> <br> Among Singapore dignitaries who witnessed the conferment were Deputy
              Prime Minister and Home Affairs Minister Wong Kan Seng, Law Minister K.
              Shanmugam and Singapore Police Force chief commissioner Tan Sri Khoo
              Boon Hui.<br> <br> <strong><a href="http://www.themalaysianinsider.com.my/index.php/malaysia/34101-singapore-honours-igp-musa-hassan-">Read More</a></strong><br> <br> <span style="color: blue;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Who is IGP Musa Hassan?</span></strong><br> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musa_Hassan">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musa_Hassan</a>)<br> <br> He took over the post from Mohamed Bakri Omar in September 2006; Hassan
              had previously worked as Deputy Inspector-General under him.[2] He was
              investigated on allegations of corruption related to the release of
              three members of illegal betting syndicates; however, Attorney-General
              Abdul Gani Patail ordered the Anti-Corruption Agency to close the
              investigations in July 2007 for lack of evidence.[3] Two months later,
              it was announced that he would receive a two-year extension of his term
              to 13 September 2009, despite having reached the mandatory retirement
              age.[1] Opposition leader Lim Kit Siang has applied pressure on the
              government not to renew Musa's term for allegedly failing to reduce
              crime rates in Malaysia.[4] Pointing to Musa Hassan's proposed
              extension, Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah criticised the routine extension of
              service for top civil servants which he said creates cults of
              personality and promotes a cosy relationship between senior officers
              and their political masters. He said that this process erodes the
              independence of the service as a whole.[5]<br> <br> <strong>Fabrication of evidence<br> </strong><br> On 29 June, 2008 Malaysian opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim announced
              that he had recently gathered evidence implicating Inspector General of
              Police Musa Hassan and Attorney General Gani Patail of misconduct and
              fabricating evidence against him. He mentioned this after the Malaysian
              police had reported that Anwar was accused by a man of sodomizing him.
              [6]<br> <br> Datuk Mat Zain Ibrahim, the police officer who investigated Datuk Seri
              Anwar Ibrahim’s black-eye beating in 1998, has accused the country's
              top lawyer and police chief of fabricating evidence in the assault. He
              claimed there was an attempt to introduce a medical report prepared by
              a Dr Abdul Rahman Yusof from Hospital Kuala Lumpur had suggested
              Anwar’s injuries were self-inflicted.
