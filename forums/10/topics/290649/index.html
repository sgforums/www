If you see other foreigner being able to get the citizenship so easily here, will you not question the value of your citizenship?<br><br>Has the gov really look into the pull or push factor forcing local to leave? Is the gov willing to make more changes to encourage ppl to stay?<br><br>So what if the MIW has done something if the result is they have all failed?  Yet claiming they are the best and deserving the best salaries? It simply mean they have not try hard enough. Period.</div>

But Singaporean who left  sg will return to visit.<br><br>What i do believe is that this open door policy is really not targeted at foreigners at all, but the actual target audience is local Singaporean who have move out to work for some years and  had stay out and SG gov want these people back with global experience.
