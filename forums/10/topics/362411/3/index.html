              <p>I got a friend who went to Australia for a month, just to clock enough times to keep their PR status, they said they never needed to speak english. I understand there a lot like in the US.</p>
              <p>Even in the tiny little red dot, there is a part of the population, who went to Chinese schools in the past,  never speak english. There are a lot of Singaporean who only speak only one sentence of english "I don't know". They are going through life, many of them successfully.</p>
              <p>But many of them speak malay, and they mix around with other races better than those who speak english.</p>
              <p>I think in the end it is important that people want to integrate. Speaking english helps but not enough.</p>

              <p>Yes it Is both... mentality of wanting to integrate so they willing to learn, but these days i called it a "life style migrant"  They carry 2 passports so that they can shine the passport when they return back to their birth countries.</p>
              <p>Compared to those migrant who came to the US in the 60's n 70's majority of them speak fluent English. But again, back than population were much much smaller.</p>
              <p>The only thing i really don't understand is that some of these folks remain in their own community city and never leave their own town, they bought over price house/apt, eat the same thing as they did in their own country, lead the same kind of routine as if they are in their country.  Behave the same as they were......</p>
              <p>wonder why.........they even move here!   </p>

              <p>I am not surprised these PRCs will drive the locals out of sg

              <p>They have bad habits too, and why is our pap controlled local
              mediacorpse keep showing programme to show the bad habits of locals
              and not china chinese?  This is discrimination.   I
              hate that programme.    Hosted by zhou cong qing,
              patricia mok, the fat lady and another guy.   
              Nowdays, mediacorpse showing more and more china production
              programmes for the china chinese, yuck pui, yucks, bloody PAP!</p>

              <p>You singaporean wogs also had just the same bad habits as they do now. So don't be too quick to assume you stand at the higher level of development. Give them time and they will develop and not spit, and not squat on toilets, speak softly and politely etc etc.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Its really amazing to see you singaporeans talk badly about other cultural groups/foreigners when you yourselves weren;t that much better before.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As for how many there are. Yeah.. a lot. Hell of a lot. You can tell who they are by looking at how many children they are. I see loads of them crowding up the IKEA, and they have 2-3 children or more haha. If you count their children, you can easily multiply the figures and add them up to 750,000 in the future =)</p>
              <p>The ICA will never release actual figures of PR applicants to the public. Believe me i know, i tried to find out how many europeans there were for a project and it is bloody difficult.</p>
