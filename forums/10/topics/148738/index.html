            <div class='col-md body'>The recent newspapers and even the magazines had been reportedly reporting cases of rapes, molesters etc..and it just sets me thinking about men's urge.<br><br>Australia is now thinking of ways to curb such crime from rising. And they proposed chemical castration. Denmark and Sweden are already implementing it and it proved results. I supposed this law is kind enough to this sicko perverts.. If I'm the law setter, I'll make sure "that thang" gets ripped off. And that should includes adulterer too.<br><br>To be crude, for the ladies, there are no ways to shut ourselves from entry.. but guys definitely can curb their urge! It's just not fair for the victims who had been raped to experience the trauma throughout the rest of their lives while the guys just get locked up and they're back on their normal lives.. They should get the equal torture physically if not mentally to compensate the emotional toil the victims are going through.<br><br>Same for adulterers, and in this case, I mean the guys who looked for their thrills out of their marriage or relationship. Even if the sluts pounced themselves on them, they should have be responsible to their partners and avoid it. I cannot stand unfaithful man who plays around while they're committed to someone. I straight-forwardly tell my man that if he dares to try anything funny ( anyway, I know he won't..) I'll snip it off without a second thought..haha...ruthless u call it..but I think that acts as a good deterent before the guys even want to try to do something stupid. I'm sure no guys who want to lose their little bro which is so part of their lives.<br><br>Maybe the women's chapter should give wives the power to punish their husbands when they committed adultery.<br><br>Share your thoughts with me.<br></div>

To castrate them ? Its like death penalties to druggies.No dealer no buyer.  You cannot just punish one side..especially only the man. .what about the woman ? Contributionary Negligence for the part of the woman too. If we were to be tough on all laws.. Judge Dredd will be the best choice for 'enforcing' these 'sins' commited. Amnesty International gonna come down hard on your ass too. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

You feel rapists should be castrated? OMG! I think you are crazy.<br><br>Why do you feel you should have exclusive use of a guys dick? What about women? Should adulterous women have their vaginas mutilated as well? I am glad you are not (i assume) anyone who has any legislative powers. I am even more glad that you are no where near me, and am probably 20000km away.<br><br>If i were your bf, i would be thinking of an exit strategy now...because frankly, i love my dick too much to risk having the fella mutilated by some psychotic feminazi. And yes i would leave you even if you had the combined sex appeal of winona ryder and Bunko Kanazawa.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Humans are no matter what still animals. No matter how much we have evolved, there is still a natural instinct in us to pro create. To have that instinct erased from us totally is not only cruel but also going against nature.<br><br>Think about this, God made Sex enjoyable, for the purpose of extending the human race. If Sex was as painful as say, plunging a thousand needles into your body at the same time, the human race would be extinct long time ago.<br><br>Utilizing chemical castration, I gather is to inject certain kind of chemicals into the body to lower the sexual urge of a person. If we start to do that too much, we would soon be having children born out of test tubes in no time.<br></div>
