                the 13 nifty 3manGRCs of 1988GE were MORE effective at 'ensuring  
              minority representation' as compared to the clumsy GE2001-2006 ones,  
              with the anticipated 2011GE being the worst (12.657% inferior to the  
              1988GE in this respect), Mr Fong must certainly <a href="http://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/be+speaking+out+of+both+sides+of+mouth">speaking through both sides of his mouth </a>in
                using the minorities as an excuse to justify the currently bloated 
              GRCs  at the expense of minority races- whose 1988GE promised strong  
              representation has since been paired down by 12.675% in GE2011. (cf  
              GE1988, GE2011GRCs are bloated by 78.023% much to the delight of the   
              incumbent PAP government.<br> PS: (Your mentioned Canadian link for comparison [<a href="http://www.elections.ca/content.aspx?section=res&amp;dir=loi&amp;document=index&amp;lang=e">link</a>] leads to 'elections Canada' website but nothing much in particular, I'd appreciate if you could please explain your link)<br> <br> <strong>2) Economies of Scale</strong><br> Blah blah blah, SMC can also later join together (you also alluded to  
              this) to benefit from 'economies of scale'. There is no need to operate 
               as a GRC to enjoy economies of scale. <br> That said, if Singaporean's consumption of goods and services is so  
              great as to requisite benefit from 'economies of scale', then perhaps SG
                should really consider enlarging its political system into something  
              like that of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress">US</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_Australia">Australian</a> govt system where bicameral legislature exist along with more  
              proportionate voting methods, both of which ensure more deliberation in 
               parliament GRCs (Lower House) can then be focused upon local  
              constituency activities and 'economies of scale'; bloating GRCs by  
              85.441% (GE2006 cf GE1988) isn't the solution.<br> You mentioned the death of MP Ong Chit Chung in this category but I  
              question the utility of fewer MPs doing more work, would their  
              effectiveness be curtailed, would the residents interest be curtailed,  
              especially if it was the minority MP falling ill/ passing away. Could  
              not a by election be held? U mean PAP politicians shudder at the process
                of elections,are PAP MPs fearful of the political debate which is 
              ought  to occur during by elections? Perhaps for by-elections, voting  
              shouldn't be made compulsory for the public's convenience- for democracy
                should allow the individual such freedoms of choice- but that another 
               topic for yet another day.<br> <br> <strong>3) Electorate gets to vote Cabinet Minister</strong><br> Haha, like such a big deal, actually it the duty of  the MP that I’ve  
              voted for to represent my interest by deciding the best fit for the  
              cabinet. U PAP people are really getting too pompous and presumptuous.  
              What remains telling in your statement is that the PAP is so confident  
              of winning that they have even declared whom the ministers in cabinet  
              are even before the election results are announced. Are PAP ministers  
              indeed so honorable and indispensable that its an honor for the people  
              to vote for them in elections? This imagery bring to mind MM Lee's  
              May2009 description of the N Korean dictator Kim Jong Il as a “<a href="http://www.pressrun.net/weblog/2010/11/wikileaks-what-lee-kuan-yew-told-steinberg.html">‘flabby old chap’ for a leader who prances around stadiums seeking adulation</a> ”, perhaps “psychopathic types” wouldn't be too far a description for 
               the YPAP author of this paper- written full of praise for PAP 
              ministers.<br> The meat of the matter remains, why did the PAP necessarily escalate the
                proportion of seats taken up by GRCs in parliament from 39 (GE1988) to
                72 (planned GE2011): a 78.023% increase whilst betraying the original 
               intent of minority representation by a reducing it's effectiveness by  
              12.657% (GE2011 cf. GE1988) as my previous article <a href="http://forums.asiaone.com/showthread.php?t=34674">'Does Racial harmony really require the creation of 75 GRC parliamentary seats?'</a>takes pains to show.<br> Has political partisan interest hijacked the original intentions of the GRC system of elections?<br> The electorate has spoken in<a href="http://www.asiaone.com/News/AsiaOne+News/Singapore/Story/A1Story20100802-229947.html"> 'Singaporeans want more say'</a> [A1news, 02Aug2010]: “when it comes to political activities like 
              policy  making as compared to ten years ago”- more freedom in elections 
              is the  desire of the electorate so why is the PAP stymieing this end by
                unnecessarily raising the sizes of GRCs towards its sole oligarchic 
              end?<br> Would racial minorities feel insulted now given that the original  
              39seats reserved by GRCs representing their interest in parliament in  
              the 1988GE has since ballooned to 75seats for the 2006GE [see <a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_aMxISxmw94Y/TPffpHt6OhI/AAAAAAAAAP8/bqBGxi06Vtw/s900/Electoral+Politics+in+Singapore,+YeoLH,+Table1,+Constituencies-+SG1,+Ethnic,+jpg+%282%29.jpg">chart</a>],
                minorities being the scapegoat for this need. Would the rest of  
              Singaporeans feel so disenchanted with the severe reduction in SMCs by  
              (75/84= 89.286% of all seats) that they might now blame and ostracize  
              the minority races for being the cause of this 'inconvenience'.<br> Adding insult to injury of all Singaporeans would be <a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1052726/1/.html">'Parliament amends Constitution to change NCMP &amp; NMP schemes'</a> [can, 26April2010] “the NCMP position is a unique feature of Singapore
                politics” that none of the opposition MPs supported as it only 
              promises  losing opposition candidates a notional parliamentary 
              representation. I  say, why not revert to the 3member GRC system of 
              elections and use the  NCMP scheme to top up the racial minority 
              candidates to equate true  population minority proportions. With an 
              excess of half the  parliamentary seats (like so in the 1988GE) being 
              SMCs, what excuse then  can the opposition give then for not winning any
               parliamentary seats?  Where forth the need for the NCMP scheme to apply

You must be joking. With last minute electoral boundary declarations [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrymandering#Singapore">wiki:gerrymandering#Singapore</a>]
                I think that its the opposition with their smaller respective party  
              sizes that is being disadvantaged in this case and given the  
              unnecessarily inflated sizes of GRCs- 5-6 members, opposition parties  
              would be hard pressed to form viable teams with campaign periods as  
              short as 17 days after opening of the register of electors [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singaporean_general_election,_2001">wiki: SG GE2001</a>].<br> PAP coat tail MPs are also expected to toe the govt line, after all, <a href="http://www.singapore-window.org/sw02/020321af.htm">'Singapore lifts whip on orchestrated parliament'</a>[<a href="http://www.singapore-window.org/sw02/020321af.htm">AFP 21Mar2002</a>]

               against one's convictions!<br> <br> GRCs effectively price out new political parties (it takes time to garner new members). SM GohCT has since admitted that <a href="http://www.yawningbread.org/arch_2006/yax-615.htm">'GRCs make it easier to find top talent: SM' </a>[ST

Together with PM Lee's Freudian slip declaration that he does spend much time thinking about: “<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krtGW-xUSH4&amp;#=1m10s">what's
                the right way to fix them, to buy my supporters votes, how can I solve

              cushy job  as a 'coat-tail MP' in coming GE 2011, there are still many 5

They would remain so in elections so long as GRCs  
              remain bloated. Many opposition parties are young, small and have little
                access to national coffers unlike the <a href="http://www.petitiononline.com/merlion1/petition.html">PAP that is able to direct national funds to its supporters</a>.

              There comes a time when fixing the opposition, buying supporter's votes,
