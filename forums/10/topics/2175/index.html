            <div class='col-md body'>Well, although education has been bothering everyone since they are young...<br>and I also read about many topics and how people replies on this...<br>I don't mind hearing more suggestions or arguements...<br><br>Well, I was a poly student and will be graduating soon...<br>So I am not sure why so many people bothering on where they will be studying? or will they be going to university?<br>For me, I think that as long as you think that you are meant for which level... where is your standard... then go ahead and study<br><br>my uncle told me... now having a diploma cert is no longer a big deal... a degree/ honour will be the least level that people going to reach...<br><br>but once you got degree, you aim for master, doctor, etc... so what you got in the end... getting high pay, shaking leg in the office at a age of 30?<br><br>For some people although they got very good grades for their exams, but what they have inside is actually nothing... all they did is just memorise and vomit them out... (although some are very excellent)<br><br>I think that even if you have only a 'O'levels cert, as long as you are hardworking, willing to learn, I don't think any company wanna miss this person. Somemore it's during this economic crisis...<br><br>So what about those going to JC, I have seen a lot of cases that some of the students was very happy that they are able to go to JC... but in the end after studying in JC one year or so, they need to register themshelves in poly... As for those who have only 'A' levels cert, what they can do? they do not have any hands-on experiments, only study, study, and study... but did the boss wanna those grads to enter their company jus to study? of course WORK!<br><br>And as for the ITE, well they are having hands-on labs... so boss will sure not goin to miss them out!<br><br>And for Poly, although three years might not be short neither long... but what we learn is mostly applied for future... even if we have a diploma cert, i think it's enough to get a good job.<br><br>As for those who are getting degree... hmm... I think it's quite difficult to get job now... cos grads surely aim for high pay, easy jobs... but don't forget if boss want better workers... they can get them from overseas...<br><br>So for my opinion, no matter we study to what level... find a job that you like and work forever... rather than getting high pay and having stress all day...<br><br>And no matter you are a degree holder or a 'O' levels grads, all you need to ask yourself is WHETHER YOU ARE A CAPABLE, HARDWORKING, WILLING TO LEARN?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I got two friends (A and B) who are totally different, (A) with five As for 'O'levels, (B) was a average student...<br><br>Despite the good results, (A) decides to go to poly instead of JC. (B) went to poly too.<br><br>Till now, (A) got almost all distinctions for all subjects and top 5% in poly, but (A) wanna find job after grad rather than continue study in university. (B) was still a average student yet wanna go for university...<br><br>But for what I think it's ok for (B) to give a try but since poly, if it's a average student I think it will be difficult to survive in university... why not don't waste money... just find a good job to work?<br><br>Can anyone tell me why people aim for studying university not even consider the abilities that they really have? What I afraid is that my friend (B) might freak out after studying in university not even one year...<br><br>As for me, I know where I am standing... I will not want a degree even though everyone is having one. I don't want to waste all those money... as I know clearly that I am not that smart type... I am glad with jus my diploma cert.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, My advice to most out there who don have an idea where to go would still be the poly path eventhough i was a JC student who made it to local U. Reason almost the same as novellem.<br><br>To novellem, all the best to your choice and try hard to break out from the ratrace. Most who made it rich and successful don't need a degree while those with degree normally work for the rich. Something from the Rich dad, Poor dad which i think make sense. Hence study how to be rich to own company instead of studying hard to get a good degree and find a job in a good company.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think whether we like it or not, the paper chase is here to stay... Its a matter of getting used to it, living with it and making your choices. People who have taken both paths have both found their niche.<br><br>For your info novellum, studying is never about memorising and regurgitation, whether in a poly, a jc or a uni. I feel sorry for the people you know who do that.<br><br>I don't necessarily agree that its more important to be hardworking because we're in an economic crisis. Its exactly because of this, and the fact that its an employer's market out there now that qualifications will matter more.<br><br>A potential employer will never know if u are a dilligent individual just by looking at u through 3 rounds of interviews. They'll want to know what u have to offer on paper before u even get a chance to start being hardworking!<br><br>Hence, qualifications and relevant experience will be the things that opens doors in the immediate aftermath of one's graduation, not virtues and "whats inside" 'cos they can't see it and quantify it. Its after this initial stage that what you are will bring you to the next level.<br><br>And I'm sure u're aware that positions offered by companies often come with minimum pre-requisite for applicants. A position for an engineer will unlikely be open to an ITE grad unless they've had an overwhelming bounty of relevent experience while a fresh engineering grad *might* stand a fighting chance... but of course, the position will go to someone with BOTH experience AND qualifications...<br><br>AND precisely because its an economic depression now, grads are lowering their expectations. so, there's more people fighting for the few jobs available which brings me right back to the point that the Boss gets to pick and choose the best so dare to dream if u think they'll pick one with lower qualification and less relevant experience but promises that he/she will work "vely hard"... yes, sure, a positive attitude counts... but many factors are in consideration as well...<br><br>Find a job u like and work forever??? Dare to dream... why on earth do u think so many people have been laid off recently? 'cos they don't like their job??? job security is not what it was before... it has been estimated that in this new globalised economy, economic fluctuations will result in people having up to 3 or more careers in 1 lifetime. And because we all need to eat, there is no longer the luxury of choosing only the jobs u like anymore, but the ones which u are most qualified for and most likely to get and keep. (if that also happens to be what u like to do, good for you...)<br><br>And so your friend *wants* to go for a degree... so encourage them instead of being such a wet blanket! Everybody's entitled to choose u know... It may not be the right choice to you, but then again, how do you know?<br><br>You decided to be happy with your diploma, so let others choose when they want to be happy.</div>
