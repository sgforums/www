I thought NATO standard 105mm rounds are all for rifled guns (M6<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> rather than smoothbore guns. Even the French TML 105mm gun is rifled rather than smoothbore. Only the 120mm guns used by NATO are smoothmore.  However, I did read from Janes that the German (Rheinmetall GmbH) has recently developed smoothbore 105mm gun.  I'm not sure if this is the one you are talking about.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>Rumors said that it incoporates a reversed Bionix chassis(engine at the back). The turret is rumored to be technologically transferred from GIAT, makers of the AMX-13s and AMX-10s that SAF have.<br></strong></blockquote>Most likely one of the French AMX-10RC turret . Can't think of any other turret that the French has produced. The AMX-30 turret will be way too big for a small tank the ST is building.<br><br>Personally, I rather ST choose the FMC turret or the M8 AGS turret. They use proven autoloader technology and can incorporate a commander's independent thermal TV (CITV) for hunter-killer mode.  That's what I'll call a force multipler.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>Like Bionix, the tank will have external mounted add-on armours with internal steel hull. (said to be comparable to the M2 bradley's armor)<br></strong></blockquote>I am not all suprised that the Bionix chassis is being used as the base of the new tank design. Afterall, it make sense from the logistic point of view. Same chassis share common share parts, including the wheels, tracks, suspensions, gears, engine etc. But darn, I still like the M8 most.<br><br>Another thing I wish the SAF would consider is to replace the Centurions with something better such as Leopard 1A5. SAF will have no problem in sourcing ex-Nethelands or ex-German tanks and simply recondition them. the A5 version has got the Leo2 FCS which make them one of the most accurate tank around regardless when they are firing while stationary or moving. The Germans sure know how to built good tanks. I think the Leo1A5 tanks will give the Malaysian T-84 a run of their money. Since T-84 is theoretically a T-72 modified.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>ST-kinetics already have a few surprises in development.

SAR-21 can carry a modified version of M203. Why need to bring in AGL? The ammo themselves will "kill" the person who is carrying it. Doesn't make sense. OICW has a 20mm genade launcher instead of the 40mm. Furthermore, they are more like the pump-action shot gun/grenade launcher, somewhat like the one depicted in the movie Aliens.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To be honest why would countries in this region need such big tanks? Other than in Northern M'sia upwards there is no suitable tank country in the Peninsula as its either mountainous, jungles(sometimes both!) or cities. The first 2 perclude the use of all but light tanks (as the British and japanese found out in 1941) while the case against armour in FIBUA has been settled several times in history(Stalingrad, Arnhem, Khafji and Grozny et al).<br><br>Besides, are the bridges in some of the more remote areas certified to take a 70 ton behemoth like the Abrams?(as someone was suggesting). This is not Western Europe, where countries like Germany have engineer certified bridges which can take M1s or Leopard 2A5s trundling across for hours without danger of collapse. Very little use for a Abrams thats half sunk into a river on top of a collapsed bridge, I'm sure you'd agree.<br><br>A light-medium tank, with displacement at most in the 30-35 ton bracket, sufficiently armed with a main gun in the 105mm class, would be more than sufficient to meet our needs</div>

The lightest would be the French AMX-30, but even that it is considered outdated. I thought Leopard 1A5 with a 46ton would come close.  Otherwise, we can start looking at up-armoured Stingray/M8 class tanks.<br><br>Anyway, a Bionix chassis and a foreign turret would probably be just under 30 tons unless ST intends to add a lot more armour to the front and side of the chassis and onto the turret.</div>

Well, I'm glad that RSAF has been 2 steps ahead in getting the Longbow Apaches while SAF has gotten some Spike ATGMs. Well, perhaps its time also for ST to produce a good light tank (105mm gun)to replace the AMX-13 SM1s.<br><br></div></blockquote>Ya, me too. The French Grandfather have been around for too long.Even with the improvements that ST made, i still think their time is up...<br></div>

They are the new "aggressors".<br><br>If I din remember wrongly, Pioneer Magazine reported a few months back that the current batch had just gone operational.</div></blockquote>I think if i remembered correctly,ADF actually means ARMY DEVELOPEMENT FORCE cos they held a recruitment drive in my camp around late 2000.Quite a few dozen from my camp signed on.They are made up mainly from infantry n guardsmen from various units signing on a 4yr contract. The first batch which made up 1 coy size is situated at Bedok Camp 2,same as the 3rd GUARDS.<br><br>The second coy is at Changi n the 3rd ??? I personally think that they r geniue pigs of the SAF trying out new doctrines n equipments that of the SAF. Maybe there is a bigger hidden agenda?!? SAF can only send regulars as peace keeping forces abroard. Maybe thats y the ADF is being setup...As ADF is the first unit in SAF where u can sign not only as a spec or officer,but as a man, it make sense that SAF is setting up this ADF thing to make up a unit purely of regulars so that it can send them to some tension hotspots in the world as peace keepers where no NSF in the right of mind would want to go...<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually, the ADF to me means, Active Deployment fuckers.  Hehehe. Basically, these soldiers are all regulars, and can be actively deployed for all sorts of rubbish, from peacekeeping missions to relief efforts and of course, combat.  Basically, they will be the proffessional soldiers mindef can afford to send away and take casualties.  Singapore usually don't send any armed peacekeeping units other than medics.  They are afraid to answer to parents and relatives should any of them KIA outside Singapore, in other people's business.  A regular/proffessional soldier force, will take away this "guilt" or "responsibility", cos this will be after all, their job. =)  I heard this ADF won't only consist of guardsmen and infantry, but even armor and CDO units.</div>

They will perform far better than NS soldiers when things get a little hot. Furthermore, you are right, Govt can put NS soldiers to do peacekeeping jobs. Just look at Somalia, had SAF NS soldiers been there, I wouldn't even start speculating what kind of causalties SAF will suffer.<br><br>An Active Deployment Force definitely makes a lot of sense in military terms. The tough thing is to get people willingly to sacrific lives for their country.<br><br>Does anyone has any info as to the make up of the ADF ? It is like the combined armed division like 3rd/6th/9th Div?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Last I heard, there was active recruitment from all over the place, new soldiers going into, completed BMT, and from regulars from various formations etc etc.  I gather the pay for ADF would be rather lucrative too, otherwise, it would be hard to get people to make such a sacrifice.  I'm sure you guys can check out with ur COs about the ADF.  Heh. =)</div>
