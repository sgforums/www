            <div class='col-md body'>anyway i agree with mhcampboy on his point. The parent is explaining something to her child, perhaps she could have not been careful to say the word 'bomb' in front of the officer without any warning that she would end up in that trouble, however does it mean that the family would pose THREATS such as bombing to the airport? ( don tell me they are terrorists in diguise with great acting skills ) Such an incident doesnt reflect well on SG don cha tink, the kind of ''top class service'' the country can offer, furthermore imposing fear on its citizens only. this is certainly not the beautiful garden city image that i was taught during pri sch</div>
