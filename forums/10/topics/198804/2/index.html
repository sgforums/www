            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Response from Reporters without borders</span><br><br><strong>Government criticised for condemning Â“unconstructiveÂ” article</strong><br><a href="http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=18208" rel="nofollow">http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=18208</a><br><br>It is not the job of government officials to take a position on newspaper articles or blog posts unless they are clearly illegal, Reporters Without Borders pointed out today after the Singaporean newspaper Today published an opinion piece by an official on 3 July condemning a recent post by blogger Lee Kin Mun as over-politicised and unconstructive.<br><br>Â“This reaction from a Singaporean official is disturbing,Â” the press freedom organisation said. Â“It reads like a warning to all journalists and bloggers in a country in which the media are already strictly controlled. The media have a right to criticise the governmentÂ’s actions and express political views. Furthermore, a newspaperÂ’s editorial policies depend solely on its editors. They should under no circumstances be subject to instructions issued by the government.Â”<br><br>Lee, who uses the pseudonym Â“mr brown,Â” wrote an article entitled Â“SÂ’poreans are fed, up with progress!Â” for TodayÂ’s opinion pages on 30 June in which he criticised recent government measures and the constant cost-of-living rises in an amusing and acerbic fashion.<br><br>Krishnasamy Bhavani, a press secretary to the ministry of information, communications and arts, responded with an article published in Today on 3 July in which she defended her governmentÂ’s policies but went on to criticise Lee for taking a political position.<br><br>Â“It is not the role of journalists or newspapers in Singapore to champion issues, or campaign for or against the Government,Â” she wrote. Â“If a columnist presents himself as a non-political observer, while exploiting his access to the mass media to undermine the governmentÂ’s standing with the electorate, then he is no longer a constructive critic, but a partisan player in politics.Â”<br><br>Lee is one of SingaporeÂ’s most popular bloggers. When the government banned political podcasts during the recent elections in April, the media largely took its cue from LeeÂ’s position that, Â“Prison got no broadband,Â” in which he seemed to discourage bloggers from violating the new rules. But he nonetheless tested the authorities himself by posting a series of Â“persistently non-political podcastsÂ” on his blog.<br><br>Reporters Without Borders was not able to reach Lee for a comment.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually I think there is a simple reason why the press in Singapore can never be "free of government influence". The main reason it remains controlled is because Singaporeans do not bother that it has been controlled. How often does one read the newspapers and wonder "am I getting the whole story?". More often what happens is "Oh wow.. I see". The main problem is that the government has successfully created a sense of "credibility" in the media we have been legally exposed to today. What many do not realise is that most facts are credible except the fact that these facts are moderated to filter any anti-government articles. Only when Singaporeans truly realise this, and the importance of correcting this, then we will start heading towards the direction of having free press in Singapore.<br></div>

One big factor that pushed our rankings down, were the racist bloggers and more recently, the chap who reprinted that anti-christian thingy ... now, can we not agree that those were neccessary steps to preserve our social cohesion and harmony ? ... freedom of speech can only exist if there are responsible speech ... clearly, some sectors of society are not there yet. I think it would be naive and indeed fool hardy if we are to swallow wholesale every single idea or ideals from other countries.<br><br>that said, I do agree that it's one thing for the govt to preach about such things and extend the blanket to cover the political realm as well. Perhaps this was an over-reaction. However, I certainly do agree that if you're going to make some political statement, then be prepared to stand up and be counted. There are plenty of opposition sites out there, with quite virulent anti-PAP rhetoric out there, and no one got dragged away in the middle of the night eh ? ... (note that I write anti-PAP, not anti-govt, but of course, perhaps some people do not draw that distinction).<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  ....</div>

One big factor that pushed our rankings down, were the racist bloggers and more recently, the chap who reprinted that anti-christian thingy ... now, can we not agree that those were neccessary steps to preserve our social cohesion and harmony ? ... freedom of speech can only exist if there are responsible speech ... clearly, some sectors of society are not there yet. I think it would be naive and indeed fool hardy if we are to swallow wholesale every single idea or ideals from other countries.<br><br></div></blockquote>The racist bloggers didn't bring down our rankings. It was the government's response to those bloggers that did. I am by no means condoning the actions of those bloggers (I'm Muslim, for your information), but I certainly object to them being dragged off to jail instead of being made to do community work or something. It brought about a very negative message here: 'If we don't like what you say, prepare to get it from us.'<br><br>And like Bear said, where the heck did Mr Brown say anything to do with race or religion? Unless if you could somehow show that criticism of the ruling party would eventually lead to racial and religious bigotry which would then lead to social strife. That, my dear, is an extremely large leap of logic which requires a massive suspension of disbelief. I'll gladly shut my claptrap and stop posting in this thread if you could somehow come up with a really convincing explanation which will not make me ROFLMAO.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>And yes, I agree that freedom of speech requires that it be used responsibly. So now, pray tell, how does criticism of ruling party equate to irresponsible speech? If you feel that your leaders aren't doing things right, then isn't it your responsibility to be voicing out your concerns and opinions?<br><br>The ruling party itself asked for feedback and urged people to speak up. Yet now it seems that they can't even handle satirical criticism.<br><br>Who's the one being irresponsible here? Mr Brown for the points that he brought up, or the ruling party for forcing him to shut up?</div>
