It was the government's response to those bloggers that did. I am by no means condoning the actions of those bloggers (I'm Muslim, for your information), but I certainly object to them being dragged off to jail instead of being made to do community work or something. It brought about a very negative message here: 'If we don't like what you say, prepare to get it from us.'<br><br>And like Bear said, where the heck did Mr Brown say anything to do with race or religion? Unless if you could somehow show that criticism of the ruling party would eventually lead to racial and religious bigotry which would then lead to social strife. That, my dear, is an extremely large leap of logic which requires a massive suspension of disbelief. I'll gladly shut my claptrap and stop posting in this thread if you could somehow come up with a really convincing explanation which will not make me ROFLMAO.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>And yes, I agree that freedom of speech requires that it be used responsibly. So now, pray tell, how does criticism of ruling party equate to irresponsible speech? If you feel that your leaders aren't doing things right, then isn't it your responsibility to be voicing out your concerns and opinions?<br><br>The ruling party itself asked for feedback and urged people to speak up.

(June 30) poured sarcasm on many issues, including the recent General Household Survey, price increases in electricity tariffs and taxi fares, our IT plans, the Progress Package and means testing for special school fees.<br><br>The results of the General Household Survey were only available after the General Election. But similar data from the Household Expenditure Survey had been published last year before the election.<br><br>There was no reason to suppress the information. It confirmed what we had told Singaporeans all along, that globalisation would stretch out incomes.<br><br>mr brown must also know that price increases in electricity tariffs and taxi fares are the inevitable result of higher oil prices.<br><br>[b]These were precisely the reasons for the Progress Package - to help<br>lower income Singaporeans cope with higher costs of living.</strong><br><br>Our IT plans are critical to Singapore's competitive position and will improve the job chances of individual Singaporeans. It is wrong of mr brown to make light of them.<br><br>As for means testing for special school fees, we understand mr brown's disappointment as the father of an autistic child. However, with means testing, we can devote more resources to families who need more help.<br><br>mr brown's views on all these issues distort the truth. They are<br>polemics dressed up as analysis, blaming the Government for all that he is unhappy with. He offers no alternatives or solutions. His piece is calculated to encourage cynicism and despondency, which can only make things worse, not better, for those he professes to sympathise with.<br><br>mr brown is entitled to his views. But opinions which are widely<br>circulated in a regular column in a serious newspaper should meet<br>higher standards. Instead of a diatribe mr brown should offer<br>constructive criticism and alternatives. And he should come out from behind his pseudonym to defend his views openly.<br><br>It is not the role of journalists or newspapers in Singapore to<br>champion issues, or campaign for or against the Government. If a<br>columnist presents himself as a non-political observer, while<br>exploiting his access to the mass media to undermine the Government's standing with the electorate, then he is no longer a constructive critic, but a partisan player in politics."<br>[/b]</blockquote>the progressive package was given to all singaporeans, not just the poor.<br><br></div>

Was it deplorable for the pappies to use these as a pretext ? Yes it was, but that they were used as a political tools by the pappies does not invalidate them. Note also that i spoke about my ideas in general terms, and not as a response to any specific instances (mr brown).
