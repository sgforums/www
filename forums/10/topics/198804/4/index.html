But sometimes, don't you notice they tolerate more of the mudslinging(which no one takes seriously)  than hard-hitting, well-crafted criticism of policies which come from the everyman and are easily connected with the public, but with the intellect of anyone who is able to spot their flaws in a glance.<br><br>I see divide and conquer.

I think you are overtly imaginative.<br><br>I'm for peaceful debates, the lack of a solution does not equate to a presence of armed fighters beating each other silly. We are not ruffians, nor are we sheep or little children.We are citizens who by and large, are affected by national issues. Who are they to tell us that we cannot discuss issues unless we are experts in that field?That's simply preposterous.<br><br>It's like telling a Chinese he cannot discuss matters relating to the CCP because he is not a political scientist or a member of the Politburo or National People's Congress.<br><br>What is a Singaporean identity? My vision is of a Singapore that is one nation which embraces all individuals regardless of beliefs and opinions. The nation is growing, this is an unavoidable fact.<br><br>As long as we keep the racial harmony and respect religion, who's to say we cannot achieve a melting pot? When we are inclusive, there is an outlet for differences to be raised.

            <div class='col-md body'>From yahoo<br><br>Sunday July 9, 5:08 PM<br>Supporters of suspended Singaporean blogger hold silent protest<br><br>Supporters of a Singaporean blogger have gathered at a busy subway station for a silent protest at the suspension of his weekly newspaper column after the government criticised his latest satirical piece about high living costs.<br><br>At least 30 supporters turned up at City Hall station at 2:00 pm dressed in brown attire in support of the blogger, who goes by the moniker Mr Brown.<br><br>"I think most of us feel that it is very important to have an independent voice in the print media," said a 25-year-old man who declined to be named.<br><br>He said he was told of the planned protest via a SMS text message on Saturday evening, like many of the others.<br><br>"For them to suspend the column is ridiculous," said a 19-year-old Canadian student who only wants to be known as Bronwyn. She was at the subway station with her sister and mother to take part in the silent protest.<br><br>The 36-year-old blogger, whose real name is Lee Kin Mun, is aware of the 30-minute silent protest but friends say he is not the organiser.<br><br>"We are aware of it but we did not organise it. We are touched by the gesture and we hope that nobody gets into trouble because of us," the blogger's friend Edmund Tan told AFP.<br><br>In Singapore any public protest of at least five people without a police permit is illegal. A few policemen patrolled the subway station but no arrests were made.<br><br>The Today newspaper's publisher MediaCorp confirmed Thursday it has suspended Mr Brown's weekly column from July 7 but gave no reason.<br><br>His latest satirical piece entitled "S'poreans are fed, up with progress!" drew a strong rebuttal from the government who said the writer was distorting the truth.<br><br>Paris-based Reporters Sans Frontieres (RSF or Reporters Without Borders) has described the government's condemnation of Mr Brown's column as "disturbing" in light of its already strict curbs on the media.<br><br>In April RSF condemned Singapore's restrictions on political discussions in blogs and websites ahead of general elections in May.<br><br>Last year the group ranked Singapore 140th out of 167 countries in its annual press freedom index.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Isn't it a fact that Utilities is up, Taxi fare going up, Public transport also going up. If Mr. Brown is highlighting the deepest sentiments from the heartlanders, shouldn't the "pay and pay" or "highest pay officials" be grateful to him for sounding the alarm of something big is stirring in the communities? Instead of ignoring the problem and burying their heads in the sand or worse shoot the messenger.  The world highest paid ministers even have the guts to ask him to shutup or provide the solution to the problems.<br><br>Shouldn't it be the jobs of the minister to address the people concerns and address their problem?</div>

Activistism may served its purpose strictly from a society well-being prospective but it is certainly detriment to the nation economic point of view.<br><br>Preventing an imposition on price will only see the profits of private corporate eroded away and subsquently investments and jobs for our citizens. In this circumstance, it is more advisable to diverse a win-win policy for both private industries and the welfarism of our citizens is through a special group appointed by the government to overlook the pricing policy.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>
