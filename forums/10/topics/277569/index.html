            <div class='col-md body'>Hi fellow Singaporeans, I am angry at the recent compulsory annuities scheme that was proposed. To me, it is nothing more than sheer robbery. This was a letter that I have sent to the major newspaper TODAY, but it is understandable why they would not want to publish it. I present it as an open letter to all of you, so that we may question what the Government is really trying to do here.<br><br><strong>The Bare Facts of Compulsory Annuities</strong><br><br>I am writing in response to the recent compulsory annuity scheme that was announced by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong in his National Day Rally Speech. I am disappointed by the metaphysical Â“for your own goodÂ” and Â“Singaporeans donÂ’t know how to manage their moneyÂ” arguments put forward by the schemeÂ’s proponents. I wish to point out to all readers the simple bare facts, and let them pass judgement for themselves.<br><br>* The life expectancy of the average Singaporean as of 2006 is 81.8 years. (Male 79.21, Female 84.59)1<br>* A Â“small portion will be set asideÂ” from the CPF minimum sum for compulsory annuities. This has been reported to be $4000-$7000<br>* Annuity payouts will be $250-$300. What this means is in the best case scenario, it takes 4000/300 = 13.3 months to recoup the principal. This effectively means, discounting inflation, annuities will start paying out from 86 years and 1 month of age. The worst case scenario is 7000/250 = 28 months added to the 85 years of age. This means 87 years and 4 months of age before annuities pay out.<br>* The average Singaporean will die long before recouping the principal sum tied up in compulsory annuities. So what happens to the money if he dies? Will it be repaid to his estate? The Government so far has been silent on this issue. I think we all know what that means.<br><br>What are Singaporeans supposed to make of headlines such as Â“MAS ready to inject cash into market if neededÂ”2 ? Liquidity is merely a euphemism for Â“paper moneyÂ”. It is clear that if MAS injects cash, this will eventually result in a rise in prices, an increase in the price level. With the constant inflation wrought by these injections, fixed incomes from schemes like annuities will fall in their purchasing power. It is no coincidence the US dollar is worth less than one-twentieth of what it was worth in 1933, post-gold-standard. Inflation diminishes the value of payouts in fixed denominations like the governmentÂ’s annuity scheme, benefiting the debtor at the expense of the creditor. The Government is taking Â“expensiveÂ” Singapore Dollars from Singaporeans, and repaying them Â“cheapÂ” Singapore Dollars. If Singaporeans die before collecting their (inflation-diminished) principal, the Government keeps the money. And the Government sets the payout bar so high, a healthy majority of us would have kicked the bucket before we even smell 85.<br><br>What puts it all in context, is the list of private annuity schemes currently available under the CPF scheme, put on the official CPF website.<br><br>http://mycpf.cpf.gov.sg/NR/rdonlyres/883DD6D3-D1EC-48DD-8B09-811C0D24ECE8/0/AnnuityComparison.pdf<br><br>One notices that with the investment of a minimum sum of $99,600, annuity payouts start at 62. Even at the lowest payout rates (GE Life, Female - $440.73/month), by age 85 the investor has received $121,000. The investor has recouped the principal, and is earning a much higher rate than government annuities. Mind you, this is the lowest. In addition, all private firms listed there repay the original principal in full upon death.<br><br>In PM LeeÂ’s speech3, he mentions that few Singaporeans take up annuities due to their unattractive returns, but that Singaporeans still need them. It is hard to take such ex cathedra statements seriously. If Singaporeans wonÂ’t take up private annuities schemes due to their low rates of return, what makes PM Lee say that Singaporeans need compulsory annuity schemes due to their even lower rates of return? This is supposed to be the brilliant retirement scheme from Mr Lee and his gang? There is a very good reason the whole thing is compulsory Â– no Singaporean in his right mind would opt for this punitive scheme.<br><br>With big government schemes like the Biopolis and a fourth university, the Government has to get the money from somewhere. With this compulsory annuities scheme and the various CPF re-jigs, it looks as if the Singapore Government has discovered that the taxpayer has more than one pocket.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>1Â“SingaporeÂ”, CIA World Factbook - https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/sn.html<br><br>2 Â“MAS ready to inject cash into market if neededÂ”, Channelnewsasia.com - http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporebusinessnews/view/293230/1/.html<br><br>3 http://app.sprinter.gov.sg/data/pr/20070819990.htm<br><br>_______________________________________________________<br><br>If you have any comments, spotted any mistakes, or disagree with my take on the issue, please leave a message on my blog here (all intelligent comments welcome!):<br><br>http://freedom-for-man.blogspot.com/2007/09/letter-to-today.html</div>
