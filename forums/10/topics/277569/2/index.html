That is not the point and you are barking up the wrong tree. If every SGrean is as financial-savvy as Leong Sze Hian or Peter Lim or Wee Cho Yaw, then there is no problem. But can you say that?  For those who can manage their finance or are financial-savvy, they don't need annuity, and even if they have to use some of CPF-money to pay for compulsory annuity, it is loose change to them! The problem (as you failed to see) is that the majority of people are not financial-savvy, nor can they save (either not a habit or don't have money to save). How do you deal with these people?</span><br><br>I assure you I have done my research into annuities. I could put it in the most technical jargon, but remember I am writing for ordinary Singaporeans. I am merely putting out the bare facts about annuities. The ordinary Singaporean does not care for convoluted explanations - clear simple facts make my point clearly. Stealing is stealing, jargon or not.<br><span style="color: red;">Hmmm ... your research is a bit skewed judging from your statement - stealing. Annuity is based on time value of money plus the element of pooled risks. Everything about money rest on interest rate. If the interest rate is good, any scheme will do. You don't need a PHD to understand this. Loansharks can tell you! And loansharks need no convoluted explanations.</span><br><br>NUS and SMU were built on taxes and CPF contributions. The real reason why the government is pushing back CPF payout age is because they are spending the money, as well as allowing contributors to invest some. This is credit expansion, and over the next 20-30 years inflation will jump remarkably. I personally feel the SGD will fall by 3-4 times in value.<br><span style="color: red;">Your economics is mixed with personal feelings. Every public good is built with public money raised thru taxation, unless you want to pay for all. While CPF fund is 'borrowed' by govt to finance developments, there is no evidence to show that the real reason is what you claimed. There are many sources of fund for gahmen to tap, CPF is not the only one!<br>And a note about inflation - I think your ah cong without studying economics will tell you that. So, you want to withdraw all your money from CPF and spend it all at one go, so that inflation will not eat into your hard-earned money?</span><br><br>You are right though, I believe the government is always looking to benefit itself at the expense of others. What is "compulsory"? "Compulsory" actions are needed when people acting voluntarily would not do so freely. Does the government do anything productive? No - anything it spends has first to be funded by taxes, monetary inflation, or deficit spending (future taxation). If we strip the government of its self-imposed sanctity, what do we find? We find that the government is nothing more than the most organised group of thieves in history, that have a monopoly of ultimate decision-making (jurisdiction) and a monopoly of taxation over a geographic location. That is all it is.<br><span style="color: red;">Hahahaha, with or without gahmen, your money is also not safe. Someone may rob you or you get cheated, or inflation will eat your money. Again, why wud gahmen want to steal when it has the power and authority to print money or tax people? Your economics is really mixed up.</span><br><br>Sure I could spin it in jargon - but why would I want to? Simple, clear, effective, language makes my point clearly. If robbery (forced taking of money) is wrong, then taxation is wrong, and compulsory annuities is wrong.<br><span style="color: red;">Your jargon is spin wrongly.  When you go to a restaurant to eat, it is compulsory that you pay! If it is voluntary - do you think people will pay? I will not, since it is voluntary!
