We do not know whether they eat any diseased matter which could pass on to humans causing diseases...(look up Mad Cow Disease, caused from feeding cows dead matter)...<br><br>This is just one of the reasons....<br><br>Any more you'd like to ask i'd be more than happy to call my friends or me to answer <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>From the sura you've posted, again, once the verses are expanded in context, its understandable that they were revealed during a time of hostile array and where treaties are broken. The early muslims recognized something of a relationship between 'erroneuos beliefs' and socio-economic exploitation of others, which is probably why these communites had to struggle with each other.<br><br>An example is taking advantage of the illiterates by purposely distorting scriptures to them for some gain. Another is driving certain groups out of their homes when treaties were first set. Its something along those lines. Complicated huh.<br><br>The hadiths (the last two quotes) you've posted, its well known among muslims they are forged or weak both on chains of transmission and <span style="font-style: italic;">fiqh</span> - understanding. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> Hadiths are like the apocryphal works in Christianity. They are sometimes outside of the main canons of Islam.<br><br>Ill end with something to balance this out once more. Speaking to the contemporary Abrahamic faith adherents of its time, the Quran states, "To each among you We have appointed a law and an open way. If God had willed, He would made you a single people, but that He might try you in what He hath given you. So strive with one another in good works. Unto God is your return and He will inform you wherein ye differed."<br><br></div>

Whaaaat? How...? Seek it out yourself laaaaaaaah.<br><blockquote>Elevating effects at the cost of false beliefs which are harmful to the individual society?</blockquote>Imo, the aftermath is irrelavant. In the same question, of false beliefs, I see how you can easily influence others with your own convictions, false or true. I see how you are every bit capable contributing to harm.

You are a potential revolution.<br><blockquote>But the extremists get their teaching from their holy book which expliclty states that in order to comply with their religious teachings they need to kill.</blockquote>Issit? Lets explore a little of that. Wakus quoted this from you.<br><br>Sura (2:191) - And slay them wherever ye find them, and drive them out of the places whence they drove you out, for persecution [of Muslims] is worse than slaughter [of non-believers].<br><br>It does explicitly said to kill non believers isnt it?

God loveth not aggressors.</span><br><br>2:192 - But if they cease, then lo! God is Forgiving, Merciful.<br><br>2:193 - And fight them until persecution is no more, and religion is for God. <span style="font-style: italic;">But if they cease, then let there be no hostility except to those who practice oppresion.</span><br><br>Hmm.<br><blockquote>You say there are traditional rules of war condemming the extremists, care to quote? </blockquote>There is a famous quote from the first successor to Muhammad that goes something like:<br><br>"Stop, O people, that I may give you ten rules for your guidance in the battlefield. Do not commit treachery or deviate from the right path. You must not mutilate dead bodies. Neither kill a child, nor a woman, nor an aged man. Bring no harm to the trees, nor burn them with fire, especially those which are fruitful. Slay not any of the enemy's flock, save for your food. You are likely to pass by people who have devoted their lives to monastic services; leave them alone."<br><br><a href="http://eteraz.wordpress.com/2006/07/23/convergence-of-traditionalism-and-jihadism/" rel="nofollow">Traditionalist Rules of Violence from Eteraz</a><br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rules_of_war_in_Islam" rel="nofollow">Islamic Military Jurisprudence from Wikipedia</a><br><blockquote>This is just twisted.</blockquote>Mmm. Sweet suffering. I suppose its couched in many allegories. For example in Buddhism if I may speak about it, if they don't reach enlightenment and see the world for what it is (become aware of God), they'll be stuck in the wheels of karma, suffering and suffering until they, <span style="font-style: italic;">know</span>.</div>

I say again you are reading it too literally and your reading of the lines really reflect the way how an extremist would read it...thus justifying it for their cause...<br><br>Okay let me clarify these lines...<br><br>Ur first line is incomplete. Try quoting it wholly can?<br><br>Sura 8:12 <strong>When God Almighty, commanded the Angels; Allah is with you, hence strengthen the hearts of those who believe.</strong> I will instill fear into the hearts of non-believers. Therefore strike their heads and strike every of their fingertips.<br><br>The ones in bold were the lines you missed...and i believed you cut and paste from a page where the tendency to be sensational is strong, the Book doesn't say anything about striking off someones head. Wonder where you get that?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The second line i say again, you refer to the line fighting, and i say again fighting takes up many forms. Do not stay close to merely war or arms, or are you that myopic to see that fight only means just that?<br><br>And before you go on shoot another of those lines, tell me the website you're getting this lines from, i would be interested to read...and i presume you're living in singapore...ever seen a muslim go after you with a knife? I don't really think so...<br><br>I'm not exactly an expert on Islam, but you just quoting these lines really only lead to more misunderstanding and hate towards Muslims...</div>
