People are the customers of such a service and when things go wrong how are the people treated by the government ?<br><br>What did the LTA do for example when people got maimed at the surprised or unauthorised barricades at overhead bridges or got stalled in the MRT trains for no apparent reasons. When HDB unilaterally wanted to further increase shop rentals without justifications as opposed JTC, it may again be a case of poor service philosophy at the ministers' level who regularly deny problems about high costs and tax-and-recover policies which are basically anti-service.<br><br>Are people treated with courtesy or bureaucracy? To improve any service excellence, the government should set itself as an example. If government ministers keep telling off people not to expect free lunch, will not that kind of attitude rub off on LTA and HDB in their service. For now the government ministers do not even realize that prevention of Nicol Highway collapse is their responsibility and when things go wrong they should be more open to admit their shortcomings instead of denying them totally or trying to find scapegoats.<br><br>No wonder the country service level is very poor because it all started by government regularly telling people to buzz off by giving unhelpful or bureaucratic replies even in the face of extreme public inconveniences or problems.<br><br>Before LHL calls for change he must recognize that our society has many problems that may trace back to the attitudes or quality of ministers.<br><br>Instead of quality service or showing works done, citizens are sometimes challenged or told off rudely not to expect free lunches (subjective anyway who is taking free lunches since people pay for all their high bonuses and many self-approved benefits) or giving of excuses of one kind or another.<br><br>Good service will not happen in Singapore until government service improves.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>One of the problems is that customer service people are usually very poorly paid, how to expect them to provide good service and smile when they're depressed, angry or worrying how to pay their bills? After all, even our ministers and mps will turn to corruption unless they're paid lots of money, why not address the problem of the poorly paid peasants at the bottom of the corporate hierachy? And unlike the ministers and mps, I don't think this group of people will demand milllion dollar salaries.</div>
