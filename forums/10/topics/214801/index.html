As it is, the very name of the 'DEMOCRATIC People's Republic of Korea' is hypocrisy in itself. The North Korean juche system is anything but democratic in its precepts, and we all know that already.<br><br>And hey, there's the official name for the former East Germany as well: 'German DEMOCRATIC Republic'. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Somehow I find it funny that communist nations would claim to be staunchly pro-communist and anti-democratic while openly using democracy in their names. One would think that if they were truly proud of their communist ideologies, they would have reflected that in their names.<br><br>Seems to indicate an apologetic stance on their part for their communist status. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>But of course, hypocrisy isn't just limited to communist states. The US, for instance, is a pretty good example of legalised hypocrisy in the guise of democracy. You don't have to think too far to think of one example of this: the indefinite confining without trial of 'enemy combatants' at Guantanamo Bay certainly goes against their ideas of personal liberties.</div>

That's 28.5 percent higher than a year earlier.<br><br>The reserves are growing at a rate of almost $30 million an hour, mostly driven by a gap between exports and imports that tripled to $102 billion last year. The government's policy of not allowing the yuan to strengthen to reflect demand for the currency keeps the nation's export prices low, further fuelling the trade surplus.<br><br>With a more flexible yuan, ``the currency would have appreciated and we wouldn't have seen this reserve accumulation,'' said Qing Wang, head of greater China research at Bank of America in Hong Kong and a former IMF official.<br><br>China's record holdings exceed the output of every economy in the world bar the eight largest. They reflect a global imbalance that's mirrored in the $805 billion U.S. current-account deficit, itself fueled by demand from the nation's consumers for cheap Chinese imports.<br><br>``The U.S. continues to live beyond its means and China's reserve accumulation is partly a result of that,'' said Barry Eichengreen, an economic historian at the University of California, Berkeley. ``Another year where no one does anything and somehow hopes the problem will solve itself will only set us up for a bigger fall.''<br><br>Currency Changes<br><br>China has recently shown signs it is responding to repeated calls by the finance ministers and central bankers of the U.S. and the other Group of Seven industrial nations to make its currency more flexible.<br><br>Premier Wen Jiabao has also acknowledged that reserves have caused a surge in the money supply that triggered a credit-fuelled investment boom the government is now trying to cool.<br><br>Central bank Governor Zhou Xiaochuan on Sept. 16 called on China's lenders to prepare for changes to the currency so they can better manage risk.<br><br>The government in April moved to loosen strict capital controls by letting companies and individuals invest outside China and allowing some outflow of funds.</div>
