It might be reasonable for Laurence to mention China due to the ideological proclivities shared between China and N Korea, except that he used an expletive. This means that he is not so much interested in "expanding the discussion" as in indulging in China-bashing for no good reason. This is why Huaqing said Laurence was being irrelevant.

            <div class='col-md body'>I dun find ani part of Lavrence thread as offence, thus why label him as a bigot.<br><br>I believe most countries takes a pragmatic approach to diplomacy and international relationship. US warms up and gets cosy with PRC due to the fact they wish PRC will align itself with her to counter the then USSR. Likewise most European coutries don't sell weapons to ROC is not bcos they "respect one China" stand, but more bcos they fear agitating PRC, thus losing out business opportunities with PRC, which means lost of billions of dollars.<br>I believe PRC will not support verbally or through true action for DPRK in this modern day. DPRK's irresponsible actions and behaviour has prove to be more of an embarrasment for PRC rather that a boon. But a strong, pro PRC DPRK is vital for PRC as it acts as a efficient buffer from US presence in ROK and at the same time provides a vital check against Japan and ROK.<br><br>I guess SG attitude towards DPRK is one dat they hope DPRK will open up like China one day and allow foreign investments to flow in. Somw wad like China, in theory a communist, but capitalist in nature. Thus we might have a chance of being the first few to capture the market.</div>

And so no country needs to consider making a decision in the direction of considering a nuclear option," Hill added.<br>North Korea's unconfirmed nuclear test has upset the balance of power in Northeast Asia. Officials and analysts worry that the test will set off an arms race in the region, with North Korea's non-nuclear neighbors pursuing their own nuclear weapons.<br>If Japan develops nuclear weapons, it will leave South Korea as the only country in the region without them. Chung-in Moon, once a top advisor to the South Korean government, told ABC News that if Japan starts a nuclear weapons program, South Korea would likely do so as well.<br>The U.S. government has yet to determine whether North Korea actually conducted a nuclear weapons test. Seismic readings from the blast location are consistent with a large unnatural explosion, and sources told ABC News that additional preliminary tests suggest that the North Korean test was a nuclear test, but the sources cautioned that the results are not definitive.<br>While some say the explosion may have been a large conventional weapons explosion, others think an explosion of that size was more likely a weak, or failed, nuclear explosion.<br>Although the test may have been a fizzle rather than a full explosion, Princeton University astrophysicist Christopher Chyba said that this type of explosion could still create a stadium-sized crater Â¡Âª one that would be devastating if it were to land in an urban area.<br>Hill's comments come as the United States is pursuing aggressive sanctions against North Korea in the United Nations Security Council designed to coerce North Korea into giving up its nuclear weapons program.<br>The Security Council is expected to vote Saturday on a resolution banning large weapons shipments, luxury goods imports and freezing any assets related to North Korea's weapons programs.<br>The United States had pushed for stronger sanctions, but eventually watered the resolution down to appease China and Russia, who feared that tougher sanctions might only make the situation worse.<br>Nevertheless, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton told reporters today that the Security Council's ability to pass a sanctions resolution within a week was "a sign of the determination of the council in the face of this threat to move quickly."<br>Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice will travel to Asia on Tuesday to push for enforcement of the resolution.<br>"She is going to be talking about the passage of that resolution certainly, but really what comes after it," State Department spokesman Sean McCormack told reporters.<br>"She is going to be talking about how to go about actually implementing that resolution," he added.<br>Rice will have stops in Japan, South Korea and China. State Department officials say a stop in Moscow is also possible before Rice returns to Washington. Assistant Secretary Hill will depart a few days before Rice and will attend the meetings as well.</div>
