Very. The thing about this Government, is that the term "heavy responsibility" is defined based on the whims of this old man. He regards people who he think can serve him well, then bribes him with lots of money to do so.<br><br>In this, we have the so-called elections, where his handpicked people are given a cruise ride to their seats of power. The net result, is that we have no say over who becomes a minister whatsoever. These people, literally, have a silver spoon in the mouth.</div>
