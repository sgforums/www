              <p>According to conventional wisdom, government must balance incomes and expenditure and create surplus.<br> <br> As a result of such a practice, the government has a tendency to increase taxes and claim all
              sorts of expenditures without really creating benefits for the citizens
              e.g. hoarding monies to invest in foreign investments causing losses by
              billions without benefiting the people.<br> <br> If the government accounts are revised to show collections of taxes
              vs benefits to citizens (e.g. indirect taxes for a start) by the sectors e.g. cigarette taxes to fund cancer
              care or road taxes to lower costs of public transportation, we will then have a more open account and make it more difficult for government to over-tax and under-spend on benefits or hoard monies for their own purposes.<br> <br> For lowering costs of public transportation, we can use sectorise taxes
              collected from vehicle ownership and usage e.g. vehicle excise duty,
              COE, ERP, Road Tax, Petrol Tax, Registration Fee etc and use part of it
              to offset rising costs in transportation to the average citizens.<br> <br> For utility, we can use the exorbitant water tax and sewerage fees to
              fund for necessity use of household electricity up to say 100 KWhr to
              lower costs of utility. For double-profits made on lands and car parks
              (citizens already paid for them under taxation) these indirect taxes
              can be used to lower housing costs to the needy and middle income
              groups including lowering the rentals to the poor who are unable to buy
              their own flats costing $150K or even unable to have three meals to
              survive.<br> <br> When the average citizens are able to survive they will spend more and
              create more consumption. In any event they need to find a way to pay
              for the continuing hard-hearted tax increases and profiteering of the
              whole government and its GLCs and live their lives as the no-welfare
              government will not support them in any other way nor their retirements.<br> <br> Citizens should be taken care of before we start looking after pr and foreigners.<br> <br> This sectorial balancing of taxes versus government spending on
              citizens' necessities will prevent further nonsense of hoarding for
              surpluses which drives many citizens to suicides and kill the economy.<br> <br> Only when citizens are not holding back spending will we once again
              have a vibrant economy because of more consumptions there are the more
              the better will be the businesses and the more jobs they will create.</p>

              <tr>
              <td colspan="2"><span class="postbody"> When the principle is accepted then and only then we go into the details.
              <br> <br> The principles to be considered here should be established:-
              <br> <br> Under the current system of governing the country, the annual account
              presented to parliament for raising of taxes and fees etc are often not
              accurate; windfall profits made from land sales by SLA and HDB and URA
              are often concealed by creative accounting.
              <br> <br>Yet when government decides to raise taxes like GST from 5% to 7%
              in 2007, such windfall profits were not disclosed resulting in an
              undisclosed S$6 billions which should have been reported to prevent the
              hefty GST increase in 2007 which have resulted in serious inflation of
              6%.
              <br> <br>Because of recessions in recent years many citizens are still
              experiencing hardship with dropping wages so new way must be found to
              help them in avoiding tax and fee increases.
              <br> <br>Yet when it comes to funding of such basic and essential services
              the government was always seen to be dragging its feet to fund them
              with excuses like "no free lunch" while continuing to hide its billions
              of profits.
              <br> <br> To overcome such problems it is essential to revise the current budgetary process.
              <br> <br> All incomes should be disclosed accurately in the annual budgets of the government.
              <br> <br>Government must allocate a proper basis for funding of desirable
              social services like medical care, housing, transportation and utility
              etc, as in many instances such expenditures should be self-financed
              from certain specifically related punitive taxes aimed at discouraging
              certain activities which are interrelated in promotion of social
              objectives and nation building.
              <br> <br>Certain essential services which government was often reluctant to
              fund out of taxes could in fact be met from such social disincentive
              taxes.
              <br> <br> For example cigarette taxes can be used to fund cancer care or R&amp;D and liquor tax used to administer drink problems.
              <br> <br>Windfall profits from SLA and LTA which were not disclosed in
              annual budget. If properly and honestly disclosed it could have
              prevented many instances of unnecessary taxing and fee increases in
              medical care and public transportation or public housing.
              <br> <br>This kind of annual parliamentary budget is wrong and
              unconscienable as it allows the government to hide windfall profits and
              under-state or misrepresent income in order to keep hoarding monies as
              has been happening for many years.
              <br> <br>Failing to realign to budgetary allocation to desirable social
              objectives and basic government services to the people, the government
              will be encouraged again and again to make false claims of deficits in
              many departments which finally were found to be untruthful because
              hidden profits made were not reported accurately.
              <br> <br>Moreover it will create a situation were the surpluses were lost by
              the respective department in extravagant expenditures like building
              unnecessary headquarters for LTA or in overseas investments like Shin
              Corp.
              <br> <br>In view of the afore-stated problems caused by a "no-welfare"
              governing system, there have been a lot of over-taxing and over-charge
              of the citizens with under-spending on essential services like medical,
              housing, utility, transportation etc.
              <br> <br>In the first place had such essential services been carefully
              funded from specific disincentive and sometimes rather punitive taxes
              like vehicle excise duty, COE, ERP or windfall profits made by GLCs and
              government agencies we could have avoided such money hoarding which
              only finally benefited the ministers and civil servants in increasing
              the salaries ad infinitum despite the private sector experiencing many
              years of downturns in wages of ordinary workers.
              <br> <br>In this way a fairer system could be established to ensure that the
              desirable social services are linked to and funded from the specific
              disincentive taxes like vehicle excise, COE ERP or Stamp fee without
              being sidelined too often by creative accounting.
              <br> <br>Note : Defence expenditures can easily be worked out and give a
              certain priority for funding but properly and fairly balanced against
              the spending for desirable social services without practical difficulty
              while preventing such lump-up accounting for being used as an perpetual
              excuse to forecast deficits or expected deficits which are far from
              truthful which actually could be aimed at withholding of tax monies for
              hoarding of surpluses serving very little purposes for ordinary citizens</span></td>
