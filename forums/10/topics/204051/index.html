If not to make Singapore a better place for Singaporeans?<br><br>Why should we pay taxes to be used to pay him and the whole of PAP? So that he can make comments like this and throw the problems back to the people?<br><br>Let's face it, Singapore today is very expensive. Living expenses are increasing each year. Yet our paychecks can't ever seem to  keep up.<br><br>Property prices are sky-rocketing. And this includes HDBs as well. And here I thought HDB's were goverment housings for the people. Yet, one 4 room unit in say Tanjong Pagar can cost close to a condominium.<br><br>The gahmen is doing nothing to keep the prices down and affordable to the people. I would understand if its private property. But this is goverment housing we are talking about.<br><br>And this is one of  many other problems that we face in Singapore today. Yet nothing is being done. Small wonder why over so many people are thinking of emigration. There seem to be no other choice when our own leaders refuse to do anything.<br><br>I for one am truly dissapointed and regret voting for the PAP.

Of course some people will start thinking for themselves, and by reflex the government will slap them down.  In the meantime, government agencies will try to lure foreign talent in to help the transition with the view to ripping them off, and it'll be a while yet before they realise that they're supposed to leave people alone to develop.</div>

There is a surplus of jobs for Singaporeans and GDP is higher than expected.<br><br>But.... take a step back and look closely. Yes these are good news for the economy. Yet do we, people benefit from it? Yes the rich get richer. But what about the middle and lower income group?<br><br>Do we see a pay increase for all sectors of the workforce that is expected that is doing well?<br><br>ERP charges are up. So are the public transportation fares. Electricity tariffs are going to be raised. Contributions to our CPF are down. Its costing so much more just to get a roof over our heads.<br><br>Yet income taxes, property taxes , etc, remains unchanged. Interest rates for our bank deposits are also down. But interest rates for loans just keep increasing.<br><br>Does anyone see the imbalance that is going on? Everything that is considered a benefit for us either is lowered or remains unchanged.<br>Yet anything that is benificial to the gahmen just goes up.<br><br>So, even if they say we are doing so well, just calculate your monthly balance sheet again. See the difference when we were not doing so well in 2002 and now.<br><br>Take a look at how well Singaporeans are actually doing.<br><br></div>
