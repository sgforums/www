              <div id="post_message_282815"><strong>Oikono.com, 5 Aug 2009</strong><br> <br> <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Where are the Singaporeans Left?</strong></span><br> <br> It has been another two years away from Singapore. One sunny afternoon,
              I stopped by the Redhill Hawker Center for lunch. Two pretty Chinese
              ladies walk up to the table of hawkers sitting next to me. The hawkers
              were giving catcalls to the ladies. One of the ladies gets a hawker to
              buy her a meal. Walking back, she promises to introduce the hawker to a
              lady of the night. Talking to friends, this fascinating phenomenon
              seems to have been around for some time. <span style="color: red;"><strong>A friend claims that sex workers from China are able to obtain visas legally since 2007.</strong></span> Unofficially, they have been around longer. But what I want to talk
              about isn’t sex (sorry to disappoint) but rather, foreigners in
              Singapore.<br> <br> I knew it was a sign of the times when my aunt married a rich Belgian
              (and retired as a lady of leisure) and my brother married a Vietnamese.
              While travelling in China, every other Chinese I encountered seemed
              able to tell me that someone they know working is in Singapore. My
              barber in Beijing had a cousin working in a hotel here; the guy who
              gave me a lift in northeast China had a friend working here; the kebab
              guy in Dandong knew someone who is a sex worker here. When I was in
              South America last December, I met quite a few retrenched bankers. Some
              of them were planning to come to Singapore to look for jobs.<br> <br> Regardless of where they come from, Singapore’s foreign crowd has gotten way bigger. <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>The government talks about squeezing 7.8 million people on this island. How are they going to do this?</strong></span> [Hint: I doubt it is going to be Singapore’s low birth rate doing the
              job.] The foreign population has become truly obvious since I left. I
              spent a Friday night at Clark Quay and <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>as
              I made my way back to the MRT station, I realized that everyone around
              me appears to be Caucasian. On some buses, I suddenly realized that the
              mainland Chinese accent was all around me. And that’s not to forget the
              Thais, Filipinos and Vietnamese.</strong></span><br> <br> I don’t really know what to make of this demographic change. Sometime
              back, I wrote about an article on income inequality in Singapore called
              “the Hawker and the Banker.” It struck a chord with many Singaporeans.
              But I now suspect that <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>the
              income inequality and rising costs might have roots in our foreign
              resident policy. One group of workers comes from developing countries.
              They work in low wage jobs, live in dormitories and eat in hawker
              centers. The other group comes from developed countries – largely
              Caucasian with a sprinkling of wealthy Chinese, Indonesian, Korean or
              Japanese. They get salaries that are multiples of what local graduates
              get, live in service apartments or condominiums, and hangout in Clark
              Quay or the city</strong></span>. And never the twain shall meet.<br> <br> The setting of this picture is the city-state of Singapore. And sitting
              in the backdrop, the question for Singaporeans must be: what do we make
              of this? <span style="color: red;"><strong>Economically,
              I believe local graduate salary failed to keep pace with inflation
              (especially in the city area). The money brought in by the rich
              expatriate crowd goes into housing, entertainment and fine dining. What
              do new graduates feel about entertainment and housing costs soaring
              above their means?</strong></span> If I once winced at eating at Crystal
              Jade, I now shudder at the thought. In turn, this system requires the
              poor foreign worker segment, without which the average Singaporean
              might find Singapore quite unaffordable rather quickly.<br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>And what does all this mean for the Singaporean identity?</strong></span> We asked ourselves this a long time ago, but this question is all the more urgent today. <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>When
              I read former Prime Minister Goh’s comments on the urgent tasks facing
              Singaporeans, I wonder if our leaders are out of touch. Does his list
              of questions resonate with your concerns? What does all this mean for
              social stability? Will widening income inequality and resentment
              towards a rich foreign crowd make Singapore a Xinjiang?</strong></span> Sounds ridiculous but just mention the stereotyped rich White man and
              his Singaporean girlfriend to the average Singaporean male and you can
              see how resentment roils under the surface…<br> <br> -----------------------<br> <br> <span style="color: navy;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Latest updates @ <a href="http://singaporenewsalternative.blogspot.com/">Singapore News Alternative</a>:</span><br> <br> 1.

              <p><br>I suppose better than u take over.  If you ever take over I believe you make this a whore nation.     Think you will gain more talking to your counterparts - or kwee kong and or kwee pohs.   Unfortunately , the audience here are not your counterparts thus not able to exchange any info on the prostitution business to benefit you.</p>
