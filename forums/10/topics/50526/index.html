            <div class='col-md body'>no kidding... when i saw the clown on CNA, i was like: u mean it took u so long to come to a conclusion?<br><br>3 months to make a feeble response is pathetic... it would've made more of an impact if it had been sooner... hmmm... quite strange cos the book was published in both english AND malay... u mean they can't read either languages properly?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  OH... they can't read!!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>quite obviously got another agenda... probably domestic. dr. M has delivered his farewell speech, the transition is still not complete... he probably wants to make some noise, make himself visible so that the PM designate would think that he's doing some work...<br><br>Sg slamming always goes down well with the public...<br><br>but seriously... it would be good to see what they can come up with. always a good idea to read both sides of the story. publishing such papers probably won't solve the water problem between Sg and M'sia, but it will leave behind a treasure throve of info for researchers and historians  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>some good has come out of it after all...</div>

Does he really want the relationship to mend?<br><br>It may not be in his hands, if a commentary written some years back by Mr Abdullah Ahmad, MalaysiaÂ’s special envoy to the United Nations, is any guide.<br><br>Mr Abdullah, a personal friend of Mr Syed HamidÂ’s, had argued: "The Malaysian foreign policy has always reflected the personality of the prime minister ... A Malaysian foreign minister, like all his counterparts, has never had much influence over policy decisions."<br><br>That could explain why the London-educated Mr Syed Hamid sometimes changes his tone. </blockquote>an excerpt from the article posted above...<br><br>i would argue that there's no such things as an "independent" foreign policy for any country. foreign policy is always an extension of the personalities of the politicians and domestic politics.<br><br>lets hope that the new PM would be in a better position to shape domestic sentiments to support a more mellow and reasonable foreign policy.<br><br></div>

Dr Mahathir is renowned to be a headstrong and stubborn leader, and is likely to continue playing hardball with Singapore throughout the rest of his tenure.<br><br>This has led some to believe that a change will come only when he steps down in October, when his deputy, Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, takes over.<br><br>Although it is still too early yet to tell what kind of prime minister Mr Badawi will be, he is widely considered a kinder, gentler leader who disdains confrontation. Still, many political observers say there will be great pressure on him to stand tough against Singapore.<br><br>``Badawi is definitely more accommodating than Mahathir, and personally I think he will try to tone things down a bit,'' former MP Mr Wong said. ``But don't forget, he's a politician first and foremost.''<br><br>This is a point echoed by academic-turned-opposition politician Rustam Sani, who has known Mr Badawi since the 1960s. ``As a person he's a nice guy, but if he has to take a hard stance [against Singapore] to win political points, I think he will do it.''<br><br>Whether Mr Badawi is the man to create a better environment for solving bilateral issues is yet to be seen, but it is obvious the key lies with the approach.<br><br>``What it takes is statesmanship from both sides,'' Mr Chandra said, ``not just good political leadership but true statesmanship.''</span><br><br><a href="http://www.singapore-window.org/sw03/030121bp.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.singapore-window.org/sw03/030121bp.htm</a><br></blockquote>The above article was taken from the archive of the SingaporeWindow, for further readings on the historical dispute between Malaysia and Singapore visit:<br><br><a href="http://www.singapore-window.org/malaysia.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.singapore-window.org/malaysia.htm</a><br><br></div>
