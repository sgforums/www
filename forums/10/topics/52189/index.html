            <div class='col-md body'>When I was young....I remembered watching my mom "leaving" me every morning....to "somewhere"......I always wondered and asked myself....."Why is she leaving me??? Where is she going every morning???" You see, my mom was a school teacher.....every morning she left us at our aunt's before going to school. That was her daily routine. I could see the sad look on her face. Just as sad as I was....yet she would eventually leave. After kissing me through the bannister on the verandah....she would leave for work. One day....I actually asked her these questions.....and she replied to me that "she had to go to work..." I didn't really understood what she meant by "I have to go to work"....what was that thing called "work"??? All I knew then was I had this terrible feeling within....I hated seeing her leave....I hated seeing her go.... I only came to realise the meaning of why people went to work only when I grew up, of course. But...wouldn't it be nice if we could just work for shorter hours everyday....just so that we could spend more time with our family and loved ones...??? Anyway....it was just a thought...</div>
