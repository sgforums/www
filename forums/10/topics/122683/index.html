A domestic servant "serves" her employer by making sure his physical comforts are met.<br><br>A government "serves" its people by ensuring that meritocratically, every citizen has an opportunity to pursue his/her own aspirations that are for the good of himself and the nation. This service implies that tough decisions resulting in policies that hurt in the short term will reward us in the long term.</div>
