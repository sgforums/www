              <p>They are under influence of state propaganda media.</p>
              <p>They are not aware that it is PAP regime propaganda.</p>
              <p>The chief reason why they are not aware that it is state
              propaganda is because there is no alternative independent media to
              propagate information to the public.</p>
              <p>Since all mainstream media is controlled by state and propagate
              same information, most people assume that the information is the
              "truth".</p>
              <p>When in fact it is nothing but state propaganda.</p>
              <p>In Taiwan, where there are many independent media outlets, there
              is variety of information and opinion and the public can compare
              the outlets and tell which is state propaganda.</p>
              <p>The point here is "can compare".</p>
              <p>In Singapore, there is no "can compare", since all media is the
              same.</p>
              <p>As a result of this lack of "can compare", people make the fatal
              error of assuming state media can give them "truth".</p>
              <p>When in fact it was only Lee Kuan Yew's propaganda.</p>

              <p>I think those who voluntarily drop their citizenship are true world talents as migration is not for anyone. Not anyone Qualifies for migration.</p>
              <p>Especially so is when destination of migration is to 1st worlds like Australia where they have super strict immigration policies.</p>
              <p>Some think just a degree will land you a citizenship in australia.</p>
              <p>Your experience, skills and cert needs to be in demand. So, not any cert will do. If they have enough of the skills, they don't need you.</p>
              <p>Credential aspect is the easy part.</p>
              <p>The tough thing is mental aspect.</p>
              <p>Can you uproot from Singapore ? Are you as mobile as our new immigrants? Are you as adaptable as our new immigrants? Are you Global Literate? (you know what this means?)</p>
              <p>Are you sure? Leaving behind your friends and comfort zone and start all over again for good? Are you really sure?</p>
              <p>Yet, so many voluntarily drop their citizenship.</p>
              <p>If they had survived in singapore for so long, I am sure they can survive anywhere.</p>
              <p>I heard BMW is cheap in Australia compared to singapore.</p>
              <p>I heard a freehold bungalow with nice view is cheap in Australia compared to singapore.</p>
              <p>I heard their citizens children get free education upto University and even doctorate, but only if they like to study to become a professor.</p>
              <p>I hear that Australia has many places to vacation and getaway on weekends. The weather also can be shiok shiok. Got snow in 1 particular place year round. surprised? you should be.</p>
              <p>I heard its a nice place to retire.</p>
              <p>I heard its very near to New Zealand, a land of extreme nature beauty.</p>
              <p>Nice lakes and mountains and rivers and coasts and beaches. Place is too big for you to get sick of it.</p>
              <p>I no no ler. I asking only.</p>

              <p>The PAP Regime rejected Jurong GRC By-Election so they can retain 4 MPs as Ministers. It appears that the people´s mandate is not a good enough reason for by-election. Poll carried by theonlinecitizen.com has already indicated that public opinion favours by-election regardless if the 4 MPs have to temporarily loose their ministerial positions. Their very act to reject the People´s mandate also rejects the legitimacy of the PAP government. It is time for us to take back what is ours. It is time to rid PAP. PAP is a dinosaur, which should have died with other dinosaurs 65M years ago.</p>

              <p>let's just say that the PAP is the ultimate babysitter. the PAP shall also decide what it wants YOU AND EVERYONE else to be. the model singaporean. whatever that may be. TV Mobile is one powerfull weapon. its stuffed in your face (and ears) to control people socially. the amount of crap spewing from it is amazing. brainwashing those who do not yet buy into the crap that is existent.</p>
              <p>off course there are different kinds of people. i believe that it is part of human nature to stay in your comfort zone and to evade difficulty and hardship if possible. i mean, honestly, who wants to live a hard life? so therefore, some or should i say most would rather not risk being thrown out of their comfort zone in the hope for something better, as compared to a few gutsy ones  who have never been in their comfort zones anyways who would move on (if possible) for a better chance at life.</p>
              <p>reality bites..........sometimes REALLY HARD. i wish all the fortunate ones who are or who have already left, the very best. just remember that its not going to be a bed of roses either. you can always call your real friends who hope the best always turns out for you.</p>
              <p>as for the rest of us, how about improving our lives by doing what we can (whatever is not controlled by PAP) by being less selfish? ha ha, easier said than done, coz we're all selfish human beings. but better to have a few more than none at all is'nt it? its actually the small everyday things that snowball and affect ppl more than anything else, really..............</p>
              <p>the trouble is that we all censor ourselves in almost everything out of fear of others. fear of dispproval from friends, family, authority. does'nt help that this is singapore(everything stupid damn thing is about face). aiyah actually its sometimes also pride lah, i call it the greatest sin in mankind. we censor ourselves to keep the ''peace'' (includes being politically correct). fearing that we might offend others and cause unconfortable situations which a lot of ppl here don't know how to handle.  so, what happens after that? our feelings stay on. negative ones as well, and these slowly grow into this ugly thing called resentment. THAT"S WHERE  WARS BEGIN. can be prevented if only ppl were more willing to be more honest with one another and willing to solve problems amicably rather than evading them.</p>
