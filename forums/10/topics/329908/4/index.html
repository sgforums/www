              <p>Back to my point.... Since sg is always Pay And Pay... I am surprised why the garmen never apply this plan... Just make it difficult to migrate... Those who wants to become PR in other countries must pay additional tax that they have worked overseas... If they want to throw away citizenship, then make them pay a very hefty sum until they cant afford to leave...</p>
              <p>If these works, there's no need for so much 'empty-spaces' in sg...</p>
              <p>About the birthrate problem. Just set an amount of children that a couple should bear. If they dont meet the 'quota', then just give them a fine... It's like the olden days, just vice versa...</p>
              <p>Yes, this will make sg reans suffer a little more. And make sg reans be like birds in a huge cage... But since when did they care about sg reans?</p>

It's a show that is potrayed by people living in sg, unless they make real documentaries that sg reans are 'suffering' overseas...</p>

              <p>my guess is because your new place got alot of freedom so you are practising your rights to visit forums.</p>
              <p>every place will have it's problem, but when you encounter problems in your new place, just think about sg, go to the conclusion that the place is still better than sg, and you will be fine.</p>
