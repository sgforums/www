            <div class='col-md body'><p>1 suggestion: Just stop making the citizen feel like 3rd class in their own country.  that show is just another propoganda in a controlled media. singapore is not bad but there are a lot more push factors in the country and a lot more pull factors from other countries wooing Singaporeans to go there. So its not just so simplistic a view as protrayed on TV. This kind of TV show is for people who have never seen the world like my MIL who thinks that everything shown on TV is the truth and nothing but the truth. It was so sad to hear her say the PAP is taking care of the people with their progress package and therefore she voted for them and she even insisted that i vote the same as her just because she gets that stupid progress package thing. She is believes in PAP all the way that it is disgusting that she can explain away all their policies simply saying that its good for us. Wait till the "FT" take the jobs away from her sons then she will kow peh</p></div>

              <p>after leaving, then apply PR, becos PR benefit is more than citizen. moreover, Government consider PR as FT, instead as being a citizen are consider as idoit</p>

              <p><br>I share the same sentiments (highlighted in blue).   The way they are, I don't see any opposition will be taking over in the next 10, 15, 20 years.  The only possibility I see in the next election is there will be further drop in the winning percentage of Pay and Pay, that is all.</p>
              <p>Regardless whether they are aware of the propaganda or not, many still support it to benefit themselves for the time.   These people are just "short sighted".  As such, it is easy job for Pay and Pay to run Singapore, sinkies are just too easy to manipulate.</p>

              <p>They are under influence of state propaganda media.</p>
              <p>They are not aware that it is PAP regime propaganda.</p>
              <p>The chief reason why they are not aware that it is state propaganda is because there is no alternative independent media to propagate information to the public.</p>
              <p>Since all mainstream media is controlled by state and propagate same information, most people assume that the information is the "truth".</p>
              <p>When in fact it is nothing but state propaganda.</p>
              <p>In Taiwan, where there are many independent media outlets, there is variety of information and opinion and the public can compare the outlets and tell which is state propaganda.</p>
              <p>The point here is "can compare".</p>
              <p>In Singapore, there is no "can compare", since all media is the same.</p>
              <p>As a result of this lack of "can compare", people make the fatal error of assuming state media can give them "truth".</p>

              <p>They are under influence of state propaganda media.</p>
              <p>They are not aware that it is PAP regime propaganda.</p>
              <p>The chief reason why they are not aware that it is state propaganda is because there is no alternative independent media to propagate information to the public.</p>
              <p>Since all mainstream media is controlled by state and propagate same information, most people assume that the information is the "truth".</p>
              <p>When in fact it is nothing but state propaganda.</p>
              <p>In Taiwan, where there are many independent media outlets, there is variety of information and opinion and the public can compare the outlets and tell which is state propaganda.</p>
              <p>The point here is "can compare".</p>
              <p>In Singapore, there is no "can compare", since all media is the same.</p>
              <p>As a result of this lack of "can compare", people make the fatal error of assuming state media can give them "truth".</p>
              <p>When in fact it was only Lee Kuan Yew's propaganda.</p>

              <p><br>Not difficult to know what sort of person LKY is.    He has the propensity to control, control, control.   A man under the bondage of power and authority.</p>
              <p>Native son to lead us -  I believe this will not materialise during my lifetime here.</p>
              <p>Actually, LKY is pro China not the west.   He slams the west for democracy, he dislikes the west for exposing his dirt.   He "carries" china so much, to the extent of allowing so many PRC here and  give them scholarship.  </p>
