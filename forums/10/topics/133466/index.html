The women could be of great assistance in the medical side if they are given the time to train. Their NS term need not be the full 2yrs the guys need to serve. I believe a shorter term, say 1 year, will b sufficient for first aid, paramedic training, etc and some internship at hospitals and other medical institutes</div>

Their NS term need not be the full 2yrs the guys need to serve. I believe a shorter term, say 1 year, will b sufficient for first aid, paramedic training, etc and some internship at hospitals and other medical institutes</div></blockquote>I would agree too that it might be a good idea to make NS mandatory for women for at least a year, especially with the declining birth rates. Women could go through a lighter version of BMT and perhaps be provided with the option of either going into first aid/civil defence or to continue with military training (with the option for them to extend their NS for the full term, like the men). Reservist training should also apply for women but perhaps cease when they become mothers.</div>
