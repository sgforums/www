My point is that we should say "OK, this is the minimum level of fitness that a combat soldier will need in order to be effective in combat". After having determined that level, it should be applied uniformly to all combat soldiers, across all age groups and across all genders. In other words, it should be like a qualifying test.<br><br>I have no objections to varying the standards required for the various silver or gold awards.

Let say you expect a 21 year old to run 2.4 km at 12 minutes 20 seconds. This is the minimum expected for someone of his age assuming he puts in the effort to stay fit etc. and yes it is currently implemented<br><br>Lets review what it would mean for a 35 year old. Let say 12.20 for a 35 year old would be equivilent to 10.00 for a 21 year old, you might disagree on this but this is a rough gauge and is based on what I said earlier about physical differences across the ages<br><br>If one were to insist that all of the minimum fitness criterias across the cats be the same, you would be insisting that a 35 year old run must run at near Gold fitness. Perhaps a number would be able to run at that speed. In reality, a huge number won't be able to run at that speed.<br><br>Even if they were to dedicate their life to just achieving an IPPT pass, a lot of them will still fail since at their current age, many health problems will arise such as heart problems etc...<br><br>Even the current minimum criteria is easily achieved. If one were to lead a sedentary lifestyle, it is not likely that he will pass the "minimum" criteria.<br><br>Hence Cat X would have a higher "minimum criteria" than Cat Y for the next age group and the same for Cat Z.</div>

A lot of them would think they are fit for running at 13.30, even though the reality is that combat fitness at their age requires them to run at 12.20.<br><br>Granted some units require a silver, some require a gold. But after ORD, many will aim for 13.30 as their minimum. That will effectively reduce the overall fitness of the Army.<br><br>I understand that you are concerned that the oldies might be getting it easy. I can't answer you about whether Cat Z is the minimum requirement to operate as an efficient combat unit. But, it should be the limit that a 35 year old be expected to perform physically, unless SAF is really screwed up..<br><br>I stand-by what I said earlier, there can be no one-standard for all age groups..

            <div class='col-md body'>About the economy being affected...Well I am sure Mr Lee Kuan Yew thought about it thoroughly when he enlisted all the men into NS. I sure did not hear anyone complaining that it would affect the economy or cause an influx of foreign workers or anythig. If the guys could be enlisted without a big fuss why not the girls...<br><br>Gender equality. Are u implying that girls are inferior to guys in singapore today. If yes then please do tell me where? In studies, don't girls score as well or even better than the guys and get an head start of 2yrs to start their job.<br>In the job market, 2yrs head start and qualifications is all that matter and girls can even sue for the simplest slight of discrimination.<br><br>Are we guys getting more respect from the girls that we serve the army?<br><br>Do the girls go 'omg, ur are protecting our lives!!! I love u sooooo much' or isit 'Haha, kena NS ah, gd luck...my sympathies la.'<br><br>You muz be kidding me.<br><br>I am sure if the girls were made to do the equal amount of work in other sectors such as simply doing clerk work or data entry or stuff and being paid like we NS man do, I am sure the country could save a huge chunk of money and rely less on foreigners even if its for 1year. Wouldn't it be a greater 'service' done to singapore.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Lets put it this way. I'm a NSF currently, and i have been pissed time and time again in the army. It sux...i can give you that. But if you take a step back and think, this consrcipted army status has been chosen for what i feel to be good enough reasons.<br><br>MM Lee once stated the reasons behind implementing a conscripted army. Once the Brits left, defence was left to ourseleves. We had 3 options. 1 was to sign a defence treaty with neighbouring nations, for example Malaysia and Indonesia, stating that in times of war, THEIR armies would defend US. This method is not unproven as Gambia and Senegal have a similar treaty that has been put to the test before. It held up. But seriously, would you like Singapore to always be at a dis-advantage by having neighbouring countries defend us?<br><br>The second option to provide protection to this small nation would be to have an almost entirely mercenary army. Whether they would hold key positions was never contemplated, as this option was thrown out the minute it was brought up for obvious reasons.<br><br>The last option was to have a conscripted army that would provide the country with a continous stream of soldiers to fall back upon should war truly break out. This, supplemented with defence treaties with other nations would at least ensure that we have a chance should someone try to attack us. So in view of all this...i guess not matter how much i hate this, i have to agree with it. It is not perfect, but it is the best that we have.<br><br>Also, as for whether girls should serve national service too? I don't think it would be a good idea. Girls will hardly understand guys as will guys understand girls, so lets just leave it as that. Having them serve in a hospital environment would be extremely dangerous not only to the patients, but also to fellow full-time staff and even more to themselves. The number one cause of fear for nurses arround is a needle prick injury. You can be infected with HIV if you are not careful. And if you say that NS nurses don't have to handle needles, put it this way. You can't plan for everything. Shit happens.<br><br>So i say...this NS thing has become part of our culture. Live with it. Girls are meant to complement guys, not do the things we do. If they don't understand, then so be it. We don't understand a lot of things that they go through also. And no matter what, i feel that the army is for guys only, at least the frontline army. It is battle proven that if guys fight besides girls, they will fight much worse than if its all guys because they naturally will want to take care of the girls and not take new grounds.</div>

While I wish to be in the university with my female compatriots, I fully understand the responsibilities I have to fufil as a citizen of this country. So, I have no qualms whatsoever abt servin my nation though this is sometimes put to the test - this being a free to view site, I dun wish to go into details.<br><br>Concerning the issue of whether females should serve national service, I believe that the status quo should be retained.<br><br>I would like all of you to consider the impact of females being drawn into national service.<br><br>Firstly, the changes would lead to a whole batch of female undergraduates/workers being withdrawn from their academic and job persuits. This has serious economic consequences, given the fact that there would be fewer graduates/workers introduced into the job market for that particular year and the subsequant years to come (depending on how long they decide females should serve).<br><br>Some might argue that this might be the perfect solution to our close to stagnated economy. We might be able to get 'foreigners' to fill in the jobs. However, another problem arises when the females together with their male compatriots ORD! We will have to compete with foreigners for jobs, and there might be even a shrtage of jobs and this problem will be here to stay with a surplus of graduates entering the job market after fufiling their academic persuits.<br><br>Eventually, a rise in unemployment (our current predicament is that we are struggling to create new jobs) may see a rise in social problems and that is just the beginning of it all<br><br>Secondly, the changes would require a radical overhaul of the structure of the SAF. How would such changes affect the operatability of the SAF? In such precarious times (with the ever looming threat of terrorism and rising oil prices), what would be the consequances?<br><br>Thirdly, are Singaporean men willing to give due recongnition to their female compatriots after undergoing NS. The females will demand for greater gendar equality. Are we men prepared to recognise this? Are we prepared to face the social consequances of 'a more independent-minded woman'? Male-Female relations will never be the same, I'm talking abt a cultural shift here.<br><br>NS is a way of life in Singapore. Hate it or like it (I saw some Officer wearing his number 4 in orchird road. Really feel like slapping him!) We lanlan have to serve. Change, we do need change from time to time, but the changes we take have to be calculated.Personally, I'm all for gender equality and thus there should not be one law for man and another for woman. The introduction of females has several permutations; which in this present climate might lead to undesirable consequances for our nation as a whole. This, we cannot afford to bear.<br></div></blockquote>your 1st point i guess its valid but i would say restructuring of the economy and job market occurs all the time i doubt it will really have as much an impact as you would infer. out of point but perhaps takign a leaf out of malaysia's system where balloting is done might be a good idea where the problem you describe is negated but the guys do not feel as shortchanged.<br><br>2ndly, the overhual in the system would not be that drastic since there are females in the system at the moment even if they are not nsf but they do have to go through most if not all the things guys have to go through. inaddition the overhual can be done gradually with minimal or no effect on the operationality.  and the overhual will again i feel not be as disruptive as you are trying to say or feel.<br><br>3rd, you mean females are not trying to fight for more advantages/equalities?(just a side note but i feel a system where a company has to employ like 40% females at least is an advantage to the females and not equality since it ensures they have higher chances in the company whereas males do not have this safety net) whether males are willing to give equal credit is not really a issue is it? as long as credit is given if some pple privately do not acknowledge the credit is it really an issue<br><br>i am not sure but you seem to feel only bad things can come out of changing the system and that you are unwillign to take risks. i would say that it isn't a veyr good view to take of things, nothign personal</div>

Right now my stand is with those who suggested tt gals help out in the service n support/logistics sector n be given NS pay. No 1 here ever suggested gals go fight in the frontline, unless they volunteer to. SG cud use Israel as a case study and work things out. If ladies r equiped with basic medical skills, in the event of a war they can help the wounded n save lifes. in peacetime who knows, they cud help, EG, perform CPR on a drowning kid.<br>There r many pros n cons but u must check out both, dun be 1 sided ok? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
