However, to me, some acceptable level of skills is better than no skills at all. Sure, a conscripted nurse might take several attempts to successfully draw a blood sample from a patient (to use as an example). The end result, though, is that we get to free up the professional nurses for the more urgent and serious casualties.<br><br>If anything, the peacetime effects will be favourable as well. Having a large pool of trained first-aiders can be useful in case of domestic emergencies, such as people having heart attacks at home, or a kid with a broken leg.</div>

If gals are serving national service, they have to take their jobs seriously or they will be charged under SAF Act. There will be black sheep everywhere but that is not a reason whey we should hold back.<br><br>Medication is hospital wards are dispensed by staff nurses, so this will not be an issue. Their role will be mainly supportive, such as transporting patients, bathing them, cleaning wounds, etc. In the hospitals, our nurses don;t even have to draw blood or set drips like our medics do.

            <div class='col-md body'>Have been to my share of seminars, and hereÂ’s the official stand as I rememberedÂ…<br><br>The primary reason why female conscription for medical/clerical roles is not implemented is because there is already a surplus of personnel in those vocations. Lots and lots of guys with downgraded PES status - all classified as non-combatants.<br><br>What the Army needs is more combat-fit manpower - and here is where there's a split in the crowd asking for females to undertake national service. For those that advocate females doing a non-combat role, such a plan lacks feasibility because it will consume precious resources - displacement from economic productivity, training, logistic and accommodation costs, all these costs just to add more manpower to an area that is already saturated.<br><br>So in the end itÂ’s either to make the ladies take up combat roles like the Israeli model, or to leave them out totally.<br><br>At the moment, how many of those men/women calling for female conscription are actually pro-enlistment of females in combat roles? Female commandoes? Female combat engineers? Female armored infantry?<br><br>Making combat troopers out of conscripted females is a sensitive topic. Will the average female be able to contribute to a combat role, or will they end up as liabilities? How to integrate or segregate the sexes if both were on the combat front?<br><br>The idea of female conscription is nothing new... its just that the situation is still not bad enough for our leaders to consider drafting the ladies in to hoist the guns.<br></div>

Not many women are going to enjoy taking up the gauntlet of doing NS and will instead come up with lame excuses to get around it.<br><br>If you want to know, those were the contents of a letter to the Straits Times Forum page by a female reader a few years back. The main point of her letter was that women 'do NS by giving birth'. I remember being incredibly incensed by her remarks as she went on to say that we guys are basically 'having fun' in NS.<br><br>You don't forget things like that - even after a few years.<br><br>The plain and simple truth is that there can be no such thing as pure gender equality.

Lots and lots of guys with downgraded PES status - all classified as non-combatants.<br><br></div></blockquote>The official explanation is really flimsy. NS is not the same as army services alone. NS is national service and doing service in the army is just one<br>"faculty" of NS.  If women can enter the work place like the men and demand equal pay and benefits, the same should also be accorded to women in NS like what the men are put through. That's plain fairness and non-discrimination to any sex.  And no one is saying women have to join the men in ARMY NS! There are other faculty of NS for the women to enrol.<br><br>I think the leaders would rather not think out of the box but sit real tight in the box (and let the boys suffer) because to open new faculties of NS and do something like NS for women is doing things out  of the box and the protests and repercussions from parents and females will be so explosive that the leaders feel it would jeopardise their votes at the polls.<br><br>Literally, imo, NS for women is preferred to be buried than a hornet's nest stirred.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This NS debate is a classical case of women not knowing what they want. Women scream for equality and their main issues are being discriminated against and the glass ceiling.<br><br>Women continue to belittle men in certain ways such as the NS issue etc will cause greater discrimination by men. Also, the failure to take up greater responsibility (such as NS) ensures the glass ceiling will always be there.<br><br>Furthermore, as long as women want priviledges without the accountability and responsibility, they will continue to be seen as second fiddle to men.<br><br>Women also constantly sabotage themselves. While they whine about the glass ceiling, they use tears and sexuality to avoid work or pass work off to others to do. they whine about being equal to men, yet refuse to take up more responsibilities.<br><br>Everything they say about "gentlemen" and dating is all a celebration of inequality. Do women want to do away with all that priviledges?</div>

Seriously, I don't mind and to me, these kind of service is simply a bit of character building for people. And some girls really need some character building. Seriously, in war scenario, do you truly think the women will sit aside and not do anything? If they did, I would suggest our men shoot them instead. But on the converse (if technology allows), when a girl have a baby, how many guys would enthusiatically proclaim he wish to get pregnant too and experience himself first hand the pregnancy and gush to everyone how wonderful it feels to have crazy hormonal surges, cravings, carry the baby to full term and have a c-section and see how the doc lift the baby out. I think men rather go to war than give birth.<br><br>somehow some guys in here like to view all females as vile creatures and threads like this will become gender bashing threads. Have you not noticed there is not much female presence  in threads that potentially end up in flame wars. Simply because there is no point. Some of the guys are just too dogmatic and stubborn to even communicate with.<br></div>
