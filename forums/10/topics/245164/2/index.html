            <div class='col-md body'>can I bring this information to you guys before we get too stuck in the question on the pay-rise of ministers?<br><br>We are only focusing on the pay-increase they are trying to push thru (1.2m to 2.2m). This does NOT include bonuses<br><br>We are NOT LOOKING at the bonuses. Read somewhere that their bonus is 6 months' MINIMUM, regardless of performance.<br><br>THEREFORE, raising their pay to 2.2m is NOT JUST a 1m difference. If you include their bonuses (which is paid based on their monthly salary), its MUCH MORE.<br><br>And by the way, just to answer that silly lawyer. I am not envious, I just think they are NOT WORTH THAT MUCH, and they DON'T DESERVE it. So far, I don't know what achievements this current batch of jokers have made for this country. In fact, I struggle to think of what good they have done.</div>

But you say to yourselves, Â“Well, you know, what do we seek in life? We seek a rice bowl, full!Â”<br><br>It is full and overflowing, in fact. They serve you your rice in a jade bowl with golden chopsticks; not that it makes much difference to the taste of the rice. But youÂ’re empty!<br><br>YouÂ’ve got technocratic skills and you are seeking more but internally you are empty. Money is your acid test of success.<br><br>IÂ’ve got nothing against money. IÂ’d like to have money myself! IÂ’d like to have a house and a garden and dogs and a car and a chauffeur but, look, IÂ’ve got a flat. IÂ’ve got a swimming pool attached to the flat. IÂ’ve not even got a car but I use taxis. I have a dignified way of life without being wealthy.<br><br>I donÂ’t see the necessity of owning a Mercedes-Benz and a swimming pool and a couple of mistresses. I think weÂ’ve got our values all wrong.<br><br>You know $96,000 a month for a Prime Minister and $60,000 a month for a minister. What the hell do you do with all that money? You canÂ’t eat it! What do you do with it? Your children donÂ’t need all that money.<br><br>My children have had the best of education. In fact, IÂ’m very proud of them. One of them is a senior registrar to two major hospitals in Oxford. Another of them is a consultant in European law to the Securities and Investment Board in the United Kingdom. TheyÂ’ve had their education. There are no complaints.<br><br><span style="color: red;">I never earned $60,000 a month or $90,000 a month. When I was Chief Minister, I earned $8,000 a month. Look, what is happening today is we are encouraged to and are becoming worshippers of the Golden Calf.<br><br>We have lost sight of the joy and excitement of public service, helping our fellow men. The joy and excitement of seeking and understanding of the joy of the miracle of the living the duty and the grandeur. We have lost taste for heroic action in the service of our people.<br><br>We have become good bourgeois seeking comfort, security. ItÂ’s like seeking a crystal coffin and being fed by intravenous injections through pipes in the crystal coffin; crystal coffins stuck with certificates of your pragmatic abilities.</span><br><br>What has changed?<br><br>The self-confidence of our people has grown immensely, and that is good to see. Our pragmatic abilities have grown magnificently, and that is good to see. Very good to see!<br><br>You are very able. YouÂ’re ambitious, and the government has heroic plans for the future. It hasnÂ’t finished.<br><br>I take off my hat to the pragmatic ability of our government but there is no soul in our conduct. It is a difficult thing to speak of because it is difficult to put in a computer, and the youth of Singapore is accustomed to computer fault. There is no longer the intellectual ferment, the passionate argument for a better civilisation. The emphasis on the rice bowl!<br><br>Tell me IÂ’m wrong, come on.</span><br>***<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> And to the lawyer:<br><br>[b]<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Qn: WHAT WOULD YOU TELL YOUTHS WHO INTEND TO PURSUE A CAREER IN LAW?</span></strong><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="color: red;">Try and understand that the law is a vocation and not a business.</span> Respect your client irrespective of the fees. I used to charge $1 for a murder case if he was Malay because he had no money. I used to charge $1 to trade unions; all Malay unions, I charged $1 a year. And the $1 is simply because, if you do it for nothing, you are not liable in negligence whereas $1 makes a contract and, if you are negligent, they can sue you.<br><br>IÂ’d like them to also understand that justice is a meld of law and humanity. Law and humanity; decency in concepts; if we administer law by the soulless logic of the computer, we arenÂ’t on our road to progress....</span><br><br><a href="http://thinkhappiness.blogspot.com/2006/08/meeting-david-marshall-in-1994.html" rel="nofollow">Meeting David Marshall in 1994</a><br><br>Cheers[/b]</blockquote>Erm.. $8000 a month in those days in the 50's when  he was Chief Minister.<br>And he was comparing to the current wages for the govt?<br><br>Isnt it is a very high pay when during those times a bowl of noodles is only in cents? And everything is cheaper then and life much easier.<br><br>I find it contradicting.. can anyone enlighten?<br><br>Anyway i do feel the ministers are earning alot.. i agree with his ideas.<br><br>IF i were to become a Member of Parliament holding a govt position, it is my honour to serve my country and i will reject high pay, just need a token of appreciation. Just enough to keep my family living in comfort without any extravangrant spending.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Seriously u will reject the high pay if u are minister? u must be joking.<br><br>Well as we all know, Singapore Government = PAP and Singapore government has huge influence over the court (Government chooses the Chief of Justice if I am not wrong). At least we never seen a case where the Court ruled against the Government (dun tell me the Government is always right).<br><br>Wat can we all do? Whining on the forum only.
