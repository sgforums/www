            <div class='col-md body'>Was this quote/interview in the context of the salary debate in 1994 when LKY was leading the charge for pegging their pay to the top salaries in the private sector?<br><br>BTW, I think this quote is really powerful. Basically, he points out the main flaw in today's government - They only have"got technocratic skills" but serve without a sense of value, integrity, honor i.e. "internally you are empty".<br><br>The ministers are now so used to a ilfe that is "full and overflowing", not only having an IRON bowl but a "jade bowl with golden chopsticks".<br><br>Basically, all of us should repeat this phrase loud to the ministers:<br>"What the hell do you do with all that money? You canÂ’t eat it! What do you do with it? Your children donÂ’t need all that money."<br><br>Also to note, 8k is big in the 50s, but not as big as 1.2mil with all the other perks in today's dollar.<br><br>At the end his speech boils down to this: You are already comfortably renumerated, get on with your job not as one doing it for the money but for the honor and vision of building something grand i.e. for others and for the people. Sadly this rhetoric is not only missing, it is totally ignored in todays government.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by Yunhaier:<br><strong> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Every time when they talk about their salary, this interview with David Marshall, back in 1994, always appear in my mind:<br><br>***<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">...And are youths the miasma of apathetic subservience to authority? But you say to yourselves, Â“Well, you know, what do we seek in life? We seek a rice bowl, full!Â”<br><br>It is full and overflowing, in fact. They serve you your rice in a jade bowl with golden chopsticks; not that it makes much difference to the taste of the rice. But youÂ’re empty!<br><br>YouÂ’ve got technocratic skills and you are seeking more but internally you are empty. Money is your acid test of success.<br><br>IÂ’ve got nothing against money. IÂ’d like to have money myself! IÂ’d like to have a house and a garden and dogs and a car and a chauffeur but, look, IÂ’ve got a flat. IÂ’ve got a swimming pool attached to the flat. IÂ’ve not even got a car but I use taxis. I have a dignified way of life without being wealthy.<br><br>I donÂ’t see the necessity of owning a Mercedes-Benz and a swimming pool and a couple of mistresses. I think weÂ’ve got our values all wrong.<br><br>You know $96,000 a month for a Prime Minister and $60,000 a month for a minister. What the hell do you do with all that money? You canÂ’t eat it! What do you do with it? Your children donÂ’t need all that money.<br><br>My children have had the best of education. In fact, IÂ’m very proud of them. One of them is a senior registrar to two major hospitals in Oxford. Another of them is a consultant in European law to the Securities and Investment Board in the United Kingdom. TheyÂ’ve had their education. There are no complaints.<br><br><span style="color: red;">I never earned $60,000 a month or $90,000 a month. When I was Chief Minister, I earned $8,000 a month. Look, what is happening today is we are encouraged to and are becoming worshippers of the Golden Calf.<br><br>We have lost sight of the joy and excitement of public service, helping our fellow men. The joy and excitement of seeking and understanding of the joy of the miracle of the living the duty and the grandeur. We have lost taste for heroic action in the service of our people.<br><br>We have become good bourgeois seeking comfort, security. ItÂ’s like seeking a crystal coffin and being fed by intravenous injections through pipes in the crystal coffin; crystal coffins stuck with certificates of your pragmatic abilities.</span><br><br>What has changed?<br><br>The self-confidence of our people has grown immensely, and that is good to see. Our pragmatic abilities have grown magnificently, and that is good to see. Very good to see!<br><br>You are very able. YouÂ’re ambitious, and the government has heroic plans for the future. It hasnÂ’t finished.<br><br>I take off my hat to the pragmatic ability of our government but there is no soul in our conduct. It is a difficult thing to speak of because it is difficult to put in a computer, and the youth of Singapore is accustomed to computer fault. There is no longer the intellectual ferment, the passionate argument for a better civilisation. The emphasis on the rice bowl!<br><br>Tell me IÂ’m wrong, come on.</span><br>***<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> And to the lawyer:<br><br>[b]<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Qn: WHAT WOULD YOU TELL YOUTHS WHO INTEND TO PURSUE A CAREER IN LAW?</span></strong><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="color: red;">Try and understand that the law is a vocation and not a business.</span> Respect your client irrespective of the fees. I used to charge $1 for a murder case if he was Malay because he had no money. I used to charge $1 to trade unions; all Malay unions, I charged $1 a year. And the $1 is simply because, if you do it for nothing, you are not liable in negligence whereas $1 makes a contract and, if you are negligent, they can sue you.<br><br>IÂ’d like them to also understand that justice is a meld of law and humanity. Law and humanity; decency in concepts; if we administer law by the soulless logic of the computer, we arenÂ’t on our road to progress....</span><br><br><a href="http://thinkhappiness.blogspot.com/2006/08/meeting-david-marshall-in-1994.html" rel="nofollow">Meeting David Marshall in 1994</a><br><br>Cheers[/b]</blockquote></div>
