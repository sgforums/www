              <p>Singapore is just a small nation.....so I am less worried about foreign intelligence mucking around and sabotaging in Singapore, or trying to steer its foreign policy one way or another.</p>
              <p>So, in that sense, the threat coming from within Singapore is relatively low-level, from certain radicalized people who wanted to take arms and avenge perceived injustices.</p>

              <p>It is interesting that these groups of people now attacking Mumbai are supposedly targetting British, American, visitors, as well as a Jewish center, while airing their grievances about Kashmir. I am just imagining about all this and I think it is very absurd. A group of teenagers and early 20s doing all this..? If they care about Kashmir why should they care about Jews..? Now it generate a lot of headlines from Western media sources as well as Israeli media outlets. I think it is highly probable to be another bullshit false-flag operation.</p>

              <p>Thank you, its heartening to see someone else that is able to look beyond media conditioning.</p>
              <p>If an attack really happens in SG, it probably isn't due to any foreign intelligence agencies because as you said, we're too insignificant. But the more frightening alternative is whether our government might pull something off to get some kind of PATRIOT Act deal passed. Not that we got lots of liberty to take away....</p>
              <p>The point is that for governments, false-flag ops are on the table, and they're willing to use it if it means expanding their powers.</p>

              <p>Yes, I agree with you. Bombing Singapore is a must and a victory for the terrorists.<br><br>A successful Singapore is the direct opposite of what an ideal caliphate is not. <br><br>Hitting Singapore will be a symbolic gesture to the world as Singapore represents the dream and aspiration of many third, second and first world nations.   </p>

              <p>Singapore is just a small nation.....so I am less worried about
              foreign intelligence mucking around and sabotaging in Singapore, or
              trying to steer its foreign policy one way or another.</p>
              <p>So, in that sense, the threat coming from within Singapore is
              relatively low-level, from certain radicalized people who wanted to
              take arms and avenge perceived injustices.</p>
              <p>That is totally different with Bali Bomb, Mumbai Attack, etc,
              9/11, all those are bullshit attacks which I am 99% sure have the
              involvement of foreign intelligence agencies.</p>
              <p>It is interesting that these groups of people now attacking
              Mumbai are supposedly targetting British, American, visitors, as
              well as a Jewish center, while airing their grievances about
              Kashmir. I am just imagining about all this and I think it is very
              absurd. A group of teenagers and early 20s doing all this..? If
              they care about Kashmir why should they care about Jews..? Now it
              generate a lot of headlines from Western media sources as well as
              Israeli media outlets. I think it is highly probable to be another
              bullshit false-flag operation.</p>

              <p>Well, since Al-Qaeda is a fictitious organisation created by the CIA, I would assume that its so-called sister group, JI, is also a front for government-sponsored terrorism.</p>
              <p>In his case, perhaps the escape was deliberate. But in any case, Singaporeans here are so cynical that the answer could fall both ways.</p>
              <p>I don't know the answer to that question. Do I know its a false-flag op? No. Do I know its not a false-flag op? No. I don't know, and neither do you.</p>

              <p>That will be a big step backward, isn't? But my guess is that when that happens, not the manner of a police state. A police state will be costly to run and the investors will flee. <br><br>More of a total control of the citizens' mind. More of a transformation of the ppl mind - total and unquestioning bowing to the rulers.   </p>
