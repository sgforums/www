And wat happened after US get invade Iraq now, and US can choose anyone to be the "arms inspectors" now. Is there any result gathered ? 1/2 a year, more time has been given to the new arms inspectors than US had given to Han Blix. Do they produce the same or worse result ?<br><br>North Korea issue. If u talked about WMD, then I have strong belief that North Korea has as many, or indeed more WMD than Iraq. Note: at tat period, Korea OPENLY declared he has WMD while there are no concrete evidence on Iraq case yet.<br><br>North Korea has sold their weopons to other countries, in a dubious, secretive and suspicious manner. If America is selling weopons to reputable countires like Taiwan and Singapore, they will be announcing right to everybody about it isn't it ? As said by u before<br><br>""""<br>The North Koreans have certainly sold their missiles and missile technologies to some of the rouge states in the Middle East and Africa, but they have not sold any weapons or WMD end products to groups such as Hamas, Al Qaeda, or the Hissbola Â–<br>""""<br><br>Hence the suspicious is not to myself only.<br><br>About Africa issue. I was just wondering from the above statement why do u think it is of lesser importance tat the weopons r sold to rouge states in the Middle East and Africa compared to groups like Hamas, Al Qaeda, or the Hissbola. I don't wanna add any additional points to tis anymore, since u tend to avoid tis statement u have said. I asked again.<br><br>Why do u think it is of lesser importance tat the weopons r sold to rouge states in the Middle East and Africa compared to groups like Hamas, Al Qaeda, or the Hissbola ?<br><br>So u find tat Iraq may produce WMD in the forms of Biological, Gas, or Nuclear device etc and stuff in car bombs and may send to other terrorrists group in the world. But up till now, is there any such agents found in the car bomb attacks ? No such attacks had been found and no concrete evidence that Iraq has manage to export such weopons and I believe that it is drawn from your own conclusion, expolating into a future possibilities.<br><br>One thing is for certain again. North Korea did sold its rocket launcher, rifles, missiles and maybe nuclear weopons to other dubious countries. They actually caught one of the ship trying to smuggle weopons. The grade of weopons sold from Korea, to me, is certainly a grade higher than those from Iraq. Using a rocket launcher, or missiles are better than using a typical car bomb.<br><br>""<br>With regards to the lawless situation in Iraq, the Iraqis are responsible in contributing to an unstable and volatile situation<br><br>Even just when Baghdad had fallen, and before Saddam, his Sons, and the leadership had been captured, the Iraqi Religious Leaders were already working the ground, agitating the Iraqi population to demonstrate to kick the US Army out of Iraq.<br><br>If this is not foolishness, what else can we describe the mind of the average Iraqi ?<br><br>"""<br><br>Is it because of the demostration by the Iraqis tat lead to no power, no water, no public servant, no jobs etc ? South Korea and Taiwanese can  have all the demostration they want, they still have their power, water and order etc. Is demostration considered lawlessness ? Are their demostration done to a big scale frequently ? Had demostration result in hindering the build up of reservoir and power grid ? With regards to lawlessness, is the sacking of all Saddam related offices like police and army the main cause or just demostration by the people ?<br><br>Initially I thought the more important reason why peace is not established is bacause of attack on US troop from the DIEHARD Saddam Loyalist and foreign elements. Tat is why I demand for explanation for why blame the whole Iraq if there is only a small number of such extremists.<br><br>In such a chaotic country with many tribes, many political parties trying to take control, it need someone who is harsher to take. Iraq has been deeply religius muslim country. If like America, suddenly exposing the people to mad rush of infomation, offering no control thus no order, it only result in creating more havoc and helplessness.<br><br>It was after being in control of a harsh leader for many years, after the dispute between different political parties and tribes have quiet down or put down, with years of education, then can they gradually increase the awareness of notions such as freedom, liberty and social grace.<br><br>As I have said, the person going to take over Iraq have not displayed any incredible talents, nor does it have any impressive merits under its belt. It is unlikely it will be harsh enough to put down any possible opposition thus resulting in lack of control. It will not gather the respect of the people and will not stop them from being rebellious.<br><br>For LKY issue, I have tis feeling tat u felt he did nothing impressive and anyone who was in his shoes will perform better. Wat others things does the government have then ? It has communists, it has disputes, riots fights between different races who are all speaking in their own languages, it's government is formed not long ago from a WW2, unemployment reached  unacceptable levels. Housing for the people r just wooden shacks, Malaysia isn't very friendly towards us then, world economy cannot be any more distressing and local Volunteer corps doesn't seemed to be a match for Indonesia army who has sent a cache of commandoes in. Problems seemed to pour at every turn. If British remains at the helm of singapore then, do u think the situation will be better ? At least be grateful for him.<br><br>""<br>After the first Gulf War, there were cries from Iraqi nationals for USA to intervene in the affairs of Iraq, and get rid of a cruel despot that knows only abuse in power.<br>""<br><br>US is just an idealistic fool hiding its real agenda of gathering its oil reserves. Well Iraqis r now also requesting American to leave, should USA stand aside ?<br><br>Wat I am trying to say is tat Saddam is bad, but he isn't any worse than many other countries. Military do not go about murder, rape and burning of their infrastructure. He has a lousy eldest son, thus he replaced his heir to his second eldest son. Their countries r not going hungry, and citizen get to have their education even for women. They joined in international sports such and women can took part in beauty pageants. And they do not have such things as 10 years national service (North Korea men have to serve tat long). Now compared it to North Korea.<br><br>10 years ago he did many atrocities, tat is true. But before he is disposed, wat r the things he have done ? If UN did nothing to them 10 years ago, why attack them now ?<br><br>I will be ending my note here, not replying anymore about tis issue as it appears to be endless.<br><br>I will still stick to my belief tat US is wrong in the attack and management of Iraq, and should be resisted to hold as an example for other nations not to declared war so recklessly. USA cannot act in such a unilateralism manner.<br><br>Atobe will still believe tat attack is necessary and should be encouraged. As he had said, if the class monitor has a black belt, he can go inside a class and wallop Ah seng back, disregarding school rules like US disregarding International rules.<br></div>

It was a UN Resolution that DEMANDED Saddam to openly and unreservedly SURRENDER and DESTROY ALL WMD stocks and development programs.<br><br>In Hans Blix report of 14 February 2003 - (which confirmed again all the other reports from the previous 10 Years) - that Saddam Hussein has failed to give satisfactory and convincing accounts and evidence of the missing stocks of confirmed WMD equipment and stocks.<br><br>Have you forgotten that Hans Blix screwed up his job, when he failed to discover Saddam Hussein's Nuclear Development Program in the 1990's (before the First Iraq War), and gave a glowing report that confirm Saddam Hussein's Iraq as having NO Nuclear Program.<br><blockquote><strong><br>North Korea issue.

Note: at tat period, Korea OPENLY declared he has WMD while there are no concrete evidence on Iraq case yet. </strong></blockquote>Yes, North Korea had talked about WMD, but only talked.<br><br>Did Kim Il Jung or his father (Kim Il Sung) used toxic gas or biological weapons on his own North Korean dissidents that wiped out entire villages - as Saddam Hussein had done to his own Iraqi Kurdish dissidents, or launching poison gas attacks against Iran during the long 7 Year Iraq-Iran War, or did North Korea invade any of her neighbors as Saddam had insanely performed an "Ali Baba" invasion of Kuwait ?<br><br>North Korea may have developed its WMD, but there are no clear and full evidence of its works, and there are definitely no real threatening moves made by North Korea towards its neighbors.<br><blockquote><strong><br>North Korea has sold their weopons to other countries, in a dubious, secretive and suspicious manner.

As said by u before<br><br>""""<br>The North Koreans have certainly sold their missiles and missile technologies to some of the rouge states in the Middle East and Africa, but they have not sold any weapons or WMD end products to groups such as Hamas, Al Qaeda, or the Hissbola Â–<br>""""<br><br>Hence the suspicious is not to myself only.<br><br>About Africa issue. I was just wondering from the above statement why do u think it is of lesser importance tat the weopons r sold to rouge states in the Middle East and Africa compared to groups like Hamas, Al Qaeda, or the Hissbola. I don't wanna add any additional points to tis anymore, since u tend to avoid tis statement u have said. I asked again.<br><br>Why do u think it is of lesser importance tat the weopons r sold to rouge states in the Middle East and Africa compared to groups like Hamas, Al Qaeda, or the Hissbola ?  </strong></blockquote>Concerning your statement that North Korea has sold its weapons and missile technologies in a "dubious, secretive and suspicious manner" - it is purely your own views.<br><br>Actually, North Korea had refused to acknowledge or recognised any authority or international governing bodies that allow interference into their government-to-government transactions in weapon sales.<br><br>Nothing dubious, secretive and suspicious about such sales just because it is not announced by the North Koreans; as any such Military Sales by our Singapore GLC to any countries are not announced either - so is our Singapore Government acting in similar "dubious, secretive and suspicious manner too" in your eyes ?<br></div>

But up till now, is there any such agents found in the car bomb attacks ? No such attacks had been found and no concrete evidence that Iraq has manage to export such weopons and I believe that it is drawn from your own conclusion, expolating into a future possibilities.  </strong>[/quote]<br>Surely being so smart, you cannot be so stupid at the same time, to the extent that you will offer such a point of view ?<br><br>If we were to wait until a 'car bomb' is fitted with a WMD device, do you think we will still be around to have such a debate ?<br><blockquote><strong><br>One thing is for certain again. North Korea did sold its rocket launcher, rifles, missiles and maybe nuclear weopons to other dubious countries. They actually caught one of the ship trying to smuggle weopons. The grade of weopons sold from Korea, to me, is certainly a grade higher than those from Iraq. Using a rocket launcher, or missiles are better than using a typical car bomb.  </strong></blockquote>North Korea had sent a shipment of Surface-to-surface Missile to Yemen, which is recognised as a sovereign state with legitimate needs for its own defence - although one may need to question what use have they got with such a missile system, given their own small population size and a smaller standing military force.<br><br>For your information, the ship was allowed to continue its journey to Yemen and unload its cargo.<br><br>I am not sure if you understand the secretive and surreptious nature of terrorist work, that capitalize on the suddeness of an attack that spread terror, pain and death in such a sudden and fast pace of events that panic is created.<br><br>With a launching of a missile, the launch can almost be immediately picked-up, trajectory detected, and the point of launch can be determined. If you are referring to the strength of the warhead and the size of a car bomb, it should be about the same 300 kg power.<br><br>If your "stupidissmart" logic do not prevent your mathematical mind from working, you will note that a car used in a car bomb attack is relatively cheap (anywhere in the world except Singapore) than a Missile.<br><blockquote><strong><br>""<br>With regards to the lawless situation in Iraq, the Iraqis are responsible in contributing to an unstable and volatile situation<br><br>Even just when Baghdad had fallen, and before Saddam, his Sons, and the leadership had been captured, the Iraqi Religious Leaders were already working the ground, agitating the Iraqi population to demonstrate to kick the US Army out of Iraq.<br><br>If this is not foolishness, what else can we describe the mind of the average Iraqi ?<br>"""<br>Is it because of the demostration by the Iraqis tat lead to no power, no water, no public servant, no jobs etc ? South Korea and Taiwanese can  have all the demostration they want, they still have their power, water and order etc. Is demostration considered lawlessness ? Are their demostration done to a big scale frequently ? Had demostration result in hindering the build up of reservoir and power grid ? With regards to lawlessness, is the sacking of all Saddam related offices like police and army the main cause or just demostration by the people ?  </strong></blockquote>Your logic used and approach is questionable.<br><br>During the New York and London black out, do you think there will be a restoration of electrical power in any faster period of time if those affected people had rioted and organised demonstrations to protest the removal of all the Government system and personnels ?<br><br>Similarly, in Iraq, the damage to the electrical grid, water and sewer system was not caused by the US Armed Forces, which had avoided damaging such civilian infrastructure during this Second Iraq War.<br><br>In Korea, Taiwan, and Hongkong, the citizens's objectives in demonstating against their respective Governments had nothing to do with such basic infrastructural services.<br><br>They were demonstrating against job losses and politics, which you will know that no matter how much you demonstrate, job losses will continue and may even destabilize the economic environment that will aggravate the situation further. So does demonstration achieve any purpose if it is not focus on the actual cause ?<br><blockquote><strong><br>Initially I thought the more important reason why peace is not established is bacause of attack on US troop from the DIEHARD Saddam Loyalist and foreign elements. Tat is why I demand for explanation for why blame the whole Iraq if there is only a small number of such extremists. </strong></blockquote>After the initial warm reception by the Iraqi citizens to the arrival of the US led Coalition Forces in the North and the South, the remaining loyalists in Saddam Hussein's home state in the Middle of Iraq remained defiant.<br><br>With the exception of the Kurds in Northen Iraq that continued to work closely with the US Armed Forces, the Islamic Clergy in Southern Iraq agitated the population to demonstrate against the US Led Coalition Forces; which caused further disruptions to the efforts to re-establich public security.<br><br>The Saddam Hussein loyalists, and reported foreign fighters filtering back into Iraq, picking easy targets at isolated pockets and unwary soldiers of the US Led Coalition, caused major disruptions that seemingly gave a helpless quagmire situation that the US Led Coaltion seemed to have found themselves in.<br><br>In such a scenario, with the Islamic Clergy motivating the large Muslim population to mindlessly demonstrate for the departure of US Led Coalition, and the endless pin-prick guerilla skirmishes with Saddam's loyalists and unknown persons from inside or outside Iraq - this has caused the statement to be made that the Iraqi people has also to be made responsible for the situation that they have found themselves in.<br><br>The poor infrastructure system experienced by most Iraqis during the period that Saddam was in power, was never announced nor could any public protests be allowed by Saddam and his henchmen.<br><br>At least, with the liberation of Iraq by the US Armed Foces, a certain degree of freedom to demonstrate against the USA is alllowed.<br><blockquote><strong><br>In such a chaotic country with many tribes, many political parties trying to take control, it need someone who is harsher to take. Iraq has been deeply religius muslim country. If like America, suddenly exposing the people to mad rush of infomation, offering no control thus no order, it only result in creating more havoc and helplessness.<br><br>It was after being in control of a harsh leader for many years, after the dispute between different political parties and tribes have quiet down or put down, with years of education, then can they gradually increase the awareness of notions such as freedom, liberty and social grace.<br><br>As I have said, the person going to take over Iraq have not displayed any incredible talents, nor does it have any impressive merits under its belt. It is unlikely it will be harsh enough to put down any possible opposition thus resulting in lack of control. It will not gather the respect of the people and will not stop them from being rebellious. </strong></blockquote>Why are you so impatient with achieving results, when the US Armed Forces is still trying to complete Level 2 of its present Computer Game of Command and Conquer to get rid of Saddam Hussein and his henchmen ?<br><br>Do you seriously believe that the harsh and iron hand rule of Saddam Hussein had allowed a high standard of infrastructure to be abandoned and fall apart the moment Saddam has left the scene ?<br><br>By the same token, this concern has also been mine, concerning the very finite life span of LKY as he move into his twilight years.<br><br>Will the absence of the strong hands of LKY result in a similar decline and breaking down of the entire infrastructural system in Singapore then ?<br><br></div>

The wholesale destruction of these marshes ruined the habitat for dozens of species of migratory birds, and ended a centuries-old way of life that prevailed among the Shiite Marsh Arabs who made the wetlands their home: the Iraqi government stated that the action was intended to produce usable farmland, while a number of outside observers felt that the destruction was aimed against the Marsh Arabs, as retribution for their participation in the 1991 uprising.<br><br>Iraqi dissidents claim that Qusay Hussein was responsible for the killing of many political activists. The Sunday Times (London) reported that Qusay Hussein ordered the killing of Khalis Mohsen al-Tikriti, an engineer at the military industrialization organization, because Qusay believed he was planning to leave Iraq. In 1998, Iraqi opposition groups accused Qusay Hussein of ordering the executions of thousands of political prisoners after hundreds of inmates were summarily executed to make room for new prisoners in crowded jails. However, groups such as Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International report none of this, and show Qusay's human rights record as being about on par with most Arab royal family members.</span> </strong><br></div>
