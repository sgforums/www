            <div class='col-md body'>My apologies to Â“Fanatical_KnightÂ” for replying to Â“stupidissmartÂ”, and in so doing bring us away from the thread started; but since no one is adding any further contribution, might as well post a reply to "stupidissmart".<br><br>If we look back at the record of events, prior to the outbreak of this Second Iraq War that resulted in SaddamÂ’s Regime being overthrown, certainly Saddam was beginning to talk to the UN Inspectors. At the same time, Saddam was playing games with the UN Inspectors, and like a Â“strip teaserÂ” , his Representatives were slowly revealing a little more information each time when the pressure is notched up another level.<br><br>At the rate that the game was played, and the pace dictated by Saddam, by the time all the information needed by the UN Inspectors will be made fully and satisfactorily available, it may take another one to ten years of constant play.<br><br>Saddam, like a schoolÂ’s worse scoundrel, was thumbing his nose at the Class Monitor, with the full knowledge that the Class Monitor cannot touch him without the sanction of the Principal, whose hands are tied by the Ministry.<br><br>Like the incorrigible school boy, Saddam stretched the International Rules and tried to buy time by playing the Europeans against the US, and breaking up the unity of the European Community with his game of brinkmanship.<br><br>He knew that the World Opinion was divided in finding a way to deal with him, and he made the best use of the indecisiveness of the World Community.<br><br>Unfortunately, Saddam placed his bet with a weak hand in a poker game with big boys, who were out to make sure that he will not get any chance to tie up with Al Qaeda, and beat the big boys when they are sleeping.<br><br>After 9-11, in which the USA has been attacked for the first time by foreigners, can you expect the USA to sit still, when intelligence reported SaddamÂ’s WMD program and the beginning of his relationship with Al Qaeda, the actual SaddamÂ’s actions of stubborn refusal to give up information willingly, SaddamÂ’s game at brinkmanship, and the past records of SaddamÂ’s unpredictable actions that include the use of WMD against innocent Iraqis ?<br><br>With all these events on record, any responsible leader will have to take pre-emptive action, when the evidence is clear that Saddam is BUYING TIME for himself (and perhaps his WMD Program ? ) .<br><br>You are not the only one asking about the whereabouts of the WMD equipment and end products.<br><br>If I am Saddam Hussein, knowing that defeat will be sudden, I will prepare in advance the dispersal of the WMD, and use it with a vengeance to hit back at the USA at the time and place of my choosing.<br><br>Saddam has got his first plan accomplished, by successfully hiding the WMD, his second plan was to successfully hide himself Â– (much like Osama Bin Laden and the Head Taliban has accomplished) Â– third, instead of releasing the WMD against the invading US Army that will end up destroying the Iraqi population and assets, Saddam will bide his time and take his revenge at a place and time of his choosing.<br><br>Do not be too quick about the Â“Spiced Up Intelligence ReportÂ” from the British Side, or even from the US side. The Board of Enquiry has not ended, and from the last news reported, it was the BBC Reporter that seemed to have got the facts wrong and twisted the events to create a scandal concerning the possibility of the Intelligence Report being Spiced UpÂ”. The Enquiry is still on-going, and the finding has not been concluded.<br><br>Concerning the North Korean problem, there are more consequences to be considered when handling North Korea.<br><br>Unlike Iraq, there are no hard evidence linking North Korea with any of the Middle Eastern groups involved in terrorism.<br><br>The North Koreans have certainly sold their missiles and missile technologies to some of the rouge states in the Middle East and Africa, but they have not sold any weapons or WMD end products to groups such as Hamas, Al Qaeda, or the Hissbola Â– so I am not sure where your information is coming from.<br><br>Unlike Iraq, North Korea has some Defense Treaty arrangement with China and Russia; and although times have changed, it is unlikely that China and Russia will come to the defense of North Korea if bad behavior becomes too embarrassing to be defended.<br><br>Still, with North Korea, the USA has to consider the sensitivity and fallout effect on a larger circle of countries Â– both politically and economically.<br><br>By attacking North Korea, the biggest casualty will be the South Koreans and the Japanese population, as the unpredictable and ruthless Kim Jong Il will resort to the use of Nuclear strikes. Mass destruction of human lives and infrastructures will be the end result in the entire Korean Peninsula, Japan, and parts of China (if it gets drawn into combat with the USA).<br><br>The economies of East Asia, South-east Asia, and the entire Pacific Region will be strategically and structurally affected.<br><br>The price of war in the Korean Peninsula will be much higher than the war in Iraq.<br><br>Unfortunately, the underground labyrinths are not fairy tales, if you recall several German Construction Companies coming up with the Building Plans of SaddamÂ’s Palaces, with vent shafts leading into deep bunkers.<br><br>Concerning your inability to tolerate my supposed statement that the Â“Iraqis deserved to suffer in an unstable and volatile situation, you may have not read carefully enough what I have stated.<br><br>If you will review my earlier post, I had stated that the Iraqis have as much responsibility to ensure that their own future will be secure and prosperous by helping the US led Coalition Force to weed out all of Saddam HusseinÂ’s Power Base and Leadership, so that these Â“murderous rulersÂ” will not return to haunt the Iraqis.<br><br>Unfortunately, if Saddam was Winston Churchill, the entire Iraqi nation would have risen up to resist the US led Coalition Force in Iraq Â– {so your comparison is wrong, and the fact that there is only sporadic pin-prick attacks against the US Forces that resulted in small number of death and casualties} - shows that the general population are accepting the reality of the situation and co-operating with the US led Coalition Force. It is the DIEHARD Saddam Loyalist and foreign elements fighting the US led forces.<br><br>It will be foolish for the average Iraqi Citizen not to make use of the US led Coalition Force to ensure that Saddam and his Murderous Crowd of Baathist Party Leaders are completely destroyed or brought to trial by the Iraqi people.<br><br>Can the average Iraqi people overthrow Saddam Hussein and his well armed Fedayeen without US help ?<br><br>If average Iraqi People love Saddam Hussein, why were they so relieved at the arrival of the US led Coalition Forces into the various major cities of Iraq ?<br><br>There were crowds rejoicing at the toppling of Saddam HusseinÂ’s statues, there were vulgar acts of insults to Saddam HusseinÂ’s photo images.<br><br>Do you seriously believe that Iraq has only ONE Percent of their population being Â‘highly educatedÂ’ ?<br><br>Like most developed countries in the Middle East, their population will have at least ten percent being educated up to tertiary levels, and at least forty percent with high and middle school education, and another forty percent having at least primary education.<br><br>If you were to look into the websites of Iraqis who have fled from the brutal treatment of Saddam Hussein, you may perhaps withdraw your statements concerning the Iraqis enjoying life under Saddam Hussein.<br><br>For your information, those who stayed behind have to put on a false front Â“to loveÂ” Saddam Hussein and his Sons, or they will be killed.<br><br>Can you accept the Singapore Football team losing the Tiger Cup, and on coming back to Singapore, the entire team is beaten at the base of their bare feet, and then dragged over broken glasses ?<br><br>This was how Saddam HusseinÂ’s eldest son Â– Uday Hussein Â– treated his Olympic Football Team, when they lost the football match that will allow Iraq a place in the top ten group.<br><br>It was a reign of terror that kept the people acting according to script prepared by SaddamÂ’s famous Minister of Information.<br><br>Where were you when the Minister of Information was putting on a brave face, to declare that the US led Coalition Force was miles away from Baghdad, even when the M-1 Abrams Tanks were rolling into the City ?<br><br>I am not sure if it is "smart to be stupid" Â– all the time, at least.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Maybe the titles does drift from the original posted, but I it is more important to consider the content of the argument in it rather than where it spawns from. Does it make a big difference if I post it at as a new thread ?<br><br>I got to ask, how does the Saddam play games with the UN inspectors ? Does allowing them to break into some palace for checking playing games ? The UN inspectors have the power to check wherever sites at watever time they need, inclusive of the sites where US intelligence suspected sites. How do u play "games" with rules being set by US and UN ? Wat aspect of the checks conducted by UN considered a game to u ? The only reason why u say it is a game probably because it is coined by US for saying tat.  How do u end tis "game" then ? U got to admit u r already biased tat they have weopons prior to checks already. U just felt tat the game can only end in one way, tat is WOMD r found and not the possibility tat there really has no weopons there. Why do u keep insisting tat they have weopons there ? The only game u can say they r playing is tat they r demanding for more talks and negotiation. I don't know tat being diplomatic is a game. And the best player is certainly North Korea.<br><br>American like a big bully in school was hit by a sudden water bomb by someone. He began to be angry and try to gather support from friends to hit back tat person. He made it such a point att those who support him is considered a friend while the other r enemies. No sitting on the fence. Of course being such a big bully he got his way, and the idiot who threw water bombs got beaten so badly tat he need to quit school. Yet big bully isn't satisfied and decided to hit his closest friend. He accused him of hiding tons of water bombs and assist in throwing bombs at him. Of course being a big bully, he do not need to produce any evidence,  his words r orders. The best friend try to prove to others tat he is innocent, but he is not given a chance and got whacked by him too, despite objections by other neutral members. Does tis story sounds familiar ?<br><br>After 9-11, Afghan is hit badly. Al Qaeda is a shadow of its former strength. But why attack Iraq even without proper proof and documentation ? I sympatise those who r dead, but please do not made revenge blindly. If u fight for a good cause, I have nothing to say. If u hit just to get a feeling of getting back, then gone too far. U took your revenge, they too will want to take their revenge back. IS there any end to tis ? Like Isreal and Palestinians. U think it will end if both sides keep "revenging" on each other ?<br><br>U said tat Saddam has no support from his people, then how does he hide all the weopons of mass destruction and not even a clue to wheer they r now ? The scale of the job is large ! Even capturing scientist and people of power produce no evidence. Do u really think hiding such WMD is easy like ABC. And do u think tat everyone will be so loyal especially to a fallen regime ? Wake up !! Iraq is unlike Bermuda Triangle. Don't keep insisting tat they have the weopons just by blind faith. Prove by hard evidence not by inferences and drawing own conclusion.<br><br>The enquiries r there, and they should placed a doubt on the reliability of the report. Iraq technology is relatively low compared to other countries and they have been isolated for so many years. Where they get such technology to make WMD from ? Is it from Al Qaeda who is more backward ? It is already obvious that the report does sounds suspicious. And the report is really proven wrong since no such weopons r found.<br><br>U mean since they r not linked to Middle East, then they should be free of accusation, even sending the weopons to rogues states in Africa is okay. So blatantly put, u suggests they hit Iraq just for revenge, just because it is a muslim state, just because it is in middle east isn't it. So Africa can kill all the people they want as long as they r not Americans right. And North Korea probably sell weopons to highest bidders, why not to muslim extremist next time, or maybe they already have done it.<br><br>U say they won't attack Korea because they have nuclear weopons and can be used at China and Japan, why r they not afraid Iraq will attack British within 45 minutes with their WMD when AMerican attack them ? Tat will certainly creates lot of havoc, more than Asia isn't it ? I guess having REAL weopons of mass destruction really help here.<br><br>The price of war in the Korean Peninsula will be certainly be much higher than the war in Iraq. Iraq has oil while Korea has starving people.<br><br>saying tis is same as telling all singaporean is at fault if the bomb at Yishun MRT really took place. It just need 30 people out of the whole population of 3 millions to creates havoc. How many actually suspect they r so extreme ? U cannot blame ALL iraqis just because there r a few black sheeps around. And how further do u want those silent majority to act ?<br><br>I refer Saddams Churchill because u say Saddam cannot ask its people to fight for their countries. I want to say all commanders do tat since beginning of warfare.<br><br>U think outside interferences will help solve problems in Iraq itself ? A chinese saying goes tat A Fair judge cannot settle domestic disputes. Which countries, after being hit by a war froma third party aiming to 'liberise' them got a good result in return ? US and Iraq cultures r totally different. How does US help them ? They help, and look at the mess now. The blame should not be to Iraqis but by how naive and idealistic US leaders became.<br><br>Saddam may be cruel, but how does US fare in such a country. Some countries need to be ruled by iron hand. In such desperate situation, do u really blame the information minister to lie to boost their morales ? A doctor telling his patient tat he is gonna be alright even though he is going to die should be prosecuted too then. I don't see any significant of it to tis argument.<br><br>"A"merican "to be". Why lose your logic and emotion in this war ?</div>

What he does have in abundance is a healthy capacity for irrational emotional outbursts.<br><br>He tries to make himself look like he knows a lot and that his views hold water by flooding the forum excessively with his disconnected ramblings and disjointed examples, impossible contextes and thoughts.

            <div class='col-md body'>Incredulity does not begin to describe my reaction to reading stupid's tripe.  How did Saddam play games?  Perhaps stupid should have paid some attention to the headlines in the second half of the 1990's.  Here's what Richard Butler, head of the UN weapons (not weopons, by the way) inspection team until 1999, had to say:<br><br><blockquote>When I led the UN weapons inspectors to disarm Iraq in 1997-98, I repeatedly sent my team on surprise, no-notice inspections to discover Hussein's hidden illegal weapons. My decisions were based on intelligence materials provided by a number of governments and information provided by Iraqi defectors. Sometimes we found illegal weapons. Frequently, however, our search proved fruitless.<br><br>Inspectors would find themselves staring at empty rooms. On other occasions, we were blocked at the front gate of a suspicious site while our helicopters observed trucks being hastily loaded within the site and driven away out the back door, presumably removing incriminating materials.<br><br>Our no-notice inspections were often compromised. Iraqi intelligence had penetrated us. Whenever our inspections found nothing, Hussein's deputy and inspections point man Tariq Aziz would insist how this proved Iraq no longer possessed illegal weapons.<br><br>I often found his claims difficult to accept because our experts had good reason to believe the opposite. This argument reached its height in early 1998 when we discovered significant Iraqi production of the most dangerous chemical warfare agent Â– VX. Iraq denied it had ever made VX.<br><br>We proved that this was not the case. The Iraqis then moved from denial to minimisation, saying they had made only 200 litres of the substance Â– one minute drop of which on the skin can kill in three minutes. We then proved that they had made at least 4000 litres and had loaded it into missile warheads.<br><br>In early 1999, after Hussein had ejected me and the other UN inspectors from Iraq, I furnished the Security Council with a final report on Iraq's WMDs.<br><br>The Security Council was largely hostile to the inspection process and we had come under savage attack, particularly from the Russians. The council nonetheless unanimously agreed to the substance of that report.</blockquote>Anyone other than those medically certified to be in a coma ought to be aware of this.  After all, it was only splashed across the front pages of the newspapers during the period that Butler described.<br><br>Then again, one might have to consider that stupid could, after all, be brain dead.</div>

U just felt tat the game can only end in one way, tat is WOMD r found and not the possibility tat there really has no weopons there. Why do u keep insisting tat they have weopons there ? The only game u can say they r playing is tat they r demanding for more talks and negotiation. I don't know tat being diplomatic is a game.

            <div class='col-md body'>I am back... I am even surprised myself for coming back.<br><br>First, I glanced through all the references u sent me. There r 2 flaws in it. First, most of them r before 2002, which is before the latest arms inspections done before the war. And most of them one sided, failing wat I called, being objective. I offer to u now some new, very objective report made by Han Blix in 2003. 1st link, he has made his case very fair, stating coorperation and unaccounted weopons before the war. This is more relevant for those who think citically. In the second link, he suggested the twist made by "English media". It also state the enthusaism from US to find any documents of WMD. The third link is short, saying tat the inspectors r not allowed back to Iraq.<br><br>http://www.un.org/Depts/unmovic/Bx27.htm<br><br>http://www.un.org/Depts/unmovic/recent%20items.html<br><br>http://www.cctv.com/english/news/TVNews/MorningNews/20030423/100198.html<br><br>The second thing about your references is tat a lot r accounts from a person story. They r nothing but just gather sympathy. It is true story only from his viewpoint, subjected to his exaggeration and twisting of facts.<br><br>For the waterbomb story, it seems u only read a line, which is waterbomb, and u compared it to airlines etc. Okie, then make the story tis way, he got shot by a paper bullet and blinded one of the bully eyes. The bully on his end, instead of beating him till he quit school, he beat him to death, and he decide to do the same too to the other friend. Does the seriousness sound fair now ?<br><br>How about the other more part of the story ? It is grieving for the American after 9-11, however his after actions apalled me. Without hard facts, without giving more time. He attacked Iraq, totally ignoring UN council, mass protest all over the world and force other nations to be his ally using the carrot and stick method.<br><br>The reply for AL Qaeda is totally different in the Iraq case now. Now US has won, where is the evidence u wanna hear ? I already told u before tat u cannot just enter a house and shoot everybody down, and find evidence in his house afterward. U have to have evidence before actually smashing your way in. No evidence is found, and if tis continues so, then wat grounds does US has to stage a war against Iraq ?<br><br>National reserve is unlike WMD. WMD is physical. There is lab, there is storage and there are many people working on it. If tat scientist has been caught, why not use his testimony to find out wher the lab is. As u have stated before, if german assist Iraq to buil underground bunker, why don't they be called up for search of WMD since they r the one tat designed it ? One the the scientist even claim Iraq is building a nuclear weopon. From reports from Han Blix, tis is highly unlikely. It is not even suspected when checks r made. Iraq don't any facility to carry tis out at all. The 3rd link is dated 1995. Long ago to be relevant.<br><br>I think u still live in the 90's to keep coming up with references 10 years ago. And I am am free of any religion, and I particularly hate religion with strict rules and regulation. The first article I write in tis forum is about how "unreligious" I am. Tis is written by u.<br><br>[<span style="color: red;">b]The North Koreans have certainly sold their missiles and missile technologies to some of the rouge states in the Middle East and Africa[/b], </span> but they have not sold any weapons or WMD end products to groups such as Hamas, Al Qaeda, or the Hissbola Â– so I am not sure where your information is coming from.<br><br>From such a line, I can only infer tat u think lightly of WMD sold to Africa and middle east while selling to Hamas, Al Qaeda, or the Hissbola is terrible. Why draw such a line ? If Africa and middle East has such weopons, many deaths and chaos can still be ensured. And as I say, they sell to highest bidders. Muslim extremists group  aren't poor either. There is nothing sensitive about it. The below paragraph is written by ATobe.<br><br>By attacking North Korea, the biggest casualty will be the South Koreans and the Japanese population, as the unpredictable and ruthless Kim Jong Il will resort to the use of Nuclear strikes. <strong>Mass destruction of human lives and infrastructures will be the end result in the entire Korean Peninsula, Japan, and parts of China </strong>(if it gets drawn into combat with the USA).<br><br>The British in their "spiced up" report has stated tat they have the capability of launchig their weopons tat is capable of attacking in 45 minutes came from the report written by British. If your fear tat Korea will unleashed his weopons if they were attacked, why aren't they afraid of Iraq unleashing his weopons when he is attacked. I included the link for the Dossier written and published by Britian government.<br><br>http://news.bbc.co.uk/nol/shared/spl/hi/middle_east/02/uk_dossier_on_iraq/html/full_dossier.stm<br><br>http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/meast/02/07/sprj.irq.uk.dossier/index.html<br><br>http://www.fromthewilderness.com/free/ww3/020603_plagiarized.html<br><br>Now doubts has arised on the credibility of the report. Tat is the only reason why war has started in Iraq. If at report turns out to be exaggerated, spiced up, then doesn't tis clearly show tat the war is fought because it has to be fought, instead of liberating the people of Iraq ?<br><br>"<br>With regards to the lawless situation in Iraq, <strong>the Iraqis are responsible in contributing to an unstable and volatile situation </strong><br><br>Even just when Baghdad had fallen, and before Saddam, his Sons, and the leadership had been captured, the Iraqi Religious Leaders were already working the ground, agitating the Iraqi population to demonstrate to kick the US Army out of Iraq.<br><br>If this is not <strong>foolishness</strong>, what else can we describe the mind of the <strong>average Iraqi </strong>?<br>"<br><br>For tis paragraph, I came up with the reply of why blaming the Iraqis when Americans fail to rule Iraq smoothly. Does the majority of the Indonesia knew tat the Bali blast will occur ? Does the majority of people in Saudi foolish when the car bombing occurs ? I am saying tat why put the blame on the "average Iraqi" when it is just a few black sheep around tat start the attack. Can u say tat all SIngaporean r foolish if the attack at Yishun MRT is successful ?<br><br>"...the Saudi Government woke up belatedly to a crisis. "<br><br>written by Atobe too. So if u say the government is responsible for the crisis, then the government of Iraq is American and I hope he wakes up to tis crisis too.<br><br>I am trying to say about management for MOST EXAMPLES. Is 3 out of 5 considerdd most ? Wat is like before Mao Sze Tong took over ? Wat was it like before Hitler took over ? Wat was it like before Lenin took over ? There were utter chaos then. These 3, enforces strict law and rulings manage to control the chaotic situation. It is easier to govern when things r peaceful. It took the grit of Lee Kuan Yew to iron issues out in Singapore before Goh Chok Tong took over. If LKY is a bit less forceful then, than things may not turn up the way they r in singapore now.<br><br>To NathanG5. I am not against help to be given to Iraqis. I am against American for being unilateralism. I am against some of the policies they they had made and I hope people r more aware of its action critically and hopefully, will act as a deterent when US try to act unilateralism. US is unlike Iraq, it should be civilised and diplomatic. If such a powerful force go around in a blaind rampage, then it only act fuel to the flames of chaos.<br></div>

After wat u have all said, I am still left bewildered what are the things that I have written wrongly.

Which case I have argued r weak ? And I thought tat is wat all argument r meant to do, find all possible support for me to present my case. If it appears weak to u, it may not be so to others. Then wat do u normally do during a difference in opinions, don't present anything or slack ?<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Make sweeping statements </span><br><br>Please give me an example. I think u probably mis-interprete me. The "sweeping statement" I have made r showing how absurb some other fellow in the forum is . If he say something I do not agree, wat better way to show it then portraying his argument by looking from a different perspective.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Respond to reasoned, logical rebuttals with emotional outbursts and shady logic and improbbable examples. </span><br><br>I guess u probably hate the metaphors I am always using, like the school bully etc. I agree I tend to be emotional at certain periods, however all the things I have written is not without logic in it. On the other hand, if u write something without any emotional ingredient in it, it probably sounds like a technical report. I am not writing a news article please.<br><br>I do not want to be too naggy and get on everybody's nerve.  Basically, am I the only one tat commits the 6 Toady commandments u have listed ? I believe even old soldiers like Atobe also commit such "sins" listed by u from time to time. Are u really free from all of it ? Is it something really undesirable ?</div>

Aren't u just attacking me without any elaboration again ? After wat u have all said, I am still left bewildered what are the things that I have written wrongly. Only tis time u try to sounds more "educated", slightly less emotional and hone on the english.<br><br>Since u have written such a list down, lets go down one by one<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">I must be right</span><br><br>Nope, I believe I am right. If u yourself don't even believe u r right, then wat r u arguing for ?<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Find whatever that appears to support my case, no matter how weak </span><br><br>Now I really need clarification from u about tis. Which case I have argued r weak ? And I thought tat is wat all argument r meant to do, find all possible support for me to present my case. If it appears weak to u, it may not be so to others. Then wat do u normally do during a difference in opinions, don't present anything or slack ?<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Make sweeping statements </span><br><br>Please give me an example. I think u probably mis-interprete me. The "sweeping statement" I have made r showing how absurb some other fellow in the forum is . If he say something I do not agree, wat better way to show it then portraying his argument by looking from a different perspective.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Respond to reasoned, logical rebuttals with emotional outbursts and shady logic and improbbable examples. </span><br><br>I guess u probably hate the metaphors I am always using, like the school bully etc. I agree I tend to be emotional at certain periods, however all the things I have written is not without logic in it. On the other hand, if u write something without any emotional ingredient in it, it probably sounds like a technical report. I am not writing a news article please.<br><br>I do not want to be too naggy and get on everybody's nerve.  Basically, am I the only one tat commits the 6 Toady commandments u have listed ? I believe even old soldiers like Atobe also commit such "sins" listed by u from time to time. Are u really free from all of it ? Is it something really undesirable ? </div></blockquote>Bang! You have shot yourself in the foot again, the one of many self inflicted bulletholes you have already given yourself. Maybe you would find a automatic weapon more useful?<br><br>If you can still be "bewildered" by the things you are in error with, and at this point after people have so completely and totally refuted your points. I conclude that you are quite beyond reason, and hence belong more in Hougang Chalet then in Speakers Corner. I'm sure your views/product of a malfunctioning mind will be more accepted there.<br><br>What's rather bewildering, and amazing at the same, is your amazing ability to make flawed statement after statement, without showing any ability to wake up to reason whatsoever, and still some how contuine on despite all the facts that have pulverized whatever your case was, not that it is a great loss anyway. Your "views" and "arguments" (should it even be called that?) have gone through so many bizzare permutations and illogical leaps and associations one wonders if you actually even bother with logic.<br><br>And of course, you still don't get it do you (not that I expected much from von ilk anyway)? You have just proved every one of my points by your most recent posts, which while learning somewhat from your logical errors on the past, does little to address the glarring errors in your overall reasoning and simple minded, bull headed approach towards such complex topics like world events.<br><br>Sadly, your "it's my way or the highway" approach is hardly impressing anybody.<br><br>And whoever that mysterious Toady is, prehaps you refer to your father? That probably a more apt and apporiate candidate, should eugenics have anything to do with your ability to reason properly. Thank you but this is a forum for rhyme and reason and resorting to infantile name without reason calling does not hold water at all.<br><br>This is getting interesting, I await your next shoot-yourself-in-the-foot reply.</div>

And the references may only contained a line or 2 which u r interested in. Please come up with the crux of the references u have given please.<br><br>Why one person account is NOT important ? Lets put it this way. U can get strange account on how people r prosecuted in Singapore from PAP too.

They can said how they r being sued, how their family break up under PAP, how unfair they have been treated. But how is the general life in Singapore then ?<br><br>""""<br>Maybe I try to understand your story this way - Ah Seng (a bully) stood and watched, while his bully friends acted on his instructions and hijacked some classroom chairs, and started to beat up and injure the other students in his Class. When the Class Monitor walked in, Ah Seng and his friends ran into a different Class with a bigger bully named Ah Beng. The Class Monitor asked Ah Beng to surrender Ah Seng and his friends, but Ah Beng challenged the Class Monitor to enter the Classroom if he had the guts, or show any proof. Not realising that the Class Monitor had a black belt, Ah Beng and Ah Seng with their gang started to beat the Class Monitor when he accepted the challenge by walking in.

U find it fair for the class monitor to go inside and beat up everyone, just because he has a black belt ?

Find the Discipline master. Surely they will act fairly and punish the ones involved. I guess if someone killed your family members, u will take a knife and chop him too isn't it ? I guess all people now should brush up their kung fu skill as no one respect law system now.<br><br>Is it any different for Iraq war. Is french fries still called french fries in US now ? I thought america is saying they r stubborn, muddle headed etc, and decrease trading with them. I bet their relationship is still sour. Malaysia condem attack, then wat happened ? Visa is not granted even to students then. America also reduce trade ties with them. Australia support America after Bali blast. America so happy to have him for ally tat he support him for attacking countries they desired to prevent further loss in their lives. In other words, he is actually supporting himself for attacking Iraq.<br><br>The case is different for ISD case. Declaring war on countires is the same as prosecuting JI to death before any hearing and investigation. Calling them for investigation is the same as bringing in arms inspectors. They r finding out if he is guilty before charging them, prosecuting them.<br><br>Very interesting, where do u get tat info about driving trucks with dollars and gold from ? U must really send me tis reference. I personally thought he nearly dies in an air missile strike before American success.<br><br>U believe Han Blix 10 years ago and not Han Blix now ?

If the states Koreas selling arms r respectable, legitimate countries, then why not buy it from China or America instead ? If it is "legitimate", why hide it in a trade ship ? Why create such a big hoo haa when they were caught ? One must guess tat the weopons sold r up to no good. I think rogues states in Africa are not any less deadly than Middle East terrorists group. As I have said many times, do u believe if Africa killed a lot of people with those weopons they have gathered is okay, while to middle East is WRONG. I ask AGAIN. IS lives of African any lesser to those in other parts of the world ? Or r u gonna say again the average Africa r foolish and desereve to die ?<br><br>I got it now, SO u think CAR BOMBS r weopons of Mass Destruction ? If tat is the case, then Indonesia has TONs of them. And Australia just TAUGHT everyone, with their recent broadcast on how to make CAR BOMBs using domestic products obtainable in supermarkets.
