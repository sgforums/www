Do you seriously think YOU can take those temperatures?

I find that it is alrite for the US troops to use air-con in Iraq war, after they trg hard during peace time. When in operation have to make sure the troops is fresh and ready to win the battle but not ware them off. Save the pride and lose the war, lousy choice.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>How about tis, American can get to enjoy aircon and electricity while the main majority of iraqis who used to have air con have to enjoy the wonderful weather there. U gonna tell me tat they r used to living in such weather so they r FINE while america used to have such good things like aircon in life deserves BETTER treatment ? Are they lessser humans than US ? Is the weather any different to both of them. Certainly they r MUCH tougher than americans in tis aspect isn't it ?<br><br>And if they didn't live in such weather, they cannot understand how it is like until u have been there. Tis can be said about the politics situation there. They didn't live in tat era, under Sadam politics, why do they have the right to start a war there to overthrow it ? Anyway, on wat grounds do they start a war ? They have smashed the door to everything in iraq, have they found the weopons of mass destruction ? They remain quiet even though nothing is found.<br><br>I believe some will tell me tat Iraq deserves all this because they r the one tat destroyed the power grid themselves. Well, u r talking of a few black sheeps in the whole population. Maybe they deserve a iron hand to be controlled. Same as china, they need an iron hand to control the population, if they fully adopt 'US' human right system, they may be as chaotic as iraq now. And anyway, America is the black sheep to be blamed for the wierd weather we r suffering now. The heat waves affects many region too. Why ? Because of pollution to environment. WHo caused the biggest polution problem in the world ? US ! They contribute 40% and more of pollution to the world ! They can do something to make a change but they refuse to do it to make themselves richer. I don't blame poor and undeveloped countries not to help proctect environment. I blamed the biggest contributor of pollution and the richest nation yet do the least thing to proctect it. They speaked so much about human rights yet fail to do anything to proctect mother nature. THey just speak things tat justified their political ambitious.<br><br>Wat have the US done after their occupation ? The only things they concentrate on is bringing oil to make money ! When tat fails, they  started the begging campaign and ask UN for help ! They just create havoc !<br><br>I believe the old lives they used to live is much better than the situation now, and things aren't gonna look very bright anytime soon. Maybe Saddam is a maniac, but things are still going smoothly then. Wat happened now ? No public servant, no rules, no traffic police, no electricity. I think it is just a big mess there.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Â“stupidissmartÂ” Â– Much like many in the Middle-east, your position is understandable.<br><br>In making a response to your article, it will be moving us away from this thread Â– Â“The Yankee soldiers are weaker than our tough SAFÂ”.<br><br>In trying to bring us back to this thread - with respect to Â“Fanatical_KnightÂ”, who started this thread - I would like to ask :-<br><br>Can our Â“toughÂ” SAF handle this situation any beter, if we were to take over the role of the US Army in Iraq ?<br><br>You may of course retort that the SAF did not start this mess in Iraq, but the original post beg the question that the SAF Soldier is tougher - therefore more capable - than the US Soldier in Iraq.<br><br>Will the SAF Soldier tolerate the heat in Iraq any better than the US Soldier, or will Singaporeans EXPECT the SAF Soldiers to live in similar conditions like the Iraqis ? - (I believe this thread does not address the Soldier on combat patrol in aircon comfort, but took objection to the US Soldier living in aircon comfort when off-duty).<br><br>Can we allow the SAF Soldiers to expect the Singapore Government to look after their welfare, when they are risking themselves on a mission required of them by the Singapore Government - much as the US Soldier is doing it now ?<br><br>Considering the other issues raised in your post, for us to sit tight and not join in the effort to destroy the ambitions of Iraq to develop a Nuclear Weapon, or Weapons of Mass Destruction will be suicidally foolish. Let us not loose focus on this issue over time.<br><br>Saddam had refused to allow the UN Inspection Groups to return to Iraq for the last ten years, and had ten years to hide their WMD programs and products.<br><br>When they had the opportunity to work with the UN Inspectors, they were evasive with their documentation and accounting of the WMD materials Â– both completed products and raw materials; they were playing a Â“shell gameÂ” with the Inspectors by moving the completed products to alternative sites, as soon as a targeted site is made know by the UN Inspectors Â– (as was demanded by Iraq as a condition to allow Inspections to proceed).<br><br>From documents seized after the fall of Baghdad, it was clear that the Iraqi Intelligence Service has already begun some kind of working relationship with Al-Qaeda, whom we now also know that they are funding and influencing regional fanatical groups such as the local Jemieah Islamiah and the Abu Sayaf Groups.<br><br>Can you imagine the consequences of a WMD device in the hands of the group responsible for the Bali and Jakarta Marriot Hotel bombings ?<br><br>It would not have been those killed and injured by the blast of those bombs, but a wider area of destruction and death would have been achieved by a WMD developed by Saddam and passed on to these terrorist groups supported by Al-Qaeda.<br><br>Should we continue to sit still, knowing the possibilities of such a scenario can develop ? The US Government did not, and the Singapore Government has quietly supported the US Government in this effort.<br><br>It is surprising that there is no news of any US breakthrough into the underground chambers and passages of the many Grand Palaces built by Saddam over the past ten years. There were much information of underground labyrinths, with secret trap doors leading to deeper chambers, and secret weapon positions, much like the Cu Chi tunnels system in the Vietnam War Era.<br><br>With x-ray machines used by L.A. Police to detect buried bodies and locate underground chambers, it is quite certain that there are more sophisticated equipment to break into the rumored underground labyrinths. There must have been breakthroughs in the search, that have so far discovered buried MIG fighter jets, large cache of buried US Currencies.<br><br>With regards to the lawless situation in Iraq, the Iraqis are responsible in contributing to an unstable and volatile situation<br><br>Even just when Baghdad had fallen, and before Saddam, his Sons, and the leadership had been captured, the Iraqi Religious Leaders were already working the ground, agitating the Iraqi population to demonstrate to kick the US Army out of Iraq.<br><br>If this is not foolishness, what else can we describe the mind of the average Iraqi ?<br><br>It is surprising that news footage do not show more interviews with the more educated Iraqi, who are less demanding towards the US and are assisting the US to restore local Iraqi rule. However, such events are not newsworthy, and more footage of Iraqi frustrations and Iraqi demonstrations are shown; and these are not representative of the larger Iraqi population.<br><br>The Iraqi population will need to help their local Iraqi Governing Council, and by extension the US Army, to provide information as to the activities and whereabouts of the anti-US groups that are sabotaging the Iraqi Infrastructure.<br><br>If the Iraqi population does not help the US Army to weed out those remaining elements of Saddam HusseinÂ’s power base, and continue to hide the saboteurs of Iraqi Infrastructure, then they deserve to be where they find themselves to be.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>U saying tat Saddam refuse to let UN inspection to carry on over past 10 years. Tat is true, but why stop their work when they r already in ? Before the war, Iraq has been surprisingly coorperative towards the inspectors. They do everything they can to try to prevent the war. If u r Saddam regime, wat more can u do ? However US insist on fighting.<br><br>U talking about weopons of mass destruction ? Where ?? Evidence from where ? How do they come up with tis statement ? U can hear from British side tat they have deliberately spice up their report just to fight them. I can imagine how much "spice" they have added to the US side. The truth is tat, they totally ignore UN inspector, suggesting they r stupid and fools. Yet in actual facts, US is equally foolish since they can't find any weopons too.<br><br>North Korean also never allowed UN inspectors too. They have openly sell woepons to other nations. They have openly made nuclear weopons. The same argument can be made to when the weopons they made r given to terrorists. Saddam regime seems to open to more talks then North Koreans. They don't even made an effort to "play games" with the world inspectors. In fact they r advertising their nuclear powess. If US is so game, why don't he fight another war as he always like to ? The scenario game can be played like tis too. They do not even need to send nuclear weopons to other parts of the world, They just launch from their current location, Japan, China and South Korea will be gone. Wat is more risky ? Can we still sit still because of tat too.<br><br>It is surprising tat u still believe tat there is possibility of weopons in<br>iraq. U think US is so stupid not to employ the use of those high technology equipment u mentioned after hs closest ally is suffering from the greatest political crisis ? They would certainly love to tell to the world they were right. I guess u stil belive in US fairy tales tat they have underground labyrith with Hitler living inside. Heck they even have roaming zombies in it, not like Cu Chi tunnels but like resident evil. Wat does finding burried unflyable obsolete planes and US dollars sounds so incredible ? U can find them buried in Russia everywhere.<br><br>I cannot stand the way u say Iraqis deserved to suffer in an unstable and volatile situation. I only need to ask r they like tis before the war ? No, they r living nicely with law, order, power and water. Wat happened then ? Some greedy people try to act hero and mess up their lives. Then they say they deserved it themselves ? R u being fair to them ? Saddam may be inciting them to fight, just as any natons will. Winston Churchill during WWII also agitating their soldiers to fight more bravely ? Which commander in history doesn't do tat ? US also inciting their soldiers to fight Iraqis too, wat is wrong for tat ? I don't see anything foolish with tat ?<br><br>Anyway, how many percent of their population is really educated ? Why talk to the 1% highly US educated people instead of the rest of the poor 99% Wat made u so sure the views is not from the majority of Iraqis ? I believe more people r the silent majority. US also show few people crying over their relatives killed during Saddam regime. R they the majority then ? The stupiest thing US did is to forced the resignation of all public servants because they r from Saddam regime. They r lumping them together.<br><br></div>
