It opens the doors very wide to foreign contractors, suppliers, professionals and workers to compete against citizens for this same reason.<br><br>If any of the above-stated departments which are not in charge of security or critical responsibilities anyway can be handled equally well by firms in the private sectors, they should be outsourced to lower Singaporeans' costs of living and doing business. At the present moment, many of the officers are costly to maintain.<br><br>Dr. Vivian Balakrishnan was seen on TV saying that "civil service is a jack of all trades but initiator of none" Today this is still true.
