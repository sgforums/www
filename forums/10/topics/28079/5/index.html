If you've never been to Singapore, how can you even comment? Most of us Singaporeans have been to malaysia, or have friends/relatives who live there so we can honestly say we know we're talking about. So before you come n comment, i suggest you climb out of your cave, come to Singapore... maybe talk to a few malays... And for crying out loud, try not to come here n sound like such a bloody swakoo... cuz it only shows how freakin dumb n ignorant you are.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>WaahhÂ… so many people attack me aaaaÂ… hehehÂ…<br><br>Our soldierÂ’s uniform allows Muslims to wear tudung. Even though we are an Islamic country we do not force our Muslims and non-Muslims soldiers to wear tudung. We do not force them to leave the squad if they want to wear tudung. It is just a matter of personal choice. Our rules are more flexible by incorporating acceptable norms and religious aspects not only to avoid racial riot, the ultimate aim is to promote respects and understanding even in Kelantan and Terengganu.<br><br>Even though in Malaysia we have various types of schools, we never restrict any of the pupils to attend to any of the schools. Malays can go to Chinese and Tamil school without any problem of wearing tudung. Even Chinese and Indian are allowed to attend the National schools or Madrasahs. No force on them to put on Islamic attire. Chinese and Indian are allowed to take various subjects including Islamic Education. None of the students are stopped from learning languages like English, Mandarin, Tamil or Arab.<br><br>How often does your rule change on this subject? It is just a matter of whether you want it to be changed or not. Your assertion that discipline and religious are two separate issues and religion should not play a big role in your civic and secular society conclude that nothing is against my statement - religion is no longer important in Singapore. I do not see which part of the sensitivities is respected when it comes to our discussion of not allowing pupil with full Islamic attire to attend your public school. I do not think the purpose of such rule is to prevent discomfort among other believers. The policy itself is creating discomfort among the society especially when they have to deal with people who comply with their belief when they go outside.<br><br>We will never allow tourist to not to cover up. I have no objections on that part at all because it is not only unaccepted by the Muslims. Even other religions and customs do not allow such behaviour. We expect foreign tourist to respect the Malaysian way of life because it is just not acceptable by all races in the country. Maybe it is acceptable in your country. Since one of you highlighted this issue, may be he/she is the one who likes to walk around without anything covering up his/her body. If so, do it in Singapore. No place for that in Malaysia.<br><br>As far as I am concern, I am just questioning the rational behind the tudung issue and giving response based on the Singaporean feedbacks. I did not give any comments based on my limited knowledge on Singapore since I have not been there. Your comments have raised another questions and perceptions or even impressions on some part of them. I do not think any part of my comments is racist or radical. If any, I would like to apologise because I did not mean to provoke anything.<br><br>Back to the main issue, now I really understand why Muslim girls are not allowed to wear tudung. It is not discrimination. It is because that is how the system works there or in other words Â– thatÂ’s the rule. If you say that we are racist by providing more opportunities to Bumiputera, well ladies and gentlemen, alas Â– thatÂ’s the rule!!<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Kayas boy , the tundung issue was set by the govt and agreed by muslim leaders.<br>To maintain equality in School , the sg govt prefers that tudungs will not be wore in sch. Every religious issue in Sg will be settle carefully with the help of related religion leaders , with the majority of our dear muslim leaders agreeing on the ban of tudung in school ,the govt have been very fair on the law. On my view , no religous discrimination could be seen on the issue.<br><br>I hope pple (singaporean / Non-singaporean ) will not be indifferent to start a wave of religous or other sensitive issues which will upset a peaceful diverse population . It doesnt mean we should not express our views , but try not to make a big fuss in the media without seeking out reasons from the related organisations .</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sorry for keeping you wait Shawnshank. It seems that our discussion has lead to questions about Islam. We are moving towards sensitive issues that may create hatred among the community with different believe. I am worried that some of my points may insult others. Questioning the rule of religion is a very dangerous act especially in countries like ours. Just like if I questioned on the trinity concept or burning replicas for the dead (just an example).<br><br>It is really difficult for me to explain about Islam to a non-believer like you. I will answer some of the above responses that I think I am able to answer since my knowledge on Islam is also quite limited. This is just to share some info or views and provide more ideas for you on what Islam is all about. Nobody is perfect and knows all.<br><br>It is not the Malays who insist that women must wear Â‘tudungÂ’. It is rule of Islam that provide a guideline on which part of the body should be covered i.e. for men Â– from the navel to the knee, and for female Â– only face and hands are allowed to be exposed (the purpose of wearing Â‘tudungÂ’ is not just to cover hair, it is also for covering areas encompassing ears, neck and parts of the chest). The use of Â‘burkarÂ’ is actually influenced by the culture in Afghanistan (note that culture and religion is different). No such ruling in Islam to cover the whole head.<br><br>An easy example to differentiate culture and religion is on the use of Â‘songkokÂ’. In Islam the male followers are encouraged to cover their heads especially during the prayer (Â‘sunnahÂ’). That is the basic guideline by Islam.

This to ensure that the beauty of female can only be seen by close relatives (Â‘muhrimÂ’) and the ones who entitled to see e.g. father, sisters, cousins and husband. The reason is not to discriminate women but to preserve and appreciate the value of a womenÂ’s splendour. Why not blind fold the men? HehehhÂ… I suggest u to try and walk around the town blind folded. Then you will know why.<br><br>It is the culture that subjugates the women not the religion. Islam never allows women to be subjugated. Which part of the Islamic ruling subjugates the women? Before you answer, please make a reference to any event and statement in Quran for such allegation. If you think there is, I am very sure that it is due to local cultural influence or merely miss-interpretation.<br><br>Islam is not an adoption of ArabsÂ’ religion. The people of Arab and the language are simply the medium of interaction to convey massage or ruling by God but then unfortunately, you are not a believer.

And it was not started only after Prophet Muhammad received the first Â‘wahyuÂ’ (message from God). It has no starting point and has no ending. Even before the creation of Adam and then Eve, right to Solomon, Joseph, Moses, Abraham, Noah, Jesus, Muhammad (not in sequence order) etc to the future. The religion is not only for Arab people. It is for the entire human being. Even the Chinese in some parts of China are Muslims. We still keep parts of the cultures that do not go against the guidelines in the religion e.g. the use of Â‘baju MelayuÂ’ among the Malays and the Chinese architectural design for mosque in China.<br><br>It is wrong to state that Â‘tudungÂ’ was never part of the local scene before. It has always been the rule of Islam but it was yet to be followed due to lack of awareness on the part of the Muslims themselves or due to colonial influence. The recent trend indicates the higher level of understanding and appreciation on the subject. One cannot be accused as radical just because of the Â‘tudungÂ’. It is just a way to cover some parts of the head. Just like wearing caps or the trendy fashion gypsy style (I donÂ’t know what they call it). What is so frightening about that?<br><br>WeyÂ… Atobe! Where the hell did you get such an idea that the Â‘tudungÂ’ issue started with the resurgence of the Arab. OPEC is absolutely not relevant with our discussion.
