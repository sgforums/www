            <div class='col-md body'>One more thing. Innocent Malaysian, just because you saw someone post something about tech transfer in Acig, do not try to add your own stuff in and pull this off on us, we know where you get your info from, and in this case, the person didn't even mention what tech transfer, I doubt he knows anyway. Once again, you have proved yourself as an idiot.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Wa lau.. Superhornet has no stealth lah... One look can tell already.<br><br>They say that its main strength is its ability to take a full warload without the need for extra fuel tanks (notice that most normal Hornets now almost <span style="font-style: italic;">always</span> carry twin drop tanks?)<br><br>The plane looks a bit beefier and broader (nope... doesn't help stealth at all), and you can see distinct bulges at the sides of the engine intakes.<br><br>Now, why would M'sia need a long-ranged plane when S'pore is so near?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Bottom line : M'sia got the wrong type of plane. (But shhh! Dun tell them!)<br><br>Comeon lah... If M'sia was really that buddy-buddy with America, then you'll be talking JSF's and F-22's, not Superhornets.</div>
