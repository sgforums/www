            <div class='col-md body'>Its true that the SuperHornet has the lowest RCS of the 'teen' fighters, even lower than that of the -16C/D. BUT, that's only in the CLEAN config, meaning no external weapons. Come on, come fly to Singapore without any weapons <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  Also, while it has a lower RCS than the F-16, it is not so low observable as to be undetectable at tactically significant ranges. our E-2 will see your SuperHornets well before they are anywhere near Singapore. Finally, the US versions of aircraft will always be different from that of other countries. For example, their F-16s have a special coating applied to lower their RCS, such that their F-16s are stealthier than those of other countrys'. The same will apply to your "oh-so-stealthy' SuperHornets, so dont expect too much.<br><br>As for your AESA dreams..... maybe you'll get them, but with all the money you're spending now, we gonna have to wait long long.....</div>

I've no connections watsoever wif the 'malay' country<br>3rd:The MAF are never n will never be in a position to challenge the SAF. U noe why? Look at the soldiers,maf soldiers are malays who are not educationally qualified,inefficient,n most importantly,not motivated<br>4th:Malaysian racial policies will bring them nowhere.I study in Raffles JC n imthe only malay in my class. However,we respect everyone as individual.English is a must. When we go NS,we are treated the same,educated or not.<br>5th:Always bear in mind that if Malaysia ever dare cut the water supply,rest assured we will go to war. N i believe the SAF will strike 1st. According to international law,geneva convention of 1932,Malaysia is obliged to comply to the 1961,62 water agreement failing which, singapore has every right to take action,including military.<br>AND 1 GODDAMNED THING I WANNA MAKE IT CLEAR!!!<br>CPT ZUL may jus be a helo pilot,but he may be the 1 to rescue ani malaysian soldier injured during an exercise in the future</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i'm back. . . anyway, Malaysia seems to be the only Muslim country Singapore has personal problems with (except Indonesia but that was only when Haibibie was in-charge and long and long ago in the 1960s and 70s)<br><br>eg. Singapore Technologies recently aided Turkey in designing their first indegenious 155mm 52 cal arty<br><br>Singapore constantly has troop deployments to Brunei for exercises and training with the Brunei army<br><br>Singapore has huge investments in Indonesia and pumped in money into that place during the economic crisis<br><br>and....<br><br>I agree with the person sometime back who posted in this thread that Malaysia isn't exactly on the best of terms ith all its neighbours either<br><br>, also<br><br>sure, we all gotta grow up and stop bickering, but if some clown from another country refuses to face facts and relishes in giving our country a good bashing on a public forum, then I think we Singaporeans should bash that clown back to whereever the hell he belongs.<br><br>my two cents</div>

Sitting Bull<br>c. Arnold Schwarzenegger<br>d. Muslim male extremists mostly between the ages of 17 and 40<br><br>2. In 1979, the U.S. embassy in Iran was taken over by:<br>a. Lost Norwegians<br>b. Elvis<br>c. A tour bus full of 80-year-old women<br>d. Muslim male extremists mostly between the ages of 17 and 40<br><br>3. During the 1980's, a number of Americans were kidnapped in Lebanon by:<br>a. John Dillinger<br>b. The King of Sweden<br>c. The Boy Scouts<br>d. Muslim male extremists mostly between the ages of 17 and 40<br><br>4. In 1983, the U.S. Marine barracks in Beirut was blown up by:<br>a. A pizza delivery boy<br>b. Pee Wee Herman<br>c. Geraldo Rivera<br>d. Muslim male extremists mostly between the ages of 17 and 40<br><br>5. In 1985, the cruise ship Achille Lauro was hijacked and a 70 year old American passenger was murdered and thrown overboard in his wheelchair by:<br>a. The Smurfs<br>b. Davy Jones<br>c. The Little Mermaid<br>d. Muslim male extremists mostly between the ages of 17 and 40<br><br>6.

Muslim male extremists mostly between the ages of 17 and 40<br><br>8. In 1993, the World Trade Center was bombed the first time by:<br>a. Richard Simmons<br>b. Grandma Moses<br>c. Michael Jordan<br>d. Muslim male extremists mostly between the ages of 17 and 40<br><br>9. In 1998, the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania were bombed by:<br>a. Mr. Rogers<br>b. Hillary, to distract attention from Wild Bill's women problems<br>c. The World Wrestling Federation<br>d. Muslim male extremists mostly between the ages of 17 and 40<br><br>10.

Billy Graham<br>d. Muslim male extremists mostly between the ages of 17 and 40<br><br>Nope, .....I really don't see a pattern here to justify racial profiling, do you? So, to ensure we Americans never offend anyone, particularly fanatics intent on killing us, airport security screeners will no longer be allowed to profile certain people. They must conduct random searches of 80-year-old women, little kids, airline pilots with proper identification, Secret Service agents who are members of the President's security detail, 85-year old Congressmen with metal hips, and Medal of Honor winning former Governors. Let's send this to as many people as we can so that the Gloria Allreds and other dunder-headed attorneys along with Federal Justices that want to thwart common sense feel doubly ashamed of themselves. As the writer of the award winning story Forrest Gump so aptly put it, "Stupid is as stupid does!"<br></strong><br><br>I got nothing against muslims, I only dun like those extremists AND chauvinists.
