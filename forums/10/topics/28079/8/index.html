            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by Atobe:<br><strong>Hello Kyas,<br><br>Your three postings on 21 January 2003 remains without any impressions left on me, and merely confirms my last reply to you, and that is<br><br><span style="color: darkred;">[b]Religion (and GOD) is created by MAN</span></strong><br><br>Yusuf Islam (aka Cat Stevens) is the epitome of a typical Western Man, who is disenchanted and bored by his own familiar culture and society; and fell into romantic embrace of a foreign culture that mystify him. He is by no means an intelligent person, although he is creative in his songs, which reflects largely his own disappointment with his own life, culture, society, and family life.<br><br>Gary Miller (aka Abdul-Ahad-Omar) is no great Philosopher- Thinker, whom one can place beside Homer, Karl Marx, Bertrand Russell, or other similar radical dissident luminaries of their own period.<br><br>Your writing confirms the fact that <strong><span style="color: brown;">Religion is dependent on Human Recording of some Human visions</span></strong> of events that is awe-inspiring.<br><br>To name a few, some of these Human Religious Records are the Jewish Torah, the Islamic Koran, the Bible, (which translate the Jewish Torah into readable English language Â– but carry with it the writings of JesusÂ’ Disciples as reflected in the New Testament).<br><br><strong><span style="color: brown;">The practice of religion in this Twenty-First Century is still dependent on the Human Interpretation of these Ancient Writings</span></strong>, by some Human Being appointed as a Religious Leader -  by some Inner Council of Other Humans, whose own appointments are questionable.<br><br>Whether the Religions concerned are Anglican, Methodist, Protestants, Lutherans, Roman Catholics, Orthodox Christians, Jewry, Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism, Sikhism, Taoism, Shintoism, and all other Human Faiths Â– they are <strong><span style="color: brown;">all dependent on some HUMAN Interpretation </span></strong>of Phenomena.<br><br>Much of your writing confirms my stated position, in which you have written the close observation of the customary practices as interpreted from your Koran.<br><br>The Â“Big Bang TheoryÂ” confirms ManÂ’s continuous search for an answer to his vain quest to find out his origin, his purpose on this earth, and his destiny.<br><br>The fact that research and knowledge coincide, does not confirm the correctness of one religion or its superiority over the others.<br><br>It merely confirms that the Human Mind is the same regardless of Religion adopted or followed or observed or practiced.<br><br>When a Society adopts an Â‘Ancient ReligionÂ’ and allow it to advocate the suppression of any member of its own Human Race Â– by the evil and narrow minded interpretation of HISTORICAL records Â– it merely show the inadequacy of that Society to deal with the social, political, economic, and religious challenges of the Twenty-First Century that its society is facing.<br>[/b]</blockquote>This is just a continuation of the previous article of Gary Miller.<br><br>Yes he is no great Philosopher- Thinker, whom one can place beside Homer, Karl Marx, Bertrand Russell, or other similar radical dissident luminaries of their own period. Do not forget that the article is all about facts that we can always verify (go and check for yourself... this not just another theory) and comparison with Al QuranÂ… well who is Chua Lee Hoong and Cheah Sin Ann anywayÂ…<br><br><span style="color: blue;"><span style="font-style: italic;">The Expanding Heavens </span><br><br>Let me first show more of our examination of the Qur'an, and then an examination of some words of prophets to find this point of convergence. In chapter fifty one, verse forty seven, it is mentioned that the heavens are expanding. As I mentioned earlier, this is in connection with the "Big Bang" origin of the universe, as it is usually called, and it was in 1973 that the Nobel prize was awarded to three men who were confirming that, after all, the universe is expanding.<br><br>The comments of Muslims over the centuries on this verse which speaks of the heavens doing exactly that is very interesting. The wisest among them had stated that the words are very dear, that the heavens are expanding, but they could not imagine how that could be so. But they were content to leave the words as they were, to say: "Allah knows best."<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The City of Iram </span><br><br>The Qur'an mentions a city by the name of Iram (89:7). The city of Iram has been unknown to history, so unknown that even some Muslim commentators, out of embarrassment or feeling apologetic for their religion, have commented on this mention of the city in the Qur'an as being perhaps figurative, that Iram was possibly a man and not a city.<br><br>In 1973 the excavation in Syria at the site of the ancient city of Eblus uncovered the largest collection of cuneiform writings on clay tablets ever assembled. In fact, the library discovered in Eblus contains more day tablets that are more than four thousand years old than all the other tablets combined from all the other sites.<br>Interestingly enough, you will find the details in the National Geographic of 1978 which confirms that in those tablets the city of Iram is mentioned. The people of Eblus used to do business with the people of Iram. So here in 1973, comes confirmation of the fact that, after all, there really was an ancient city by that name, wherever it was. How did it find its way into the Qur'an, we might ask?<br><br>Those Muslims who may have offered their comments, trying to explain away this reference that they were uncomfortable with, were outsmarted by the author of the Qur'an. They are those who would outsmart the author of the Qur'an They would attempt it. Primarily, their activity would involve trying to produce the evidence that the author of this book had a primitive understanding of the world around us.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The Smallest Matter </span><br><br>For example, there is a word which is translated today usually in Arabic as zarrah. This is usually translated as "atom" and it is usually thought of in Arabic as being the smallest item available at one time. Perhaps the Arabs thought it was an ant or a grain of dust. Today the word is usually translated as "atom".<br><br>Those who would outsmart the author of the Qur'an have insisted that, well, the atom is not after all the smallest piece of matter because in this century it has been discovered that even the atom is made of still smaller pieces of matter. Is it then possible to outsmart the author who chose to use this word? Well, there is an interesting verse, in chapter ten, verse sixty one, which speaks of items the size of a zarrah, (atom) or smaller.<br><br>There is no possibility that on this subject someone is going to say a new discovery has outdated the words of the Qur'an on the issue of the size of matter or the ultimate particles. The verse talks about items the size of a zarrah (atom) or smaller. </span><br></div>

This is to avoid people from worshipping statues and to differentiate the Muslims with the ones who worship statues. Are there any human being that is as small as the barbie doll? No. therefore it is allowed.

Now I always take any found wallet to a proper place, without actually keeping any of the cash or things. I did it because someone had actually returned the wallet to me untouched. Wat I was hoping is tat whoever received my gesture of returning wallet will do the same and return the wallet to the proper place instead of keeping them. thus there will be more wallet returners in society then wallet keepers. Next time I lose a wallet, it being picked by wallet returners will be higher... Now wat I wish other to do for me, I will do for the others first...

            <div class='col-md body'>definitely the best forum discussion i've read so far. bout this religion thing.whoever raised the issue, it definitely beats reading bout the original discussion topic. k, i know this might sound kinda lame and others might just kill it of by saying excuses, but this is wat my pastor offered me when i asked him bout all the dinosaurs and things that we have never heard of in the bible. God is our creator. He determines wat we need to know, when we need to know, and how we are to know of it. if He were to describe every being He has created, we would not be able to distinguish wat He actually wanted us to learn from it. The bible wouldn't be a bible if it had all that knowledge and information, it'd be a complete encyclopedia guide!! how's that?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>According to medical research, mutton and beef require three hours to be digested in the stomach but pork needs four hours.<br><br>There are many things in the world which man must know how to differentiate before putting them into his mouth. there are many plants which are edible, while some are poisonous and can kill, although many of these plants are medicinal herbs. Similarly there is flesh which is harmful to man. Naturally pork is not so poisonous as to kill people on the spot. The poison is latent in pork as has been explained aboved. It is not as nourishing as any other meat and it may cause prolonged suffering.<br><br>People may say "the chinese have been eating pork for countless generation and it is the national food for the chinese and yet the chinese exist in large numbers in the world. But please note that the chinese are in general compelled to be vegetarians. Peasants who comprise at least 80% of the total population of China enjoy the eating of pork just about 3 times a year viz. at the beginning of the year, the 5th day of the 5th Moon and the 5th day of 8th Moon. I can confirm that no peasants in china could consume 24 pound of pork a year in the past. Today they cannot eat more than 12 pound a year. Please note that in the previous articles many of the diseases caused by pork came from china.<br><br>another article wrote by haji ibrahim ma</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Kyas:<br><br>You bring great items of interest to our attention and for that I thank you.<br><br>However I still dont see any religious reason to avoid pork. If the things you've posted happen to be the reasons then, to my understanding, Islam forbids pork because it is unhealthy? While I applaud this evidence of an early public health policy, I fail to see why only pork is singled out? Im sure you understand my confusion. Saying avoid an animal because it is unhealthy is quite different from saying that that animal is haram...<br><br>Also, I already had an idea that raw pork can be incredibly deadly...but do all those scary things survive cooking?</div>

God is our creator. He determines wat we need to know, when we need to know, and how we are to know of it. if He were to describe every being He has created, we would not be able to distinguish wat He actually wanted us to learn from it. The bible wouldn't be a bible if it had all that knowledge and information, it'd be a complete encyclopedia guide!! how's that?<br></div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> Thats why a very literal reading of any religious text and utter and complete faith in it should be discouraged. I believe it is a guiding text. The ability to conciously perceive our surroundings and react and learn is Humankind's greatest gift. Whether it was divinely given or not, I believe it should not be strangled  by closed minds...especially when dealing with something so important as belief in a greater being. The problem has always been and always will be people from opposite sides trying to impose their view on others...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There's a reason why pork is popular eating in many countries, that's because pigs are the most efficent at converting feed to meat, about 25 percent of feed in fact. For poorer communities, rearing pigs is the most penny wise for lifestock.<br><br>As for the supposed "ill" effects of eating pork and all the supposed "toxins" and such. There has been I repeat, NO conclusive scientific research done into pork that has proven any of this. And the supposed list of diseases you can get via eating pork is misleading, for the risk of catching ill effects from other meats or even vegetables are also present. Though of course, common sense is encouraged in eating pork, avoid the lard if you can and don't overload on it, because it's has the highest energy content of all the meats you can eat. Eating pork is like eating about any other meat. Though personally I'm a chicken and lamb person.<br><br>Other then that, trying to find scientific reasons not to eat pork to justify religion is pretty much lik trying to get a square peg into a round hole. Most of the scientific "reasons" put up dun hold water when put to critical scientific method. The reasons appears, are for other then actual metaphysical reasons.</div>

And it does not appear to work experimentally too, we have yet to see truckloads of people at hospitals from these diseases, if at all.
