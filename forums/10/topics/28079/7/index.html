Too literal an interpretation of any religion is a bad thing. These words came from  centuries ago, times were different then. Religious intolerence is such an ugly thing to see in people of the 21st century. Granted we dont have colonies on Mars and flying cars but surely we can recognise the intrinsic value of another religion. Religions basically teach people good things and thus all religions are basically good. We're not in the Middle Ages anymore where we were afraid of invading heretics. Putting down another religion is just plain ignorant and rather arrogant.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just to say a piece of my mind after reading so much articles on this issue...<br><br>First thing first, when one believe in a religion, he have to believe everything tat the source had said. For example if u r a Christian, u have to fully believe the bible. If u r a Muslim, u have to fully believe the Quran. (Hence source = bibles, Quran, scriptures etc) One cannot say he believe the Quran for certain chapters, the following phrases and not believe in the rest. Why can't one do selective believing ? Because it means u already believe tat the source isnÂ’t always correct, and may make u think logically why canÂ’t one eat pork or one have to cover the head till the ears etcÂ… The source must act almost like a history textbook, it tells u wat had actually happened in the past. If I am not wrong, Muslim and Christian tell almost the same tale till Christ, tales like Adam and Eve, Noah's Ark, World is created by 7 days etc. FranklyÂ… They sound too close to being mere folk stories, legends to me. I cannot believe tat the Earth was once a garden for Adam and Eve, or tat Eve was created out of a ribcage, or a devil disguised as a snake pursuading Adam to eat the fruit or Wisdom. There r too many flaws, too childish, too idealistic to be true. Just think logically, scientifically when u read those stories again. DoesnÂ’t tat sounds like fairytales ? If u believe them, why doesnÂ’t u believe in Chinese folktales or Indian folktales too ?<br><br>I like the story about the knife and asking too much questions etc in kayaÂ’s tale... but if we do not ask for prove before believing, then we r being blind and ignorance, and easily get cheated.  One should not just accept things blindly without questioning. Tat is why science is so interesting as it asked people to support their claims with proof, and it must be ALWAYS true in the given situation and conditions. I believe kyak believe in science as the real truth too, as he compared the Quran AGAINST the big bang theory. In other words, if science proves it, then it is the truth. In tat caseÂ… why donÂ’t people believe in science totally ? Why canÂ’t they believe in DarwinÂ’s evolution theory, Big Bang Theory and a freak case of coincidence tat creates life instead of some Supreme Being which we never see, never hear and never proven to exists, probably cooked up by people with strange dreams, or schizophrenic, who creates human to be his toys or entertainment and now doing nothing but giving believers favours and advantages while condemning the others.<br><br>About his tale of the man knowing your father, I have to say tat it is true in a certain sense. It is only true if he say everything is correct. He can say 100 true things about your father, but it only takes one false statement to know he is telling a lie. If your father has a gigantic mole on his nose the size of a fist from birth, and he claims your father has none, than u can say he is lying to u. U can only say tat statement is correct, but u cannot say the whole Quran is true. I donÂ’t know about Quran but for the bible, they claim tat the Earth revolves around the sun. Of course now it is common sense tat is obviously wrong. Tat alone can discredit the whole bible and everything in it. One might say isnÂ’t tat too strict ? No. Laws of physics, chemistry is capable to withstand tat test, and tat distinguish itself from religion. The Quran tells of so many things, it is pure coincidental tat one of them match with science. And from your statement (21:30), tat is too vague to explain anything. Chinese too tell of a story of a giant Pang Gu separating the sky and earthÂ… does tat means we all have to believe tat it is true ?<br><br></div>

Why canÂ’t they believe in DarwinÂ’s evolution theory, Big Bang Theory and a freak case of coincidence tat creates life instead of some Supreme Being which we never see, never hear and never proven to exists, probably cooked up by people with strange dreams, or schizophrenic, who creates human to be his toys or entertainment and now doing nothing but giving believers favours and advantages while condemning the others.<br><br>About his tale of the man knowing your father, I have to say tat it is true in a certain sense. It is only true if he say everything is correct. He can say 100 true things about your father, but it only takes one false statement to know he is telling a lie. If your father has a gigantic mole on his nose the size of a fist from birth, and he claims your father has none, than u can say he is lying to u. U can only say tat statement is correct, but u cannot say the whole Quran is true. I donÂ’t know about Quran but for the bible, they claim tat the Earth revolves around the sun. Of course now it is common sense tat is obviously wrong. Tat alone can discredit the whole bible and everything in it. One might say isnÂ’t tat too strict ? No. Laws of physics, chemistry is capable to withstand tat test, and tat distinguish itself from religion. The Quran tells of so many things, it is pure coincidental tat one of them match with science. And from your statement (21:30), tat is too vague to explain anything. Chinese too tell of a story of a giant Pang Gu separating the sky and earthÂ… does tat means we all have to believe tat it is true ?<br><br></div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> I like ur style!! You very obviously like science, good for you. However you seem to be very rigidly against religions for their inconsistencies. Not so good...<br><br>Religion has an intrinsic value system that science, so far, cannot provide. No experiment can tell you if it is good or bad to hurt someone. In fact there is no such thing as good or bad in science, just results.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> Im guessing you'll be saying "But isnt it obvious that hurting people is bad??"<br><br>I'll repeat myself <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> With a vigorously scientific system there can be no answer. If you think about it...the stigma towards acts that are "bad" is entirely based on religion. I dare say that without concepts of good and bad from religion the world as we know it would be a very different place.<br><br>You disagree with the concept of selectively accepting religion. Then you go on to say that one must not blindly believe. I would dare say that the concept of the selective acceptance of religion represents questioning and the improving of religion. It is so true that one must not blindly believe. Recognise that the value of religion is not to provide every single answer to everything. It is the belief and hope that there is something better in this world that we can aspire to be.<br><br>You ask why dont people believe utterly in science. If we really did that...then would you argue that we must believe everything that the great big source book of science says? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> If man had stuck to believing everything in his science textbooks then we would never have gotten anywhere. Thankfully people are starting to realise it's the same with religion...<br><br>I humbly suggest that you tone down your disregard (though personally i think it's closer to contempt) for religion and realise that some people will always choose to seek answers in their own special way.<br><br>Complete utter faith in anything is fanaticism.<br><br>P.S. - Concerning Darwinism...Im<br>not being Creationist here...but if i remember correctly arent there rather large holes in the theory? I cant remember where i read it from but i just thought I'd tell you as ur obviously interested in science. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Do some searching on the internet, im sure you'll find it...<br><br></div>

For example if u r a Christian, u have to fully believe the bible. If u r a Muslim, u have to fully believe the Quran. (Hence source = bibles, Quran, scriptures etc) One cannot say he believe the Quran for certain chapters, the following phrases and not believe in the rest. Why can't one do selective believing ? Because it means u already believe tat the source isnÂ’t always correct, and may make u think logically why canÂ’t one eat pork or one have to cover the head till the ears etcÂ… The source must act almost like a history textbook, it tells u wat had actually happened in the past. If I am not wrong, Muslim and Christian tell almost the same tale till Christ, tales like Adam and Eve, Noah's Ark, World is created by 7 days etc. FranklyÂ… They sound too close to being mere folk stories, legends to me. I cannot believe tat the Earth was once a garden for Adam and Eve, or tat Eve was created out of a ribcage, or a devil disguised as a snake pursuading Adam to eat the fruit or Wisdom. There r too many flaws, too childish, too idealistic to be true. Just think logically, scientifically when u read those stories again. DoesnÂ’t tat sounds like fairytales ? If u believe them, why doesnÂ’t u believe in Chinese folktales or Indian folktales too ?<br><br>I like the story about the knife and asking too much questions etc in kayaÂ’s tale... but if we do not ask for prove before believing, then we r being blind and ignorance, and easily get cheated.  One should not just accept things blindly without questioning. Tat is why science is so interesting as it asked people to support their claims with proof, and it must be ALWAYS true in the given situation and conditions. I believe kyak believe in science as the real truth too, as he compared the Quran AGAINST the big bang theory. In other words, if science proves it, then it is the truth. In tat caseÂ… why donÂ’t people believe in science totally ? Why canÂ’t they believe in DarwinÂ’s evolution theory, Big Bang Theory and a freak case of coincidence tat creates life instead of some Supreme Being which we never see, never hear and never proven to exists, probably cooked up by people with strange dreams, or schizophrenic, who creates human to be his toys or entertainment and now doing nothing but giving believers favours and advantages while condemning the others.<br><br>About his tale of the man knowing your father, I have to say tat it is true in a certain sense.

U can only say tat statement is correct, but u cannot say the whole Quran is true. I donÂ’t know about Quran but for the bible, they claim tat the Earth revolves around the sun. Of course now it is common sense tat is obviously wrong. Tat alone can discredit the whole bible and everything in it. One might say isnÂ’t tat too strict ? No. Laws of physics, chemistry is capable to withstand tat test, and tat distinguish itself from religion. The Quran tells of so many things, it is pure coincidental tat one of them match with science. And from your statement (21:30), tat is too vague to explain anything.

Before Adam was brought to earth as the leader (khalifah), he was tought by God the names of alll things and living things on earth. (Al-Baqarah:31).<br><br>So... the Quran support the idea that all those pre historic creatures existed... even long before Adam was sent to earth they are already living creatures on earth.<br><br>I am sure you have read the Bible... why don't you try to read the Quran... so that you can make a clearer comparison.
