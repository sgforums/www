You keep an open eye and an open mind abt things and learn from the things there.  What I am recounting are personal experiences from a trip up north where I also happened to learn a little bit more abt Malaysia.<br><br>The fact that you have not come to singapore and have no intention to do so, accounts for your poor judgement of Singapore as 'just a small island'.   I take it that you have no intention of coming due to your lack of interest in Singapore, if you lack this interest, then how do you credibly comment on what Singapore is?  I would strongly advise you to take a trip down south to have a look around before you lay your judgement.<br><br>my two cents<br></div>

I am not certain if you are referring to those I met before. Two years back, I went to Endau Rompin on a school expedition, they acted as our local guides in the forests in Endau Rompin.  I still carry the leech bite scars form that trip. . .will never forget it, and those guides really know the forests well. . .would recommend you to take a trip there yourself too if you want to really meet and find out about them, you can stay at the sort of lodging area or park ranger's HQ(whatever you call it, its accessible by road) in the forests, it has a museum of some sort displaying the plants and insects in those forests.  There are comfortable beds there and a sort of large dome shaped shared toilet bulding with a few cuibicles inside.  The government employ many of the Orang Asli as guides in these forests.<br><br>Alternatively, there are some sort of platforms for you to pitch your tent on near some river, it is not very accesible by road, you have to walk uphill abit to get to a road. . .one tent per platform, there is also a toilet not very far away and near a shelter where we ate and did morning PT.<br><br>Basically, its pretty fun and you can get know your Orang Aslis at the same time  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>"my disagreement with M'sia policy is that while u're giving assistance, why restrict this assistance only to a select group of your citizenry? does it make the rest any less malaysian? does it make Bumis any more malaysian?<br><br>i know that Malaysians of every ethnic background is capable of loyalty and national pride. so what's the gov'ts problem using skin colour and ethnicity as a criteria to determine who deserves gov't assistance?"<br><br>Due colonialism, 'Malaysian' were divided into 3 main groups economically. One was the people who worked in the tin mines. Most of them were Chinese. They were more exposed to urban way of life. Second were the people who worked with the British in the rubber or oil palm estate. Too many them are Indians. They are lack of exposure in term of modernisation. The third was the people who make a living in the traditional sectors as fishermen and farmers. Most of them are the Malays and other ethnic people.<br><br>This colonialism had been going on for so many decades to the extent that it has created a stigma among the society saying that if you are Malay, u should be living in kampong and makes a living by being a farmer. If you are an Indian you cannot avoid yourself from being an estate worker. And Chinese must be a businessman.  As a result, Chinese are wealthier than the others. The then leaders saw this as unhealthy situation, where the country's wealth was only enjoyed by a certain ethnic group.<br><br>That was why the Malaysian government has been giving a lot of assistance especially to the Bumiputera.

Surely none of you out there can deny that if only one race controls the economy, there is a tendency that the others will be discriminated. A huge example, look at the U.S. the only superpower left after no more U.S.S.R.

We had the British, we had divide and rule, we had plantations (first gambier and pepper, then rubber), we had kampongs and fishermen and we had towns and commerce.

            <div class='col-md body'>Â“If Islam can allow a Muslim Pilot to forgo fasting during Ramadan, and also forego the frequent breaks for daily prayers required of a faithful Muslim, then perhaps maybe we can see some Singapore Malay who qualify to become Fighter Pilots.Â”<br><br>Dear Atobe,<br><br>The above statement has proven that you are lack of understanding about Islam.<br><br>One can forego fasting during Ramadan under any of the following conditions:<br>1.	sick or suffering from a disease that could affect your health if you continue fasting,<br>2.	a lady comes to her Â‘periodÂ’ or<br>3.	after a delivery,<br>4.	a musafir (travel more than 60 marhalah approximately 91 km) and<br>5.	you are no longer a Muslim.<br><br>In the case of daily prayer the above conditions also applies except some flexibility for no. 1 and 4.<br><br>For condition no. 1, if you have a difficulty to stand, you can always perform your prayer by sitting down. If u cannot sit, you lay down. If you cannot move you body, just blink your eyes. If you cannot even blink our eyes you can simply perform your prayer by heart.<br><br>Under the fourth condition, if you are a musafir, there is an allowance.  You can perform your prayer by:<br>1.	Jamak (combine the solah eg. zohor can be perform during the period of asar before you perform your asar prayer) or<br>2.	Qasar (shorten the length of a prayer e.g. zohor prayer can be shorten to only 2 rakaah instead of 4) or<br>3.	Jamak Qasar (integrating the above 2 methods)<br><br>In the case of moving vehicle if you need to perform your prayer you can always perform it by facing any direction Â– no problem at all, especially in the huge passenger aircraft.<br><br>If you are performing your important duty that if you stop doing will affect other people, then you are allowed to defer you prayer to another period of solah. We call it qadaÂ’.<br><br>Islam is not so radical as portrayed especially by western media. It is not so strict that there is no flexibility. In some cases we can even eat pork. I hope my short explanations will clear some of your misunderstanding. If any of them is wrong, I hope the other Muslim brothers out there will correct me. Only God knows all.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I do agree with you that they can go to madrasah because that is the only place that allows them to practice their belief particularly in wearing tudung. Yes, they have their choices and it is up to them or their parents to choose. If this is the case, you are only creating a larger gap between a Muslim and non-Muslim. The Muslims will go to madrasah, and the non-Muslim will go to the public school. Will that help Singaporean to unite? Will that support the integration between races? I do not think so.<br><br>By the way, I was not talking about the choices they have. I was only talking about your school system Â– the system that was created by men. Are you saying that nothing can change a rule? Are you saying that discipline is the utmost important thing to the extent that you can forget about religion? This shows how unimportant religion is now in Singapore. Thank God the first thing in our Rukun Negara is to Â‘Believe in GodÂ’. That indicates how we respect religion and each otherÂ’s belief. We never force the non-Muslim to wear tudung. They can wear the type of uniform that can be considered as acceptable by their belief and culture.<br><br>Maybe for you tudung is Â‘just a piece of clothÂ’ and it is a petty thing. Well it is not a small matter to Muslims.<br><br>As for me if I were a Singaporean and if it is really true that the best alternative for education in Singapore is by attending public school, for the sake of my daughterÂ’s future, I will allow her to not to wear tudung in school because it is the rule Â– a rule that has no respect for religion. We call it Â‘daruratÂ’. So far nothing can be done about it except by voicing views through proper channel. I prefer to call it rule and not discipline because it not making you less discipline just because of the tudung.<br><br>American school system has nothing to do with our discussion. Thanks for highlighting that Muslim student are allowed to leave school early to attend the Friday prayer in Singapore. It is not news for me. But, it is discrimination for not allowing Muslims to practise their belief i.e. in this case wearing tudung for Muslim girls when they reach puberty.<br><br>I am sure that an open-minded person like will be able to understand because as you were saying Â“essentially there is no problemÂ” Â– no problem means no problem.</div>
