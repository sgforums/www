They even welcome contructive criticism to TR, as long as they make Singaporeans think and show some political awareness, instead of bochup which our Govt wants us to be.....</p>

              <p>I wonder whether those scholars find it hard especially there are red tapes within the organisation that those scholars simply shut off their mind and goes thru motion, afterall, they get good monthly salary.</p>

              <p>Well, if TR is permanently down, as the TOC site has said, then it's a bit too late for that, no? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>By all means discuss about real and proper issues instead of taking NEA to task for not predicting the weather correctly, or taking SCDF to task for their (I quote TR) 'patriachical approach' towards Mustafa Center's fire safety violations. So, if Mustafa Center went up in flames and got lots of casualties from violating fire safety codes, I suppose TR will thank SCDF for not being so 'patriachical'?</p>
              <p>By the way, the correct term is 'paternalistic', not 'patriarchical'. Their attempt to sound cheem has failed. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>On a more serious note, articles like those have convinced me that they are unable to walk the 
                  middle path of objectivity and careful analysis, and just make a lot of 
                  noise for the sake of making noise.</p>
