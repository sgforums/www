            <div class='col-md body'>Surely the government and Temasek must realised, that what is done without any regards in Singapore to Singaporeans (their cross control and monopoly of various industries), while being tolerated and endured by Singaporeans, will not necessarily be tolerated by the citizens and the government of other countries.<br><br>Monopoly will only bring about higher prices and less consumer surplus.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It is not difficult for our neighbouring countries to see how naive is our Temasek and to pretend to encourage it to seek expansions into their own domestic markets.<br><br>These countries' regulatory authorities will keep very quiet with no comments at first when Temasek is seeking to buy into their major companies thinking of their greatness or their having strategic good buys but once the deal is struck Temasek would be completely at these regulatory authorities' mercy for these regulatory authorities could easily think of ways and means of invoking some of their own laws or regulations to declare such purchases as illegal or irregular and impose heavy penalty.<br><br>This has happened in suzhou and shin corp and this will happen again and again but despite all the scholars in Temasek it just simply cannot see the ploys employed to nab Temasek into losing its billions of its people's hard-earned assets.<br><br>Even for purchase of China's domestic airlines, Temasek could boast again what a good buy it is but there is nothing to stop the China's regulatory authority to do an about-turn as has happened to suzhou project and cause problems to the purchase and treat temasek as money tree to shake some monies from.<br><br>After all to them Temasek is sucking monies from its own people through all kinds of schemes and they might as well take away this kind of easy monies before they are lost to others.<br><br>Laws or morality are not the issue with Temasek as it will continue to spend away citizens' hard-earned monies on shin corp so likewise the other countries would just simply look for every way and means to entice it and exploit temasek's naivety about its own greatness.</div>
