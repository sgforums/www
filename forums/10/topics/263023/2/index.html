It has been an unequal relation all these past 40 plus years with government ministers and their rookies being able to slam and defame any one by calling them names like whiners, quitters, hinese chauvanese, racists, liars etc without proof or evidence but at the slightest they would start a civil defamation against anyone without solid evidence.<br><br>It is about time people wake up and not to be taken for granted and begin to ask for fair and accountable system of governance.<br><br>To transform the government from autocracy and self-centredness the first agenda of the people is to put up proposal to change the constitution. Only throuh the constitution finally will the people have sufficient power to check on wrong doing or abuse of power.<br><br>What kind of system is this. Big fish eats small fishes?</div></blockquote>The problem when people unintentionally hit them on the weakness of their policies , they ask you for nric numbers.<br><br>The opposition parties I look at , they survive because it is a farce to show that Singapore is a democratic country. When any of the opposition trips on something, you see defamation suits coming up on every single opportunity.

But when they trip .....the same fate awaits them.<br><br>So what choice do people with opposing views do? They either migrate or risk having everything they worked for destroyed.<br><br>One perfect example of the consequences of having a nanny state govt , look at the bloody taxi forum post - something not working - some sheep brain will call for the govt to fix it. Well taxis are important but why not highlight to tourists that there is an option of public transport since Singapore's public transportation is actually good compared to the crap ones I see in Australia? Hawker centers raise food prices - and some sheep brains complain to the govt to control the prices. Meh .....go somewhere else and eat or cook stuff yourself since it is cheaper to do so.<br></div>

I don't believe in a top down approach that the government has taken.<br><br>Years ago when I was teenager, Singapore was number 1 in my head , PAP was a good government. Then cracks appear when I started asking an MP questions about foreign talents and what's not , I got asked for my nric in a forum that should be one where people unload their ideas and opinions to inform the rulers of what grassroots wanted to see.<br><br>After I went abroad for my study, Singapore was the safest country but at what price? I see people protesting peacefully because they don't agree with something. Albeit there are often emotions running high and protesters can get carried away but they provide me with a perspective that not everyone thinks the same. And their government is not silencing their right to voice vociferously against the policies unless they are threatening the security of the public.<br><br>I came back to Singapore only to find myself with a degree of disillusion. Scholars paid higher than commoners even though they have the same type of degree as I. Being told by administrators of a large hospital in Singapore that I won't be able to make it anywhere because I don't want to work for them anymore. And then having a friend being told she cannot go for a masters that she had saved money for , and they did not need to pay a cent. But  because she has "no leadership quality" in their eyes, she can't have the year of nopay study leave.<br><br>Working and around my neighbourhood, I see the plight of poor people yet I see our leaders paying themselves highly when the money could be better spent on helping the disadvantaged. Then you have the foreign talents which are really no better than our local talents.<br><br>That did it in for me. There was no way I can stay in a place which only paid lipservice to its citizens about constant upgrading yet did not allow capable people because they fear some sort of takeover on their jobs or something. Opting to take in third class foreigners in favor of well trained Singaporeans . Paying themselves so highly without regulation or input from the people. That is really too much.<br><br>My own government policies did not give me an option to stay on. I came back for 2.5 years of service - wasted years when I should have got out. Then the part about quitting the country - well I think the government should think on the factors that made people quitters rather than to label them.<br><br>Australia choose to adopt me because they lack people with my skills and I am grateful to Australia for that - a mutual benefit. It is not about what my country can do for me but what I can do for my country ....well my country did not do anything for me and I came back and wasted my life in it . To tell the truth , I still feel damn sore that Australia choose to nurture me than my own country.<br><br>The way I see it , I am better off just coming back to Singapore and contribute to its economy by being a tourist in my homeland.<br><br></div></blockquote> no disagreement with you. Don't get me wrong, I never agree that quitters should be labelled on all who migrated. I have many friends who migrated to Canada and australia, we are in contact and knowing their circumstances, they were never quitters, one or two good riddance, many are losses to Singapore.<br><br>I come to this forum to hear and learn something I do not read in the papers or hear in my daily encountering. any info, opinions or comments that went through some brains before posting received much of my attention, regardless of how radical that may be.<br><br>What the real oppositions out there need are some true stories, feelings and analysis about the policies, and more people, especially young ones, coming forward to take a stand.</div>

Therefore don't affect me soo much. But I know of ppl would keep on selling and buying house to get cash. Then now 'hang' because can't sell off their high price housing. <strong>This to me... is called Greed without Planning</strong>. Each and every S'porean are entitle to 2 times buying HDB with lower price. But Many have already used up entitlement during 'Hot price' time..... now too late lor.<br><br>Please plan carefully before buying and selling your HDB..... don't do it just beause the price is good. If u sell high, of course have to buy high. Then if the price drop a few years from now......<br><br>3) Long ago already given out hope on ever getting my CPF in lump sum.
