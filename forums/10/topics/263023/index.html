I don't believe in a top down approach that the government has taken.<br><br>Years ago when I was teenager, Singapore was number 1 in my head , PAP was a good government. Then cracks appear when I started asking an MP questions about foreign talents and what's not , I got asked for my nric in a forum that should be one where people unload their ideas and opinions to inform the rulers of what grassroots wanted to see.<br><br>After I went abroad for my study, Singapore was the safest country but at what price? I see people protesting peacefully because they don't agree with something. Albeit there are often emotions running high and protesters can get carried away but they provide me with a perspective that not everyone thinks the same. And their government is not silencing their right to voice vociferously against the policies unless they are threatening the security of the public.<br><br>I came back to Singapore only to find myself with a degree of disillusion. Scholars paid higher than commoners even though they have the same type of degree as I. Being told by administrators of a large hospital in Singapore that I won't be able to make it anywhere because I don't want to work for them anymore. And then having a friend being told she cannot go for a masters that she had saved money for , and they did not need to pay a cent. But  because she has "no leadership quality" in their eyes, she can't have the year of nopay study leave.<br><br>Working and around my neighbourhood, I see the plight of poor people yet I see our leaders paying themselves highly when the money could be better spent on helping the disadvantaged. Then you have the foreign talents which are really no better than our local talents.<br><br>That did it in for me. There was no way I can stay in a place which only paid lipservice to its citizens about constant upgrading yet did not allow capable people because they fear some sort of takeover on their jobs or something. Opting to take in third class foreigners in favor of well trained Singaporeans . Paying themselves so highly without regulation or input from the people. That is really too much.<br><br>My own government policies did not give me an option to stay on. I came back for 2.5 years of service - wasted years when I should have got out. Then the part about quitting the country - well I think the government should think on the factors that made people quitters rather than to label them.<br><br>Australia choose to adopt me because they lack people with my skills and I am grateful to Australia for that - a mutual benefit. It is not about what my country can do for me but what I can do for my country ....well my country did not do anything for me and I came back and wasted my life in it . To tell the truth , I still feel damn sore that Australia choose to nurture me than my own country.<br><br>The way I see it , I am better off just coming back to Singapore and contribute to its economy by being a tourist in my homeland.<br><br></div>
