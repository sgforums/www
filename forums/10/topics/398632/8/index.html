              <p>"The cheapest way to dry clothes is the current way of drying the clothes on the bamboo poles placed just outside the kitchen.</p>
              <p>The main advantages are that clothes dried under the sunny sun with winds are these clothes smell nice and feel good when the clothes are being worn as compared to clothes dried inside the rooms with winds or fans have an unpleasant smell and the feel is not as good when the clothes are being worn.</p>
              <p>It is noted that the cost of current method of drying clothes is very minimal as compared to the cost of building of a balcony for drying clothes which cost more than $10,000."</p>

              <p>As I said, some cloth cannot be wash with washing machine, fabric such as silk and cotton will get damage.</p>
              <p>The cost of balcony is nothing comparing to the safety of it, many a times see on news someone drop from a high floor while hanging cloth with bamboo poles. So with a balcony, i believe that it not only create safety, good for women and older folks too. And when you are not drying cloth, can use the balcony for suntan or play mahjong.</p>

              <p>Just think lah!</p>
              <p>If you built a balcony for $10,000 only the top floor can dry clothes in the sun and sunbathe there.</p>
              <p>The rest of the balconies will be below and shaded from the sun.</p>
              <p>Also you must impose the death penalty to discourage the top flat owner from instaling a roof over his balcony.</p>
              <p>Therefore the  balcony for drying clothes in HDB flats idea is one idea that  is not better than the PM idea. You fail on this one.</p>
              <p>Even if you make the balcony free and compulsory, people will curse you, for spending  money unnecessarily and not giving people cash instead.</p>
              <p>One room, two room and three room flat dwellers want cash, not balconies.</p>
              <p>Give them cash plus a balcony  free also not good, they want cash and cash, and more cash.</p>

              <p>I was just wondering whether are we taken for a ride by TS. It's a strange and funny thread, but yet the responses have been quite popular so far. Frankly, in Singapore, with or without a balcony, your cloth will get dry up on a hot sunny day.</p>
              <p>I believe that there is a co-payment for building balcony as part of an upgrading project, and as somone mentioned, it also need the resident to vote for it. For the resident part, they can pay by CPF on installment basis. With CPF rules changed, why not go for it, after all, with the new rules, you cannot withdraw CPF completely.</p>

              <p>I was just wondering whether are we taken for a ride by TS. It's a strange and funny thread, but yet the responses have been quite popular so far. Frankly, in Singapore, with or without a balcony, your cloth will get dry up on a hot sunny day.</p>
              <p>I believe that there is a co-payment for building balcony as part of an upgrading project, and as somone mentioned, it also need the resident to vote for it. For the resident part, they can pay by CPF on installment basis. With CPF rules changed, why not go for it, after all, with the new rules, you cannot withdraw CPF completely.</p>
