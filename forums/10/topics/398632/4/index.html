              <p>PRP, to put it simply, you just want to grab fame shamelessly, otherwise why would you make a claim that you believe your ideas are better than that PM has and Dr Goh Keng Swee. On what basis and grounds, qualifications and expertise can you justify your claim.</p>
              <p>Of course, forumers will take you as nuts and  ridicule and make fun on you.</p>
              <p>You put up a balcony idea that is half-past six and when other forumers pointed out the weaknessses of your idea and you just patch it with a modified idea and continue to claim that your idea is the best.</p>
              <p>You are just like a porridge hawker and claims that you cook the best porridge in Singapore and when someone told you the porridge is too salty and the texture is too thick and you just add more water to the porridge and continue <br>to claim you cook the best porridge in Singapore.</p>
              <p>An excellent porridge hawker will not claim he or she cooks the best porridge but he or she will let the customers eat the porridge and for the customers to make the appraisal that they find that the porridge is the best.</p>
              <p>So, PRP, don't claim that your porridge is the best, show us your porridge and we the forumers ie the csutomers will appraise it and if your porridge is really the best, you will definitely get the appraisal that the porridge is the best.</p>

              <p>People living in HDB flats must learn to be considerate, that is the only way.  I also kena before wet and dripping clothes from upstairs, and it's really irritating.</p>
              <p>The government can build balconies, or even create new HDB regulations for hanging clothes, but the root of the problem will not be solved.  Ultimately, learning to be considerate is the only way.</p>
