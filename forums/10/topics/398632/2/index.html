              <p>If I am not wrong, there are implaction if HDB is to built blacony for you just to dry cloth, firstly, it is a cost, are you going to foot the bill? are the residents in your place agree with you to built balcony just for drying cloth?</p>
              <p>Secondly, if it is a share balcony, problem like lost of underwear and clothing will be another issue </p>

              <p><br>in fact, i got a worker here whose HDB flat was upgraded with a balcony, he told me it is a co payment, HDB paid half, he paid half, to build a balcony, and it cost $40,000 per house, so HDB deducted 20k from his CPF or for those not enuf, thru installment, actually he was very reluctant to upgrade, but his blocks residents, after a nice dinner and celebration by the MPs and all those carrying boss RC members, voted to get it upgraded.</p>
              <p>Now he lost 20k in his CPF and yet get a small balcony..even his dog also cannot move about inside this small balcony...and all the residents also regretted, so i hope you understand the implication of asking for this and that from HDB, they will ask you to pay then use cheap material and con you.</p>
