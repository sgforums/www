              <p>Are you not being contradictory?</p>
              <p>You want laws to prevent closing up the balcony, now you say can put up grill.</p>

              <p>not contradictory lah according to PRP.</p>
              <p>When the water problem is raised with his balcony idea, he next patches up his idea and say that there should be a drainage for the water.</p>
              <p>So, when the danger of open balcony problem is raised, he next patches up his idea and say that grill should be put up.</p>
              <p>So, where got problem right, PRP balcony idea is the best, just that his idea has many holes now and he is trying very hard to cover the holes only mah. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>

              <p>You are getting better, you at least admit your ideas have faults, but only a few.</p>

              <p>Won't this be more dangerous, children will climb up the cage like grille because there are no windows. Grille are mostly aluminium and will most likely collapse under the weight of the children. Grille and children then becomes killer litter to those below.</p>

              <p>You say that people don't know how to use the balcony, I say that people always will close up the balcony for extra space and safety. Your proposal to counterr  that is laws.<br> Isn't that a valid comment.</p>
              <p>Devil7030 says that you idea is full of holes, and he is correct as you keep patching up your ideas as this thread goes along.</p>

              <p><br>The comment was made by me and not you. So now  you make use of my own comment to criticise me.I asked u which of your comments was correct?</p>
              <p>When HDB design a balcony and one want to change it to interior space,he need to apply to the authority to make the change.The authority may not approve.</p>

              <p>Implementing the idea for new flats shouldn't be a problem.</p>
              <p>When HDB did main upgrading for old flats, they even built a small room for residents.So building balcony should be affordable and the govt should give much subsidy  because it is to solve a problem of the existing flats.</p>

              <p>Your idea of a balcony for drying clothes  has already been implemented by the HDB, there is this service balcony incorporated into the flat since more than 10 years ago. All new flats have service balcony. Is it your idea?</p>
              <p>What makes you think your idea of another balcony for drying clothes would work.</p>
              <p>You want a balcony built out from a balcony?</p>
              <p>Which will be closed up anyway. Singaporeans are smart enough to get round any laws.</p>
