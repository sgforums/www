            <div class='col-md body'>with regards to the recent news reports on Thailand accusing Singapore<br><br>The current person in-charge of Thailand (right after Prime Minister has being voted off) is the Military Leader<br><br>Ever since the Military Leader of Thailand took over the running of the GOVT, he started to give comments on UNRELIABLE statements with no proof to fall back on.<br><br>The stigma of Singapore Spying on Thailand Issue started with Ex-Prime Minister visiting Singapore on a casual private trip.<br><br>Case Study 1:<br>When the Military Leader knows about this matter, he than remarked that Singapore is Tapping (spying) on Thailand's govt/ political issues since Singapore's Temasek Holdings has just bought over Ex-Prime Minister's share of the Telecommunication Company in Thailand. [claiming that all the records of information shared over the phone is Thailand are being channeled into Singapore.<br><br>Case Study 2:<br>With the visit of Ex-Prime Minister of Thailand coming over to Singapore, Thailand has Immediately Canceled all HIGH LEVEL meetings scheduled with Singapore. Their reason for cancelation of meetings with Singapore govt is due to Ex-Prime Minister revealed Thailand's secrets to Singapore.<br><br>Case Study 3:<br>As the stigma/impression created by the Thailand Govt (Military Leader [in the event of a minister or govt body has lost it's ability to run the country or is voted off, naturally the acting govt person will be the one who has military powers in control) worsen due to increasing Unfriendly Remarks made by Thailand, even normal citizens of Thailand are treating Singapore People/Whatever is related to Singapore as Bad (or something similar)<br><br>There's a direct example - The Asian Cup which is Singapore Competing against Thailand for the Soccer Championship.<br><br>While they are already bias of Singapore, based on the un-founded remarks made by the Military Leader. They then took their frustrations &amp; their own one-sided view of belief which in-directly contributed to the Thailand Soccer Players and Referee not giving a Professionalism as a Sports Player and Referee.<br><br>Example : Singapore Goal Keeper is given a yellow card just for taking slightly longer time in deciding where to kick the ball to.<br><br>Another Example : People sitting at the waiting area (the place where back-up players and their coach sits) just verbally shouted / slightly raise their voices and showed some unhappiness (very normal) when Thailand Referee did something - (this part i missed it so not sure), than the Thail Referee give a person at the waiting area a YELLOW CARD.<br><br>Is that fair?<br><span style="color: darkblue;"><br>Disccussions - Should Military Leaders Take Up the role of Running the Govt/Country when there's a need for some immediate person to take-over<br><br>With a person who's expertises lies in Fighting (- Either Win or Lose thinking when it comes to War.) takes over the Country and the GOVT to run the country. Should the people running the country be taking any tests to Judge if they are the situable candidate to run the country. [should they try to change their thinking and start to think in terms of a Win-Win situation and try to be friendly towards Singapore?]<br></span><br>Ever since The day that marks the Visit of Ex-Prime Minister that sparked the Harsh One-Sided Remark on Singapore, Thailand people in Thailand has being hostile (nearing this level) to almost anything that's related to Singapore.<br><br>What's next from the Military Leaders?<br>More accusations perhaps?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>do we really need businessmen/businesswomen to run the country?<br><br>if it's like what you said, than i don't think i would even want to be in that country if it's being run by business people.<br><br>they only care about profits, and not the welfare of people<br><br>- look at China, during Bird Flu (chicken stain with H5N1 virus) pandemic in the last 2 years of newspapers reports, there are people who would go to the extent of digging out burried pigs that might have the virus in it.<br><br>is it safe to let the country be run by those who really cares only for profits?<br><br>or do we need people to run the country who cares for the welfare of the nation and the people living in that country?<br><br>Looking at Singapore Today, I seriously don't like the way it's being run, no doubt, comparing it to Singapore in the passed, although Singapore was a 3rd world country in the 1960s, but the govt is TRULY a People's GOVT, providing care and support for every single citizen in Singapore.<br><br>But what do we have now in Singapore?<br>The leaders cares only for profits and reputation.<br><br>Singapore is going to be a HUB for nearly everything.<br>From Science Research Hub (Biopolics - i think i have spelt wrongly - kindly correct me, thanks) to Clubbing Hub with Zouk leading the way (featured in Straits Time) and the Sports Sch (+ the govt wanting to attract talents into Singapore) as well as to make Singapore a stop-over place for talents to train in adjusting to Asian Climate to prepare for Beijing 2008.<br><br>Even arts, they also want to be Number 1 when the market Definately 100% isn't ready to be a really Art Nation in Singapore with the Esplanade built some years back, but have yet to bear fruits in making Singapore the Arts Central,although there's some small little results, but that is considered just the stem of the plant, we still don't have the leaves and the flower and the plant to bear fruit for the Arts in Singapore.<br><br>Now the govt only cares about profit and frame, although they are promoting us to be entrepeneurs but the loans and tax for SMEs are still quite high and there's a Straight Rule for SME, we have no flexiblity. Even if we were to use our HBD or our own home be it Semi-D and condo to start a home based business, we also have to pay tax (if i didn't remember wrongly), what on earth is going on?<br><br>We are already paying for our homes, while we own the homes that we bought it, what rights do the govt have over us when we do our own little business if it starts from our home?<br><br>Why the hassle of all those rules?<br>It's our own Home, we have got rights to do anything and everything in our own home (given that we didn't disrupt the neighbours nor inconveince them in anyway possible)<br><br>Military Leaders like Singapore Leaders now only care to Win.<br><br>Looking at Singapore Leaders now, to a certain extent, they are also short-shited already.<br><br>Cutting in corporate tax, they will lose up to 10million in tax, but with the increase bunden on tax payers - of 7% GST [2% increase] they (govt) will earn up to 16million in GST collected; I've heard this from Radio Channel 95.8 this late morning.<br><br>Are we really being taken care of?<br>Are the Military leaders good Govt Leaders?<br><br>I doubt very much so.<br>Everything i said above are based on my own view (subjective).<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Not to mention LG Lim Chuan Poh, Permanent Secretary for Education, soon to be A*Star chairman. Not sure he'll relish to be in that hot seat though. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Generally, though, I think the military, especially the SAF, tends to breed a rather narrow sort of mentality which is not really suitable to the business of government. Generals and admirals tend to lack understanding of the fundamental principles of politics, economics and diplomacy. The PAP should really examine their policy of recruiting ex-military leaders, or at least the way of educating them.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Does anyone expect Lim Chuan Poh to be able to handle the situation at A*star better than outgoing straight-talker Philip Yeo?<br><br>Given the fact that the sparring opponent is a member of the Lee family, who has always gone against her father's wishes? The stinging sensation from her defiance against her father's wishes to go to Pre-U at RI instead of attending college at NJC must still be ringing in LKY's ear.<br><br>Against the likes of heavyweights such as Dr Lee, can Lim Chuan Poh convince the public that the BIO-MED research in upcoming Biopolis will not be a massive splurging of taxpayers' monies and another expensive tuition fee? Philip Yeo may have managed to flaunt his obvious arrogance with impunity against errant bond-breakers, but his responses against Dr Lee have been nothing short of muted, like a barking dog which has been suddenly muzzled.<br><br>In a dog-eat-dog world, where the bigger dog comes out tops, can his final response of 'letting Lim Chuan Poh answer further questions' be a sign of throwing in the towel?<br><br>Under the circumstances, can the former chief of defence force (CDF) possibly stabilize the ship?</div>
