              <p><strong>Written by Our Correspondent</strong></p>
              <p>A Thai expatriate living in Bangkok by the name of John Symons has written an article to Thailand English Daily – “The Nation” expressing his doubts at Singapore’s recent ranking of 3rd by Transparency International.</p>
              <p>The Singapore media labels Singapore as the “3rd least corrupt nation” in the world based on the rankings which was described by Mr Symons as “somewhat surreal.”</p>
              <p>Mr Symons questioned the accuracy of the rankings on the basis that Singapore lacks a free and independent media – a crucial component of an open and incorrupt society:</p>
              <p><em>“One of the main precursors for an open and incorrupt society, as I understand it, is a strong, independent and free press that is not afraid to undertake investigative journalism to expose wrongdoers so that they can be prosecuted and tried in fair and unbiased courts.</em></p>
              <p><em>Singapore’s press, however, is ranked 133 on a world scale of 175 for freedom, languishing beneath such paragons of virtue as Bangladesh, the Central African Republic, Cambodia and Nicaragua.”</em></p>
              <p>Mr Symons also took issue with the latest defamation lawsuit launched by MM Lee and PM Lee against “well known and respected” Far Eastern Economic Review which saw the Singapore court awarding damages in excess of $400,000 to the two leaders.</p>
              <p>He felt that the picture presented by Transparent International on Singapore is incomplete as whistle-blowers against corrupt officials are not protected in Singapore.</p>
              <p><em>“Where those who are the first line of defence in the fight against corruption are bound and gagged and live in constant fear of law suits on a whim, I doubt we are seeing anything that equates to a full and clear picture of the “cleanliness” of Singapore,” </em>he wrote.</p>
              <p>The Singapore government has always insisted on paying its leaders astronomical salaries to curb corruption.</p>
              <p>The Prime Minister of Singapore, Lee Hsien Loong, is paid more than 5 times the annual salary of U.S. President Barack Obama.</p>
              <p>Singapore’s founding father and octagenarian leader MM Lee Kuan Yew boasted unashamedly in the state media lately that he could have earned much more in the private sector.</p>

              <p>A <strong>straw man</strong> is a fallacy in which an irrelevant topic is presented in order to divert attention from the original issue. The basic idea is to "win" an argument by leading attention away from the argument and to another topic.</p>

              <p><br>Mr John Symons has given a true account of the state of affairs in Singapore.</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">There are not many things Singaporeans know about the MIWs except for their greed and their $$$$ faced approach to all things Singapore.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Are the PAP Ministers paying themselves an obscenely, high, over-the-top salary ??</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">The general concensus you get from Singaporeans is a resounding 'yes'.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">... but apparently it's not, according to the MIWs themselves... because despite their already mind-boggling salaries (compared to those in Public service in other equally non-corrupt, 1st world developed countries), they still are entitled to a 'confidential discretionary component' bonus says an inside source.</span></p>

It's so simply due to the fact that there's no rule of law in SIngapore. All depends on the lee wee family. Singapore doesn't belong to its people it belongs to he Lee Kuan Yew family and cronies.
