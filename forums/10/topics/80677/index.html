To me... <strong>CCA is like family commitment... hobbies</strong>... when u'r out in e working world...   It's better to learn to handle them at a lower level now thn to panic or get into family conflicts (e.g. quarrel, complaining spouse isn't understanding/helpful enuff...).. all these link to ur future work handling skills and social problems in one way or another...<br><br>It's wiser to look far and wider... look at a bigger picture.. tht's wat they say... gerrykoh... <strong>my reply isn't negatively against u</strong>... but i hope it'll be useful to u.. u may c how it comes into picture in future..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>p/s some ppl treat CCA as extra-marital affair!!!

Then older Primary got to do Young Scientist projects on zoology, ecology, astronomy etc. during the holidays Bet done by most parents. Sec. sch. every subject also have incl. Social Studies, home econs. I remember my kid has to plan for a party &amp; do the invitation, menu, the food must be healthy, check the calories, look for decoration &amp; cutlery for the table layout. My time we just learn to cook for home econs. Also another time, got to make a kite. Given materials, also must ensure it can fly.

            <div class='col-md body'>As far as I understand it, project work is a mockery of the term. Students perform the motions of doing a project, but everything is confined to the theoretical level. There is research (mostly confined to net surfing), some discussion, writing up a report, do a presentation, but nothing tangible results.<br><br>For example, one group of students can suggest building a home for strays, but they do not actually build one. They just talk about doing it. Of what worth or usefulness is this? You are right if you conclude: absolutely none.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There are too many restrictions  regarding project work. Proposals get rejected because the teachers say certain topics like biotech is too common, cannot do same topic as other students etc. etc. Know of some people who have to rewrite 5-6 times b4 proposal can be accepted. Only when it is approved then u can proceed. U must write thick report, do interviews/ survey, charts/graphs, minutes of meeting, research etc all within a short period. I see the poor students struggling to complete it during their Jun hols &amp; sundays. They cannot get any rest! I suspect the teachers also not well equipped to handle PW. The kids become unethusiastic &amp; frustrated as a result. Why can't the schs. allow them to just do it, why have so many restrictions!</div>

My A-level results not so good so I went to poly after my NS. I feel that the lecturers and tutors in poly are more nuturing and receptive to different ideas from students. They dun go for a model answer. There is also more room for discussion and different answers are accepted as long as you can prove your point. In JC the learning is more of a one way traffic. Situation may be different now. Not sure. Left school for quite a while liao.<br></div>
