              <p><strong>Man found dead at his home computer terminal  <br>Carolyn Quek  <br>Thu, Feb 14, 2008<br>AsiaOne</strong>  <br> <br>A 20-YEAR-OLD unemployed man was found dead slumped over his computer at home on Wednesday afternoon.</p>
              <p>Mr Ong Yi Biao was alone at home that day, and had logged onto his computer at about 11am to play the game, Defence of the Ancients.</p>
              <p>When his 14-year-old sister returned to their Geylang Bahru rental flat at about 4pm, she found him slumped in his chair.<br> <br>On Tuesday night, Mr Ong had fainted in front of the same computer, said his grieving mother. She said she was teaching him how to play mahjong on the Internet when he passed out for about a minute. She did not say if medical attention was sought then.</p>
              <p>Mr Ong's sister on Thursday told reporters at the mortuary that her brother had been playing computer game with eight other players.</p>
              <p>While the game would usually take about an hour to complete, Mr Ong had only played for about 12 minutes, she said.</p>
              <p>Mr Ong's 50-year-old mother said that he was her eldest son and she had bought him the game after he completed his national service last September.</p>
              <p>He was not an avid gamer, his family said, and would not spend more than two hours at a stretch on the computer.</p>
              <p>He had a medical history of asthma but his condition had been stable and he was not on any medication for it.</p>
              <p>His family added that Mr Ong, who dropped out of school at Secondary Three, had planned to to take up a computer course at a private school.<br> </p>

              <p>Anyway, it's probably one rare case ba, like the guy who died of some blood clot in one of the legs after remaining in the same position for prolonged periods of time.</p>
              <p>But I still don't believe that many Singaporeans would be able to live past 80 and enjoy the (mere) payout from the annuity scheme. Most of them would have been lying on hospital beds using up their Medisave funds instead.</p>

              <p>Still, if you flip the obituaries, you see most people dying before the age of 85.</p>

              <p>Erm, true, but there was actually a programmer who died while waiting for his IDE to boot.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Man Dies Waiting for Eclipse to Launch</strong><br><br>A software engineer in San Jose, CA was found dead at his desk yesterday, apparently having died while waiting for his Java editing program, Eclipse, to finish its boot process. Coworkers say the engineer came in that morning vowing to "get Eclipse working on his box or die trying." The last thing anyone heard him say aloud was the cryptic comment: "I see the splash screen is appropriately blue." Nobody knows what he meant. The man was then thought to have fallen asleep, but hours later it was discovered that the engineer had died suddenly of apparent natural causes. The forensics team's investigation that evening was reportedly interrupted unexpectedly when the dead man's Eclipse program suddenly finished launching. The team tried to interact with it to see if they could find clues about the man's death, but the program was unresponsive and the machine ultimately had to be rebooted. At this time, the police commissioner says there is no evidence of foul play, and they currently believe the man simply died of either boredom or frustration.</p>

              <p>I really think people are missing the big picture here.  This is the PAP we are talking about.  They have a proven track record of saying whatever is needed to grease in policies that they abuse later on...  ERP gantries (look how they popped up everywhere.  Still to control traffic?  Really?)...  Look at GST (from we won't increase it, will be removed if times are bad.. yet our CPF contributions have not been restored yet, but GST as already gone up).</p>
              <p>Now this?  They've just put in the groundwork to take as much of our CPF as they want.   From slowing delaying when they return it to us to now not having to even bother about making up retirement ages.  They can now take as much as they want for whatever they want.</p>
              <p>Think the premiums are going to stay at the initial amount?  Think they payouts aren't going to decrease?  Think this is the last scheme they are going to have to suck out our CPF funds?</p>

              <p><strong><strong>CEO found dead in sauna was in pink of health: husband</strong>  </strong></p>
              <p><strong>Jessica Lim and Yen Feng <br>Fri, Feb 15, 2008<br>The Straits Times  <br></strong> <br>GOLFER. Globe-trotter. Avid dancer.</p>
              <p>People who knew Mrs Soo Lee, the woman found dead in the steam room of the Singapore Island Country Club on Tuesday, described her as an adventurous person with a real zest for life.</p>
              <p>She travelled overseas regularly to indulge in one of her favourite pastimes - golf - hitting the links in countries like South Africa and Scotland.</p>
              <p> <br>She was no Sunday golfer either: Mrs Lee was a two-time winner of the Ladies' Gold Medal at the SICC's annual golf tournament.</p>
              <p>Her other passion was dancing. Friends and family told The Straits Times that she often went out dancing with her husband, a retired airline manager.</p>
              <p>Mrs Lee, the chief executive officer of the Singapore Aircargo Agents Association (SAAA) was believed to have gone to the club with two friends early on Tuesday. But while relaxing in the steam room at around 9 am, she lost consciousness.</p>
              <p>The Straits Times understands that her friends tried to rouse her, and called for help when they failed. The club's swimming coach and gym instructor rushed to administer cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and even deployed a defibrillator, but Mrs Lee was pronounced dead at Tan Tock Seng hospital at 10 am.</p>
              <p>On Friday, her husband, Mr Freddie Lee was still reeling from her sudden death.</p>
              <p>At the family home in White House Park after a funeral service at the Choa Chu Kang Christian Cemetery, where Mrs Soo Lee was buried on Friday, Mr Lee said: 'She was in the pink of health - even healthier than I am.'</p>
              <p>The couple has two grown up children, who are in their 30s.</p>
              <p>Doctors and spa operators contacted by ST yesterday said there were no inherent dangers in steam rooms or saunas.</p>
              <p>But they cautioned people who have heart conditions against using them.</p>
              <p>Dr Bernard Ee, a cardiologist in private practice, said: 'In extreme temperatures, blood pressure will fall, and may lead to heart attacks for people with prior heart conditions.'</p>
              <p>'Patients with heart conditions should avoid using steam rooms or saunas.'<br> </p>

              <p>... nnb... lack of official data &amp; yet can claim Singaporeans living longer...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>=====================</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Wealthy 'don't live longer' <br>They may face more health woes: Minister <br> Ansley Ng</strong><br><br> <br>SOME Singaporeans are worried that the poor may not live long enough to receive the monthly payouts under the newly-unveiled CPF Life annuity scheme, fearing that the rich may benefit most because they have better access to healthcare — and thus a longer life span.<br>.<br>Allaying their concerns yesterday, Mr Lim Boon Heng, the Minister-in-Charge of ageing issues, said there is no proof that wealthy people live longer.<br>.<br>"There are many poor people today who have to rely on community support such as old-age homes and they live to a 100-plus. <br>.<br>"Surely, they don't have as much access to money to look after their health or to good food," said Mr Lim, who is also Minister in the Prime Minister's Office.<br>.<br>But wealthy people might face health woes more easily because of the rich foods they consume. "If you talk about heart attacks, I think there is a higher prevalence among those who have the resources and therefore overeat," he added.<br>.<br><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Currently, there is a lack of official data — deaths are tracked in terms of age and gender — to determine if affluent folk live longer.</span><br></strong>.<br>CPF Life, a scheme that provides eligible Central Provident Fund members with a lifelong monthly income from the age of 65 or later if they so choose, will start operating in 2013.<br>.<br>Mr Lim was speaking to reporters yesterday in Punggol South at the launch of the second site of the Wellness Programme, a two-year pilot plan managed by NTUC ElderCare to provide information and services for elderly folk.<br>.<br>Commenting on last Friday's Budget announcement, which was tweaked to help the elderly, Mr Lim said it recognised the role they played in nation building.<br>.<br>"So, the older a person is, the bigger the handout from the state. We also recognise that senior citizens today did not have as much time to accumulate savings in their CPF," he said. "So, it is right that when the Government can afford it, top-ups to their CPF and Medisave accounts would be made."<br>.<br>The Budget will "go a long way to meeting people's concerns about the rising cost of living", he added.<br>.<br>Mr Lim urged Singaporeans to work together to generate economic growth and be more self-reliant, not "burden the state with responsibilities" that will keep growing.<br>.<br>When times are good, Budget surpluses will be handed down to the people, he added.<br>.<br>"When we have a good year, whoever is the Minister for Finance can be like cai shen ye (the God of Fortune) and give out goodies to every family," said the minister. <br>They may face more health woes: Minister <br> </p>

              <p>Anyway, it's probably one rare case ba, like the guy who died of
              some blood clot in one of the legs after remaining in the same
              position for prolonged periods of time.</p>
              <p>But I still don't believe that many Singaporeans would be able
              to live past 80 and enjoy the (mere) payout from the annuity
              scheme. Most of them would have been lying on hospital beds using
              up their Medisave funds instead.</p>

              <p>What is this topic about?</p>
              <p>Are we trying to disprove Govt's assertion that Singaporeans on average live to a certain age? Or what?</p>
              <p>All the evidence is anecdotal.  You want anecdotal evidence I also have.</p>
