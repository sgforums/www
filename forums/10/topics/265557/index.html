PAP dun care about our welfare? Any standards to benchmark against?<br><br>Home &gt; ST Forum &gt; Story June 28, 2007<br>SPORTS AND SUDDEN DEATH- Triathlete should have been given CPR<br>THE death of a healthy, young aspiring triathlete recently is truly sad. Sudden cardiac arrest is the leading cause of death among athletes worldwide. It is a well-documented phenomenon, not a medical mystery.<br>Sudden cardiac arrest risks are unfortunately extremely difficult to screen for, even with ECGs and chest X-rays. Thus medical examination of young, fit athletes is unlikely to identify individuals at risk.<br><br>In responding to the sudden collapse of the triathlete, several issues arose:<br><br>The first responders at the scene described him as having a weak pulse and therefore they did not begin car-diopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). On arrival at hospital, medical professionals described him as having no pulse.<br>A pulse check is known to be a very inaccurate way of ascertaining circulation. CPR training teaches individuals to look for 'signs of life' and this involves checking for breathing and movement. Lack of breathing is indication enough to start CPR. In a state of anxiety and panic, non-medical first responders often feel the bounding pulse in their own fingers and attribute it to the victim.<br><br>In the event of sudden collapse and an absence of medical personnel, the initial response should not have been to bundle the victim into a van and drive to hospital. A call to 995 should have been made immediately. An emergency ambulance staffed by trained paramedics and with a defibrillator would have been dispatched.<br>First responders should have initiated CPR on-site while waiting for the ambulance. When the paramedics arrive, they will deliver life-saving shocks at the scene, if indicated.<br><br>Despite several officials on-site being trained in CPR, errors occurred. The issue here thus becomes that of the competency of these individuals to render medical first response.<br><br>The <strong>lack of an on-site automated defibrillator (AED) and trained personnel to use it was an ill-fated oversight</strong>. To cite budgetary concerns as a reason is truly regrettable.<br>Just having an ambulance at sports events may not be the solution in itself. There are no regulations in Singapore governing the equipping of private/standby ambulances. Sadly, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>[u]only one in 10 of non-SCDF ambulances has life-saving AEDs on board</strong></span>[/u].<br><br>In summary, <strong>sports governing bodies must re-examine guidelines on the provision of event medical coverage. Personnel equipped, trained and competent in emergency medical first response must be present</strong>.<br><br>Only then can we say this life lost was not in vain.<br><br>Dr Charles Johnson<br>Emergency Physician<br><br><a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/ST%2BForum/Story/STIStory_133568.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.straitstimes.com/ST%2BForum/Story/STIStory_133568.html</a><br>----------------------------------------<br>Home &gt; ST Forum &gt; Online Story<br>June 30, 2007<br>Reckless behaviour by a non-emergency ambulance driver<br>I WAS driving along Yishun Ave 2 towards Yishun from Sembawang before the junction of Yishun Ave 7 at 4.50pm on June 28 when a non-emergency ambulance from Civic, with number plate SGC4580S, drove recklessly behind me.<br>The ambulance was switching between lanes in a two-carriage lane behind me. I did not switch lanes as I was not sure what the driver's intentions were as his moves were too dangerous.<br><br>The ambulance then tailgated me for a while before switching lanes. He then <strong>cut into my lane without signalling</strong>, leaving me with no ample time to react.<br><br>The ambulance was so near me I had to brake very hard to prevent <strong>a collision</strong>. The car behind me, too, braked very hard and almost hit my rear.<br><br>The ambulance then proceeded to <strong>beat a red traffic light.</strong><br><br>It was a miracle that no accidents happened due to this senseless driving by an inconsiderate driver who had no regard and respect for both the law and other motorists.<br><br>I then called the Civic helpline and a woman replied that as ambulance drivers attend to emergency calls, they have a right to speed.<br><br>Firstly, Civic is a non-emergency ambulance, emergency cases are attended to by SCDF ambulance, the only non-emergency ambulance capable of handling an emergency is Hope Ambulance as its personnel are AED- and ACLS-trained.<br><br>Secondly, even if it is an emergency, it does not warrant the driver to drive at <strong>140kmh.</strong> How do I know the speed? I chased the driver to demand an explanation and apology for his reckless ways and, to my shock, I was driving at 100kmh and the ambulance was gaining speed all the way.<br><br>How can someone put the lives of a patient and his relatives at risk by driving at such a speed on a road with a speed limit of 60kmh. And the audacity to switch lanes with no regard to the safety of other motorists.<br><br>I have seen other non-emergency ambulances on the roads before and the drivers do not behave in this manner.<br><br>A prompt reply was received from Civic's supervisor, a Mr Francis. He apologised for the driver's reckless behaviour and promised that he will look into the matter.<br><br>Even though I do not condone this type of road behaviour, I must commend the prompt reply and understanding from Mr Francis.<br><br>Derrick Chew Kiang Ngee<br><br><a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/ST%2BForum/Online%2BStory/STIStory_134201.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.straitstimes.com/ST%2BForum/Online%2BStory/STIStory_134201.html</a></div>
