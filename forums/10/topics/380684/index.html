              <div id="post_message_336646"><a href="http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20091103a6.html">http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-b...0091103a6.html</a><br> <br> <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Lee contrasts his party with stagnant LDP</strong></span><br> <br> <img src="http://english.people.com.cn/200605/08/images/0507_A13.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br> <br> SINGAPORE (Kyodo) <span style="color: red;"><strong>Singapore Prime Minister
              Lee Hsien Loong has cited the failure of the Liberal Democratic Party
              to renew itself as a grim reminder of the need for his People's Action
              Party, which has ruled the wealthy city-state for decades, to avoid the
              same downhill path.</strong></span><br> <br> "It is not easy for a party in power to celebrate 50 years in
              government. You look at the parties in Asia — several of them have been
              in power for a considerable time, but all of them are soul-searching,
              thinking (about) what must they change, how must they adapt to the
              future," Lee said at the party's convention Sunday, the
              English-language Straits Times newspaper reported Monday.<br> <br> Lee is secretary general of the PAP, which has been in power since 1959.<br> <br> His speech to about 1,000 party cadres mentioned the recent troubles
              faced by Japan's LDP and Malaysia's ruling Barisan National coalition.<br> <br> <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>He said the PAP's commitment to
              self-renewal has been a key factor preventing it from decaying or
              stagnating, and allowing it to stay relevant and in power for so long.</strong></span><br> <br> "For the LDP, things began to take a turn for the worse in the 1990s when the Japanese economic bubble burst. <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>The
              electorate started to blame every bad thing that happened — from
              unemployment to the loss of its self-confidence — on the party," </strong></span>he said.<br> <br> "This August, it lost at the polls. It had ruled Japan for almost 55
              years, save for a break in 1993. But it isn't just that the economy
              went up and went down. It's more than that. The LDP didn't renew
              themselves," he said.<br> <br> Lee said the Japanese system that allowed legislators' children to
              practically inherit Diet seats from their parents and the long waiting
              time period before legislators could become ministers made it hard for
              the LDP to retain and attract talent.<br> <br> "Now the LDP has lost power but is still finding it difficult to break
              the old mold," he said, adding that the party needs to "take time to
              reorganize itself and find new ways to appeal to voters."<br> <br> Lee said his own party has identified some younger candidates in their
              30s and 40s to join his party's slate for the next general election,
              which is due by February 2012.<br> <br> The PAP has dominated Singapore's legislature since independence after
              separation with Malaysia in 1965. It won 82 out of 84 parliamentary
              seats in the 2006 general elections, or 67 percent of the votes cast.<br> <br> Lee's father, Singapore's first prime minister, Lee Kuan Yew, ruled the city-state with an iron fist for about three decades.</div>

              <p>Firstly, do you ever read the posts before giving your two cents worth of frivoluos opinion that address the issues at a tangent ?</p>
              <p>Was my last reponse referring only to "panaceas" as a cure for all the problems about the country - or was it referring to PM LHL's claim that it is alright to "<em>changing the water without changing the medicine</em>" ?</p>
              <p>What relevance is there with your points about "<em>buying properties, shopping and happily staying at home posting</em>" being related to "<em>pain</em>" - or even as a response to what was in my last post ?</p>
              <p>Obviously, with your continued frivolous attitude you have not kept to date with the facts that Singapore was in deep recession before Malaysia and Indonesia, and that even as they managed to hang on - we are still bleeding with more retrenchments to come by end-2009 and into Year 2010.</p>
              <p>What has "<em>independence</em>" got to do in not comparing the economy of Hong Kong as a city with that of Singapore as a city ? </p>
              <p>Is that how a Taiwanese 'hum' form its opinion by being a 'street-walker' in the back lanes - by "talking to a few old hkees" in the back streets of Hong Kong ?</p>
              <p>The homes in Hong Kong are built by Private Capital on land that are purchased at Hong Kong market prices, compared to Singapore's HDB flats that are build on land that are "snatched" from private ownership with compensation that are far below the prevailing market prices, built with cheap loans from our CPF, and making 148 per cent profit in the sales prices sold to Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>The intelligence of as a 'hum' is certainly remarkable in not being honest even with its brains that lay dead as it froth uselessly even as it breathes.</p>

              <p>Is this the philosophy of a Taiwanese 'hum' - which is no better then its characteristic frivolous 'la la la' attitude ?</p>
              <p>Which part of "<em>the earlier years in Singapore</em>" can a Taiwanese 'hum' be familiar with that it intend to refer to in this effort to teach Singaporean old men ?</p>
              <p>Can the Taiwanese 'hum' be knowledgeable enough to appreciate that "<em>in the early years in Singapore, even as a lay worker, you can retire in your golden years with childrens and grandchildrens</em>" ?</p>
              <p>What can the Taiwanese 'hum' mean by "<em>lay workers</em>" - who are these "<em>lay workers</em>" ?</p>
              <p>Surely not as a "<em>lay worker</em>" like the Taiwanese 'hum' strutting its stuff at the bar ?</p>
              <p>Why did the Taiwanese 'hum' so brilliantly <strong>jumped </strong>from the 'early years in Singapore' to the present day and age when the TODAY's 'lay workers' have "<em>no childrens and grandchildrens</em>" ?</p>
              <p>Was it due entirely to the fault of TODAY's "<em>lay workers</em>" for not seeding, or was it due entirely to PAPa's penalties imposed through the early years to control the population, and forcing Singaporeans to abandon the "<em>life in the early years</em>" to work under the plans created by PAPa's ambitions ?</p>
              <p>What happened to the "<em>ample opportunities</em>" that the "<em>lay workers</em>" had "<em>in the early years</em>" - and which evaporated after PAPa came into Singapore's political scene ?</p>
              <p>Only the brilliance of a Taiwanese 'hum' can know about spreading "<em>seeds</em>" - as its expertise is with walking the back streets of Hong Kong and working in Singapore Bars.</p>
              <p>Does that qualify the Taiwanese 'hum' to teach anyone - its kind of civil thinking in this Speaker's Corner ?</p>

              <p>Fecal matter? All the good of nutrients already absorbed, and what remains are just waste material? Perhaps only 3rd world societies would value turds, as a heat source.</p>
              <p>The Turd should do well for 3rd world nations then, and serve as a fuel source, being all fiery as evidently seen, but not a concern to anyone, for all that burns, is but a piece of shit.</p>
              <p>As for creating awareness, what can a piece of turd offer? Nothing more than she is just a piece of contemptible twisting coils of foul smelling odourous thing called 'sai' in crude hokkien. And the accompanied hokkien term for attitudes of self admitted shitty person she claimed she is is Kar na sai.</p>
              <p>Which explains her regular style and daily tirade to others i suppose.</p>

              <p>Firstly, do you ever read the posts before giving your two cents worth of frivoluos opinion that address the issues at a tangent ?</p>
              <p>Was my last reponse referring only to "panaceas" as a cure for all the problems about the country - or was it referring to PM LHL's claim that it is alright to "<em>changing the water without changing the medicine</em>" ?</p>
              <p>What relevance is there with your points about "<em>buying properties, shopping and happily staying at home posting</em>" being related to "<em>pain</em>" - or even as a response to what was in my last post ?</p>
              <p>Obviously, with your continued frivolous attitude you have not kept to date with the facts that Singapore was in deep recession before Malaysia and Indonesia, and that even as they managed to hang on - we are still bleeding with more retrenchments to come by end-2009 and into Year 2010.</p>
              <p>What has "<em>independence</em>" got to do in not comparing the economy of Hong Kong as a city with that of Singapore as a city ? </p>
              <p>Is that how a Taiwanese 'hum' form its opinion by being a 'street-walker' in the back lanes - by "talking to a few old hkees" in the back streets of Hong Kong ?</p>
              <p>The homes in Hong Kong are built by Private Capital on land that are purchased at Hong Kong market prices, compared to Singapore's HDB flats that are build on land that are "snatched" from private ownership with compensation that are far below the prevailing market prices, built with cheap loans from our CPF, and making 148 per cent profit in the sales prices sold to Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>The intelligence of as a 'hum' is certainly remarkable in not being honest even with its brains that lay dead as it froth uselessly even as it breathes.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Is this the philosophy of a Taiwanese 'hum' - which is no better then its characteristic frivolous 'la la la' attitude ?</p>
              <p>Which part of "<em>the earlier years in Singapore</em>" can a Taiwanese 'hum' be familiar with that it intend to refer to in this effort to teach Singaporean old men ?</p>
              <p>Can the Taiwanese 'hum' be knowledgeable enough to appreciate that "<em>in the early years in Singapore, even as a lay worker, you can retire in your golden years with childrens and grandchildrens</em>" ?</p>
              <p>What can the Taiwanese 'hum' mean by "<em>lay workers</em>" - who are these "<em>lay workers</em>" ?</p>
              <p>Surely not as a "<em>lay worker</em>" like the Taiwanese 'hum' strutting its stuff at the bar ?</p>
              <p>Why did the Taiwanese 'hum' so brilliantly <strong>jumped</strong> from the 'early years in Singapore' to the present day and age when the TODAY's 'lay workers' have "<em>no childrens and grandchildrens</em>" ?</p>
              <p>Was it due entirely to the fault of TODAY's "<em>lay workers</em>" for not seeding, or was it due entirely to PAPa's penalties imposed through the early years to control the population, and forcing Singaporeans to abandon the "<em>life in the early years</em>" to work under the plans created by PAPa's ambitions ?</p>
              <p>What happened to the "<em>ample opportunities</em>" that the "<em>lay workers</em>" had "<em>in the early years</em>" - and which evaporated after PAPa came into Singapore's political scene ?</p>
              <p>Only the brilliance of a Taiwanese 'hum' can know about spreading "<em>seeds</em>" - as its expertise is with walking the back streets of Hong Kong and working in Singapore Bars.</p>
              <p>Does that qualify the Taiwanese 'hum' to teach anyone - its kind of civil thinking in this Speaker's Corner ?</p>

But if one wish to keep grumbling and laze at coffee shops, parks and benches, you simply cannot expect 3 hot meals to be serve on your table. Being poor with bones is ok, at least you know u did not perform well during your younger days, it is still not late to upgrade and make a living. But being poor and yet keep blaming on the enviroment and the govt without self reflection of one poor performances, is totally absurd to the society that support merit and good peformers. Therefore Singapore's poor can come in two categories, one maybe due to the enviroment, the other being a poor performer. By factoring environement, which is beyong one control, fair enuf, but if you are poor because of poor performing, you have to be gracious enuf to look at your situation before blaming others</p>

              <p>Can anyone expect a 'hum' to understand any logic when it is accustomed to a fivolous life of frothing even as it breathes without any effort to be useful in any ways ?</p>
              <p>It proves again my point that you do not read anybody's reponse and will simply jump into any thread with your 'la la la' attitude to make any impetulant comments simply to spam the thread into irrelevancy.</p>
              <p>As a Taiwanese 'hum' - how qualified are you to even begin to understand the social problems faced by the lower income group in Singapore ?</p>
              <p>Does it take a genius to state the obvious that "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">if you do well in your young days, you will get your reward</span></em>" ?</p>
              <p>Are you so certain that preparation in your younger days alone provide the foundation for the rest of your life - irregardless of the political, economic and social situation that shakes up your entire world ?</p>
              <p>It is easy to generalise and pass judgmental comments with one broad stroke - do you seriously believe that those who are now "down and out" remain responsible for their own present circumstances ?</p>
              <p>What is the basis for making such generalise derogatory assumptions ?</p>
              <p>What is the basis in your categorization of Singapore's poor which you claimed can be attributed to either the "<span style="color: #0000ff;">environment</span>" or to the fact that they are "<span style="color: #0000ff;">poor performer</span>" ?</p>
              <p>Can the poor be so neatly compartmentalize - even with your ill informed generosity to have the "environment" to be beyond the control of the poor ?</p>
              <p>Are you certain that the "<span style="color: #0000ff;">environment</span>" itself has not contributed to the poor becoming a "<span style="color: #0000ff;">poor performer</span>" - in a perpetual vicious cycle of poverty causing deeper poverty ?</p>
              <p>It is easy to blame the private individual when the evidence is that the Singapore Government has not done much to improve the lives of the poor nor the poorest in the community of the poor.</p>
              <p>It is easy to blame those who have not known anything except poverty from birth, and do not know anything more then what is life beyond their poverty.</p>
              <p>What has the Government done that is realistic to help the poor, who will grab any life line that can be thrown out to them ?</p>
              <p>The Singapore Government may have provided some programs to help the poor, but most of the help given are conditional, and with the poor at times not even able to fulfill the minimum condition before such help can be given.</p>
              <p>Even when help is offered - most of the poor do not even know the existence of such programs when their poverty give them no access to any information.</p>
              <p>Many poor in Singapore - as well as those who are "not so poor" nor "well-to-do" - have preferred to depend on themselves to the best of their own abilities as many know the declared position of the Singapore Government.</p>
              <p>Even if there are government programmes that are laid out to supposedly help to give "new skills" to jobless Singaporeans, are some of these "new skills" realistic and give relevant skills to the jobless Singaporeans - or even to the poor ?</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Can anyone expect a 'hum' to understand any logic when it is accustomed to a fivolous life of frothing even as it breathes without any effort to be useful in any ways ?</p>
              <p>It proves again my point that you do not read anybody's reponse and will simply jump into any thread with your 'la la la' attitude to make any impetulant comments simply to spam the thread into irrelevancy.</p>
              <p>As a Taiwanese 'hum' - how qualified are you to even begin to understand the social problems faced by the lower income group in Singapore ?</p>
              <p>Does it take a genius to state the obvious that "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">if you do well in your young days, you will get your reward</span></em>" ?</p>
              <p>Are you so certain that preparation in your younger days alone provide the foundation for the rest of your life - irregardless of the political, economic and social situation that shakes up your entire world ?</p>
              <p>It is easy to generalise and pass judgmental comments with one broad stroke - do you seriously believe that those who are now "down and out" remain responsible for their own present circumstances ?</p>
              <p>What is the basis for making such generalise derogatory assumptions ?</p>
              <p>What is the basis in your categorization of Singapore's poor which you claimed can be attributed to either the "<span style="color: #0000ff;">environment</span>" or to the fact that they are "<span style="color: #0000ff;">poor performer</span>" ?</p>
              <p>Can the poor be so neatly compartmentalize - even with your ill informed generosity to have the "environment" to be beyond the control of the poor ?</p>
              <p>Are you certain that the "<span style="color: #0000ff;">environment</span>" itself has not contributed to the poor becoming a "<span style="color: #0000ff;">poor performer</span>" - in a perpetual vicious cycle of poverty causing deeper poverty ?</p>
              <p>It is easy to blame the private individual when the evidence is that the Singapore Government has not done much to improve the lives of the poor nor the poorest in the community of the poor.</p>
              <p>It is easy to blame those who have not known anything except poverty from birth, and do not know anything more then what is life beyond their poverty.</p>
              <p>What has the Government done that is realistic to help the poor, who will grab any life line that can be thrown out to them ?</p>
              <p>The Singapore Government may have provided some programs to help the poor, but most of the help given are conditional, and with the poor at times not even able to fulfill the minimum condition before such help can be given.</p>
              <p>Even when help is offered - most of the poor do not even know the existence of such programs when their poverty give them no access to any information.</p>
              <p>Many poor in Singapore - as well as those who are "not so poor" nor "well-to-do" - have preferred to depend on themselves to the best of their own abilities as many know the declared position of the Singapore Government.</p>
              <p>Even if there are government programmes that are laid out to supposedly help to give "new skills" to jobless Singaporeans, are some of these "new skills" realistic and give relevant skills to the jobless Singaporeans - or even to the poor ?</p>
              <p>Some programs demand basic education or some basic skills; other programs simply require the jobless to change their entire career plans - such as an executive in a Financial Institution retrenched at an age of late 40s being retrained to be a staff in the hotel housekeeping department taking care of guest rooms.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p><br>Uncle, seems like you like to complicate things when actually it is very simple, wall of texts but not meaning in it, be simple ya.</p>
              <p>You have to agree with me that even our poor are having a better life than other countries, it is not that I did not travel around to see for myself, you also have to agree with me that in every country, there must be poor and rich, between the middle class, in most of the other countries, if you are poor, you become poorers, and hardly you get chance to be rich unless some miracle happens, but in Singapore, it is different, as long as you have the will, smart and merited, even if you are a youtiao seller's son, you can make it big, most of our rich here, are from poor, not the middle class alone. LKY had put it rightly when he said, if you got the ability, the shrew in business, the power to challenge, the will to learn and be educated, we want you, because we believe you can make it big...poor or rich is not a issue in Singapore which is base meritocracy. Our poors are definitely more fortunate than others, there get extensive helps and alway a roof on top of them,</p>
              <p>What i am trying to address here is that we can help the poor, but the poor must help themselves out of the ring, dun alway believe that you will get poorer or that govt make you poor, that is obviously lazyiness and lame excuses. A poor have to ask himself/herself, what have i done and what should i do next to stay up, or what should i do to help my next generation to be rich...and the legend continue. NO one, especially the our ancestor of Chinese and Indian came to Singapore in the early years as a rich man, all came with nothing, and it is only those who had a good foresight, a goal in life and hardworking to work toward it, bring about a rich decendents.</p>

              <p>Again, you have jumped into a thread without even understanding a single word of what this thread is all about - and what has been stated in my post.</p>
              <p>To reply to your deliberate effort to trivialise the thread with your irrelevant issues that you insist on debating will simply achieve your objective to derail every thread with your kind of flippant unthinking attitude.</p>
              <p>Read again the title of this thread, and what has been posted before you jump into this thread with your characteristic idiocy.</p>
              <p>It is imbecilic thinking to believe that Singapore's poor is better off then the poor in other countries. Period.</p>
