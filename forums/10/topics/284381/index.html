            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Inside France's Secret War</strong><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">For 40 years, the French government has been fighting a secret war in Africa, hidden not only from its people, but from the world. It has led the French to slaughter democrats, install dictator after dictator Â– and to fund and fuel the most vicious genocide since the Nazis. Today, this war is so violent that thousands are fleeing across the border from the Central African Republic into Darfur Â– seeking sanctuary in the world's most notorious killing fields.</span><br><br>By Johann Hari in Birao, Central African Republic<br><br>...But I couldn't find anyone in the CAR Â– not a single person, not even the most pro-French Â– who thought Sudan had anything to do with the rebels. So I arrange to meet up in Bangui with Louise Roland-Gosselin, an Anglo-French director of the group Waging Peace, who has been studying the Central African Republic.<br><br>"The policies here in the CAR are part of a much bigger approach by France towards Africa," she says. "We call this system 'Franceafrique', and it was set up by Charles de Gaulle to replace the former colonial system. There is clear continuity from the imperial system to the present day."<br><br>The motives for this war are, Roland-Gosselin says, drenched in dollars and euros and uranium.<br><br>"The overarching goal is to take African resources and funnel them towards French corporations," she says. "The CAR itself is a base from which the French can access resources all over Africa. That is why it is so important.<br><br>They use it to keep the oil flowing to French companies in Chad, the resources flowing from Congo, and so on. And of course, the country itself has valuable resources. CAR has a lot of uranium, which the French badly need because they are so dependent on nuclear power. At the moment they get their uranium from Niger, but the CAR is their back-up plan." So this is, in part, a war for nuclear power? " Yes, but also a lot of this money has been funnelled, through corruption, straight back into the French political process. Say somebody needs a road built here in the CAR. The French government will insist on a French company Â– and the French company back home donates a lot to the 'right' French political party."<br><br>This neo-imperial war reached its psychotic apogee in 1994, when the French government used the CAR as a base to fund and fuel the Rwandan genocide, the most bloody since the death of Adolf Hitler.<br><br>Vincent Mounie is a leading figure in Sur Vie, a French organisation monitoring its government's actions in Africa. He explains: "The French were totally complicit in the genocide. There were French troops there before, during and after the genocide, backing the most extreme Hutu forces as they murdered the Tutsis. You know the identity cards that divided the Rwandan population into Hutus and Tutsis in preparation for the slaughter? They were printed in Paris."...<br><br><a href="http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article18516.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article18516.htm</a><br><br>See also:<br><strong>Imperialist France Destroys an African Air Force</strong><br><a href="http://www.counterpunch.org/leupp11132004.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.counterpunch.org/leupp11132004.html</a><br><br><strong>France History in Africa</strong><br><a href="http://www.africaresource.com/content/view/418/68/" rel="nofollow">http://www.africaresource.com/content/view/418/68/</a></div>
