              <p>Well Singapore isn't exactly like Germany or London.  When i walk out in the street I still see Singaporeans about, not hordes of tea-towel wearing Middle Easterners.  You can tell that Singaporeans are still the majority and you don't have gettoes.</p>
              <p>We dont have fanatics here or rude people, and I think our immigration laws and PR laws are getting tighter, and if you are an immigrant and u screw up, you're out and they'll replace you easily.  So i think we have it under control FOR NOW....  So i think the current fear is not warranted.</p>
              <p>Although I will say this, yesterday I went to Bugis to get some research and i stopped at the MAccers to get sausage mcmuffin, a whole bunch of school girls came in (in some uniform... you know like what uniforms look like in local school) and they all were from China... like 10 of them ha ha.  So that was the only time i felt the immigration thing that you guys are talking about.</p>

              <p>I support CSJ,but his view about Singapore government impose racism on Malays n Muslim i cannot accept.As a matter of fact,i find that Muslim are hard to merge into our society n that Western countries also have similar problem is very true.Not only Western countries,an article i read on the newspaper saying Muslim tend to form their "own community" in United States also.</p>
              <p>Thing is,my job last time have access to various secondary n primary schools,n Indians n Chinese students mostly speak English n some in their own language among themselves.But Malay students are different,they "definitely" speak Malay within their group n knid of ignore other ppl.</p>
              <p>And also,i have seen Chinese n Indians convert their religion from Buddism or Hindu to Christinity or Catholic,or become free thinker.But during my almost 40 yrs of life,i have never seen a single Malay families(especially male),convert to other religion or become free thinker.</p>
              <p>Another thing is Malays seem to have friends everywhere.I remember 1 time when i was queue for bus in a bus stop,i met 2 group of Malays.Obviously,these 2 grp of Malays dont know each other,coz they didnt greet to each other initially.Later,out of the blue,they greet each other like very close friends.I was like WTF,i have never seen Chinese,Indians or Caucasians do these kind of thing.</p>
              <p>Lastly,if our country is racist,look at how Malaysia n Indonesia behave towards us n other races in their own countries.And if u tell me that Malaysia didnt support the Muslim terrorists in Southern Thailand n Philipphines,stiring up the bloodshed in these countries,i dont believe it.</p>
              <p>P.S I am not against Muslim,everyone got the rights to believe in different religions.If i offended anyone,sorry about that.But,this is how i feel when i work or interact with them.</p>

              <p style="margin-top: 13px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">In his ground-breaking new book, Mark Curtis reveals the secret history of British collusion with radical Islamic and terrorist groups. It shows how Labour and Conservative governments have connived with militant groups linked to al-Qaida to control oil resources, overthrow governments and promote Britain’s financial interests. The current terrorist threat to Britain is partly ‘blowback’.</span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 13px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px;">The story of how Britain has helped to nurture the rise of global terrorism has never been told. <em>Secret Affairs</em> reveals how Britain has covertly supported radical Islamic groups in Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, Libya, the Balkans, Syria, Indonesia and Egypt. Drawing on declassified government files, it documents Britain’s hidden strategic alliance with the two major state sponsors of radical Islam – Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. And it shows how British policies of ‘divide of rule’ – rooted in the Empire – have used Islamic forces to promote imperial interests in India, Palestine, Jordan and Yemen. Similar British policies continue today in the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 13px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px;">Mark Curtis shows how British collusion with radical Islam is intimately related to its postwar imperial decline. Expedient and pragmatic, and lacking any moral compass, policy-makers have aimed to counter popular, nationalist forces in a desperate attempt to uphold their power in a changing world.</p>

              <p><br>First of all, you have to get it right, Malay is a race, Muslim is a religion, so when you want to talk about Malay, you are talking about a race, if you talk about Muslim, you are talking about the whole islam religion.</p>
              <p>It is not wrong for races to form their own group, as homo sapien, just as animal instinct, we are group gathering creature, even different species of bear stay with each other. So, this is natural, what is so wrong with some races making brotherhood and sisterhood with each other, let them be, as long as they do not disturb us, and we do not disturb them, that is both respect each other spaces and cultures, live in harmony, let it be, if can interact, then interact, if not, just live you way and stay happy, let them be, they are a happy race that call for unity, can take the stress of life, sincere to their religion, never complain much about govt or chinese coming here taking over them, let them be, think of it, Malays are easy going people.</p>

              <p>Ha.  Caucasians and SIngaporeans do that as well- meeting people similar to yourself and striking up a conversation, you have no idea.  I have met far more Muslims in Malaysia and Singapore that frankly do not care about the religion, but people from the Middle-east are much more stringent.  <br><br>Also, most of the so called Muslims in the EU do not come from Southeast Asia, but the M. East.</p>
              <p>But i do believe that if we had Malays in Europe, there would be less problems because the Islam we encounter here in Southeast Asia is far more benign than in the Middle East.  You would never have radical mosques in Singapore as you do in London (since we love free speech and stuff like that).  Plus there is the language problem, we speak far better english here and it would be easy to integrate.  I am merely saying that</p>

              <p>And also,i have heard that,(forgive me if it wasnt true),that if a family member want to convert to other religion,the parents will threaten to "disown" them?Huh?</p>
              <p>I have a relative who work as lawyer in Malaysia,thing is,he has no customers unless he convert to Muslim,which he did.And as we know,in Malaysia,u want to become Muslim is very easy,but if u want to leave it,its very difficult n u have to attend religious court?Huh?</p>
