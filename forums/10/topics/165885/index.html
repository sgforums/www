            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Sorry, you are over-qualified ...<br><br>He upgraded his skills with 2 post-graduate diplomas but a decent job is still a dream<br><br>Weekend ?November 26, 2005</strong><br><br>Lifelong learning and skills upgrading have been touted as the way to stay ahead in today's rat race. Most would assume that so long as you make that effort to remain relevant, a decent job is usually not far away.<br><br>True? Not quite, as far as Clement Chan, 38, is concerned.<br><br>He's learned the hard way that taking the initiative to upgrade far from guarantees him continued employment.<br><br>In fact, he's been out of a job since July, having been turned down by scores of companies.<br><br>The reason given by most of them: You're over-qualified.<br><br>Mr Chan graduated with an economics degree from the National University of Singapore in 1993. Since then, he's used his own money to take up two post-graduate diplomas in IT at the Institute of Systems Science.<br><br>Thinking he had a distinct advantage over those who only possessed a degree or less, Mr Chan soon realised just how wrong he was. His numerous attempts to find work in his preferred lines of banking and IT have been fruitless.<br><br>"One local bank rejected my application because I was considered over-qualified. This despite the fact I was willing to lower my expectations in both pay and job scope," he told Today.<br><br>His case is not an isolated one. Earlier this month, a reader wrote in with a similar plight, having spent $15,000 on a course but is still jobless a year after graduation.<br><br>Mr Chan, a father of three, has even paid a visit to his MP, Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio GRC), who linked him up with bodies such as the Singapore Workforce Development Agency, but to no avail.<br><br>"Most of the jobs don't fit my profile as the companies are recruiting non-graduates. I've also approached the job placement firms, but nothing so far," he lamented.<br><br>It's a fall from grace for Mr Chan, who just five years ago was earning $5,000 a month as an assistant vice-president at a major bank, only for him to step down due to a change in management.<br><br>Since then, he's been in and out of numerous contract jobs, many of which did not recognise his post-graduate qualifications.<br><br>He counts himself fortunate that his wife is able to support herself as she holds a relatively high-paying job with a local university. Now living off his dwindling savings, he hopes to find work by the end of this year. Early last year, the couple made the decision to downgrade from an executive apartment to a five-room flat.<br><br>Everyday, he sends out "at least three or four" applications. He estimates that since July, he's expressed interest in over 100 positions ?including those as a librarian, cash management executive, systems analyst and business analyst.<br><br>One factor could be the nature of the saturated IT field he's looking to join, a possibility Mr Chan does not dismiss.<br><br>The bottom line: Be savvy in what sort of profession you pick, as well as the type of course you take up.<br><br>"Sure, in IT the demand is much more than the supply. So many people are coming from China and India to take these jobs. Because of this globalised market, you are competing with so many others who have the same skills as you."<br><br>Which is why Mr Chan is now prepared to lower his expectations.<br><br>"I'm willing to take up temporary and contract positions, but to date I have no success. I don't mind earning $1,200, but many employers don't want to give even that chance to me," he said.<br><br>AS TOLD TO LEE U-WEN<br><a href="http://www.todayonline.com/articles/86695print.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.todayonline.com/articles/86695print.asp</a></div>
