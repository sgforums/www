              <h1>Efficient civil service is the result of the hard work of pioneers and not the present PAP leaders</h1>
              <p><strong>By Eugene Yeo</strong></p>
              <p>The PAP and its minions have always defended their bloated salaries
                  on the pretext that they have kept our civil service largely efficient
                  and corruption-free.</p>
              <p>Nothing can be further from the truth.</p>
              <p>While I have no complaints about our civil service - in spite of the
                  occasional lapses, they do get things done at times; the present PAP
                  team cannot take credit for the work of its predecessors.</p>
              <p>Did the British bequeath us a corrupted and inefficient civil
                  service after they left ? Did the PAP government build the entire civil
                  service from scratch ?</p>
              <p>Unlike some other Third World countries who were oppressed and
                  exploited by their colonial masters, the British did their part in
                  preparing Singapore for eventual self-government by passing on their
                  expertise and experience in governance to us.</p>
              <p>We inherited the British Westminister Parliamentary system, their
                  judiciary, and education system. All the PAP did is simply to build on
                  what was already there when they took over the reins of government.</p>
              <p>When Hong Kong was passed over to Communist China in 1997, its civil
                  service did not collapse overnight and even after some alterations were
                  made by the Chinese authorities to the administrative structure, it
                  still functions well to this day.</p>
              <p>This shows that as long there is a core system put in place, it
                  matters little whoever runs the civil service unless it is dismantled
                  entirely like in Myanmar. Most mundane administrative tasks can
                  essentially run on auto-pilot mode unless there is interference from
                  the authorities above.</p>
              <p>After Singapore gained independence in 1965, it was the Old Guards
                  of the PAP who transformed Singapore into an Asian economic powerhouse
                  and they were not paid such extravagant salaries in those days.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The present PAP leaders are downright shameless to claim undeserved
                  credit for themselves to justify their high salaries where all they did
                  is to simply to assume ownership of the civil service.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Why should we be paying them for the contributions of past leaders ?
                  Going by their reasoning, we might as well pay a yearly “honorarium” to
                  the United Kingdom for leaving us their administrative system !</p>
              <p>The civil service is run by many hardworking, honest and
                  down-to-earth ordinary Singaporeans who are paid pittance for their
                  work. It is these junior officers on the ground who deserve a pay rise
                  and not the upper echelons of the service. Despite their relatively low
                  pay, is there pervasive corruption in the ranks and files of the
                  service ?</p>
              <p>High salaries do not prevent corruption. Greed knows no bounds. Only
                  constant vigilance within the organization and strict laws to punish
                  transgressors can keep corruption at bay. It would be foolhardy to
                  assume that a system can be trusted on the merits of trust alone
                  without any external checks and balances put in place.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>A top civil servant like a Permanent Secretary takes home more than
                  S$50,000 monthly, more than the top-earning lawyers and doctors. Will
                  he or she be able to command a higher salary with his / her academic
                  qualifications in the private sector ? I seriously doubt so. Therefore,
                  the argument that we need to pay high salaries to keep the best talent
                  doesn’t hold any grounds at all.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Singapore has one of the best education system in the world. Our
                  students constantly top international competition in mathematics and
                  science. We have a high literacy rate of over 95% and more than half of
                  the population has some sort of tertiary education. There is more than
                  enough talent to filled up all levels of position in the civil service.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The most direct and appropriate way of retaining the best talent in
                  the service is to do away with the scholarships and implement real
                  meritocracy in the civil service where anybody can rise up to the
                  highest rank based on their work performance regardless of their
                  academic qualifications.</strong></span></p>
              <p>As the administrative arm of the government, the civil service
                  should be depoliticized and allowed to function independently of
                  partisan differences so that it can continue to serve the people well
                  even when there is a change of government.</p>
