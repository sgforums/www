            <div class='col-md body'>Now, The US department did not identify which asian countries had done this, but It's a common knowledge. After so many years, only now did this incident came Up.. why now? Isn't this a good propaganda news to rave up the "war on Terror" theme ?<br><br><strong>Intel pros say Bush is lying about foiling 2002 terror attack </strong><br><br>Outraged intelligence professionals say President George W. Bush is "cheapening" and "politicizing" their work with claims the United States foiled a planned terrorist attack against Los Angeles in 2002.<br><br><strong>"The President has cheapened the entire intelligence community by dragging us into his fantasy world," says a longtime field operative of the Central Intelligence Agency. "He is basing this absurd claim on the same discredited informant who told us Al Qaeda would attack selected financial institutions in New York and Washington." </strong><br><br><strong>Within hours of the PresidentÂ’s speech Thursday claiming his administration had prevented a major attack, sources who said they were current and retired intelligence pros from the CIA, NSA, FBI and military contacted Capitol Hill Blue with angry comments disputing the PresidentÂ’s remarks.<br><br>Â“HeÂ’s full of shit,Â” said one sharply-worded email.</strong><br><br>Although none were willing to allow use of their names, saying doing so would place them in legal jeopardy, we were able to confirm that at least four of the 23 who contacted us currently work, or had worked, within the U.S. intelligence community.<br><br>But Los Angeles Mayor Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa is willing to go on the record, claiming Bush blind-sided his city with the claims.<br><br>"I'm amazed that the president would make this (announcement) on national TV and not inform us of these details through the appropriate channels," the mayor says. "I don't expect a call from the president Â— but somebody." Villaraigosa also said he has twice requested meetings with Bush to discuss security issues for Los Angeles and was turned down both times.<br><br><strong>Intelligence pros say much of the information used by Bush in an attempt to justify his increased spying on Americans by the National Security Agency, trampling of civil rights under the USA Patriot Act, and massive buildup of the Department of Homeland Security, now the nationÂ’s largest federal bureaucracy, was Â“worthless intel that was discarded long ago.Â” </strong><br><br>Â“A lot of buzz circulated in the months following the September 11, 2001, attacks,Â” says an NSA operative. Â“Snippets here and there were true but most was just random information that could never be confirmed. One thing we do know about al Qaeda is that they seldom use the same technique twice. They tried a car bomb to bring down the World Trade Center and it failed. Then they went to planes. The next time will be something different because weÂ’ve geared up to prevent hijacking planes and using them as flying bombs.Â”<br><br><strong>In August 2004, just as the Presidential campaign was about to heat up, the Bush White House raised the terror alert, claiming attacks were imminent on major financial institutions. The alert, apparently timed to steal thunder from Democrat John KerryÂ’s nomination for President, was withdrawn after administration officials admitted it was based on old information from a discredited informant.</strong><br><br>The discredited information dated back to the same period when intelligence agencies began receiving reports of a planned attack against Los Angeles.<br><br>Former DHS secretary Tom Ridge admits the U.S. raised terror alerts for the wrong reasons and now says he often disagreed with the timing of such alerts but was overruled by the White House.<br><br>"More often than not we were the least inclined to raise it," Ridge says. "Sometimes we disagreed with the intelligence assessment. Sometimes we thought even if the intelligence was good, you don't necessarily put the country on alert, There were times when the White House was really aggressive about raising it, and we said, 'For that?' We often lost the argument."<br><br>Ridge left DHS in February 2005 and replaced him with Michael Chertoff who agrees with the Â“cry wolfÂ” strategy of the White House.<br><br>Â“Chertoff is a lackey,Â” says Kevin Riley, a retired New York City Detective who knew Chertoff during his days as a U.S. Attorney in New York. Â“HeÂ’ll do whatever Bush tells him to do.Â”<br><br>Intelligence pros at established Washington agencies laugh at DHS operatives, calling them Â“Keystone KopsÂ” and Â“overpaid rent-a-cops,Â” saying they lack any real expertise in dealing with terrorism.<br><br>Â“DHS is a political police force,Â” says a retired CIA agent. Â“They exist to enforce the political propaganda program of George W. Bush. ThatÂ’s all theyÂ’re good for and theyÂ’re not very good at that.Â”<br><br><a href="http://www.capitolhillblue.com/blog/2006/02/intel_pros_say_bush_is_lying_a.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.capitolhillblue.com/blog/2006/02/intel_pros_say_bush_is_lying_a.html</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Another Article......<br><br><strong>Twenty-Three Intel Experts Say LA Terror Plot a Sham</strong><br><br>Paul Joseph Watson/Prison Planet.com | February 10 2006<br><br>Related: Bush Plays Terror Card With Bogus LA Attack Plot<br><br>Following yesterday's highly suspiciously timed announcement that the US government had foiled a 2002 terror plot against the Los Angeles Library Tower, intelligence experts and White House reporters have uniformly debunked the story.<br><br><strong>As we reported yesterday, in an orchestrated set-up, George W. Bush announced that a plan to fly a plane into the LA Library Tower was thwarted in 2002 and within minutes news networks were showing footage of the same building being destroyed in the movie Independence Day.</strong><br><br>After the mayor of LA, Antonio Villaraigosa, immediately went public with comments of his absolute bewilderment concerning the alleged plot, no fewer than twenty three intelligence experts told Capitol Hill Blue that President Bush was "cheapening and politicizing their work" by creating a "fantasy world" of discredited terror alerts and using them for political points scoring.<br><br>Both current and former NSA and FBI officials vented their fury with George Bush, one telling Capitol Hill Blue that he was "full of shit."<br><br>The LA attack plot arose from the same discredited informant who said that Washington and New York financial institutions were being targeted, which led the White House to raise the terror alert right as the 2004 election campaign was beginning.<br><br>In June 2004 John Pistole, the FBI's counterterrorism director, said he was "not sure what [the CIA] was referring to," after a CIA counterterrorism official who testified under the alias "Ted Davis" said that the US had prevented aviation attacks against the east and west coast.<br><br>Even former Homeland Security secretary Tom Ridge, before he was replaced by Michael Chertoff, stated that the White House would raise the terror alert with zeal based on the flimsiest evidence.<br><br><strong>White House press reporters questioned the timing of the bogus attack claim Thursday evening in light of the NSA spying hearings, after Bush claimed NSA surveillance was key in preventing the alleged attack.<br><br>"But is it just a coincidence? You had February 6th circled on the calendar for the hearings, the NSA hearings. Is it just a pure coincidence that this comes out today?" asked one journalist.</strong><br><br>McClellan was clearly ruffled and all he could do was repeat the same line about how the President likes to share information with the American people, a claim that would be funny if it were not so disturbingly tragic in light of today's report highlighting White House knowledge of levee breaks in New Orleans hours after Hurricane Katrina roared ashore.<br><br><strong>"Scott, I wanted to just ask a follow-up about the LA plot. Is there something missing from this story, a practical application, a few facts? Because if you want to commandeer a plane and fly it into a tower, if you used shoe bombs, wouldn't you blow off the cockpit? Or is there something missing from this story?" asked another.</strong><br><br>File this with the dozens of fake terror alerts, staged 'Al-Qaeda' arrests and hoax bin Laden tapes as another brazen attempt to frighten the American people into jettisoning their own liberty for the sake of a mythical security offered by an illegitimate occupational government.<br><br><a href="http://www.prisonplanet.com/articles/february2006/100206plotasham.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.prisonplanet.com/articles/february2006/100206plotasham.htm</a><br><br></div>
