What is pap afraid of? Is pap trying to be the nanny.<br><br>Internet is the last freedom of expression. People enjoy freedoms and with freedom they will do plenty.<br><br>Doesn't the government own the press and TV ? Why so afraid of the sammy. If pap or government is so really concerned about ethics and morality why open the IR against people's strong objections.<br><br>Can't it understand that government is not itself too good with its own morality by taking the world's highest salaries when 80% of people are living below the poverty.<br><br>Government must understand people have never asked government for morality since it cannot lead by morality. Morality can only be taught by the people and the parents. So government should not try to be hypocrite when it already shows no concern for morality by bringing in the IR.<br><br>When government invited the IR, it has already forfeited the right to govern with morality. So do not talk about morality or try to be like the nanny. Parents anyway has never asked government to be nanny. If pap wants to close down sammy, it might as well close down internet and close down the world.<br><br>No wonder in PM trip to New Zealand he was so embarassed by the headline news in front of his hosts screaming the way he is controlling people's freedoms.<br></div>
