            <div class='col-md body'>The complaints by people against sammyboy webside is a typical example of how citizens' intolerance can finally making themselves the sole losers.<br><br>For example, if citizens keep complaining against fellow citizens for behaviours and other social problems, what will the government do?<br><br>The government can deal with the complaints and come up with different ways to govern the country e.g.<br><br>(1) Objectively - government studies the root cause and put up measures to avoid the problems balancing the laws with citizens' self-help and self-reliance to provide some basic equilibrium of roles or power between state and individuals.<br><br>In responding to complaints on racism, - it needs not over-react. It can use the existing law wisely to bring about balance and self-reliance to encourage interactions and cooperation among races and mutual respects and harmony.<br><br>(2) Subjectively - a control-oriented government may use the complaints to pass stricter laws to create more crimes and offences and give it more power of arrests and curbing of freedoms e.g. Immigration Act has now the power to jail a innocuous or innocent landlord for renting out premises to foreign worker.<br><br>The draconian ISA may be extended to increase govenment's discretion to classify even religious dissents as undesirable anti-state activities with power of preemptive arrest under the act.<br><br>On the ground of preventing racism the govenrment has already passed GRC laws only to result in the government having more power to maintain its one-party rule.<br><br>Over the past 40 years, we have seen the government passing more and more laws to give itself more and more power to control the press, citizens' freedom of expressions and social activities and gathering.<br><br>On the ground of traffic congestion, the government took the opportunity to triple-charge on vehicle ownership and transportation in the form of the heavy Excise duty, COE and ERPs fees which cause our loss of economic competitiveness.<br><br>The slightest complaints by some individuals have caused more laws and controls over signages on buildings or T-shirts and display of elephant placards to signify unhappiness over delays in opening MRT stations, etc.<br><br>Do we want to build a society where individuals keep complaining and government keep increasing its powers over individual freedoms, trading, association or creative activities.<br><br>If we are not clear what we want, we will only make the government increase controls of freedom or prohibit citizens' rights.<br><br>If we are unhappy with some individuals posting of porn in certain websides, then what do you think those complaints will make the government do.<br><br>I am sure the government will not hesitate to use such complaints as tools or convenient activants to increase further its own political power over dissenting or alternative views or criticisms of its governance by coming up with a stricter Sedition Act to clamp down citizens' criticisms.<br><br>My advice to people is - be objective and do not rely on the government to increase controls of individuals or society. Instead of using controls and regulations in an one-sided manner, get government to liberalise controls over citizens and free up social, political and creative entrpreneurship spheres so that the society will eventually learn how to balance and take care of behavioural problems through self-restraints, harmony and balance.<br><br>Before any one is asking more prohibitions in cyber freedom the last means of expression of citizens against any sammy or other websites for any reason, think again.<br><br>Do not add more fuels to the government's control fire as such actions will surely one way turn the citizens into zhombies with no ones to speak up for citizens and government running up the whole country without accountability leading to high cost problems and all the pro-foreign excesses causing bigger problems to all.<br><br>There is a heavy price to pay for more controls. The better solution is to get government to liberalise so that at the end there will be greater opportunities for all and with this upgrading there will be less social problems with fellow citizens and more self-reliance and self-checks.<br><br>More controls might lead to pent-up frenzy which may end up as instability and chaos as has happened in many countries governed in such a manner.<br><br>What do we want as a society - keep complaining against fellow citizens adding more fuels to government fire in wanting more laws to contain citizens and extend its existing power.</div>

Similarly, the IR is not left to self-regulate and free-hands by the businessmen, the government has a stake &amp; responsibility to impose laws and regulations on entrance requirements, employment suitability, loans credit etc. Other measures can include establishing family care centre, counselling centre and reorganising anti-vice police department. With all these reinforce in place, though the moral principle of having a IR is unduly wrong in a social or religion prospective but considering the economic values it could add to the nation wealth and the creation of jobs aplenty certainly offset society ills by a huge margin.<br><br>"The key to achieving a balance is through regulation not complete elimination."  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>
