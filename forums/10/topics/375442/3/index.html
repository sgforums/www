              <p>Our power Lady Ah Ho very smart. She tells you Xmas coming so hohoho. Put your money into the empty piggy bank!</p>
              <p><em>Published November 18, 2009</em></p>
              <p><em>Temasek in US$500m global bond issue</em></p>
              <p><em>By CONRAD TAN </em></p>
              <p><em>TEMASEK Holdings is raising US$500 million by selling 30-year US dollar bonds to institutional investors worldwide - its second large bond issue in a month.</em></p>
              <p><em>The bonds will <strong>pay fixed interest of 5.375 per cent a year until they mature in 2039</strong>. They are rated triple-A - the highest grade possible - by credit-rating agencies Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody's Investor Services.</em></p>
              <p><em>The bonds are priced to yield 1.15 percentage points more than 30-year US Treasury bonds and are being re-offered to investors at a slight discount to yield a return of 5.441 per cent a year, Temasek said in a statement.</em></p>
              <p><em>They are the longest-dated bonds issued by Temasek so far, and the third series under a US$5 billion medium-term note programme it started in 2005.</em></p>
              <p><em>Last month, Temasek sold US$1.5 billion of US dollar bonds paying fixed interest of 4.3 per cent a year and maturing in October 2019. In 2005, it sold US$1.75 billion of US dollar bonds paying fixed interest of 4.5 per cent a year and maturing in September 2015.</em></p>
              <p><em>Further issues are likely. Temasek chief executive Ho Ching said in May that it plans to issue bonds of varying maturities. The spread - or extra yield - on the bonds, compared with traditional benchmarks such as US Treasuries, will reflect investors' perception of Temasek's creditworthiness.</em></p>
              <p><em>This will serve as a public signal of Temasek's financial position and credit risks that will bind its strategic actions and commercial choices, Ms Ho said at the time. 'We hope to establish a series of different tenured bonds for a more robust and nuanced signal over the longer term,' she added.</em></p>
              <p><em>As with the earlier issues, the bonds will be listed on Singapore Exchange.<br>Net proceeds from the sale of the bonds will be used by Temasek and its subsidiaries to fund their ordinary course of business, Temasek said. Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are managing the sale.</em></p>
              <p><em>All the bonds under the US$5 billion medium-term note programme are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Temasek.</em></p>
              <p><em>The bonds will be issued by Temasek Financial (I), a wholly owned unit of Temasek that was set up in 2004 to issue notes under the bond programme.</em></p>
              <p><em>The offering is scheduled to close on Nov 23.</em></p>

              <p>I do believe it is a good biz decisions. Bonds are used to generate capital, which means lesser touching of our reserves.</p>
              <p>As the world is slowly evolving out of the financial crisis, opportunities galore abounds. With sufficient capital, Temasek would be a good position to capture market opportunities, coupled with the recent APEC's declarations and objectives for free trade and opening up of markets.</p>
              <p>With our intelligent workforce as well as heavy investments in R&amp;D, science and tech, our country thru our GICs are poised to take on the world and grab whatever market share while we can. Repaying the bond interests upon maturity should not be a problem, for the returns in blue chip companies would definately be high.</p>
              <p>Our markets are not only in Dubai alone, but had reached even from Africa to Russia. Human has needs and ultimately will have to spend even just to survive. Investing in science and tech is right, for it improves survival and creates viable products and services wanted by the markets. </p>
              <p>With the profits generated, it does not goes into the wallets of ministers but to our society's coffers, unlike private enterprises which only enrich bosses.</p>

              <p>What is there not to believe? Crisis comes with opportunities, tried and tested time after time since civilisation begun, best taken with calculated risks and not foolhardy ones. Who better than those whom are well connected, in the know, to make them?</p>
              <p>Like you once said, its all about buy, sell and profit, and in this case, with long term vision for benefits. There's still plenty of resources on Earth and mankind had not grown out of needs.</p>
              <p>If you are implying on empty coffers, then credible evidences will have to be used to support. No one, absolutely no one, had return empty handed from collecting their due CPF savings with interests. Social funding for our citizens had not stopped, and are still being currently used to support jobs and job creation.</p>
              <p>Temasek should be credited for taking such initiatives now, while the iron is still hot. Wherelse will our monies for our treasury come from? No choice, cant afford to relax or get cold feet now. The world aint gonna wait for us.</p>

              <p>Beside all those usual cursing by my Uncle Atobe and medication deficiencies of my Uncle Andrew.  I, as a financial advisor, will like draw a view of the financial aspect of singapore.</p>
              <p>In my opinon, the logic is simple, singapore is not  totally out of recession, for that i have to agree, state media will alway propagate good news more than bad news, funny is that most who dislike the govt are the ones most anxious to read it.</p>
              <p>Singapore is a kind of country that like to appear good on the upfront with a pain in the rear, same goes to many HDB houses, so nice to look at, but inside is not so nice and the cost is high. In term of economy, theylove to paint a good picture base on a mere vague statistics of GDP which nobody gives a damn on how they achieve it. In fact, whenever they said GDP is up, we are in trouble, something will goes up, this time around, property tax, and maybe follow by transport fares or ERPs. In economy terms, if GDP is up, the citizens should be better off, course we are producing more and exporting more, but yet our paid is so miserable stagnanted if not reduced. Therefore we should expect govt getting income thru export taxation and thereby loosen the burden on its citizens, but here is different, GDP up, we paid more, why??? So if you will to ask, i prefer a lower GDP.</p>
              <p>The restructuring of CPF, increase of Taxation, and import of more foreign for more taxation shown a desparate situation for govt to raise money because they do not wish to go into the reserve, as that would lower our Sg Dollars, and if sg dollars goes now, a average guy on the street is till ok, cos, he dun have much money to care for, but for a rich guy, his money will sink tremedously, and our elites are rich peoples. Moreover, in term of working condition, the objective by NTUC calling for Cheap, better and faster, fall in a way of asking people to produce more with less, another squeeze on the already hardworking Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>Companies are actually not progressing well even if the economy had turned around, because some jobs are gone for good, the shares market improvement is due to low interest rates, which peoples to put in stocks, bonds and shares to earn higher dividends instead of the pathetic 0.25 to 1 % FD in banks. But doesn't mean that economy is good, on the other hand, low interest rates is mend to churn the economy into peoples buying and taking loan for business, as the interest is low, repaying will not be so high. But banks today, because of so much bad debt accumulated, are more caution on loans, and that refray peoples from doing business. And without business, there will be less jobs and standstill economy. The recently insurgent of IPOs offering already tell you that organisations had no choice but to float their IPO, as bank risk rating of lending had got up, so the option for bank is to underwrite IPOs for organisation or companies who want to raise funds/get money instead of borrowing from banks, which is not successful.</p>
              <p>As the Dubai case, it due to overly loans on construction, as you know Dubai had changed in past 10 years from a desert into a comospolitans city, and developers are borrowing alots to built all those fancy buildings which could be a lost due to delay and material miscalculation, result in unable to pay the banks. The resultant effect will be most funds managers or individual pulling out of Dubai interest. And as a globlised economy, Asian, especially Singapore will be affected. I believe that for Singapore or Asia, it is only a blip of withdrawal by investors, as this is a first time Dubai having a problem, people are more caution, on the other hand, it actually should be a gain for asia unless they invested too much in Dubai. But we must alway remember, investors will like to park their money somewhere, due low interest rates, they will park anywhere that got potential of 3% and above return, by and large, we will see a shrink in stockmarket of Singapore early next week, but investor will return after studying the situation, and Singapore will be up again, we will not exceed the 3000 STI marks this year, but i think for next year, with the IR coming up, a poor western economy, I bet the STI will go beyong 3200marks </p>
