            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by BÃ¥seline:</div><div class="quote_body">Take for instance the recent SIA thingy.<br><br>Airline is a delicate industry, will outsourcing reduced the overall safety and quality of machine parts since majority of the projects will have to go on the cheap? Will the companies outsourced provide adequate knowledge and skills such delicate projects?</div></blockquote>SIA's case is not a good example in this case. SIA IT Department only handles the internal systems like revenue accounting, reservation and departure control system. They do not maintain the aircraft systems and thus do not affect safety.<br><br>Anyway, on the subject of IT outsourcing, it really depends on what type of system we are talking about. IT industry has grown to be a huge industry now with various field any one person can specialized in. I would compare that to the engineers where you have civil engineers, mechanical, electrical, electronics, avionics etc... IT industry can be classified into software programmers, hardware, web design, system artitecture, Database administrators etc..<br><br>For some aspect of IT industry, it makes full sense to outsource since some software do not need to be re-invented when there are specialised software company who will create the software and sell it worldwide. For example, data mining/reporting software is a very common application that many cooperation requires. It does not make sense to have each company developing their own data mining software. On the other hand, there may be unique softwares that only a certain company needs and in this case, internal development might make more sense. So, it really depends on the situation whether outsourcing is logical.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The world trend is to outsource expensive works and services to others who can perform the same more economically.<br><br>So, Singapore will find it difficult to resist this trend. If we resist it, we may find our exports and other works and services uncompetitive and lose jobs.<br><br>Having said this, the question to be asked is: How to outsource and turn the savings from outsourcing to create more investments, save jobs or even to increase jobs.<br><br>Is our government adopting this strategy? Only a pro-employment and pro-business government will help to prevent loss of jobs in the event of outsourcing becoming a trend.<br><br>Foreign investments are based on mega-economic policy. How about rationalising foreign investment policies and be more accountable so as to invest surpluses and reinvest investment gains to create and safeguard jobs.<br><br>There are still many viable local businesses the government can go into locally such as using our available resources like vacant lands etc to start substitution and agro-based industries to save us foreign exchanges. Our farm produces may be a little expensive compared with imported ones but such industries can provide our retirees and unemployed with entrepreneurial opportunities and create jobs. Are we have a holistic economic strategy aimed at making our own domestic sector strong instead of investing in foreign countries with no particular plans or strategies.<br><br>It is not a good economic strategy just to emphasise that we need foreigners and foreign companies to create jobs. The endless wooing of  foreign investments did not seem to work well during past two recessions.

Minister of Manpower has just said that outsourcing is inevitable. With this announcement, many private firms will be bolder in outsourcing so will the government. Yet, without understanding the full implementation, the government seems to be making all kinds of policies affecting all the citizens.<br><br>The employment situation will be only getting dimmer. It is time for government to do something to compensate the ill effects of outsourcing. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"></div>

If SATS outsource to other local companies, that means opportunities are there for local companies to taking over part of the business of the big companies. why not?</div>
