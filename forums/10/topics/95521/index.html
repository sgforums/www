            <div class='col-md body'>Ask what is the definition of IT services?  How can IT be one of the possible outsourcing list?  Today, almost everything is IT-run.  We use IT to manufacture, to file, to plan, to defend, to write, to run our transportation system, car, etc.<br><br>IT services is very vast.  Just outsourcing IT alone is vast enough.<br><br>And is outsourcing safe?  Especially at such a time when terrorism is happening everywhere.<br><br>We have enough Bangladesh, Sri Lankan, Chinese, Indo, Philippino foreign cleaners, construction workers, tuition teachers, etc.  They are residing in one of our HDB flats.  They don't live in Namly Avenue nor Bukit Timah area.  Seriously they are of security concern to us.<br><br>What happen when all these IT segments are ousourced?  Will our info be compromised further?  Will our National Info be leaked to CIA, etc?  Thus exposing our weaknesses to foreign countries?<br><br>I understand Singapore is facing some kind of hidden crisis as it seems.  And when has our 5-day week working life has become some kind of endless nightmare of ours?  How many of us are starting to experience working late into the evenings and nights when you are supposed to be home enjoying family bonding?<br><br>Will there be a day when only the foreigners appreciate what our government has done for them and will be eligible to vote?</div>
