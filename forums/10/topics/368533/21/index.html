              <p><strong>Justice Legal,you are the most selfish and this is the most sickening ever post I have ever read. What kind of person are you to discriminate against our own countrymen serving their nation. </strong></p>
              <p><strong>Hello,please wake the hell up from your slumber, and do note that these guys are serving the nation proud and doing a good job!!! If you are so afraid of your precious kids being in contact with any germs,then put your kids in a PLASTIC BUBBLE! For all we know,it's you that must be practising bad hygiene at home! God knows how well you personally clean your kids!! Basing on your views,I can only imagine how narrow minded and "small" you are. I see you have come up with a term of your own,"Boar Flu",hmm...you must be a scientist or a professor in some medical field. Maybe you should proceed over to engineering and come up with a floating bubble to put your kids in. And also get one for yourself to keep your puny brain in.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>And if you think that NSF's have got money to burn by taking cabs,well pay attention to MIDz's reply. Midz gave you a full calculation on NSF pay. Thank you Midz.</strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>"LOL u know how much is their pay?</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Let's said $350 ok?</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>1 week book out once.. So that's 4 times..</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>4 x $10 = $40</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Leaving $310 onli .. Dun forget their HP bills + daily usage of
                                      money + some still need to provide money for the family."</strong></span></p>
              <p>Justice Legal,the next time you wanna condemn someone,please enlighten yourself first. For all we know,maybe you yourself had a hell of a bad experience in the Army, and this is your way of blaming SAF. Why don't <strong>YOU YOURSELF AND YOUR KIDS TAKE A CAB</strong>, as what some of us here agree. <strong>TAKE THE CAB TO PUT YOU AND YOUR KIDS IN IT. </strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Justice Legal, just an advice,the next time you try to think,please don't...you got stupidity and selfishness coming out from you. You're an idiot.</p>

              <p>I was in the UK in the past few weeks and i saw a whole town
              lining up to pay respects to the hearses of fallen British soldiers
              recently killed in Afghanistan. Anonymous bystanders actually shed
              tears to persons they did not know who died while serving in a
              faraway country. A war that actually have no bearing on them
              whatsoever. But still, they come and pay their respects.</p>
              <p>Here, we Singaporeans complain about smelly uniforms and NS boys
              occupying seats on buses or trains. No wonder most of our
              servicemen wants to keng all the time.</p>

              <p>Hmm... apparently Parn wasn't there when we stepped off aircraft into empty air, sailed down a chopper with nothing but a rope between us and a painful death.</p>
              <p>Parn wasn't there when we accelerated tiny chunks of metal to nearly a kilometer a second, and learned to put them on target a hundred meters away, and she wasn't there when we learned to make improvised bombs from few few ordinary objects.</p>
              <p>Has she steered multiton steel beasts that can fire 120mm APFSDS rounds? Or has she known the lethal effects of a shaped charged warhead? Has she been part of a team which can rain 155mm death out to 40 clicks?</p>
              <p>So yes, I've been in the military and Parn can scream all she wants, but it simply has no effect because I've been there, I've seen what the guys can do, and I tell you it takes guts to step out of a plane, rappel down a chopper, and mess around with things that can easily take lives if you're not careful.</p>

              <p>I cant believe i'm giving my first post to this nonsensical thread. No wonder our society is degenerating..</p>
              <p>Just to let u guys noe tt there is a rule that is enforced in CERTAIN army camps that DO NOT ALLOW E ARMY GUYS TO BATHE BEFORE BOOKING OUT.. Do you think all army guys if given a choice would like to book out as quoted from TS "smelly green monsters"? I personally do not understand this rule but seriously some ppl shld do sm research b4 posting unconstructive comments which leads to such public outrage and furore.</p>
              <p>If sm ppl r so opinionated and passionate about this issue, I dare you to bring this issue up to MINDEF and make a difference to the lousy air quality in S'pore due to these "smelly green monsters" walking ard and polluting S'pore's air.. Perhaps a new directive shld b implemented? All army guys shld perform a "spraying deodorant parade" each time b4 booking out? Sounds good eh?</p>
              <p>Wake up your idea pls</p>

              <p>I think Parn just departed reality...</p>
              <p>Hello earth to Parn? Earth to Parn?</p>
              <p>This thread was started by a well noted online troll whose main objective is to start flamewars by posting flamebait. Just look at his/her previous posts in other threads.</p>
              <p>The truth is, is there really a social issue about "stinky NS boys" in Singapore? I'll hazard a guess I think the answer is generally. No. Being in the armed forces before it's certianly not S.O.P to send your recruits out of camp right after 10 days in the field. They have this technology we use that is called a "shower".</p>
              <p>In fact if anything there is quite a penalty for going out in public with anything less then proper bearings. I don't recall moving away from anybody I see in uniform while in public transport, so if anything, the "stinky NS boys" occurs as as isloated case.</p>
              <p>I don't think the TS actually encountered what she/he said she/he did in the thread, this was simply an attempt to cook up another post to get some attention. The sad fact that Parn can pick up on that cause shows that if anything, there is a general lack of decernment... and of course, the smearing of the tradition and experiences of an entire generation of people who did their duty without question as a largely irrelevant experience of incompetent people.</p>
              <p>I think feminism and all that junk aside there's one thing very important to know about guys. If a culture sets itself up to constantly deride it's protectors, then those who deride and show contempt for their protectors should not expect the protection they are supposed to provide.</p>
              <p>Basically this, I've met girls who keep complaining about how their guys are useless or cannot protect them... but it makes me wonder what makes these girls worth protecting in the first place if they have nothing but contempt for their guy?</p>

              <p>I think it has already ended since none of the Singaporean guys here are able to come up with a valid argument, other than turning it into a personal attack and hiding behind their unavoidable national service.</p>

              <p>It's true that most Singaporean males need to do their national service, but can they stay pregnant for nine months and give birth?</p>
              <p>They should thank their lucky stars for their national service duty, else I am unable to imagine what other kinds of retarded excuses they are going to choke up to even compare with all females in the world.</p>
              <p>Maybe they aren't smart enough to figure it out, but while they do not have a choice not to serve their national service, we have a choice not to bear their children.</p>
