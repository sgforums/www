              <p>This is hardly an argument in anycase. It's a black tar brush that blots out all the risks and sacrifices people have made, sometimes the ultimate sacrifice, over all these years.</p>
              <p>That's why I say no need to argue, just put Parn in an frontline infantry unit for a few weeks outfield, she'll get the picture.</p>
              <p>In any case, even the whole premise of her argument is flawed. Most NS men don't even book out stinking. You don't do that in SISPEC, and certainly not in OCS, and your main posting would certainly give you time to figure your personal stuff out before leaving camp.</p>
              <p>The most likely candidate I see for probably stinking would be the tekong-bound recruit who is more keen on booking out and taking the short cuts to do so.</p>
              <p>So basically they are crying foul about a very small proportion of the military, which is okay if taken in proportion and addressed issue by issue. But trying to say the entire force of 250,000 people stink just because they wear green is a bit of a bad joke. Saying that these 250,000 people are whimps is not a joke, it's vulgar.</p>
              <p>And if it's such an issue go raise it with the press like the dog or cat issues. But personally I don't have an issue with this. In my personal experience I haven't come across the chow recruit in public, and most of the people in green i meet in public do not stink.</p>
              <p>Basically, TS is a troll, and Parn is kinda sad for actually taking TS seriously. As I said, two weeks outfield would be good for her.</p>

              <p>There's much more to that. We respect the commitments and sacrifices of women who endure pregnancy. But we don't see that as an excuse to hammer "useless" men. Often (but sadly not always), these "useless men" do everything they can to help such women through that pregnancy. Just as many (but sadly not all) women help their men (boyfriends, friends, relatives, even strangers!) go through NS in whatever ways they can..</p>
              <p>But i digress. This thread is *not about pregnancy vs NS. It is *not about men vs women.</p>
              <p>It is about *people requesting decency vs those who would not only deny it, but maliciously attack the characters of the former.</p>
              <p>Simply put, the Troll has lost all credibility. That is, assuming it had any in the 1st place. Its opinions are not worth consideration, except *maybe the consideration that one gives to a fly being swatted.</p>
              <p>That's the wonderful thing about these forums. I realised i don't need an M16 or bayonet to make my point clear. Just let the moron make a fool of itself for everyone to see.</p>

              <p><br>Basically this, if Parn wants to use the pregnancy tack, then can we say that all women who do not have children or choose to remain childless are cowards and a disgrace to womenkind for forsaking their duty?</p>
              <p>Of course not. That point has no logical congruence at all and it's not even the way we view motherhood.</p>
              <p>Which is a bit discusting, because I suspect her view of motherhood does not glorify it or give it the respect it deserves... it is if anything, disgraced and dishonoured by being used as ammunition in her pseudo-feminist arguments.</p>
              <p>Imagine the uproar that will be caused if some joker started a thread on how pregnant women are a liability on the train because they always need seats that other same-fare paying passengers have to give up. Imagine the uproar when they suggest that maybe pregnant women should pay more because they have seats reserved for them or should just not take the train and get a taxi instead.</p>

              <p>Additionally it is amusing when some girls (they are most certainly not women), who have been resolved to stay childless and single, use the "pregnancy as ns" argument.</p>
              <p>Apparently the fact that they invalidate their own existence with their own argument seems to be lost on them.</p>
              <p>Indeed, our current culture has a lot to say about what's man and what's not man... but what is WOMAN indeed? A pseudo-feminist certainly isn't one. Parn certainly isn't one.</p>

              <p>First, i don't deny that you've given up 2 years of your life too. I don't deny that you've made sacrifices too. I don't "look down" on lower PES ppl. But i'm not sure if you have put yourself in the shoes of many NSmen in combat vocations, in part because you didn't undergo BMT. Until i know more abt your service, i can't conclusively say anything.</p>
              <p>Again, i say that this is not a "bashing lower-PES" ppl thing. But i'm not going to be politically correct and say that they always know what they're talking about when they comment on combat personnel. We don't expect infantrymen to fully comprehend what commandos go through. We don't expect artillerymen to understand tankees. And so on.</p>
              <p>The bombs are beside the point.</p>
              <p>If anything, that's an argument against forcing boys to learn how to kill. It's *not an argument against the boys themselves.</p>

              <p>i've served the nation for 2 years of my life (2 yrs = priceless, btw).</p>
              <p>i hope MINDEF only teaches selected and only necessary units (like commandos etc.) how to make bombs and not every NSF.</p>
              <p>we all saw what could have happened if there's another Dave Teo, but this time, instead of SAR-21 rifle, he has a mini micro-circuit bomb enough to stuff several in his backpack and walk around some malls.</p>
              <p>what could happened?! i never went through BMT due to my PES status, so i'm not sure if every NSF (or some) are taught to make bombs out of simple materials.</p>

              <p>I find nothing great about NS, and Sgmen should not take NS as a feeling but rather a duty, and also Sgmen should not take NS as looking themselve higher than all others. To us women, with or without NS, makes no different. We never ask you go NS, it is the laws, and the laws maker here are all men, so men are alway knocking each other heads, both up and down.</p>

              <p>I see where you're coming from, but tt's besides the point.</p>
              <p>If you've read my earlier posts, you'll see that i'm not comparing NS with pregnancy. That's not relevant to our discussion. But if others want to raise the pregnancy tack to bash NSmen, we will respond accordingly.</p>
              <p>This isn't about who suffers more. No one wins an argument via pain olympics. It's about asking ppl to put themselves in our shoes. No one lambasted pregnant women. No one lambasted women just for not doing NS. But we do take issue with those who not only fail to appreciate our sacrifice, but maliciously belittle it.</p>
              <p>No one's asking others to praise us endlessly for giving up 2 years. We're just asking them not to insult our experiences.</p>
