              <p>I was bringing my children home from Downtown East last friday
              when a group of army boys boarded the bus with us. Gosh they were

              me. Their sweaty body touch mine hands and my kids and I glared at
              them. SAF should really ban their soldiers from taking the bus.
              Can't they take taxis with their pay? What are our tax payer money
              for? Somemore they come from tekong dunno got any germs or virus
              with them. Later they spread to my children and worse to us. Hope

              <p>i think the TS wants our NSFs to march everywhere.. or the SAF to move them about in 3-ton trucks..</p>
              <p>maybe the TS should just take the goddamned taxis to prevent.. uhh.. but but.. the taxi drivers may also smell of cigarette smoke and may accost the precious snowflake which is her crotch-droppings...</p>

              <p>sad.army should actually send ns guys back in their vehicles rather than the bus which i find time consuming.gov got no time to accomodate this luxury so public transport will have to do.</p>
