              <p>I was bringing my children home from Downtown East last friday

              Can't they take taxis with their pay? What are our tax payer money
              for? Somemore they come from tekong dunno got any germs or virus
              with them. Later they spread to my children and worse to us. Hope

              <p>i think the TS wants our NSFs to march everywhere.. or the SAF to move them about in 3-ton trucks..</p>
