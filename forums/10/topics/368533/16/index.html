              <p>Thank you for your reply to topic. Really glad to see parn and Nikar support me in this issue. I am sure all of us here agree that NS boy are smelly when they book out. Mode of transportation still debatable. But I stand firm they take taxi not bus cause they not only smelly but may be carrying known virus like AIDs or maybe boar flu. This very dangerous to rest of us Singaporean. As to why I don’t take cab, I want to save my hubby money. He work so hard in this country, it is the least I can do for him. And my kids like buses also. Anyway my poor girl was recovering but bobian last night got to go whitesand to buy things then see all the ns boy again. She start to cry say all the smeely green monster coming to catch her again. In my heart I ache like anything. Why <span>SAF</span> allow all these boys book out smeely dirty lidat. Make my little princess so scared. If they take taxi or stay in tekong all the way all these won’t happen. and we won’t get funny virus. maybe increase in malaria due to ns boy book out.<br>I heard got increase in malaria in singapore. most likely due to ns boy book out spread to us. actually parn idea of give them air con bus good idea. save us and benefit them. hope all ns boy here will tell your officer to get bus for you and you all pool money together to get the bus. really we all tax payer sponser your food and gun heavy toll on us. I guess this is minimum you all can do.</p>

              <p>I would rather see them admit that they stink but comes up with good, positive ideas and suggestions to improve their own image.</p>
              <p>Since they are too wussy to bring it up to their superiors and create awareness, then they should be more self-aware and accept, acknowledge the public opinions about them.</p>
              <p>Singaporean guys have this appalling habit of hiding behind their dreaded national service and demanded respect from the public and act patriotic when they think it will brings them absolute victory in whichever arguments they're into.</p>
              <p>Singaporean guys cannot lose, surrender, or even accept criticism regardless if it is for the sake of their own good or the goodness of many others.

              <p>Sadly, this is the present and the future of Singaporean males that we are witnessing. If they aren't able to self-aware. self-correct, self-reflect within themselves, then it is almost certain that they are not capable of bringing any future to themselves, their families and their country.</p>
              <p>It doesn't take much efforts to bring out their true ugly nature within themselves and expose them for all to see.</p>
              <p>Now you can see how retarded they are by trying to deny stinkiness with their educated minds but not righteous hearts. </p>

              <p>I never thought I would have a hilarious time reading postings, least of all here on Speakers corner, over a trival issue such as our chilvarious boys in uniform.</p>
              <p>16 pages of fetid odourous raising of stink over sweaty army boys booking out in their thick no.4 uniforms, reeking of honest perspiration, arousing the censure of one intolerant ivory tower occupant whom suffers from a depressive smelling paronoia called <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">A</span></strong>cute <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">S</span></strong>ensitivity <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">S</span></strong>yndrome.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>A.S.S</strong></span> w<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>hole</strong></span> sufferers tend to be painful whenever they are shafted hard with effluvium from bodies, and regurgetate thru their mouths when such stench pokes hard at their olfactory senses, comming undone and dribbling from their mouths.</p>
              <p>A possible cure for her may come in the form of using  </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>S</strong></span> <em>pecial  </em><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>U</strong></span> <em>rgent</em>  <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">C</span></strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>ontrolled</em></span>  <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>K</strong></span> <em>aons</em>  <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>MORE</strong></span> on   <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>C</strong></span> <em>arbon</em>  <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>O</strong></span> <em>dor  </em><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">C</span></strong> <em>ommand</em>  <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>K</strong></span> <em>icker</em> <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">S</span></strong>. Saliva would greatly ease the flow.
