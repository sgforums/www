I dont see a point why army boys cannot take public transport such as SBS buses just because of someone as unreasonable like you . So you are trying to say that army boys should only take taxis home after they book out ? Why cant you just take taxis and go to places that you desire , rather then asking the army boys to use their meagre pays to take taxis just because you are being selfish ?</p></div>

              Ah Chia I thought you anti PAP one? SAF is formed by bastard PAP right? you of all people should support me. Is it too much ask NS Boys to take taxi? It is more hygenic for us and keep us cooler. Otherwise they walk around with smelly green uniform full of germs from tekong can kill us one. Got poor pregnant lady in intensive care due to H1N1. Tekong so many germs you want us to die of boar flu. Really all the NS boy if they cannot take initative take taxi should just quarantine in tekong keep all of us safe. Anyway thankfully my husband no need serve NS as his country don't need to such thing. But sigh my daughter still frighten after encounter with green smelly monster. Cry every night. So NS boy who read this hope you take pity on all of us Singaporean and take taxi ok?

So many of them no money because they spend on prostitute and get AIDS then when seat on bus they cut themselves and spread AIDS to us. That is why taxi better.

              right? you of all people should support me. Is it too much ask NS
              Boys to take taxi? It is more hygenic for us and keep us cooler.
              Otherwise they walk around with smelly green uniform full of germs
              from tekong can kill us one. Got poor pregnant lady in intensive
              care due to H1N1. Tekong so many germs you want us to die of boar
              flu. Really all the NS boy if they cannot take initative take taxi
              should just quarantine in tekong keep all of us safe. Anyway
              thankfully my husband no need serve NS as his country don't need to
              such thing. But sigh my daughter still frighten after encounter
              with green smelly monster. Cry every night. So NS boy who read this
              hope you take pity on all of us Singaporean and take taxi ok?</p>

              <p>Since you and your daughters are such weaklings, just leave the country or go get your private car. Germs? You sure there is none on you and in your house? The entire bus is filled with germs with any type of people on it. Why not buy your own private bus and hire a driver so that your bus will only be filled with your own germs?</p>
              <p>U rich lady why still take cab ah? Noone else is bothered but you so you should be the 1 that takes a cab since weaklings cannot handle public transport.</p>
              <p>Why not take pity every other singaporean and stay at home permanently? Don't spread your weakling germs around and make everyone like u.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>LOL , give me a break .. So Your trying to say that army boys should take taxi just because singapore has some bitches like you , who dont know what it is like to serve 2 years of National Service. Why not if you dont want to get h1n1 , you might as well just take taxi yourself , to protect YOU AND YOUR CHILDREN from not getting those "flu" you mentioned. You got no rights to call them "green smelly monster" . Cause you didnt even went through it . If only you are agreeing to this , please do not use " us Singaporean " i doubt MANY SINGAPOREANS are gonna share your same thoughts.</p></div>

              <p>We pay tax to maintain army boy they should use the pay to take

              That is why taxi better. Somemore Singapore got more non ns boy

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Please use some brain before you try to post anything. What does it mean by PUBLIC transport? Army boys gets only about 400 per month. And due to their parents good teaching, they know how to return to their parent for the 18 years of bringing them up, so we just estimate each army boy gives theirs parents about 200. Pay bills and whatever 100.and they are only left with 100.  Let me just ask you what can you do with a mere 100 bucks for 1 month. i bet you can spend more then 100 in a week. How much tax do you pay a year? Do you think that you are the ONLY one that pay taxes? Why don't i see other tax payers complaining too? When they are done with NS, they come out to work, they PAY taxes too.</p></div>

              <p>I was bringing my children home from Downtown East last friday when a group of army boys boarded the bus with us. Gosh they were so smelly and disgusting that my kids started to make sick faces at me. Their sweaty body touch mine hands and my kids and I glared at them. SAF should really ban their soldiers from taking the bus. Can't they take taxis with their pay? What are our tax payer money for? Somemore they come from tekong dunno got any germs or virus with them. Later they spread to my children and worse to us. Hope the relavant authorities take note</p>

              <p>Government should provide air-con army buses to pick up and deliver these army boys home.</p>
              <p>Why need to be air-con bus? So that they can all keep their stinky sweaty smell among themselves and keep their forest flu/diseases away from weak and innocent public like myself.</p>

              <p>I wonder how much operational/combat value TS and TS's kids have compared to the entire SAF combined (minus TS if it's a male). Aren't our battle-worthy troops entitled to enjoy a trip home in the comfort of a bus after days of preparing to defend/aiding in the maintenance of the muscle of the nation, like people out there who slog whole days fighting to help maintain (and grow, if possible) SG's economic might? (Never mind where the $$ went to; that's another debate of its own...)</p>
              <p>If TS can do better than all SG's forces of steel combined, let TS declare so and by TS's own might serve to take the reins of the nation's military offensive/defensive capabilities. Let it display any striking power it may habour within depths unbeknownst to all.</p>

SO That IN THAT PRIVATE BUS OF yours , Only has your own GERMS spreading ? SO that you will just stop whining and accept the fact that army boys are CURRENTLY allowed to take public transport . See this , If Your Parents Told You and Taught you history when your young , i think you should know better that those army boys sweat for the sake of defending singapore . Why not just try serving it for 1 week ? lets not say 2 years .</p></div>
