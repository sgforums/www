              <p><em>it would be nice if those who can't stand army soldiers sweating can avoid taking buses, then this would avoid insulting ALL male Singaporean who have to serve NS, and avoid showing the inconsiderate social behaviour of a few females Singaporean.</em></p>
              <p><em>It would be extra nice if the TS could get out of the bus so that the NS guys, who had missed home for one whole week, could take a comfortable ride home; and it would be extra extra nice if she can show sympathy for the poor NS guys who had worked hard the whole week, by teaching her daughters to respect the  solders brothers."</em></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Sgdiehard, i actually agree with you.</p>
              <p>I'm simply telling the other side that even if NSmen are stinky, that is besides the point. NSmen should not be blamed or judged for being stinky because you can't expect them to smell squeaky clean everywhere they go. That's because 1.) NSmen do try to spruce up when they can, so it's not as if we don't make the effort; 2.) sprucing up is often not possible (like you said, we can't put a shower in every bus etc); and 3.) sprucing up is often futile (corporal punishment, walking long distances, hot sun, heavy uniform, heavy field pack). Pls refer to post 4 on pg 26.</p>
              <p>Also, regarding the "nice" and "extra nice" bits, pls refer to the 3rd post on pg 26. There, i said that just cos some NSmen go out of their way to be "nice" is not a reason not to accept NSmen who take public transport.</p>

              <p>2.) An NSman's kindness is insignificant compared to the fact that he dirtied my seat</p>
              <p>3.) NSmen are green monsters and a hazard to the public, and not least to me and my children</p>
              <p>4.) NSmen attract sick faces (tasteful, indeed)</p>
              <p>5.) NSmen are mere useless boy scouts. That they give up a good part of their lives to do a job they dislike for people who don't appreciate them is not enough. We must say that just because NSmen may not be as good as first-world armies, it also follows that they are useless braggarts. Indeed, NSmen are cowards and, implicitly, only heroes like us can do a better job of protecting the country.</p>
              <p>6.) NSmen's efforts to alleviate or at least explain the situation do not matter. It does not matter that they make the effort to clean up, that they face obstacles in cleaning up, and that often cleaning up turns out futile. All that matters is that they stink, pollute our precious space, and should be forced out of it.</p>
              <p>7.) In fact, while we're at it, let's heap on ad hominem attacks. Let's not just attack NSmen's smell, let's attack their characters. Then howl about being threatened when they respond angrily.</p>
              <p>There's much more that i can list, but i believe i've made my point clear.</p>

              <p>"There is a group of people saying that NS Men should take
              greater social and moral responsibility when they are out in
              public(spray dunnoe what and others to "beautify" themselves) and
              there is another group saying that that is unreasonable and there
              came the war of words which got downright personal."</p>
              <p>I don't think it's that simple.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, there's a group that said:</p>
              <p>1.) NSmen should be banned from public buses</p>
              <p>2.) An NSman's kindness is insignificant compared to the fact
              that he dirtied my seat</p>
              <p>3.) NSmen are green monsters and a hazard to the public, and not
              least to me and my children</p>
              <p>4.) NSmen attract sick faces (tasteful, indeed)</p>
              <p>5.) NSmen are mere useless boy scouts. That they give up a good
              part of their lives to do a job they dislike for people who don't
              appreciate them is not enough. We must say that just because NSmen
              may not be as good as first-world armies, it also follows that they
              are useless braggarts. Indeed, NSmen are cowards and, implicitly,
              only heroes like us can do a better job of protecting the
              country.</p>
              <p>6.) NSmen's efforts to alleviate or at least explain the
              situation do not matter. It does not matter that they make the
              effort to clean up, that they face obstacles in cleaning up, and
              that often cleaning up turns out futile. All that matters is that
              they stink, pollute our precious space, and should be forced out of
              it.</p>
              <p>7.) In fact, while we're at it, let's heap on ad hominem
              attacks. Let's not just attack NSmen's smell, let's attack their
              characters. Then howl about being threatened when they respond
              angrily.</p>
              <p>There's much more that i can list, but i believe i've made my
              point clear.</p>
              <p>It's not just a question of people requesting social
              responsibility vs egotistical unreasonable NSmen. What it</p>

              <p>There's much more to that. We respect the commitments and sacrifices of women who endure pregnancy. But we don't see that as an excuse to hammer "useless" men. Often (but sadly not always), these "useless men" do everything they can to help such women through that pregnancy. Just as many (but sadly not all) women help their men (boyfriends, friends, relatives, even strangers!) go through NS in whatever ways they can..</p>
              <p>But i digress. This thread is *not about pregnancy vs NS. It is *not about men vs women.</p>
              <p>It is about *people requesting decency vs those who would not only deny it, but maliciously attack the characters of the former.</p>
              <p>Simply put, the Troll has lost all credibility. That is, assuming it had any in the 1st place. Its opinions are not worth consideration, except *maybe the consideration that one gives to a fly being swatted.</p>
              <p>That's the wonderful thing about these forums. I realised i don't need an M16 or bayonet to make my point clear. Just let the moron make a fool of itself for everyone to see.</p>
              <p>How delightfully simple.</p>
