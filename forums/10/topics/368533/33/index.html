              <p>As I mentioned before, NSmen are human, some has BO, some dont.</p>
              <p><br><em>I am sure that I am definitely not smelly when I left Tekong. Because I went Jack's Place, then Suntech then Orchard before I hit home.</em></p>

              <p><br><strong>Anyway it is officer's job to ensure that the NSmen are presentable to the public. So the BMTC CO/OC now, better do some work. [Taiji]</strong></p>

              <p><br>1. From the next working year, all recruits are to book out in civilian. [It does not make sense, that private can book out in civilian, recruit can’t].</p>
              <p><br>2. Perfume/deodorant/powder is to be included in the emart item and the field pack item. [Actually SAF powder is already an useful emart item, maybe not scented. That's why]</p>
              <p><br>3. Sgt/Trainers are not allowed to issue corporal punishment before book out.<br> <br><strong>Officers’ reply as expected would be: [Taiji back]</strong></p>
              <p>TS has post a good suggestion. Perhaps, it is really time to look into the BMTC policy.</p>
              <p>So at the end. I get it, it is the "high rank" guy's fault. OK better do your job properly, if not get condemned.</p>

              <p>huhhh.... <strong> it is officer's job to ensure that the NSmen are presentable to the public. </strong>?</p>
              <p>The NS men go meet their girlfriend, if they stink their girlfriends dump them, officer's fault?</p>
              <p><strong>all recruits are to book out in civilian.</strong>  last time I washed my cloth in camp so when I book out I din't have to bring a big bag full of clothing for my mother to wash. I changed in the toilet of white sand....then I was heading Suntec in the next train. This also must teach, need to send back to their mothers.</p>
              <p><strong>[It does not make sense, that private can book out in civilian, recruit can’t].</strong> Private passed out, recruit not yet. does it make sense that officers are saluted but private need to salute. You pass out already or not?</p>
              <p><strong>Perfume/deodorant/powder is to be included in the emart item and the field pack item. </strong>lipstick, eyeliners, mascaras,  ....all included, that will really make our soldier boy presentable.</p>
              <p><strong>Sgt/Trainers are not allowed to issue corporal punishment before book out </strong>what you really need is aircon bus to take them to the jetty, and then aircon bus pick them up at the jetty. why you always kena punishment?</p>
              <p><strong>it is really time to look into the BMTC policy</strong>.The best BMTC policy is to let the parents put on the cap for their sons, on their passing out day, after they have completed their 40km road march, .... I never hear any civilian complain about smelly, stinky, .....</p>

              <p>huhhh....  <strong>it is officer's job to ensure that the NSmen are presentable to the public.</strong> ?</p>
              <p>The NS men go meet their girlfriend, if they stink their girlfriends dump them, officer's fault?</p>
              <p><strong>all recruits are to book out in civilian.</strong>  last time I washed my cloth in camp so when I book out I din't have to bring a big bag full of clothing for my mother to wash. I changed in the toilet of white sand....then I was heading Suntec in the next train. This also must teach, need to send back to their mothers.</p>
              <p><strong>[It does not make sense, that private can book out in civilian, recruit can’t].</strong> Private passed out, recruit not yet. does it make sense that officers are saluted but private need to salute. You pass out already or not?</p>
              <p><strong>Perfume/deodorant/powder is to be included in the emart item and the field pack item.</strong> lipstick, eyeliners, mascaras,  ....all included, that will really make our soldier boy presentable.</p>
              <p><strong>Sgt/Trainers are not allowed to issue corporal punishment before book out</strong> what you really need is aircon bus to take them to the jetty, and then aircon bus pick them up at the jetty. why you always kena punishment?</p>
              <p><strong>it is really time to look into the BMTC policy</strong>.The best BMTC policy is to let the parents put on the cap for their sons, on their passing out day, after they have completed their 40km road march, .... I never hear any civilian complain about smelly, stinky, .....</p>
