              <p>I think Parn just departed reality...</p>
              <p>Hello earth to Parn? Earth to Parn?</p>
              <p>This thread was started by a well noted online troll whose main objective is to start flamewars by posting flamebait. Just look at his/her previous posts in other threads.</p>
              <p>The truth is, is there really a social issue about "stinky NS boys" in Singapore? I'll hazard a guess I think the answer is generally. No. Being in the armed forces before it's certianly not S.O.P to send your recruits out of camp right after 10 days in the field. They have this technology we use that is called a "shower".</p>
              <p>In fact if anything there is quite a penalty for going out in public with anything less then proper bearings. I don't recall moving away from anybody I see in uniform while in public transport, so if anything, the "stinky NS boys" occurs as as isloated case.</p>
              <p>I don't think the TS actually encountered what she/he said she/he did in the thread, this was simply an attempt to cook up another post to get some attention. The sad fact that Parn can pick up on that cause shows that if anything, there is a general lack of decernment... and of course, the smearing of the tradition and experiences of an entire generation of people who did their duty without question as a largely irrelevant experience of incompetent people.</p>
              <p>I think feminism and all that junk aside there's one thing very important to know about guys. If a culture sets itself up to constantly deride it's protectors, then those who deride and show contempt for their protectors should not expect the protection they are supposed to provide.</p>
              <p>Basically this, I've met girls who keep complaining about how their guys are useless or cannot protect them... but it makes me wonder what makes these girls worth protecting in the first place if they have nothing but contempt for their guy?</p>

              <p><br>A few valid and sensible questions for you since you are quite keen to defend your fellowmen.</p>
              <p>1) Do you admit that army boys stink and spread their BO on public transport without any form of consideration for public opinions?</p>
              <p>2) Do you agree that this problem can be avoided or resolved easily if the army boys regards public opinions considerably to contain and reduce their stink and BO before they hop onto public transport?</p>
              <p>3) Do you agree that army boys wearing their uniform should do their best to uphold their image as protector of this country and take considerate amount of personal responsibility to ensure they present/project only their best appearance/odour to the public and especially when they are in the public?</p>
              <p>4) Do you agree that Singapore army boys has much to learn from overseas army boys in other non-third world countries regarding public behaviour and image?</p>
              <p>5) Do you agree that it is also unacceptable for Singaporean guys who has been in the army or currently in the army, to discuss about personal/group slayings using army equipments to threaten and terrorise anonymous forumers in an online forum?</p>

              <p>I really felt insulted. TS really has no idea how much a male Singaporean sacrifice when they do their duty for their country, and here she goes, insulting people. I was a product of Tekong and I know that for a start, hygiene is very important in the camps. You try marching to the ferry terminal and not sweat!!!</p>
              <p>I think TS's view are not shared by most Singaporeans here. Singaporeans know how much sacrifice NSmen put in. They sacrifice their time, careers, studies, families, friends, girlfriends, wives, and kid, sometimes even their life. Does she realise some NSF have kids, are taking care of their family, risking their life?! PEOPLE REALLY DIE IN NS LIAO!!!! And what for? So she can send her girls to school safely. At least we deserve is a little bit of respect. You think we want to be smelly?! Sometimes, Singaporeans are complacent that the peace and prosperity cannot be taken away.</p>
              <p>I leaving for Brunei next month for a YEAR as a perm staff there, and I also NSF liao. So you can realise how horrible it was for me to see people like TS disrespect our contributions. But probably she doesn't realise that. What to do..... suck thumb liao.....</p>

              <p>First and foremost, I believe each and every single individual is entitled to their own opinions, regardless whether they are reasonable or not.</p>
              <p>I think there has been a lot of generalizing and stereotyping in this thread. Then again, stereotypical behavior has always been prevailent in our society today. It is really quite narrow-minded and it puts forward alot of negativity.</p>
              <p>Undoubtedly, there are a fraction of army chaps who, no doubt eager to book out, rush home on public transports without considering whether their sweat and stink will affect the general public. However, there are also army boys who take a shower and put on a clean st of uniform before booking out. Have we overlooked these bunch of people?</p>
              <p>I don't know about you people, but I sweat a lot myself. Singapore has a very humid climate and people are bound to sweat when standing under the sun or sometimes just by walking around. Moreever, these army boys are wearing their No. 4, which is not the most comfortable or thinnest piece of clothing. I personally did not have the chance to wear the new pixellated uniform as I was not issued but the old one is thick and hot as heck! Add on a field pack filled with stuff collected over the week and you get 1 miserable suffering army boy who is just eager to go home, take a nice shower, and ejoy his weekend.</p>
              <p>Of course I do agree that ALL soldiers have the responsibility to uphold their image as defenders of this country, whether they like it or not. It tells a alot about their discipline and responsibility, which I strongly believe should be instilled in them.</p>
              <p>With regards to the post by 'Parn', I feel that it is unfair to compare. I cite a few examples: The United States Army is arguably the most elite amongst the world's military. Yet, there is much to be said about their professionalism and conduct. I'm sure you would have heard of the rape case in Japan, where the accused is a US soldier stationed there. I'm sure you would have heard of the Guantanamo Bay tortures carried out by United States soldiers. All these examples are very well-publicised and with a few simple clicks over the internet, you will surely find more examples of unprofessional conduct of first-world soldiers.</p>
              <p>Yet, the most infamous and publicised public misconduct of a SAF soldier is none other than CPL Dave Teo.</p>
              <p>Does BO and stink really affects the SAF's image as DEFENDERS of our country? Do we really want each and every one of our soldiers to book out in long-sleeved shirts, pants, and ties? The SAF has 1 motto and 1 motto only - and that is to DETER. The SAF is not in the business of training men to be prim and proper. The SAF is not in the business of teaching men how not to sweat when dressed in their No. 4 and carrying their fieldpacks. </p>
              <p>Perhaps we all need to sit back and reflect. What is truly the intent of serving national service? Do the general public understand and acknowledge the intent of the government drafting young men to serve national service? Have you ever stepped into the shoes of these young men and try to understand what they're going through?</p>
              <p>I understand that the bros here that have or are doing their national service will get defensive when issues like these appear. It is not something we like, nor is it something that we can control at times. If the weather is hot, we are bound to sweat. Our uniforms are not Nike or Adidas sports tees with Dri-Fit technology or whatsoever. Our uniforms are designed primarily to save our own asses in times of war. Our uniforms are designed to enable us to hide from enemy's eyes so that we can execute our tasks without having to dodge enemy fire. Our uniform is what that is stopped us from getting an early ticket to the grave.</p>
              <p>It is always easier to complain about this and that and those. It is always easier to view things from our own perspective instead of others. I would be irritated as hell as I were to squeeze in a MRT cabin with a bunch of stinky, sweaty recruits who have just booked out after a 6 days field camp from Tekong. I would be irritated as hell if I were to sit beside a commando who has just completed his 72km route march.

              <p>Undoubtedly, there are a fraction of army chaps who, no doubt eager to book out, rush home on public transports without considering whether their sweat and stink will affect the general public.

              <p>I don't know about you people, but I sweat a lot myself. Singapore has a very humid climate and people are bound to sweat when standing under the sun or sometimes just by walking around. Moreever, these army boys are wearing their No. 4, which is not the most comfortable or thinnest piece of clothing. I personally did not have the chance to wear the new pixellated uniform as I was not issued but the old one is thick and hot as heck! Add on a field pack filled with stuff collected over the week and you get 1 miserable suffering army boy who is just eager to go home, take a nice shower, and ejoy his weekend.</p>
              <p>Of course I do agree that ALL soldiers have the responsibility to uphold their image as defenders of this country, whether they like it or not. It tells a alot about their discipline and responsibility, which I strongly believe should be instilled in them.</p>
              <p>With regards to the post by 'Parn', I feel that it is unfair to compare. I cite a few examples: The United States Army is arguably the most elite amongst the world's military. Yet, there is much to be said about their professionalism and conduct. I'm sure you would have heard of the rape case in Japan, where the accused is a US soldier stationed there. I'm sure you would have heard of the Guantanamo Bay tortures carried out by United States soldiers. All these examples are very well-publicised and with a few simple clicks over the internet, you will surely find more examples of unprofessional conduct of first-world soldiers.</p>
              <p>Yet, the most infamous and publicised public misconduct of a SAF soldier is none other than CPL Dave Teo.</p>
              <p>Does BO and stink really affects the SAF's image as DEFENDERS of our country? Do we really want each and every one of our soldiers to book out in long-sleeved shirts, pants, and ties? The SAF has 1 motto and 1 motto only - and that is to DETER. The SAF is not in the business of training men to be prim and proper. The SAF is not in the business of teaching men how not to sweat when dressed in their No. 4 and carrying their fieldpacks. </p>
              <p>Perhaps we all need to sit back and reflect. What is truly the intent of serving national service? Do the general public understand and acknowledge the intent of the government drafting young men to serve national service? Have you ever stepped into the shoes of these young men and try to understand what they're going through?</p>
              <p>I understand that the bros here that have or are doing their national service will get defensive when issues like these appear. It is not something we like, nor is it something that we can control at times. If the weather is hot, we are bound to sweat. Our uniforms are not Nike or Adidas sports tees with Dri-Fit technology or whatsoever. Our uniforms are designed primarily to save our own asses in times of war. Our uniforms are designed to enable us to hide from enemy's eyes so that we can execute our tasks without having to dodge enemy fire. Our uniform is what that is stopped us from getting an early ticket to the grave.</p>
              <p>It is always easier to complain about this and that and those. It is always easier to view things from our own perspective instead of others. I would be irritated as hell as I were to squeeze in a MRT cabin with a bunch of stinky, sweaty recruits who have just booked out after a 6 days field camp from Tekong. I would be irritated as hell if I were to sit beside a commando who has just completed his 72km route march.

              <p>Parn just stubbornly refuse to acknowledge that some NSF simply dont have a choice to stay "sweet" smelling after a long march and waiting time for ferry/buses under the sun. worse if there would be additional "punishments" from superiors like push ups before booking out.

              <p>if wearing civilian attire (for those who are given the option to) is not regarded as being considerate what else you expect? limousine services for dropping NSF right to their doorstep?</p>

              <p>   I still stand by my fellow NSman. They have a right to be livid by TS.</p>

              <p>this thread has nothing to do with females siding with TS/parn &amp; males siding with army guys...</p>
              <p>its just that no matter how many guys tell about the facts &amp; individual responsibilities taken for personal grooming..</p>
              <p>Parn just stubbornly refuse to acknowledge that some NSF simply dont have a choice to stay "sweet" smelling after a long march and waiting time for ferry/buses under the sun. worse if there would be additional "punishments" from superiors like push ups before booking out. (dont tell me you dont perspire from exercises..)</p>
              <p>if wearing civilian attire (for those who are given the option to) is not regarded as being considerate what else you expect? limousine services for dropping NSF right to their doorstep?</p>
              <p>instead those constructive feedbacks by some guys here are deemed as EXCUSES by PARN... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>

              <p><br>Really? I don't see many are willing to admit and reply my questions here.</p>
              <p>Would you like to try?</p>
              <p>1) Do you admit that army boys stink and spread their BO on public transport without any form of consideration for public opinions?</p>
              <p>2) Do you agree that this problem can be avoided or resolved easily if the army boys regards public opinions considerably to contain and reduce their stink and BO before they hop onto public transport?</p>
              <p>3) Do you agree that army boys wearing their uniform should do their best to uphold their image as protector of this country and take considerate amount of personal responsibility to ensure they present/project only their best appearance/odour to the public and especially when they are in the public?</p>
              <p>4) Do you agree that Singapore army boys has much to learn from overseas army boys in other non-third world countries regarding public behaviour and image?</p>
              <p>5) Do you agree that it is also unacceptable for Singaporean guys who has been in the army or currently in the army, to discuss about personal/group slayings using army equipments to threaten and terrorise anonymous forumers in an online forum?</p>
              <p>You can always run away and avoid them like a coward if you are unable to reply them.</p>
              <p>I understand that even despite national service, not many Singaporean males are brave enough to stand up for themselves but are always willing to gather together for gender bashings and bullying.</p>
              <p>It's in their blood to run away when they are losing and I will not be surprise.</p>
              <p>Just needed to expose this serious flaw in our present society.</p>
