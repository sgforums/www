              <p>If you have the means to get M16, I am sure many guys including those in NS will support you.</p>
              <p>WEll, TS is really uncalled for.     She has to face consequences of her spoken words, simple!   </p>
              <p>Nobody likes to smell unpleasant, that is where tolerance comes into the picture.     She is simply not tolerant, gracious and understanding towards the NS guys.     When I come across NS guys who just book out, i just tolerate the smell.  Anyway, it is only for a while and not 24hrs that we have to be in the same place, same public transport as them.   </p>

              <p>Hi TS, the way u comment on NSFs make me sick, I myself is an NSman, and your comments make me sick. We all sweat and bleed is for who ?? Is because when war comes and Shiat hits the fan,we are to protect our country and its people, i'm going to make sure that if war really comes and we are to defend the country,i'm sorry,you are not on my list,neither are both of your so-called precious daughters. :)</p>
              <p>If you are so rich,please,go and help the economy by purchasing a car and contribute to the govt by ERP :)</p>
              <p>The govt will thank you for it :)</p>
              <p>SAF will also thank you for it cuz finally they can pay our boys better salary :)</p>

              <p><br> I see, so national service is important for you guys to serve but

              <p>If not, why is such service not implemented by the army
              then? I think it is because NONE of you guys bothered to tell
              anyone about it. I don't think there's anything wrong with sharing
              a few good suggestions among yourselves to make your national
              service experience better than your worst nightmares. Just take a
              look at how many Singaporean guys wimping out at the thought of
              going to national service is already a good reason for them to be
              looked down upon by people who don't have to go national service.
              Such wussies!!!</p>
              <p>If it is possible when you all were in primary school, I don't
              see why it is NOT POSSIBLE when you all are grown up.</p>
              <p>Do you really know which portion of your taxable income goes to
              benefit which sector/department? If you don't, then I don't see why
              you are acting like Mr. Merlin-know-it-all and advise us about your
              concerns regarding our tax monies.</p>
              <p>Feel free to ignore those irrelevant portions of my post, I only
              ignore those irrelevant people who tried desperately to reply my
              post. Especially insensible people like Gedanken and EtherealLife,

              <p>Think of it this way, if those army boys do not exist to sweat or stink up the your precious bus, which is public and for all to use, you would have no security against external forces who would invade this country. True enough, you may say soldiers these days are like boy scouts, but I do not dare to doubt these "boy scouts" ability to handle a weapon or tank in overcoming the enemy should there be a game of survival played between 2 armies. Given the blood, sweat and tears we sacrifice for this nation, and I'm not spreading propoganda here, I believe every soldier wants to be treated like a citizen of Singapore and of course enjoy the simple right to travel on public transport, instead of being forced to travel separately due to some hyperchondriac's dissatisfaction with their smell. Your having posted here reveals how ill-informed you are about NSFs coming from Pulau Tekong. One day, eventually, your daughters are going to have to go through that phase in life when they have friends/boyfriends in the army. I think they would not be making sick faces upon seeing them book out in their greens, however smelly or dirty those NS boys will be. Till then, I hope you would get out of your ivory tower in supposing that public transport is only for the clean and the pleasant-smelling folks like yourself. Do try to spare some thought for the cab drivers too. I doubt they'd like smelly dirty army boys stinking up and dirtying their taxis anymore than you being so intolerant of said behaviour.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and if you really still want to argue your point, remember that, every drop of sweat is shed because a soldier has toiled to contribute to your defence and safety. Every sickness they carry is evidence of the sacrifice the soldier goes through to train to defend you. Any unpleasant smell you detect off these individuals is evidence that soldiers are really toiling long and hard so that your country remains safe. I hope you would be a little bit more tolerant of such "disgusting" bits</p>

              <p>Parn, it is no use supporting the TS any longer. It is perfectly ok to voice out her concerns, petty or otherwise, just as everyone has the freedom of speech.</p>
              <p>But what she had done is to go over board with her civil behaviour  and treated our boys with utter contempt. Who doesnt have BO? I am sure you do too, to a certain degree and depending on which part that is hot,covered and perspiring when under our hot humid climate.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When she disgustingly takes out a tissue paper to wipe the seat offered by our gallant boy, who had been marching to the jetty in tekong, standing and waiting for hours for the ferry, then standing on the ferry and then marching to the bus stop, finally getting a seat after hours of standing, not to mention a week of strenous activity, TS is acting beyond reason and beyond all civil rights we cherished.</p>
              <p>Think of how the poor boy feel if you were in his shoes - others on the bus would probably be laffing at his stupidity, but if i was there, I would have been proud of him, BO or no, not to mention TS foistering of irrational fears of germs, viruses, bacteria or Aids on the valiant man.</p>
              <p>So stuff your accusations of suffering                                                                  Respiratory Ailing Penetration Encumberment from our boys. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>A</strong></span>cute <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>S</strong></span>ensitivity <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>S</strong></span>yndrome is prevalent amongst selfish self centred bimbos.</p>
              <p>Human beings all have noses and would be able to have the sense of smell. The only difference lies in its acuty. TS seems to have a super sensitive<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong> A.S.S.</strong></span> <span style="color: #000000;">or simply put, is an</span> <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>A.S.S.</strong></span></p>

              <p><br>It depends on how much sweat and how wet and disgusting is the condition of the seat after the army boy sat up from it.</p>
              <p>What if you were that little boy? And your Mum reacted like what TS did, took out a tissue to clean the seat for you so that you will be PROTECTED from whatever is invisible and maybe not deadly enough bacteria?</p>
              <p>Would you blame and flame your Mum in the same manner?</p>
              <p>Taking out an tissue and wiping it may seems to be terribly offensive for outsiders like yourself and to the army boy, but that action is absolutely justifiable for all Mothers out there who loves and want to protect their child.</p>
              <p>Do you think the Mother reacted in that manner should not have done it? Do you really think YOU and all YOUR OPINIONS are more important than her maternal instincts towards her own child?</p>
              <p>You speak easily of <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">A</span></strong>cute <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>S</strong></span>ensitivity <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>S</strong></span>yndrome, but take a look at yourself and tell me who is the person who is really affected by a simple gesture generated from a Mother's maternal instinct to provide the best possible protection for her child. It's YOU, and YOU ARE REALLY THE PERSON WITH <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">A</span></strong>cute <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>S</strong></span>ensitivity <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>S</strong></span>yndrome!</p>
              <p>Your failure to comprehend and assess the entire situation correctly is due to your bias-ness and your own self-generated 'righteous' ego. You should look and assess both situation with neutrally before you go jump on people like me.</p>
              <p>I seriously doubt you will even be capable enough to admit your own error and swallow a slice of your own humble <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">A</span></strong>cute <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>S</strong></span>ensitivity <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>S</strong></span>yndrome pie.</p>
