              <p>I can see what you're getting at, but your argument is flawed.</p>
              <p>Your argument presents a false dichotomy. You make it appear that there are only 2 choices, when there are more. You evidently say:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>EITHER</p>
              <p>A.) We force guys to do NS; OR<br>B.) We cannot defend ourselves if war breaks out, which will be more likely if we don't do (A).</p>
              <p>However, those are not the only choices. There is also</p>
              <p>C.) We maintain a viable regular military, preferably one capable of defeating attackers larger than itself.</p>
              <p><br>We could go into a massive debate over the merits/demerits of regular militaries. However, that's not my point. My point is that your argument fails to account for all feasible courses of action.</p>
              <p>People often justify the need for a credible military. But they do not provide enough justification for *conscription. More importantly, they don't show us just why professional militaries are doomed to fail in Sg's context. We cannot conflate the two issues.</p>

              <p>go to Military Nuts if you want to discuss about conscription army or regular army. there will be other considerations involved, such as the likely war scenario, the possible enemy.... </p>
              <p>My point is if you have to spend 2 years in NS, you make the best out of it, this is part of your life.</p>
              <p>you will be really dellusioned if you think you are doing a job that some regulars should do. the MOD and government can debate all they can, but when your order comes, you have only two choice, report or migrate!</p>

              <p>On this, we agree, actually. I don't have to like prison to sign up for courses to improve myself and make my life in there as bearable as possible. I don't have to like prison, or any other unlikeable situation, to make the most of it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>"you will be really dellusioned if you think you are doing a job that some regulars should do."</em></p>
              <p>I entertain no such illusions. Did i indicate anywhere that i did? In fact, pls ref to my statement that we can't expect conscripts to be as competent as regulars.</p>
              <p>In fact, this actually adds fuel to my argument that professional armies are the better choice.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>"the MOD and government can debate all they can, but when your order comes, you have only two choice, report or migrate!""</em></p>
              <p>I reported. I did my job, even if i didn't like it. Your point is...?</p>
              <p>Just because we have no choice doesn't mean we can't talk about it. Last i checked, citizens in democratic countries actually bother to talk about things that affect their country. They don't shut up just because some ppl are uncomfortable with what they say.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As it is, i see that feelings on this subject are far too entrenched. Neither is this the forum for such a debate.</p>
              <p>But the least i ask of you is, pls don't make it seem as if NSmen are either 1.) diehard gungho GIs; or 2.) chao keng kia. You should know as well as i do that we are not such a simple lot.</p>

              <p>nah...if there is passion, the guy would sign on. it is a commitment so guys would not go awol whenever he can, it is a commitment so you complete the task so that your whole platoon can go home week end. It is positive personal attitude that makes you do the best you can during the two years.</p>
              <p>We know that if we don't give that commitment, there is more likelihood that we might have to defend ourselves, and not many of us can run when there is a need to fight...., We all wish never have to use what we learn in NS, that is what sensible folk would say.</p>
              <p>guy who just pass or count the days wasting taxpayers money will also pass on or count their days when they don't like their job but cannot find better ones, it is their own time and life they are wasting.</p>

              <p><br>It is of critical value and foremost important that in Army, a guy must put himself above all to defend his country, home, childrens, womenfolks, old peoples etc etc...(dunno wan to include FT or not?)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A soldier must knows his objectives well and towards those objectives, be it disciplines or skills, he needs to be motivated to do it. Otherwise, it will be totally fruitless and wasting of time and resource on both the guy and the nation resulting in the day after he walked out of his camp, he forget totally on how to fire a rifle.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Therefore i believe it is critical for govt or the public by and large to move toward patriotism and the willingness to serve. But contrary to all these, guys gathering with us tends to feel dissatisfaction about wasting their time in NS and more importantly, why young foreign talent guys who become citizenship of Singapore dun have to serve NS?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In the end, how on earth are we going to trust a group of guys defending us with no morale and happiness. Are they trained for 2 years++ or acted as an actor for 2 years++?</p>

              <p>On this, we agree, actually. I don't have to like prison to sign up for courses to improve myself and make my life in there as bearable as possible. I don't have to like prison, or any other unlikeable situation, to make the most of it.</p>

              <p>I entertain no such illusions. Did i indicate anywhere that i did? In fact, pls ref to my statement that we can't expect conscripts to be as competent as regulars.</p>
              <p>In fact, this actually adds fuel to my argument that professional armies are the better choice.</p>

              <p>I reported. I did my job, even if i didn't like it. Your point is...?</p>
              <p>Just because we have no choice doesn't mean we can't talk about it. Last i checked, citizens in democratic countries actually bother to talk about things that affect their country. They don't shut up just because some ppl are uncomfortable with what they say.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As it is, i see that feelings on this subject are far too entrenched. Neither is this the forum for such a debate.</p>
              <p>But the least i ask of you is, pls don't make it seem as if NSmen are either 1.) diehard gungho GIs; or 2.) chao keng kia. You should know as well as i do that we are not such a simple lot.</p>

              <p><br>Much of what you say is sensible, with one *big exception. I don't think all guys only "act" for those 2 years.</p>
              <p>Granted, unwillingness to do NS does contribute to the "chao keng" problem. Yet, even if ppl dislike the job, many will still do their best- if for no other reason than to get it over with instead of semula again and again.</p>
              <p>However, this is still beside the point. The point is that even the most "diehard" NSmen can't realistically be expected to attain the same standard as professionals. NSmen are not just soldiers, but *citizens also. That in no way detracts from their contributions. It simply means that NSmen cannot devote their lives to soldiering. As a consequence, many of them lose their skills through atrophy. Precious time is wasted maintaining a standard, or at least keeping it from all going to hell. That time could be spent on professionals and helping them advance to better standards.</p>
              <p>As sgdiehard said so appropriately: <em>"you will be really dellusioned if you think you are doing a job that some regulars should do." </em>I cannot agree more.</p>
              <p>Therefore, whether NSmen, facing low morale and unhappiness, "act" or not is not material. What matters is that we can't expect them to be as good as regulars, because we can't blame them for being citizens instead of full-time soldiers.</p>
