              <p>Singaporeans are living in a very safe environment, compared to othe countries in the world. Perhaps this is why most of us are clouded by this perception that Singapore will forever be safe, and conflicts with other countries are impossible.</p>

              <p>Haha doesn't happen for everyone.</p>
              <p>Some ppl don't want to do it, but will do it cos it's their "duty". They do not feel "keng"-ing is acceptable for them.</p>
              <p>Others are worried about being charged for lying or something. That's not cowardice, that's plain common sense. Few ppl want to get f-ed over for lying at their NS checkup.</p>

              <p>Interesting. Reminds me of this fascinating question.</p>
              <p>Say you lock X in a room. You post a guard outside to shoot him if he escapes. X stays in the room happily, regardless of how unhappy the other inmates are. Unlike inmates who test the lock or even break out, X doesn't think to do the same thing.</p>
              <p>Has X's freedom been taken away? For that matter, have the other inmates also been deprived of their freedom?</p>

              <p><br>NS is voluntary or force into by the law, in this case, many guys told me that they can volunteer to serve army but not neccessary need 2 years ++, volunteer is something of a help, it is a passion, a commitment, but by forcing it into law and requirement, it is no more a passion or commitment, rather, the guy serving there will just pass or count the days resulting in wastage of taxpayers money and defence objectives.</p>

              <p><br>Hm actually angel7030's statement does make sense. Conscription is counter-productive because it forces ppl to do what they don't want to do. Resources are wasted on forcing people to conform to moulds against their will. It'd be better to keep a regular army rather than force ppl into a conscript one. That's what many of us NSmen actually argue too.</p>
              <p>However, perhaps she shd've clarified that she wasn't belittling our work. Hating army =/= being an f---ed up soldier.</p>
              <p>*Maybe one isn't as "good" as the gung-ho regulars in professional armies. But you can't expect ppl who must still live lives other than soldiering to be as "gung-ho" as soldiers who make soldiering their *life. </p>
              <p>More importantly, our sacrifices still count for a lot- esp because they are forced from us. I know quite a lot of guys who hated NS, yet did their job as well as they could for various reasons (not letting buddies down, among other things).</p>

              <p>And yes, i agree that "commitment" is impt to getting through NS. Commitment to your friends. Commitment to getting the job done. Commitment to ensuring that we don't kena more s*** than we need to.</p>
              <p>But commitment =/= liking it. I may be committed to study for subjects that i never wanted to take in uni, but that doesn't mean i enjoy it. I was forced into trip science in sec school. I detested bio. But i studied it cos it was my duty as a student to do my best. However, that commitment didn't make bio my "passion". It didn't mean that bio was "necessary". In fact, after a time, i dropped it and found that i didn't even *need bio to get into the courses i wanted.</p>
              <p>So no. Committing to something does not mean it's "necessary" for the country- only that you'll do it.</p>
              <p>I may feel it's a waste of my bloody time. I may hate every second of it. I may not even feel it's even necessary.</p>
              <p>But in the end, it's my "duty". I either do it, or kena charged. More importantly, we all depend on each other to get through this s*** together. So we just do it- whether or not it's "good", or even "necessary".</p>

              <p>I can see what you're getting at, but your argument is flawed.</p>
              <p>Your argument presents a false dichotomy. You make it appear that there are only 2 choices, when there are more. You evidently say:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>EITHER</p>
              <p>A.) We force guys to do NS; OR<br>B.) We cannot defend ourselves if war breaks out, which will be more likely if we don't do (A).</p>
              <p>However, those are not the only choices. There is also</p>
              <p>C.) We maintain a viable regular military, preferably one capable of defeating attackers larger than itself.</p>
              <p><br>We could go into a massive debate over the merits/demerits of regular militaries. However, that's not my point. My point is that your argument fails to account for all feasible courses of action.</p>
              <p>People often justify the need for a credible military. But they do not provide enough justification for *conscription. More importantly, they don't show us just why professional militaries are doomed to fail in Sg's context. We cannot conflate the two issues.</p>
