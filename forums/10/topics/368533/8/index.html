              <p>Don't be unreasonable and force your own unreasonable thinking onto the public just because you guys need to serve the army for 2 years. You all can always serve the army and have a choice NOT BE STINKY in public transport right?</p>
              <p>Be considerate and fair to people in the public who do not serve in the army and get free food, money, lodging for 2 years like you guys does. Don't Singaporean guys get more starting salary than Singaporean girls when they goes out to work in the society?</p>
              <p>Grow up and don't whine like be a wussy and hide behind your national service everytime you all get criticised correctly. It's not the army's fault that you all are unable to accept the right criticism, it's your own fault.</p>

              <p>Serving army is no longer a WOW factor for Singaporean girls in Singapore, it can only be used by desperate Singaporean males to WOW all the foreign maids or brides into surrendering their virginity to those Singaporean males.</p>

              <p>There's nothing that they can do because recruits seldom get a chance to take a shower before leaving Pulau Tekong. They have to pack their bags (which have been clean as much as possible after getting subjected to mud and rain), clean up their quarters and be subject to corporal punishment...and then they have to march one kilometre or so from the bunks to the jetty in the open.</p>
              <p>Short of getting their sweat glands paralysed surgically (which would be downright dangerous), what do you expect them to do? Not everyone's family owns a car, and cab rides can be up to $30 depending on how far they live and what time they reach Pasir Ris.</p>
              <p>Since nothing else you've mentioned is relevant, this is all I'll address for now.</p>

              <p>Just because they had to serve the army for 2 years, they
              assumed they can act like  WWII Jap soldiers and
              everyone had to stand with their STINKINESS!</p>
              <p>Don't be unreasonable and force your own unreasonable thinking
              onto the public just because you guys need to serve the army for 2
              years. You all can always serve the army and have a choice NOT
              BE STINKY in public transport right?</p>
              <p>Be considerate and fair to people in the public who do not serve
              in the army and get free food, money, lodging for 2 years like you
              guys does. Don't Singaporean guys get more starting salary than
              Singaporean girls when they goes out to work in the society?</p>
              <p>Grow up and don't whine like be a wussy and hide behind
              your national service everytime you all get criticised correctly.
              It's not the army's fault that you all are unable to accept the
              right criticism, it's your own fault.</p>
              <p>Where's the national pride in serving the national service when
              Singaporean guys like you all are expecting the rest of the public
              to suck your cocks with a smile when you all are obviously stinky
              and stubbornly refused to admit that you stink?</p>
              <p>Serving army is no longer a WOW factor for Singaporean girls in
              Singapore, it can only be used by desperate Singaporean males to
              WOW all the foreign maids or brides into
              surrendering their virginity to those Singaporean males.</p>
              <p>No wonder Singaporean guys are so mad with bangalahs,
              competitors for foreign maids' virginity right?</p>

They have to pack their bags (which have been clean as much as possible after getting subjected to mud and rain), clean up their quarters and be subject to corporal punishment...and then they have to march one kilometre or so from the bunks to the jetty in the open.</p>
              <p>Short of getting their sweat glands paralysed surgically (which would be downright dangerous), what do you expect them to do? Not everyone's family owns a car, and cab rides can be up to $30 depending on how far they live and what time they reach Pasir Ris.</p>

              <p><br> You mean the army don't allow the boys to take a shower before they

              <p>Then what pride is there to serve the army when you aren't even
              allow to take a shower?</p>
              <p>Will they shoot you if you really insist on taking a shower? If
              not, could you all please use your brain and take a shower before
              you leave the army camp for goodness sake!</p>
              <p>And also please be smart enough to bring in one set of your
              non-havoc and non-offensive outside clothings when you leave
              the army camp.</p>
              <p>So having air-con buses to pick up and send army boys home is
              not relevant? You must be blind then.</p>

              <p>u are really a RETARD.. as I said they could have showered but their mean superiors would have subject them to more physical activities like what Kuali said..</p>
              <p>this is army you think anyone has FREEDOM like you out here who can criticise / give opinions all you want without being subjected to regimentation? you think they can shower or change to civilian clothes as and when they like?</p>
              <p>find out the FACTS before you flame anyone. imbecile..</p>

              <p>First of all, there's so many things I want to clear up here.</p>
              <p>1stly, i want to back up JusticeLegal (the TS) and also Parn. Both of them have very sensible arguments, esp that long post by Parn further up in this page.</p>
              <p>and in case anyone doubts my credibility in NS (hello, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>MidIllusionz, NoahNoah, amv98, Fantagf</strong></span>), Nikar here is from SAF Ammo Command during his NS days, ok?!</p>
              <p>my vocation is GE Storeman II, rank is LCP.</p>
              <p>to losers like  <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>MidIllusionz, NoahNoah, amv98,</strong></span> pls stop trolling and flaming all the time ok? i'm just airing my views and if you don't see fit, feel free to back up your claims with evidence.</p>
              <p>The thing is: nobody can deny that army guys indeed stink.</p>
              <p>one example out of the many i can give:</p>
              <p>when taking Bus 975, u will past by Tengah Airbase. those airforce guys will board the bus there, and there's not so smelly cos' they all No. 3 no slogging.</p>
              <p>however, when the bus goes into old lim chu kang road, where Lim Chu Kang Camp I and II are, that's where the bus takes on the stench of corpses (not as bad, but smelly)</p>
              <p>if anyone, including everyone who has served NS before, can come and tell me that you've never encountered NS guys who stench the air of the bus, then really, u win.</p>
              <p><strong>that's a fact which is un-deniable. No way to change that.</strong></p>
              <p>Whether or not NS guys are noble and serve the country / protect SGreans is <strong>ANOTHER DIFFERENT SEPARATE </strong>issue. NSFs can kill Osama but the fact still lies that they're sweaty and smelly and they stink. Two different issues.</p>
              <p>TS's proposal of asking NSFs to take taxis is a bit too far, because only those paper generals and armchair kings have that kinda money to take taxi everyday.</p>
              <p>besides, if smelly NSFs take taxis, the taxi uncle will suffer and i pity him.</p>
              <p>what MINDEF should do.......is to supply all NSFs with deodorant.</p>
              <p>come on, that isn't hard to do. To be fair, we have to consider others' welfare onboard buses as well.</p>
              <p>even i myself, as an NSF during my NS days who takes multi-baths per day and check myself before i go home each day, find that the stench from some NS guys (not all) are very gross indeed.</p>
              <p>NSFs already have a lower-than-life reputation in SG. let's all be more zhen-qi and have more pride in ourselves. Wearing that No. 4 uniform is not a thing to be proud of and being known that you're an NSF makes you drop your head in shame.</p>
              <p>and to hear of that 3G hype "<em><strong>with 3G, each SAF soldier has the entire power of the SAF in his arsenal</strong></em>" makes me want to dig a hole to hide my face when foreigners read that.</p>
              <p>the least we can do is to minimize the stench and sweat when we book out into civilian enviroments.</p>
