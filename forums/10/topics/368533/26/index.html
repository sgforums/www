              <p><em>"No offence to any guys here, but wont you feel embarrassed if your smelly? I rather take my bicycle and cycle than to take a bus if im smelly, unless my home is far from where i am then bo bian la, quickly go home change and tahan those comments thrown at you. TS is rude and immatured to paste such comments about NS boys, but its honestly more embarrassing if you board the bus and everyone around you shun you and pinch their nose. Trust me, the feeling isnt nice.</em></p>
              <p><br><em>Maybe those NS guys home is far from tekong departure, thats why take bus. Take taxi will cost $20 (if lets say from tampines to bukit panjang), wallet may not have so much cash when book out. It isnt fair to say they smelly and dont take bus, they got their rights also. Im sure they feel embarrassed about their smell, just that they bo bian need to take bus."</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It *is commendable that you cycle rather than take the bus. In doing so, you are:</p>
              <p>1.) Putting extra strain on yourself (cycling takes more effort than taking public transport); and</p>
              <p>2.) Being extra considerate (not wanting to board the bus for fear of putting off passengers *is commendable)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>HOWEVER:</p>
              <p>That does not mean we should compel NSmen to stay off public transport. I know that is probably not your point, but i do want to emphasise this.</p>
              <p>Just because one person goes the extra mile to be "good" doesn't mean we should compel everyone else to follow his example. We do not expect every soldier to act like John Rambo just because Audie Murphy was extra brave and won the Medal of Honour. We do not expect every student to give his/her teacher an apple just because one was extra thoughtful and gave him/her a Gala.</p>
              <p>Likewise, we do not force NSman off public buses just because you are "nicer". You have exceeded expectations by staying off public transport. However, that is no reason to expect, much less compel every other NSman to behave similarly.</p>
              <p>Again, i say that your actions are commendable. However, i don't want the troll to think that they justify its unreasonable demands.</p>

              <p><em>"Like every1 else, some people have BO so dont. What is so strange about this?</em></p>
              <p><em>Do they bathe at all? YES. WE bathe."</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Good points, all. Still, there's more to it.</p>
              <p>The point isn't simply whether we can bathe or not. In general,</p>
              <p>1.) Before bookout, NSmen do try to smell good *if it's feasible*. They may bathe, apply deodorant/powder, wear new uniform, wear civies etc.</p>
              <p>We *do make the effort wherever we *can.</p>
              <p>2.) However, sprucing up isn't always possible. Sometimes you don't want to shower because you don't want to sabo your mates during area cleaning (by not being available to clean and by leaving soap suds etc). Sometimes there are simply too few cubicles for too many people. Sometimes the showers are down. Etc, etc, etc.</p>
              <p>The point is, smelling nice isn't always possible in the SAF. We don't like it, but we *can't do much about it*.</p>
              <p>3.) Often, sprucing up is futile. Even after showering, you may still sweat quite a bit. Sometimes/often (more so with recruits/trainees), you'll kena corporal punishment. Often you'll have to walk a long distance to the gate, and then to the bus-stop/MRT station. If you're wearing civies, it's bad enough. Imagine how sweaty you'll be in no. 4. Often you'll book out when it's hot- it's just a question of *how hot. </p>
              <p>In any case, you'll probably pick up at least a mildly unpleasant odour.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We don't want wild applause for defending our country etc etc. But we *do hope for some modicum of empathy and respect, if not understanding. We want others to at least *try to put themselves in our shoes and see where we're coming from, not least because that's what we'd do for them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>**</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I will admit that my stated intention to hammer the troll with military equipment was inappropriate. Whether it was a *joke or not, it was unacceptable.</p>
              <p>However, my contempt still stands.</p>

I don't care that he's probably tired from all that walking in that disgustingly heavy uniform and is being nice to us, he *dirtied the seat*! WE SHOULD BAN THESE MONSTERS FROM PUBLIC BUSES."</p>
              <p>Regardless of whether it's *intended as a personal attack, in practise it comes damn close to being one. Among other bad things, it's offensive, thoughtless, downright rude, and worst still- unnecessarily so.</p>

              <p>There's a difference between setting up bombs to murder innocent civilians (terrorism), and setting up bombs to destroy enemy forces (legitimate military ops). As much as the latter isn't nice and dandy, it's definitely a world away from terrorism.</p>

It is no doubt that most people carry gems, especially after some training. It is self responsibility to at least clean yourself up before boarding the bus. I suggest you write a letter to the government instead. =)</p>

              <p>Public transport is for public; buses and MRT are for the basic for those who cannot afford taxi, let alone private cars. banning anybody from taking buses or MRT is depriving them of their basic right to move around.</p>
              <p>reasons like stinky shirt is discrimination, for there are so many female with bad bad body odour who board buses and MRT, obviously they don't have the money for deodorant so have to take bus,</p>
              <p>worse, some use cheap cheap perfume and powder giving the kind of smell that really drive people nuts. so how? need to ban them too?</p>
              <p>If children see green monsters when they see army soldiers, they are probably seeing a witch in their own home, holding vacuum cleaner instead of broom, they are living in hell already, somebody should be writing to the ghostbusters, mental hospital, not the government.</p>
              <p>if the army guys want to have fun they would go to angel's bar, what is the fun of touching just anybody in the bus. At least the army guys' hands are dirty with soil, and I know in tekong soldiers are told to wash their hands frequently, so there is no problem if there is only sweat, who don't sweat in this hot and humid weather in Singapore? but who know what these girls and their mother, especially their mother touched before they boarded the bus.  </p>

              <p>Seeing things from all perspectives does not mean accommodating the other perspective. Just to be clear, i won't say that Fryderyk HPH is doing that. But i do want to stress that reasonableness =/= blind accommodation- esp if one side is being unreasonable.</p>
              <p>To illustrate. I might understand why the Taliban chop off people's hands for stealing, or why they force women to wear burqas etc. I understand that their extreme interpretation of their otherwise benign religion makes them think that way. BUT that doesn't mean that i accommodate them by agreeing that mutilation is a good punishment for theft, or that a woman should be forcibly deprived of her freedom.</p>
              <p>Likewise, i may see why someone says that NSmen are stinky. In fact, many of us *admit that unfortunately, many NSmen *are stinky. I'm going to agree that it'd be nice to spruce up. I'd even agree that it's extra nice if some NSmen freely avoid public transport to be "nice". But i'm not going to agree with the extreme conclusion that NSmen should be forced off the bus. On the contrary, i'd say that NSmen have every right to use public transport, and should expect to be allowed on public buses without having to ask for everyone else's graciousness.</p>

              <p>it would be nice if those who can't stand army soldiers sweating can avoid taking buses, then this would avoid insulting ALL male Singaporean who have to serve NS, and avoid showing the inconsiderate social behaviour of a few females Singaporean.</p>
