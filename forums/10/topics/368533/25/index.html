              <p><br> Appreciate your feedbacks. As for your request on question 3, I
              feel it is acceptable if they are aware and do all they can to
              reduce/eliminate their BO to the best of their abilities.</p>
              <p>Nobody expect army boys to smell like flowers, but warm,
              sourish, vinegar, dead smell on a grand
              poisonous proportions are highly non-desirable (IT
              SHOULDN'T EVEN BE CLOSE TO THAT SCALE). And so is the
              couldn't-care-less attitude to public criticism.</p>

              <p>Trust me we are lucky to be even able to talk about this issue here openly.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In Israel, Males and Females go for NS... I don't think there will be any differentiation between the gender thingy and BO issue. In both Israel and South Korea, it is, quote, "Against the Law", to express dissatisfaction with the armed forces. Public(or rather, personal) criticism wise, the issue is less rampant here then at the other two countries.</p>

              <p>Even if take taxi the driver will directly shoot at you for

              <p>I once ride my mountain bike till Tampines Mountain Bike trail
              from bukit panjang and while coming back i encountered some problem
              with my bike, end up take taxi. Halfway thru the journey the uncle
              opened the windows and say to me "sorry ah, your sweat very smelly.
              I cannot tahan" with a giggle.</p>
              <p>I didnt feel offended but embarrassed. I rather take the bus
              with my NS buddy than to take taxi and kena critised alone.</p>
              <p>But if given a choice i would take a non aircon bus. Because i
              can smell my own smell when take aircon, sometimes i cant tahan my
              own smell also.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="icon_redface.gif"><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> </p>

TS is rude and immatured to paste such comments about NS boys, but its honestly more embarrassing if you board the bus and everyone around you shun you and pinch their nose. Trust me, the feeling isnt nice.</p>
              <p><br>Maybe those NS guys home is far from tekong departure, thats why take bus. Take taxi will cost $20 (if lets say from tampines to bukit panjang), wallet may not have so much cash when book out. It isnt fair to say they smelly and dont take bus, they got their rights also. Im sure they feel embarrassed about their smell, just that they bo bian need to take bus.</p>

              <p>Five questions should produce FIVE answers.</p>
              <p>1) Do you admit that army boys stink and spread their BO on
              public transport without any form of consideration for public
              opinions?</p>
              <p>2) Do you agree that this problem can be avoided or
              resolved easily if the army boys regards public opinions
              considerably to contain and reduce their stink and BO before they
              hop onto public transport?</p>
              <p>3) Do you agree that army boys wearing their uniform
              should do their best to uphold their image as protector of this
              country and take considerate amount of personal responsibility to
              ensure they present/project only their best appearance/odour to the
              public and especially when they are in the public?</p>
              <p>4) Do you agree that Singapore army boys has much to learn from
              overseas army boys in other non-third world countries regarding
              public behaviour and image?</p>
              <p>5) Do you agree that it is also unacceptable for Singaporean
              guys who has been in the army or currently in the army, to discuss
              about personal/group slayings using army equipments to
              threaten and terrorise anonymous forumers in an online forum?</p>

              <p>First NS/Army can be considered as a job/vocation. You just take it as a group of workers just knock off from work. They are just people who work in the Army. </p>
              <p>Like every1 else, some people have BO so dont. What is so strange about this?</p>
              <p>Do they bathe at all? YES. WE bathe.</p>
              <p>Like every normal human being, we went to work and knock off. Sometime job requires OT, so there is no choice.There is hostel provided, so we stay in for convenience.</p>
              <p>Public Transport is for the public, we are cilivian once we are out of the gate. Depends on individual some people care some dont.</p>
              <p>Do not think army boys are someone very special and different. We are just low-paid civil servant. Sometime we wear the green uniform sometime we dont. Depends on mood.</p>
